    "body": "\nThe solar activity that’s been lighting up the night sky across North America this week is now causing Jeff Bezos’ space company to push back the second launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nJust hours before the scheduled launch on Wednesday, Blue Origin said it is standing down from the attempt due to the solar activity and its “potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft” — a Mars-bound science mission the company is carrying to space for NASA. A new launch date has not yet been announced.\nNew Glenn’s first launch in January was mostly a successful demonstration mission of the rocket. Blue Origin delayed the second launch multiple times, though, and the company is being cautious since this is the first time the rocket has a commercial payload onboard. \nNew Glenn nearly took off this past Sunday, but weather concerns and an errant cruise ship in the flight path, plus some issues with the launchpad equipment, caused the company to shelve the attempt.\n",

    "body": "\nIndian online brokerage platform Groww’s IPO on Wednesday proved to be the largest listing by an Indian fintech so far this year, as the company raised ₹66.3 billion (about $748 million) with its shares closing 29% higher from their issue price.\nThe company’s shares opened at ₹112, about 12% above their issue price of ₹100, and closed at ₹128.85, lending it a market cap of ₹795 billion (approximately $9 billion). \nGroww’s listing comes amid a broader pickup in Indian startup IPOs. Eyewear retailer Lenskart made its market debut earlier this week, and payments platform Pine Labs is scheduled to list on Friday (its $440 million IPO was fully subscribed as of Tuesday). Other venture-backed firms, including PhysicsWallah and Capillary Technologies, are set to go public in the coming days.\nFounded in 2016 by former Flipkart employees, Groww has benefited from India’s retail investing boom, and its investors include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Peak XV, Y Combinator, Ribbit Capital and Tiger Global. Its app targets first-time investors to the retail investing market, and competes with the likes of Zerodha and Angel One.\nGroww had more than 14 million active users as of June, and over 12.6 million active NSE clients, per its IPO offer document (PDF). While stockbroking remains its core business, the company has expanded into lending, too, launching a separate app for that business last year. The company also offers payments, asset management and insurance brokerage. However, these businesses remain modest in scale compared with its brokerage revenues.\nIn the financial year ended March 2025, the company reported revenue of ₹39 billion ($440 million) and net profit of ₹18 billion ($206 million). \nPeak XV Partners, Ribbit Capital, Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital were among investors who sold their stakes in the offering. The IPO was subscribed nearly 18 times, led by strong demand from institutional investors, and the company raised about ₹30 billion from anchor investors in a pre-IPO placement last week.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We owe so much to so many people for building this,” Groww co-founder and CEO Lalit Keshre said during the company’s listing ceremony. “When we started, we thought that in one month, if we could get 100 customers, it would be very good. But guess what? We got 600 customers,” he added, reflecting on the startup’s early days.\nVenture investors cheered Groww’s successful market debut. “Many U.S. LPs have asked me if Indian investments would ever make money,” Anu Hariharan, co-founder of Avra Capital, an early investor in Groww, wrote in a post on X. “Ecosystems take time — but here’s Groww, returning capital many times over and returning at least two U.S. funds fully and likely delivering one of the best IRRs of the decade (Launching Stocks in 2020 → IPO in 2025).”\nThe debut also marks a milestone for Y Combinator: Groww is the first Indian company backed by the accelerator to go public. The fintech is also the first Indian startup to list after relocating its corporate headquarters from Delaware, underscoring a broader shift among Indian unicorns moving their base back home.\nGroww said it plans to use the fresh capital to expand its cloud and technology infrastructure, intensify marketing efforts, and invest further in its lending and margin trading businesses. It said it has also earmarked funds for potential acquisitions.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAustralia’s intelligence head Mike Burgess has warned that China-backed hackers are “probing” the country’s critical infrastructure, and in some cases have gained access. \nBurgess, who heads the country’s main intelligence agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, said that at least two China government-backed hacking groups are pre-positioning for sabotage and espionage. \nThe comments, made during a conference speech in Melbourne on Wednesday, echo similar remarks by the U.S. government, which has warned that the ongoing hacking campaigns may pose risks of economic and societal disruption.\nAccording to Burgess, a hacker group known as Volt Typhoon is trying to break into critical infrastructure networks such as power, water, and transportation systems. Burgess warned that successful hacks could affect energy and water supplies, and cause widespread outages.\nThe U.S. has previously said that the Chinese hackers have spent years planting malware on critical infrastructure systems that are capable of causing disruptive cyberattacks when activated. U.S. officials said that Volt Typhoon’s goals are to hamper the U.S.’ response to China’s anticipated future invasion of Taiwan.\n“I do not think we — and I mean all of us — truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating, this could be,” said Burgess, speaking about the threat. He said that once the hackers have access, what happens next is a “matter of intent, not capability.” \nBurgess also warned that another China-backed hacking group dubbed Salt Typhoon, known for hacking into the networks of phone and internet companies to steal call records and other sensitive data, was also targeting the country’s telecoms infrastructure. \nSalt Typhoon has hacked more than 200 phone and internet companies, according to the FBI, including AT&T, Verizon and Lumen, along with several other cloud and data center providers. The hacks prompted the FBI to urge Americans to switch to end-to-end encrypted messaging apps to avoid having their calls and text messages accessed by the hackers.\nThe Canadian government also confirmed earlier this year that its telcos were breached as part of China-linked attacks.\nChina has long denied the hacking allegations. \n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:52 AM PST · November 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nAnthropic on Wednesday said it had signed an ambitious new data center partnership with U.K.-based neocloud provider, Fluidstack, committing $50 billion to building facilities across the U.S. to meet its growing compute needs.\nThe data centers will be located in Texas and New York, and come online throughout 2026. The company described the sites as “custom built for Anthropic with a focus on maximizing efficiency for our workloads.”\n“We’re getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren’t possible before,” Anthropic’s CEO and co-founder, Dario Amodei (pictured above), said in a statement. “Realizing that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier.”\nBecause of the intense compute demands of Anthropic’s Claude family of models, the company is already engaged in significant cloud partnerships with both Google and Amazon (which is also an investor). But this is the company’s first major effort to build custom infrastructure. The $50 billion outlay, while large, is in line with the company’s internal revenue projections, which reportedly see Anthropic reaching $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in positive cash flow by 2028.\nWhile $50 billion represents a massive commitment in both cash and compute power, it is nonetheless dwarfed by similar projects from Anthropic’s competitors. Meta has committed to building $600 billion worth of data centers over the next three years, while the Stargate partnership between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle has already planned $500 billion in infrastructure spending. The spending has fueled concerns about an AI bubble due to flagging demand or even misallocated spending.\nThe project marks a major success for Fluidstack, a relatively young neocloud company that has become a vendor of choice in the AI building boom. Founded in 2017, the company was named in February as the primary partner for a 1 gigawatt AI project backed by the French government, which represented more than $11 billion in spending. According to Forbes, the company already has partnerships in place with Meta, Black Forest Labs and France’s Mistral.\nFluidstack was also one of the first third-party vendors to receive Google’s custom-built TPUs, a major vote of confidence for the company.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nMatt Carey, the co-founder and CEO of Boston-based startup Teradar loves when people tell him: “I don’t believe you.”\nThat’s “right where we want folks,” he recently told TechCrunch. \nCarey has spent the last few years quietly building a solid-state sensor that sees the world using the terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum, which sits between microwaves and infrared. It essentially combines the best traits of radar sensors — like no moving parts and the ability to pierce rain or fog — with the higher definition afforded by laser-based lidar sensors.\nIt’s a product that’s never been done at this scale before, so people are understandably skeptical when Carey explains his work. A long-range, high-resolution sensor that’s also affordable? It just sounds too good to be true.\nIt’s usually at this point that Carey gives them a demo, like at this past year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. There was Carey, outside the Westgate hotel, aiming an early version of the Teradar sensor at crowds of people as reps from some of the biggest automakers watched it parse the scene in real time. \n“They almost didn’t believe it until they got to play with it,” he said. “I’ve never raised money without, like, spending a lot of time in a demo of people trying to break it. And that’s how it should be, right?”\nCarey’s demos — and the tech itself — helped him lock down a $150 million Series B funding round from investors like Capricorn Investment Group, Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, mobility-focused firm Ibex Investors, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTeradar claims to already be working with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe to validate the tech, and expects to win a contract to put the company’s sensors in a 2028-model vehicle — meaning it will need to be ready to go in 2027. Teradar is also working with three Tier 1 suppliers, which he said the company will lean on for manufacturing.\nThe near-term goal for Teradar is for automakers to use its sensors to power advanced driver assistance and even self-driving systems. The “modular terahertz engine,” as the sensor is officially known, can be customized to fit any of those applications, and Carey said the price will fall somewhere between a radar and a lidar. (Think a few hundred dollars, not a few thousand.)\n“How do we get the sensor on every single vehicle? I drive a Ford Focus, and there’s zero chance you’re putting a $1,000 lidar” on that, Carey said.\nCarey said he was inspired to start Teradar after a friend of his died in a car crash.\n“It was one of those weird corner cases where, between the sun, and the fog, it couldn’t have been solved by any existing sensor,” he said. In a situation like that, where there’s lots of glare, cameras typically struggle. Lidar would also be challenged because of the fog. And radar can only help so much with its typically-lower resolution.\nCarey had already been in talks to go work for an automaker, and was thinking about autonomous vehicle tech. In 2021, he started talking to his co-worker Gregory Charvat, the CTO of spatial sensor and intelligence company Humatics, about this apparent problem.\n“[Charvat] was like, ‘you know, I’ve always wanted to be able to image at terahertz,’” Carey said. Shortly after, they started Teradar, with MIT’s The Engine nonprofit incubator leading its seed round.\nThere could be other applications for Teradar’s sensor, like in the defense sector. There’s clearly interest there based on who on the company’s cap table. For now, Carey said the company is almost entirely focused on the automotive business.\nCarey admits he’s not the first to try to leverage the terahertz part of the spectrum; there’s been a litany of academic research, and some attempts to commercialize the tech before. But a lot of that has been focused around industrial or security applications.\nHe said recent advancements in the silicon industry combined with a focused team of experts — including his third co-founder Nick Saiz, who Carey boasted is “the world’s best terahertz chip designer, bar none” — has allowed them to move quickly and woo big automakers.\nThat doesn’t mean it’s been easy, though. \n“It’s very difficult to get their attention, it’s very difficult to get their dollars, and it’s very difficult to get their test track time,” he said. “The fact that they’ve unlocked all of those things for us means a big deal.” \nIn other words: now they believe him.\n",

    "body": "\nFigma is expanding its presence in India by setting up a local office and hiring Indian talent as it seeks to deepen ties with one of its largest user communities and make a broader push to better win over developers alongside the designers who already rely on the platform.\nFounded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace, Figma broke through by offering a browser-based interface at a time when most designers were still tied to desktop software. The approach was initially met with skepticism, but the platform eventually became a go-to collaboration tool for UX and product teams. Now, the company is looking to replicate that trajectory with developers — and sees India as a key market to accelerate that evolution.\nIndia has one of the world’s largest developer communities — an advantage already recognized by tech giants such as Microsoft, which counts nearly 22 million Indian developers on GitHub. As much as 33% of Figma’s users globally are developers, and the company has been rolling out features aimed at bridging design and engineering workflows. However, Figma still faces a perception challenge: many Indian developers continue to see Figma primarily as a design tool rather than a platform for end-to-end product creation.\n“India has such a large population of developers who might not currently think of Figma as their tool, and that’s the thing that we want to do,” said Abhishek Mathur, VP of Engineering at Figma, in an interview. “A lot of it is being done by the community, but we want to be part of that activity as well — and share our story of enabling developers to be more than just writing code.”\nOn Wednesday, Figma opened a new office in Bengaluru, India, as part of its continuing expansion outside the U.S. The San Francisco-headquartered company already has offices in Tokyo, Singapore, London, Paris, Berlin, Sydney, and São Paulo.\nUntil now, Figma had been supporting users in India remotely through its Singapore team. The company now recognizes the value of establishing a local presence, as its user base and community activity in the country have continued to expand.\n“India has always been a global hub of innovation, and particularly, for Figma, international markets are a big part of usage,” Mathur told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs much as 85% of Figma’s overall usage is international, and India is its second-largest user base after the U.S., Mathur noted. The company said it was serving users in 85% of India’s 28 official states as of the third quarter of 2025. As of September, more than 40% of the top 100 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange were Figma customers, it added.\nImage Credits:Figma\nFigma counts 13 million weekly active users worldwide. The company did not share specific user numbers for India, though Mathur described the country as “a very large portion” of its base. Its India community, called Friends of Figma, alone includes more than 25,000 members.\nIn May, Figma introduced a new range of AI-powered features designed to extend its software’s value beyond design teams, positioning it in competition not just with Adobe and Canva, but also with AI coding platforms such as Replit and Lovable. One of those features, Figma Make, allows users to generate working web applications from natural-language prompts and collaborate on both design and code within the same workspace.\nMathur said India has been the largest market for Figma Make, with users in the country generating over 800,000 prototypes so far.\nFigma also sees increased adoption among developers in India, particularly for its dev mode, which debuted in 2023 to help developers quickly translate designs into code.\n“The first spectrum of imagination to production is what we are seeing in terms of differences between India and the rest of the globe,” Mathur said. “The usage patterns are similar, but the scale of operations in some of the things is very challenging.”\nFigma’s Bengaluru office will initially focus on strengthening the company’s sales and marketing operations in the country. Its users in India include consumer-facing startups such as CRED, Groww, Fynd, Swiggy, and Zomato, as well as IT services giants including Infosys and TCS and consumer companies such as Airtel, CARS24, and Myntra.\nIn 2024, Figma generated about half of its revenue from markets outside the U.S., and Mathur described India as an “important market” for the company, though he did not disclose its specific contribution to global revenue.\nIndia’s user base is already influencing Figma’s product development. For instance, feedback from its community in India led the company to introduce improved code-export options that produce higher-quality code — a direct response to requests from Indian users seeking better output.\n“We want to continue to do events, understand and work with our customers — small to large — and as time progresses, we might add other possibilities as well,” Mathur said.\n",

    "body": "\nWisdomAI, the new AI data analytics startup from Rubrik co-founder Soham Mazumdar, has landed a fresh $50 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from new investor NVentures (Nvidia’s venture capital arm).  \nThis round comes roughly six months after the startup announced a seed round of $23 million led by Coatue. \nWisdomAI offers AI-driven data analytics that can answer business questions from structured, unstructured, and even “dirty” data, meaning data that hasn’t been cleaned of typos or errors. A business user simply asks questions in natural language, such as, “How many customers do I have in my pipeline and what’s preventing them from closing this quarter?”  \nBut the company is using a clever method to eliminate the LLM hallucination problem. WisdomAI is not using LLMs to write answers to questions. Instead, LLMs are only used to write the query —  the part that will go out to a data warehouse to retrieve data. So if the LLM hallucinates, it will simply write an ineffective query rather than inventing false answers.\nWisdomAI has written its own logic that it calls the “enterprise context layer,” which studies the customer data to understand it. All of the startup’s co-founders worked with Mazumdar at data security company Rubrik, giving them deep experience with enterprise storage warehouses. (Mazumdar left Rubrik in 2023.)\nSince formally launching in late 2024, WisdomAI has grown from two enterprise customers to around 40 enterprise customers, CEO Mazumdar says. WisdomAI counts such companies like Descope, ConocoPhillips, Cisco, and Patreon as customers. \nMazumdar said the young company is also growing usage within its enterprise customers. Some customers have doubled usage within two months. Another customer started with 10 seats and expanded to 450, which is almost everyone in the company, he said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the last six months, WisdomAI has also added an agentic feature that will alert users in real time to important changes in situations they are monitoring. \n“I have created an agent which is watching our product usage metrics, our ticket information,” Mazumdar says, adding that it took him about five minutes to create it. But rather than sending him a daily or, even, hourly report on usage and helpdesk tickets, it alerts him “when something interesting happens,” he describes.\n“I think that’s the magic with analytics. It’s always been a static report, but we are making it dynamic. We are making it proactive,” he said. \n",

    "body": "\nFor all their pitches promising something new, AI startups share many of the same questions as startups in years past: How do they know when they’ve achieved the holy grail of product-market fit?\nProduct-market fit has been studied extensively over the years; entire books have been written about how to master the art. But as with so many things, AI is upending established practices.\n“Honestly, it just could not be more different from all the playbooks that we’ve all been taught in tech in the past,” Ann Bordetsky, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, told a standing room-only crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco. “It’s a completely different ball game.”\nTop of the list is the pace of change in the AI world. “The technology itself isn’t static,” she said.\nEven still, there are ways that founders and operators can evaluate whether they have product-market fit.\nOne of the best things to watch, Murali Joshi, a partner at Iconiq, told the audience, is “durability of spend.” AI is still early in the adoption curve at many companies, and so much of their spend is focused on experimentation rather than integration. \n“Increasingly, we’re seeing people really shift away from just experimental AI budgets to core office of the CXO budgets,” Joshi said. “Digging into that is super critical to ensure that this is a tool, a solution, a platform that’s here to stay, versus something that they’re just testing and trying out.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nJoshi also suggested startups consider classic metrics: daily, weekly, and monthly active users. “How frequently are your customers engaging with the tool and the product that they’re paying for?”\nBordetsky agreed, adding that qualitative data can help provide nuance to some of the quantitative metrics which might suggest, but not confirm, whether customers are likely to stick with a product. \n“If you talk to customers or users, even in qualitative interviews, which we do tend to do a lot early on, that comes through very clearly,” she said.\nInterviewing people in the executive suite can be helpful, too, Joshi said. “Where does this sit in the tech stack?” he suggests asking them. He said that startups should think about how they can make themselves “more sticky as a product in terms of the core workflows.”\nLastly, it’s important for AI startups to think about product-market fit as a continuum, Bordetsky said. Product-market fit is not sort of one point in time,” she said. “It’s learning to think about how you maybe start with a little bit of product market fit in your space, but then really strengthen that over time.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAirbnb is piloting a service with Instacart that will allow guests to order groceries directly through the Airbnb app before and during their stay, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday.\n“We are regularly testing new product updates, categories and initiatives, in order to provide the best possible experience for our community,” an Airbnb spokesperson said in an email. “As part of that, following the launch of Airbnb Services earlier this year, we will pilot groceries with Instacart in select markets across the U.S. beginning in January.”\nThe new kitchen stocking service will be available to select hosts with available listings in Phoenix, Orlando and Los Angeles, according to a help page on Airbnb’s website.\nThe news was first reported by Bloomberg.\nIf hosts receive their guests’ pre-orders and put them away before they check in, they will receive $25, according to the the help page. They will also receive a $100 bonus for their first completed order. Guests will be able to place orders on Instacart from the Airbnb app up to three weeks before their stay.\n“By bringing groceries powered by Instacart directly into the Airbnb app, we’re making it easier for guests to stock their kitchens and feel at home from day one,” an Instacart spokesperson said in an email. “We’re excited to partner with Airbnb on this pilot and put our broad retailer network and leading technology to work for their guests.”\nThe new partnership with Instacart marks the latest addition to Airbnb’s “Services,” which launched in May and allow guests to book services and experiences, like getting a massage, haircut, or chef-prepared meal. While these offerings can be added to your stay, they can also be booked independently. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe launch of Services put Airbnb more directly in competition with other travel companies such as Tripadvisor, Booking.com, Viator, and GetYourGuide. \nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky has said Services will help the company add $1 billion or more in revenue a year.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPower demands of data centers have grown from tens to 200 kilowatts in just a few years, a pace that has data center developers scrambling to design future facilities that can handle the load. \n“In the next couple of years, it’s going to be 600 kilowatts, and then we’re going to a megawatt,” Tim Heidel, CEO of Veir, told TechCrunch. “We’re speaking to folks that are now trying to wrap their heads around the architecture for how you design data centers that have multi-megawatt racks.”\nAt those scales, even the low-voltage cables that bring power to the racks start to take up too much space and generate too much heat.\nTo rein that in, Veir has adapted its superconducting electrical cables to bring them inside the data center. The Microsoft-backed startup’s first product will be a cable system capable of carrying 3 megawatts of low-voltage electricity.\nTo demonstrate the technology, Veir built a simulated data center near its headquarters in Massachusetts. The cables will be piloted in data centers next year in advance of an expected 2027 commercial launch, Heidel said.\nSuperconductors are a class of materials that can conduct electricity with zero loss of energy. The only hitch is that they need to be cooled well below freezing temperatures.\nVeir had previously focused on using superconductors to improve capacity on long-distance transmission lines. But utilities are cautious and tend to be slow to adopt new technology. While there’s still a good chance utilities will eventually tap superconductors for high-demand transmission lines, that transition is a bit farther in the future.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The pace at which the data center community is moving, evolving, growing, scaling, and tackling challenges is far higher than the transmission community,” Heidel said.\nVeir has been in talks with data centers for years. Recently, the tenor of those conversations changed.\n“We were seeing a lot of folks saying, ‘Oh this grid interconnection problem is a real thing, and we got to figure out how to solve that.’ But then a handful of potential customers started turning around and saying, we actually have really hard problems to solve on our campuses and inside of our buildings,” he said.\nThe startup took the same core technology that it had developed for transmission lines and adapted it to the low-voltage needs of data centers. Veir buys the superconductors from the same suppliers, and they’re wrapped in a jacket to contain the liquid nitrogen coolant that keeps the material at –196˚ C (–321˚ F). Termination boxes sit at the end of those cables to transition from superconductors to copper cables.\n“We’re really a systems integrator that builds the cooling systems, manufacturers the cables, puts the whole system together in order to deliver an enormous amount of power in a small space,” Heidel said.\nThe result are cables that require 20 times less space than copper while carrying power five times farther, Veir said.\n“The AI and data center community is desperate to find solutions today and is desperate to stay ahead. There’s a tremendous amount of competitive pressure to stay at the forefront,” Heidel said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

Now, iOS users in the U.S. can describe their edits using voice or text to modify images, Google announced Tuesday. The company is also bringing its redesigned photo editor with easy editing options to iOS.\nThe upgrade includes a new personalized edits feature that recognizes people from Google Photos’ face groups. Users can find the “Help me edit” option and type several  instructions applicable to people within the photo. For instance, “Remove Riley’s sunglasses, open my eyes, make Engel smile, and open her eyes” to get edits related to each person, as the image below shows.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe company is adding its popular AI image model, Nano Banana, to Google Photos to let users edit their photos to recreate images in new styles like a Renaissance portrait or cartoon strip. \nGoogle is also adding AI templates to easily let users convert one photo into a specific format. With Nano Banana, formats like turning images into retro portraits or action figures became popular. The company said this feature will roll out next week on Android under the Create tab in the U.S. and India, where Nano Banana is used the most.\nImage Credits: Google\nGoogle Photos is also getting a slight design change with a new Ask button that will act as a starting point for different AI requests. Users can ask for information about the photo, discover related moments, and edit it using prompts. The company will also show some suggestion chips to indicate what users can do with this feature, which is rolling out to users in the U.S. on iOS and Android.\nImage Credits: Google\nLast year, Google introduced an AI-powered search feature for the Photos app with an initial launch in the United States. Today, the company is expanding the search to more than 100 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Africa.

    "body": "\nSixteen years ago, engineers working on the Google self-driving project conducted their first autonomous vehicle tests on the freeway that connects Silicon Valley to San Francisco. \nThe company would eventually become Waymo, autonomous vehicle testing would expand — fanning out to other cities. Eventually, the company launched commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Other cities soon followed. \nBut freeways, despite some of that early testing, would remain out of reach. Until today. \nWaymo said Wednesday it will begin offering robotaxi rides that use freeways across San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, a critical expansion for the company that it says will reduce ride times by up to 50%. That stat could help attract a whole new group of users who need to travel between the many towns and suburbs within the greater San Francisco Bay Area or quicken commutes across the sprawling Los Angeles and Phoenix metro areas. \nUsing freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in. \nThe service won’t be offered to all Waymo riders at first, the company said. Waymo riders who want to experience freeway rides can note their preference in the Waymo app. Once the rider hails a ride, they may be matched with a freeway trip, according to the company.\nThe company’s robotaxi routes will now stretch to San Jose, an expansion that will create a unified 260-mile service area across the Peninsula, according to Waymo. The company said it will also begin curbside drop off and pick up service at the San Jose Mineta International Airport. It already offers curbside service to the Sky Harbor Phoenix International Airport.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n“Freeway driving is one of those things that’s very easy to learn, but very hard to master when we’re talking about full autonomy without a human driver as a backup, and at scale,” Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov said in a media briefing with reporters. “It took time to do it properly, with a strong focus on system safety and reliability.”\nWaymo robotaxis have been spotted on freeways for months. TechCrunch took a test ride last year in the Phoenix area that included freeways. The company has provided trips to employees for more than a year. It also expanded testing to include closed course and simulation\nWhile many assume freeway driving is easier, it comes with its own set of challenges, principal software engineer Pierre Kreitman said in a recent briefing. He noted that critical events happen less often on freeways, which means there are fewer opportunities to expose Waymo’s self-driving system to rare scenarios and prove how the system performs when it really matters. The company chose to augment its public road driving with a combination of closed course and simulation testing.\nThis expanded testing and validation of the software was done to ensure the vehicles transition smoothly and safely between freeways and surface streets, and recognize and adapt to the unique context of the road around them, Kreitman said. \nWaymo has also expanded its operational protocols, including how it coordinates with safety officials like California Highway Patrol, now that its robotaxis are on freeways. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nThe U.S. is far ahead of Europe in the race for large AI models — but the picture is different for the application layer, with emerging category leaders such as Lovable, the vibe-coding startup, and Synthesia, which makes AI-generated video for the enterprise. \nThat’s the conclusion made by global VC firm Accel in its 2025 Globalscape report, which focuses on the AI and cloud market. Worth noting: Accel is an investor in both Lovable and Synthesia.\nAccording to Accel, European and Israeli cloud and AI applications have raised 66 cents for every dollar raised by their American counterparts in 2025 so far. “When we started this report 10 years ago, Europe was one tenth of the U.S.,” Accel partner Philippe Botteri told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Courtesy of Accel\nBotteri says the ratio has increased because the region has developed an ecosystem of founders and investors “who really understand how to build great software companies, and that flywheel has been running for 10 years.”\nIt’s also a reminder that Europeans and Israelis can do more than just staff Big Tech AI labs — an observation also shared by Jonathan Userovici, a Paris-based general partner at Headline. “Across every vertical, from legal and healthcare to manufacturing and marketing, we’re seeing founders who combine world-class technical talent with deep market expertise,” Userovici told TechCrunch.\nThis aligns with the findings of the AI Europe 100 report published by Headline earlier this year, which curated AI-native application startups around Europe that the firm sees as having “the potential to become tomorrow’s winners in Europe” thanks to a combination of growth velocity, team, and tech advancement.\nThat growth velocity is one of the key differences that Accel sees between this AI wave and previous ones. A new breed of AI-native applications has reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue in a matter of years, a feat that used to take decades.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“They’re growing faster than anything we’ve seen in the past, and they’re doing this with an incredible level of efficiency, meaning that revenue per headcount is the highest we’ve ever seen for software companies,” Botteri said. “And that’s happening on both sides of the [Atlantic] ocean.”\nHowever, he noted that “existing cloud software companies are not going away.” Accel’s Public Cloud Index is up 25% year-over-year, and these players are “all adding agentic capabilities to their products.” As for private companies, some are integrating AI so deeply that they can be considered AI-native, he argued, naming Accel portfolio company Doctolib as an example.\nWhile Europe has kept high hopes for homegrown foundation model companies like Mistral AI, Accel’s outlook for European model companies is less sunny. But Botteri didn’t dismiss it entirely as a space for future leaders to emerge. It could still happen for smaller models but “it is not a very target-rich environment,” he added.\nIn contrast, VCs are actively competing for investment opportunities in the AI application layer, despite recurring questions about defensibility. According to Botteri, there is still defensibility in building a product-centric offering with fast adoption.\nAnother false dichotomy is the thought that there is no space outside of models and applications. “We see that most of the market today is chasing models, compute and applications, and we think that data is undervalued at the moment,” said Lotan Levkowitz, a managing partner at Israeli VC firm Grove Ventures. “We strongly believe that companies focused on proprietary data and data flywheels are indeed very lucrative.”\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nEinride said Wednesday it plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, just six weeks after the Swedish electric and autonomous truck startup raised $100 million from investors. The SPAC merger with Legato Merger Corp. values Einride at $1.8 billion in pre-money equity, according to the companies.\nThe deal is expected to generate about $219 million in gross proceeds, a figure that doesn’t take into account any redemption of Legato’s public shares. The company is also seeking up to $100 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) capital.\nThe merger is expected to close in the first half of 2026, with Einride making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.\nEinride was founded in 2016 with an ambition to transform the freight industry, first with electric trucks, then with autonomous electric autonomous pods —  vehicles that lack a steering wheel or pedals designed for self-driving. The company, which hired Roozbeh Charli as its new CEO earlier this year, has been trying to scale three business lines: electric big rigs, autonomous pod-like trucks that navigate fixed routes, and planning software designed for shippers.\nEinride has had some success in expanding beyond Sweden. It operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE, for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has made some inroads with its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the United States.\nEinride, which also has a U.S. headquarters in Austin, Texas, revealed in its announcement that it has a current annual recurring revenue (ARR) run rate of about $45 million and a total contracted base of $65 million ARR from signed customer contracts.\nThe company’s $100 million raise, which was announced in October, was meant to help the company scale with its customer base and accelerate the deployment of its autonomous freight technology, Charli said at the time.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEinride previously raised $500 million in 2022 in a Series C round of equity and debt. The equity-based $200 million portion came from backers including Northzone, EQT Ventures, Temasek, Swedish pension fund AMF, Polar Structure, and Norrsken VC. It also secured $300 million in debt funding led by Barclays Europe. The $100 million raise in October included existing investor EQT Ventures and quantum computing company IonQ.\nEinride joins other autonomous vehicle companies that have pursued SPAC mergers in recent years to secure additional funding.\nAurora, which launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board), went public via a SPAC merger valued at $13 billion in 2021. Self-driving trucks startup Kodiak AI took the SPAC road to the public market earlier this year. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nThreads, Meta’s competitor to X, will now begin targeting a specific type of creator: podcasters. The company said on Tuesday that Threads will focus on bringing more discussions around podcasts to its app and helping creators promote their shows.\nInitially, Threads will roll out a couple of new features to help on this front. For one, it will give podcast links in the feed a unique and more pronounced look, with colorful backgrounds and image thumbnails, making them easier to spot.\nCreators, meanwhile, will get a dedicated spot in their user profile to add a link to their podcast. Threads says these links, which are similarly designed to stand out, will help podcasters better promote their shows and grow their audiences.\nIn the year ahead, these features will be followed by others that will also focus on serving podcasters and their listeners, a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Threads\nMeta explained it’s interested in the podcast community because it sees the potential in becoming the de facto place for people to talk about shows and engage with creators. Today, such discussions are distributed across social media, on places like Reddit, X, Facebook and Instagram, as well as on the platforms where podcasts are streamed, like YouTube and Spotify (the latter added support for comments last year).\nThe company’s also trying to tap podcasts’ deep ties to culture, which can drive discussions and encourage interactions. Threads currently has more than 400 million monthly active users and 150 million daily active users, less than its rival X, which claims as many as 600 million monthly active users. Capturing the podcast community, or even a portion of that, could help to narrow that gap significantly.\nImage Credits:Threads\nHowever, while Threads will target the discussions that result from podcasts, the company told TechCrunch it doesn’t intend to be a podcast distribution platform. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInstead, the company will focus on giving podcast hosts more insight and analytics on how the conversations around their shows are resonating with fans. It also intends to develop more features that would help people discover podcasts they might like, and connect podcasters and listeners through conversations.\nThis isn’t the first time Threads has targeted creators as a way to differentiate its social network from X, Bluesky, and others in the space.\nImage Credits:Threads\nThe company in May gave creators the ability to add up to five links in their profile, allowing them to promote their broader presence across the web, including on other social media sites, video platforms, blogs, and portfolios. The company more recently also began allowing creators to share longer thoughts and perspectives through a text attachment feature.\nMeta says users can expect to see Threads explore more features focused on podcast discussions in the months ahead.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

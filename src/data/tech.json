The fund raised a $150 million Fund I in early 2024 and then, just last September, announced a $274 million Fund II, raised in just a week. On LinkedIn, Altman called the past two years running Alt Capital “the most rewarding” of his life, adding that he loved “new ideas and being part of a team with a mission.” \nAlt Capital invested in at least 52 companies, according to PitchBook, including Rippling, Antares Nuclear, and CompLabs. It’s unclear what happens to Alt Capital or whether Benchmark has acquired its portfolio, as Altman also announced that his teammates from the fund will be following him to Benchmark. (That’s also unusual, given Benchmark has historically been structured as a flat firm with primarily GPs only, versus layers of investors.)\nAltman also said he will retain the board seats at the companies he backed while at Alt Capital. \nAltman did not respond to requests for comment earlier today; Benchmark declined to comment.\nAltman, a younger brother of OpenAI co-founder Sam, is also the founder of the HR platform Lattice, which he still chairs, per his LinkedIn profile. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n",

    "body": "\nX recently introduced a new immersive video player, signaling another major step in its ongoing push into video-focused experiences. \nNikita Bier, X’s head of product, announced the update earlier this week, admitting the previous video player “badly needed a refresh.” The redesign aims to make video consumption more engaging and user-friendly, especially on mobile devices.\nImage Credits:@nikitabier on X\nThe update, currently rolling out to iOS, allows users to expand videos to full screen with a single tap. Once in full-screen mode, viewers can swipe up to scroll to the next video, which is reminiscent of TikTok’s popular format.\nWhile the new player aims to enhance mobile video viewing, some users argue that the update forces all videos into a cropped, full-screen view, removing the option to view content in its original aspect ratio.\n“This UI sucks so bad. Let me just watch full-scale videos,” one user said. \nWhen another user asked which orientation is preferred, Bier confirmed that portrait is ideal. This approach mirrors broader industry trends, with vertical videos dominating platforms such as TikTok and Instagram Reels. Even streaming services have adopted the format, with Disney+ being the most recent to introduce a vertical video feed. \n“Sorry, but cropping the video incentivized people to post square videos. We are a mobile company,” he said, noting that X will stop cropping vertical content moving forward. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBier hinted that more video-focused updates are on the horizon as X doubles down on its video ambitions.\nThe timing of X’s update is notable, given that last month TikTok’s U.S. operations were sold to an American investor group. X is positioning itself as a competitor, ramping up its video features to attract both viewers and creators. \nThe recent introduction of the video player follows X’s launch of a dedicated vertical video feed that became available globally last year. The company is also incorporating AI-driven tools, such as Grok’s text-to-video generation feature. \nNotably, Grok’s image-generation capability recently sparked controversy, leading to its restriction to paying subscribers on X, due to the tool allowing users to create sexualized and nude images of women and children.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSnap’s direct revenue business has reached a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate, the company announced on Wednesday. Annualized revenue refers to a business’s current revenue rate projected over a full year. The social media giant says the milestone is driven by its Snapchat+ offering, which has now surpassed 25 million subscribers.\nLaunched in 2022, Snapchat+ gives subscribers access to exclusive and pre-release features for $3.99 per month. Following a successful launch, Snap introduced additional paid tiers beyond the core Snapchat+ subscription over the past year to further diversify its revenue streams.\n“Snapchat+ has become one of the fastest-growing consumer subscription services globally, with subscriber growth every quarter,” the company wrote in a blog post. “What started as an early-access program for our most engaged Snapchatters has quickly scaled into a meaningful business—one that now represents a strong and growing revenue stream alongside our ads business.”\nLast June, Snapchat launched Lens+, which gives users access to exclusive Lenses and AR experiences, along with the perks in the standard Snapchat+ tier, for $8.99 per month. \nIn early 2025, the company launched an ad-free Snapchat+ subscription tier called Platinum for $15.99 per month. And, in a controversial move in September, Snapchat announced plans to cap free storage for its Memories feature and launched a paid storage plan that costs $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ subscribers will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB.\nMoving beyond Snapchat+, the company announced yesterday that it’s launching creator subscriptions in alpha with select people in the U.S. Users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscriptions, which will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator’s public Stories, and an ad-free experience for that creator’s Stories.\nIn terms of the future, Snap says it’s going to continue to grow Snapchat+ with a focus on customization and community-driven features. \nSnap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, and rival Meta is following suit, as the company told TechCrunch last month that it was going to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle announced on Wednesday that it’s adding a music-generation feature to the Gemini app. The company is using DeepMind’s Lyria 3 music-generation model to power the feature, which is still in beta.\nTo use the feature, you’ll describe the song you want to create, and the app will generate a track along with lyrics. For instance, you could ask Gemini to create a “comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding its match,” and the app will generate a 30-second track along with cover art made by Nano Banana.\nGoogle said that you can even upload a photo or a video, and the AI-powered tool will create a song to match the mood of the media file.\n\nLoading the player…\n\nThe company said that Lyria 3 improves on the previous generation of models, creating more realistic and complex music tracks. Users can also change and control other elements like style, vocals, and tempo.\nAlong with rolling out Lyria 3 to the Gemini app, Google is making the model available to YouTube creators through the Dream Track feature on YouTube, a tool that helps creators make AI-generated tracks. The option was only available to YouTube creators in the U.S. until now. But with this release, Google is expanding Dream Track availability globally.\nGoogle said that you can’t mimic an artist outright, but if you add an artist’s name to your prompt, Gemini will create a track in a similar style or a mood. (It’s not clear if generation will make it easier for others to decode the music style of a particular artist.)\n“Music generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content,” the company said in a blog post.\nGoogle noted that all songs created with the Lyria 3 model will have a SynthID watermark to identify AI-generated content. The company said that it’s also adding capabilities to identify AI-generated music with SynthID within Gemini. Users will be able to upload tracks and ask Gemini if it is AI-generated.\nMusic generation is rolling out to all 18+ Gemini users across the world with support for English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.\nAI-generated music has created mixed sentiments among artists and listeners. On one hand, companies like YouTube and Spotify are adopting AI and signing contracts with music labels to monetize AI-generated music. On the other hand, AI model and tooling companies are facing lawsuits from the music industry over copyrights of the training material. Platforms like Deezer have published tools to mark AI-generated music to curb fraudulent streams of this kind of music.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "description": "\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles will not suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days because the EV maker has stopped us",
    "body": "\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles will not suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days because the EV maker has stopped using the term “Autopilot” in the marketing of its vehicles in the state.\nThe decision, issued late Tuesday, means Tesla can continue selling its EVs in California without interruption and officially settles a case that has been dragging on for nearly three years. California is Tesla’s biggest U.S. market.\nIn November 2023, the DMV filed accusations that Tesla violated state law by using deceptive marketing of Autopilot, its basic advanced driver assistance system, as well as its more capable Full Self-Driving driver assistance software. The state regulator argued that the terms mislead customers and distorted the capabilities of the advanced driver assistance systems.\nTesla stopped using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability,” and instead used Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to more accurately describe the system and clarify that drivers were still required to monitor it. But Tesla held on to the Autopilot term, prompting the DMV to refer the case to an administrative law judge at the California Office of Administrative Hearings.\nIn December, the administrative law judge agreed with the DMV’s request to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its actions. The DMV agreed with the ruling, but didn’t pounce; instead, the state regulator gave Tesla 60 days to comply.\n“Since then, Tesla took corrective action and has stopped using the misleading term ‘Autopilot’ in the marketing of its electric vehicles in California,” the DMV stated in a release posted on its website. “Tesla had previously modified its use of the term ‘Full Self-Driving’ to clarify that driver supervision is required. By taking this prescribed action, Tesla will avoid having its dealer and manufacturer licenses suspended in the state for 30 days by the DMV.”\nTesla didn’t just stop using the term Autopilot, though. In January, the company discontinued Autopilot in the U.S. and Canada altogether. The move not only helped it comply with the DMV but was also viewed as a way to boost adoption of FSD, which unlike Autopilot, requires the owner to pay for the upgraded system.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFSD Supervised, which until February 14 required an $8,000 one-time fee, is now only available through a monthly subscription of $99. That subscription fee is expected to increase as the system becomes more capable, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:40 PM PST · February 17, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nA federal district court in Northern California ruled in favor of Cameo, a platform that allows users to get personalized video messages from celebrities, and ordered OpenAI to stop using “Cameo” in its products and features.\nOpenAI was using the “Cameo” name for its AI-powered video generation app Sora 2. Users could use that feature to insert digital likenesses of themselves into AI-generated videos. In a ruling filed Saturday, the court said the name was similar enough to cause user confusion, and rejected OpenAI’s argument that “Cameo” was merely descriptive, finding that “it suggests rather than describes the feature.”\nIn November, the court granted a temporary restraining order to Cameo and stopped OpenAI from using the word. The AI company then renamed the feature to “Characters” after that order.\n“We have spent nearly a decade building a brand that stands for talent-friendly interactions and genuine connection, and we like to say that ‘every Cameo is a commercial for the next one.” Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. \n“This ruling is a critical victory not just for our company, but for the integrity of our marketplace and the thousands of creators who trust the Cameo name. We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property against any platform that attempts to trade on the goodwill and recognition we have worked so hard to establish,” he noted.\n“We disagree with the complaint’s assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word ‘cameo,’ and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” an OpenAI spokesperson told Reuters in response to the ruling.\nOpenAI has been involved in several intellectual property cases in recent months. Earlier this month, the company ditched “IO” branding around its upcoming hardware products, according to court documents obtained by WIRED.

    "body": "\nIndian AI company Sarvam plans to bring its newly released AI models to users by deploying them on Nokia feature phones, cars and its own smart glasses.\nThe company, backed by the likes of Lightspeed, PeakXV, and Khosla Ventures, said at the ongoing India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi that it is using edge models that take up only megabytes of space, can run on most phones with existing processors, and can work offline.\nThe company is teaming up with HMD to bring a conversational AI assistant to Nokia and HMD phones. A video demo showed a user clicking a dedicated AI button on a feature phone to converse with an AI assistant in a local language to get guidance on government schemes or local markets. It is not clear if all the AI features showcased at the event will work offline.\n“Through edge AI, we want to bring intelligence to every phone, laptop, car, and even a new generation of devices,” Tushar Goswamy, head of Edge AI at Sarvam, said during a presentation.\nHe said that the company has worked with Qualcomm to tune its models for the latter’s chipsets. Sarvam didn’t provide details on which devices the models will be deployed to. Qualcomm said that it is developing a “Sovereign AI Experience Suite” that would work across a range of devices, including phones, PCs, laptops, cars, and IoT devices. \n“Our collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies can accelerate how we take sovereign AI from research to deployment,” Sarvam co-founder and CEO Vivek Raghwan said in a statement.\n“This will allow Sarvam to design models and applications that run closer to the edge, safeguard data, and are ready for adoption, at scale.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSarvam also said it is working with German engineering giant Bosch to bring AI assistants to cars, though it didn’t disclose many other details.\nThe startup also showed off a pair of AI smart-glasses, dubbed Sarvam Kaze, designed and manufactured in India. The company’s co-founder, Pratyush Kumar, said the glasses are a “builders’ device” and will be available in May.\nSarvam has so far operated largely in the enterprise market, offering its voice-focused models for use cases like customer support. The new models and partnerships indicate the company is shifting its focus towards consumer use cases.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOnly days after Spotify announced its foray into physical book sales, which included an audiobook feature that lets you sync your listening and your offline reading progress, Amazon-owned Audible has launched a feature that brings ebooks together with audiobooks.\nThe company announced on Wednesday an “immersion reading” feature in the Audible app, which allows readers who have both the ebook and audiobook versions of a title in their Audible and Kindle libraries to read the ebook’s text while the audio plays. The feature also lets users switch between the different formats across devices. While in the “Read & Listen” mode, the text of the book is highlighted in real-time in sync with the narration.\nThe Kindle app already offered a tool that would allow readers to move between the Audible version and the ebook, when both versions had been purchased. This feature is now coming to Audible’s app for the first time. Customers will need to own both versions of the book for this to work, but discounted audiobooks will be made available to customers who own the matching ebook, the company says.\nAt launch, hundreds of thousands of titles will be supported by the new “Read & Listen” feature, including those in English, German, Spanish, Italian, and French. Initially, the option will be offered in the U.S., with the U.K., Australia, and Germany gaining support over the next few months.\nTo discover eligible titles, Audible will automatically identify which Kindle ebooks have audiobook matches within its app. \nOf course, many customers were already reading and listening to their books without buying two versions — by having Alexa narrate their ebooks from their Kindle library. Alexa is not a professional narrator by any means, and the AI assistant’s more monotonous delivery can lead you to zone out. By offering a way to add on the audiobook for a lower price when you’ve already bought the ebook, Amazon hopes to boost book sales across formats.\nThe company also claims that the combination of reading and listening can improve focus and comprehension, according to industry research and its own internal data. In addition, customers who read and listen are the most engaged, consuming nearly twice as much content per month as audiobook-only customers, Audible noted. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe feature may make sense for students and those learning a new language, as well as those who are trying to get through more books quickly. It’s also useful for those who regularly switch back and forth between reading and listening, and those who want the experience of the narration — particularly if a book is read by a favorite voice actor. Plus, some may simply appreciate having a narrator introduce all the characters by name, so they can learn the pronunciation without having to guess (a particularly thorny issue in fantasy novels!)\n“Audiobooks count as reading,” said Andy Tsao, Chief Product Officer at Audible, in a statement about the launch. “But now at Audible, you can read with your eyes too. Read & Listen gives book lovers the best of both worlds. Whether you’re learning a new language, studying for school, or lost in a story’s world, you no longer have to choose one format over the other.”\nAmazon notes that the new feature will not impact publishers’ royalty payments. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIndian AI lab Sarvam on Tuesday unveiled a new generation of large language models, as it bets that smaller, efficient open-source AI models will be able to grab some market share away from more expensive systems offered by its much larger U.S. and Chinese rivals.\nThe launch, announced at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, aligns with New Delhi’s push to reduce reliance on foreign AI platforms and tailor models to local languages and use cases.\nSarvam said the new lineup includes 30-billion and 105-billion parameter models; a text-to-speech model; a speech-to-text model; and a vision model to parse documents. These mark a sharp upgrade from the company’s 2-billion-parameter Sarvam 1 model that it released in October 2024.\nThe 30-billion- and 105-billion-parameter models use a mixture-of-experts architecture, which activates only a fraction of their total parameters at a time, significantly reducing computing costs, Sarvam said. The 30B model supports a 32,000-token context window aimed at real-time conversational use, while the larger model offers a 128,000-token window for more complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.\nSarvam’s 30B model is placed against Google’s Gemma 27B and OpenAI’s GPT-OSS-20B, among other models Image Credits:Sarvam\nSarvam said the new AI models were trained from scratch rather than fine-tuned on existing open-source systems. The 30B model was pre-trained on about 16 trillion tokens of text, while the 105B model was trained on trillions of tokens spanning multiple Indian languages, it said.\nThe models are designed to support real-time applications, the startup said, including voice-based assistants and chat systems in Indian languages. \nSarvam’s 105B is touted to compete against OpenAI’s GPT-OSS-120B and Alibaba’s Qwen-3-Next-80BImage Credits:Sarvam\nThe startup said the models were trained using computing resources provided under India’s government-backed IndiaAI Mission, with infrastructure support from data center operator Yotta and technical support from Nvidia.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSarvam executives said the company plans to take a measured approach to scaling its models, focusing on real-world applications rather than raw size.\n“We want to be mindful in how we do the scaling,” Sarvam co-founder Pratyush Kumar said at the launch. “We don’t want to do the scaling mindlessly. We want to understand the tasks which really matter at scale and go and build for them.”\nSarvam said it plans to open-source the 30B and 105B models, though it did not specify whether the training data or full training code would also be made public.\nThe company also outlined plans to build specialized AI systems, including coding-focused models and enterprise tools under a product it calls Sarvam for Work, and a conversational AI agent platform called Samvaad. \nFounded in 2023, Sarvam has raised more than $50 million in funding and counts Lightspeed Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India) among its investors.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nCreative company Canva ended 2025 on a high note with a 20% increase in monthly active users, growth that was partially propelled by adoption of its AI tools. \nCanva had more than 265 million monthly active users and over 31 million paid users in 2025, according to the company. That user base helped push its annual recurring revenue to $4 billion by the end of year, Canva co-founder and COO Cliff Obrecht told TechCrunch on the sidelines of Web Summit Qatar. The subscription-based company also saw its B2B business, which accounts for companies with more than 25 seats, grow by 100% with $500 million in ARR. \nThe company still sees the majority of its business from North America, with continued growth in international markets. To increase paying users, Canva has introduced lower-priced subscriptions in countries like Pakistan, Uruguay, Morocco, and Jamaica.\nCanva’s AI investments are paying off, according to Obrecht. The company debuted a tool that lets users create mini apps and websites using AI last year. Obrecht noted the tool has more than 10 million monthly active users now. It’s been successful enough that the company is thinking about putting AI at the center and acting like a “design agency in your pocket,” Obrecht said.\nThat shift to AI comes as Canva faces competition from the likes of Adobe, Freepik, and Apple, which has pushed to become a full-packaged creator suite by bundling apps like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStagewith into a $12.99 per month Creator Studio. \n“Where we started was… we got the Canva platform, and we’re giving the Canva platform a bunch of AI tools. We’re inverting that now. We’re becoming an AI platform with a bunch of design tools. So you can think of it more like a cursor for design,” he said.\nCanva is also actively integrating with chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude. It said that by October 2025, users had more than 26 million conversations with the Canva app on ChatGPT. It also claimed that Canva was one of the top 10 referred domains from ChatGPT.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nObrecht said that the company is allocating resources to work on having Canva surface in LLM search results, along with working on SEO.\n“So we drove a lot of early days in Canva through Google, really understood people’s search intent, and delivered them content that they could then go into our product and edit. And so we really see ChatGPT or any of the LLMs top of the funnel acquisition platforms,” he said. \nHe noted that while search is a big driving factor, traffic through LLM referrals is in double-digit percentages. The company is also allocating resources to have Canva surface more in chatbots.\nCanva was last valued at $42 billion in a share sell. Obrecht told Bloomberg last November, that the company will go public in the next “couple of years.”\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFei-Fei Li’s World Labs has secured a $200 million investment from software design giant Autodesk. The partnership will see the two companies collaborating to explore how World Labs’ models  — AI systems that can generate and reason about immersive 3D environments — can work alongside Autodesk’s tools, and vice versa, starting with a focus on entertainment use cases. \nThe deal is part of a larger round for World Labs, according to Autodesk, which declined to disclose further details. World Labs, which emerged from stealth in 2024 with $230 million at a $1 billion valuation, is reportedly now in talks to raise capital at a $5 billion valuation. \nWorld Labs did not immediately return a request for more details.\nFor World Labs, Autodesk’s investment is a signal that its product has commercial appeal. The startup’s first world model product, Marble, released last November, lets users create editable, downloadable 3D environments. \nAutodesk is one of the biggest developers of 3D CAD (computer-aided design) software. Its platform underpins architectural, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and entertainment workflows. That focus on the built world makes investment in advanced spatial AI a natural extension of its core business. \nOr as Li put it in a statement: “Autodesk has long helped people think spatially and solve real-world problems and, together, we share a clear purpose: building physical AI that augments human creativity and puts more powerful tools in the hands of designers, builders, and creators.”\nAs part of the deal, Autodesk will serve as an advisor to World Labs, and the two will collaborate at the “research and model level.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDaron Green, Autodesk’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch the partnership is still in its early days, so the precise form it’s going to take hasn’t been determined yet. \n“You could anticipate us consuming their models or them consuming our models in different settings,” Green said. \nHe mused that customers might like to start with a world-model-based sketch in World Labs (say, of an office layout) and then drill down on certain design aspects (like the design of the desk), which is where Autodesk’s tech might come in. \n“Similarly, you might want to take an object that you’ve designed in our [platform], and put it in a context that you create through one of [World Labs’s] prompts,” Green said. \nGreen added that data sharing is not part of the agreement.\nGreen said the two companies plan to start with media and entertainment use cases. Most companies building world models — including Google DeepMind and Runway — see gaming and interactive entertainment as an initial go-to-market strategy. \nAutodesk already works with most major media production companies and has been training models for character animation. \n“These are close to world models,” Green said. “They’re a characterization of an animal in the world that’s responding to physical constraints like time, maybe a terrain it needs to traverse. So there’s a physical understanding in the model, and you can see how that might be combined [with World Labs’s tech]. You’re not just animating the dog, but you’re giving it a world within which it can now interact.”\nThe partnership with World Labs supports Autodesk’s broader push to integrate more AI features across its software portfolio. The company is developing “neural CAD,” a new kind of generative AI model trained on geometric data that can reason about components and entire systems. Put simply, it can generate working 3D models, not just images, with an understanding of how those designs would function in the real world. \nAutodesk’s neural CAD models are already being integrated into the firm’s product design and architecture products as a step toward more advanced spatial intelligence. But World Labs’ models could help extend that capability beyond individual design files toward more holistic digital representations of the physical world. \nGreen thinks different AI systems, including large language models, world models and neural CAD, will be combined in the future to improve designs for Autodesk’s customers. \n“If AI is to be truly useful, it must understand worlds, not just words,” Li said in the statement. “Worlds are governed by geometry, physics, and dynamics, and reconciling the semantic, spatial, and physical is the next great frontier of AI.”\n",

The move comes as the South Asian nation seeks to scale AI skills and build domestic capacity in one of the world’s largest talent markets.\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI said it was partnering with six public and private higher-education institutions in India, including top engineering, management, medical, and design-focused institutes, with the aim of reaching more than 100,000 students, faculty, and staff over the next year.\nRather than focusing on consumer use, the initiative centers on integrating AI into core academic functions, signalling OpenAI’s interest in influencing how AI is taught, governed, and normalized within one of the world’s largest higher-education systems. \nOpenAI has already built a large consumer audience for its ChatGPT chatbot, which has over 100 million monthly active users in India, according to CEO Sam Altman, and India has emerged as the company’s second-largest user base after the U.S. The announcement also coincides with a broader push by leading AI firms to deepen their presence in India, which is hosting an AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week.\nThe first cohort of partners includes some of India’s most influential academic institutions, such as the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, alongside private universities and specialised design schools. The ChatGPT maker said the partnerships would span disciplines ranging from engineering and management to healthcare and creative fields.\nIndia has already emerged as a key testing ground for AI use in education. Last month, Google said India accounts for the highest global usage of its Gemini tools for learning. Microsoft, similarly, said this week it would expand its Elevate skilling program in India to train teachers across schools, vocational institutes, and higher-education settings, working with government agencies as part of a broader push to build AI skills at scale.\nOpenAI said the partnerships would involve campus-wide access to its ChatGPT Edu tools, faculty training, and responsible-use frameworks. The focus, the company said, is on embedding AI into core academic workflows such as coding, research, analytics, and case analysis, rather than offering standalone access to tools.\nTwo of the partner institutions, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, will also introduce OpenAI-backed certifications. Additionally, OpenAI said it would work with Indian ed-tech platforms, including PhysicsWallah, upGrad, and HCL GUVI, to extend AI training beyond campuses. These platforms will launch structured courses on AI fundamentals and ChatGPT use cases, aimed at students and early-career professionals.\nRaghav Gupta, head of education at OpenAI India, said educational institutions were a “critical route” to closing the gap between rapidly advancing AI tools and how people are actually using them, as skills demands shift across the economy.\nLast year, OpenAI hired Gupta, a former Coursera Asia-Pacific managing director, as its India and Asia-Pacific head of education, alongside the launch of a Learning Accelerator programme focused on expanding AI skills.\nThe flurry of moves into education underscores how AI companies are increasingly looking beyond consumer tools and corporate clients toward institutions that shape skills, norms, and long-term adoption. For countries like India, the contest is not just around access to AI, but also about who helps define how it is taught, governed, and embedded at scale.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nData centers face a conundrum: how to power increasingly dense server racks using equipment that relies on century-old technology. \nTraditional transformers are bulky and hot, but a new generation of solid-state transformers promises to address both problems while making power management more flexible.\nOne solid-state transformer startup, DG Matrix, has raised $60 million in a Series A round, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Engine Ventures led the round with ABB, Cerberus Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures, Clean Energy Ventures, Fine Structure Ventures, Helios Climate Ventures, MCJ, and Piedmont Capital participating.\nThe company also recently announced a deal to provide its Interport device to Exowatt, the startup building solar-plus-storage containers to supply data centers with 24/7 electricity.\nThe Interport device acts as a router for power, Subhashish Bhattacharya, co-founder and CTO of DG Matrix, told TechCrunch. One Interport can handle up to 2.4 megawatts of connections. For example, it could accumulate 600 kilowatts from solar panels and 600 kilowatts from grid-scale batteries to feed power to 12 racks drawing 100 kilowatts each.\nBecause Interport can integrate electricity from a variety of sources, including large batteries, DG Matrix says it can eliminate uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and the equipment needed to support them. \nAltogether, one Interport can cut down the amount of space devoted to power conversion in a data center. Two four-by-30 foot skids laden with power conversion equipment can be replaced by a single four-by-four foot Interport device, DG Matrix co-founder and CEO Haroon Inam told TechCrunch. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy eliminating several devices, the company can boost the system’s overall efficiency. All the legacy devices chained together can achieve about 82% to 90% efficiency, Inam said, while Interport is 95% to 98% efficient. He said that reliability should improve, too. “When you are using only 10%, 15% of the components that legacy is using, you’re going to be far more reliable,” he added.\nDG Matrix is in the process of rolling out initial units to customers in June. Its next product will be a sidecar to supply data center racks with power that builds on the technology the company has already developed. \nCurrently, data centers represent about about 90% of DG Matrix’s pipeline, with the remainder devoted to EV charging for fleets. Inam said the next step is to expand into building power and add more capacity to build micro- and mini-grids to support electrification projects in remote communities. There, Interports would orchestrate power from solar, wind, and batteries to provide round-the-clock electricity without a grid connection.\n“Nobody’s going to build a $100 million transmission line to a village,” Inam said. “Now you can spend a fraction of that money and help eliminate energy poverty.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nHeron Power, founded by former Tesla executive Drew Baglino, announced on Wednesday that it has raised $140 million to build gigawatts worth of solid-state transformers for data centers and the grid.\nIt’s a fast turnaround for the startup, which raised a $38 million Series A in May. Baglino said Heron Power didn’t need the money, but after customers expressed interest in buying more than 40 gigawatts of solid-state transformers, it decided to raise again. \n“If our customers are leaning in, we need to lean in as well,” Baglino, who is CEO of Heron Power, told TechCrunch. “We gotta go faster.”\nThe speed at which Heron Power is raising shows just how data centers are driving demand for products that can rapidly deliver electricity to their servers. Baglino, who spent nearly two decades at Tesla and led the powertrain and energy groups, is no stranger to moving quickly.\nThe Series B round was led by Andreessen Horowitz’s American Dynamism Fund and Breakthrough Energy Ventures with participation from Capricorn Investment Group, Energy Impact Partners, Gigascale Capital, and Valor Atreides AI Fund.\nSolid-state transformers have been under development more than a decade, but only recently have matured to the point where they are ready to deploy in data centers and other large, energy-intensive facilities.\nThe new technology seeks to replace old iron-core transformers, which have existed in essentially the same form for more than a century. Iron-core transformers are inexpensive and efficient, but they are bulky and generate lots of heat. Solid-state transformers are smaller and can also more efficient by replacing several pieces of equipment, solving two of data center developers’ biggest challenges. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSolid-state transformers can also manage power intelligently, including from a range of electricity sources like wind, solar, and batteries, because they use semiconductors instead of passive metal.\nThe startup’s solid-state transformers, branded as Heron Link, can convert medium voltage electricity to the 800-volt power needed by Nvidia’s reference rack designs. They’re capable of handling 5 megawatts a piece, and each device contains tens of modules that do the power conversion. If one fails, it can be swapped out in about 10 minutes, far faster than it takes to replace a monolithic transformer.\nEach Heron Link also contains specialized lithium-ion batteries that can discharge quickly to provide 30 seconds of power to smooth the transition to backup power sources like grid-scale batteries, allowing data centers to eliminate uninterruptible power supplies. \nBy eliminating pieces of equipment, solid-state transformers also eliminate several points of failure and reduce costs. “We can remove 70% of the gear involved,” Baglino said. “For some data center applications, it might be savings of an order of magnitude.”\nData centers are only about a third of Heron Power’s business currently, Baglino said. The remainder is split between solar power and grid-scale batteries, which benefit from solid-state transformers’ speed and flexibility.\nHeron Power plans to use the new funding to build a factory capable of producing 40-gigawatts of Heron Link transformers annually. That’s about 10% to 15% of annual production outside of China (or about 5% to 10% of total global demand), the equivalent to half the peak power demand of the state of Texas. \nBaglino said the company intends to begin pilot production in early 2027 before ramping production over the following two years. \nHeron Power isn’t alone in developing solid-state transformers, and with many of the grid’s old transformers approaching replacement age, competition will be stiff. The startup’s new cash haul paired with Baglino’s experience scaling production could give it an advantage. “We will push as hard as we can,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

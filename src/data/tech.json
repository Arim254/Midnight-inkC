    "body": "\nApple is getting serious about succession planning, according to a new report in The Financial Times.\nThe company’s board and senior executives are reportedly preparing for the possibility that Tim Cook could step down as CEO as soon as early next year. This would come after Apple’s earnings report in late January, giving the new leadership team time to settle into their roles before Apple’s big events like the Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\nThe 65-year-old Cook has been Apple’s chief executive since Steve Jobs resigned in 2011; he’s now served as CEO for longer than Jobs. Under his leadership, Apple has grown from a market capitalization of $350 billion to $4 trillion, although the company has apparently struggled to find the right direction with AI.\nNo final decisions have been made about Cook’s successor or the timing of his departure, the FT says. However, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus is reportedly seen as the most likely candidate for the company’s next CEO.\n",

Once sequestered, Charm can sell carbon removal credits to companies. Axios first reported on the startup’s deal with Boeing.\nAviation has made little progress on cutting its carbon emissions. That has left companies in the sector searching for alternatives. Carbon removal has emerged as a contender given that it has the potential to cost less than transitioning to sustainable aviation fuels.\nBy 2050, one study found that the aviation industry will need to spend at least $60 billion on carbon offsets to reach net zero emissions.\nCharm can also produce biochar, a substance that when applied to farm fields can help boost soil productivity, though those efforts are still in their infancy, according to data from carbon removal registry Isometric.\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Two years ago, Charm sold 112,000 carbon removal credits to Frontier, the advanced market commitment, for $53 million, or about $470 per metric ton. Charm has said it wants to bring the cost down to about $50 per metric ton.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Climate\n",

The telltale sign that supposedly signals text written by AI has popped up everywhere in recent months, including in school papers, emails, comments, customer service chats, LinkedIn posts, online forums, ad copy, and more. The inclusion of the em dash has led people to criticize those writers for being lazy and turning to an AI chatbot to do their work.\nOf course, many have also argued for the em dash, saying it’s been a part of their writing well before LLMs adopted the punctuation. However, the fact that chatbots couldn’t seem to avoid its use made the so-called “ChatGPT hyphen” a newly objectionable addition to any text, even if they weren’t a reliable signal of content created by generative AI.\nThe problem had stumped OpenAI for some time, as ChatGPT users were unable to get the chatbot to stop using the symbol, even when they specifically asked it not to.\nNow, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the company has fixed the problem. In a post on X, Altman writes, “If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do,” calling the update a “small-but-happy win.”\n\nSmall-but-happy win:If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it's supposed to do!— Sam Altman (@sama) November 14, 2025\n\nThe company explains in a post on Threads (where it forced ChatGPT to apologize for “ruining the em dash”) that ChatGPT will be better at not using the em dash if you instruct it not to via the custom instructions in your personalization settings. That means it won’t necessarily eliminate the em dash from its output by default, but you will at least have more control over the frequency of its appearance.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\nAfter a two-week blackout, YouTube TV and Disney announced Friday that they have reached a deal.\nIn addition to bringing Disney networks like ABC, ESPN, and FX back to YouTube’s streaming TV service, the deal will also see ESPN make its new direct-to-consumer service available on YouTube TV at no additional cost. YouTube will also be able to sell select Disney networks and the Disney+/Hulu bundle as part of different packages.\nIn a statement, Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, described the deal as one that “recognizes the tremendous value of Disney’s programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice.”\n“We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,” the Disney executives added.\nYouTube also released a statement Friday saying that subscribers would see the affected channels restored “throughout the course of the day.” The company said, “We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we negotiated on their behalf.”\nYouTube TV is meant to be a cable TV alternative for cord cutters, but like most cable TV providers, the service has had its share of disputes with major content providers — usually over how much money to pay them and how much flexibility it has to offer their content in different bundles.\nThe last time YouTube and Disney renegotiated in 2022, there was a similar (if significantly briefer) blackout. This time around, YouTube offered customers a $20 credit that they can apply to their next bill.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne survey even suggested that due to the Disney blackout, 24% of the service’s more than 10 million subscribers said they had already canceled their subscription or planned to do so soon. (A YouTube spokesperson said actual churn was “manageable and does not align with the findings of this survey.”)\nIndeed, TechCrunch’s Amanda Silberling said the blackout was ruining her life because she couldn’t watch “Jeopardy!” Thankfully, her two-week nightmare is over.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s budding satellite internet program is no longer called Project Kuiper. It is now known simply as “Leo.” The name change comes as the company appears to be shifting its focus from “unserved or underserved” communities to securing larger commercial contracts.\nThe satellite network has been in the works since 2019 and, as Amazon tells it, the name Project Kuiper was only ever supposed to be temporary. Leo is a nod to the network’s location in what’s known as low-Earth orbit, commonly referred to in the space industry as “LEO.”\nAs Amazon worked toward launching the first Kuiper satellites earlier this year, the company boasted that the project was an “initiative to increase global broadband access” with a noble-sounding “mission to bring fast, affordable broadband” to communities that aren’t well-served by traditional internet providers.\nBut, as TechCrunch previously noted, the company has changed the language it uses to describe the service in recent months as it inked deals with Airbus and JetBlue, putting the network more squarely in competition with SpaceX’s Starlink service.\nAmazon didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nAn archived version of the main FAQ page for Kuiper — published in late 2024 — puts the aforementioned “mission” to serve those communities right at the top of the post. Affordability is mentioned three times throughout, with Amazon calling it a “key principle of Project Kuiper.” \n“Amazon has a longstanding commitment to low prices, and lots of experience building popular, low-cost devices like Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick,” reads the answer to a question on the archived post about how much Kuiper service will cost. “We’re applying a similar approach with Project Kuiper.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat question-and-answer about cost is now gone from the Leo FAQ, and there is no mention of “affordability” anywhere on the page.\nThe language at the top of the new FAQ is also different. It states that Leo is “Amazon’s low Earth orbit satellite network, designed to provide fast, reliable internet to customers and communities beyond the reach of existing networks.” \nWhile the Leo FAQ mentions that poor connectivity can “create an economic disadvantage for people, businesses, and other organizations operating in unserved and underserved parts of the world,” the company is less specific than it used to be about putting those communities front and center in the customer pipeline.\nAmazon Leo’s new website is even more blatant about how it is prioritizing home and commercial internet service. It promotes the ability to make “seamless video calls, stream 4K videos,” and “handle your whole family’s internet needs,” as well as the fact that Leo is “[f]lexible, scalable, enterprise-ready.”\nThe idea of using Leo “even in rural and remote locations” is brought up as almost an afterthought on the main website, and there is no mention of cost or affordability.\nDespite all this, on Thursday, Amazon posted a flashy video about the name change on X. Among other things, it shows a kid using her computer to do homework, professional drift racing, ambulance workers on a remote road, a farmer using a tablet, and a couple dancing in a laundromat. Along with the video, it wrote: “New name, same mission.” \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

But the consequences of self-favoring go far beyond the amount awarded. We will continue to fight – because market abuse must have consequences and must not become a lucrative business model that is worthwhile despite fines and compensation payments,” Idealo’s co-founder and CEO Albrecht von Sonntag said in a statement.\nGoogle said it intends to appeal both rulings. “The changes we made in 2017 are working well, with no intervention from the European Commission. The number of price comparison sites in Europe using the remedy Shopping Unit has multiplied from seven then to 1,550 today,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nThe company added that it offers rival comparison shopping services the same opportunity as Google Shopping to display ads, and said Google Shopping operates as if it were a separate business, participating in auctions the same as everyone else.\nThe ruling follows close on the heels of an EU investigation into how Google’s spam policy affects publishers’ search rankings. The company was recently fined €2.95 billion (just under $3.5 billion) by the EU for allegedly breaching EU antitrust rules by favoring its own advertising services. \nNote: This story was updated to add a comment from Google.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nAfter a year of frenzied dealmaking and rumors of an upcoming IPO, the financial scrutiny into OpenAI is intensifying. Leaked documents obtained by tech blogger Ed Zitron provide more of a glimpse into OpenAI’s financials — specifically its revenue and compute costs over the past couple of years.  \nZitron reported this week that in 2024, Microsoft received $493.8 million in revenue share payments from OpenAI. In the first three quarters of 2025, that number jumped to $865.8 million, according to documents he viewed.\nOpenAI reportedly shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft as part of a previous deal where the software giant invested over $13 billion in the powerful AI startup. (Neither the startup nor the people in Redmond have publicly confirmed this percentage.)\nHowever, this is where things get a little sticky, because Microsoft also shares revenue with OpenAI, kicking back about 20% of the revenues from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Bing is powered by OpenAI, and the OpenAI Service sells cloud access to OpenAI’s models to developers and businesses.  \nThe source also told TechCrunch that the leaked payments refer to Microsoft’s net revenue share, not the gross revenue share. In other words, they don’t include whatever Microsoft paid to OpenAI from Bing and Azure OpenAI royalties. Microsoft deducts those figures from its internally reported revenue share numbers, according to this person.\nMicrosoft doesn’t break out how much it makes from Bing and Azure OpenAI in its financial statements, so it’s difficult to estimate how much the tech giant is kicking back.\nNevertheless, the leaked documents provide a window into the hottest company on the private markets today — and not just how much it makes in revenue, but also how much it’s spending in comparison to that revenue.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo, based on that widely reported 20% revenue-share statistic, we can infer that OpenAI’s revenue was at least $2.5 billion in 2024 and $4.33 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 — but very likely to be more. Previous reports from The Information put OpenAI’s 2024 revenue at around $4 billion, and its revenue from the first half of 2025 at $4.3 billion.  \nAltman also recently said OpenAI’s revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year, will end the year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate (which is a projection, not guidance on actual revenue), and that the company could even hit $100 billion by 2027. \nPer Zitron’s analysis, OpenAI may have spent roughly $3.8 billion on inference in 2024. That spend increased to roughly $8.65 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Inference is the compute used to run a trained AI model to generate responses.  \nOpenAI has historically almost exclusively relied on Microsoft Azure to provide compute access, though it has also struck deals with CoreWeave and Oracle, and more recently with AWS and Google Cloud. \nPrevious reports put OpenAI’s entire compute spend at roughly $5.6 billion for 2024 and its “cost of revenue” at $2.5 billion for the first half of 2025.  \nA source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that while OpenAI’s training spend is mostly non-cash — meaning, paid by credits Microsoft awarded OpenAI as part of its investment — the firm’s inference spend is largely cash. (Training refers to the compute resources needed to initially train a model.)\nWhile not a complete picture, these numbers imply that OpenAI could be spending more on inference costs than it is earning in revenue. \nAnd those implications promise to add to the incessant AI bubble chatter that has seeped into every conversation from New York City to Silicon Valley. If model giant OpenAI really still is in the red running its models, what might this mean for the massive investments at jaw-dropping valuations for the rest of the AI world?\nOpenAI declined to comment.

    "body": "\nTesla has published the most detailed look at the performance and relative safety of its advanced driver-assistance software, just a few weeks after Waymo’s co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana at TechCrunch Disrupt called on companies to release more data.\nOn a new section of its website, Tesla claims that in North America, owners using the company’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software are driving around 5 million miles before a major collision and around 1.5 million miles before a minor collision.\nThat’s a far lower rate than the national average based on statistics provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). That data shows people get in a major collision every 699,000 miles, and a minor one every 229,000, at least according to Tesla’s interpretation.\nTesla has been releasing “vehicle safety reports” on a quarter-by-quarter basis for a while. But those reports have been repeatedly panned for being insufficient. And Tesla has released almost no information about the safety performance of the Robotaxi trial it’s been running in Austin, Texas, this year, which still has employees in the driver’s seat monitoring for safety reasons.\nWaymo, the leading robotaxi company in the U.S. at the moment based on cars deployed and customers served, has published detailed data showing its vehicles are around 5x safer than human drivers, and 12x safer with respect to pedestrians. At last month’s Disrupt conference, Mawakana was asked to name other companies she felt were making roads safer.\n“I don’t know who’s on that list, because they’re not telling us what’s happening with their fleets,” said Mawakana, without naming Tesla.\n“I think there is a responsibility, if you’re going to put vehicles on the road, and you’re going to remove the driver from behind the wheel, and you’re going to have someone in some other room observing the fleet who can take over their vehicles, it is incumbent upon you to be transparent about what’s happening,” she added. “And if you are not being transparent, then it is my view that you are not doing what is necessary in order to actually earn the right to make the road safer.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWaymo didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday about whether Mawakana believes Tesla’s new data is sufficient.\nOne of the repeated criticisms of Tesla’s quarterly safety reports is that it focused on Autopilot, a far less advanced driver-assistance system than the Full Self Driving (Supervised) software, or FSD — which, despite its name, does not make a car fully autonomous. Autopilot was designed to be used on highways, which typically see a lower rate of crashes (when including minor collisions).\nTesla has finally broken out all this data. The new section of Tesla’s website claims that drivers using FSD travel about 2.9 million miles between major collisions, while NHTSA data shows all drivers travel about 505,000 miles per major collision. Tesla claims FSD users drive about 986,000 miles between minor collisions, while NHTSA data shows all drivers travel around 178,000 miles per minor collision.\nTesla is also finally showing how it defines these terms for the first time. \nThe carmaker is using the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, specifically 49 C.F.R. § 563.5. Tesla defines “major collisions” as crashes with higher-severity impacts where a vehicle’s airbags “or other non-reversible pyrotechnic restraints” are deployed. The company also says that if FSD was active “at any point within five seconds leading up to a collision event,” then it includes that crash in this dataset.\n“This calculation ensures that our reported collision rates for FSD (Supervised) capture not only collisions that occur while the system is actively controlling the vehicle, but also scenarios where a driver may disengage the system or where the system aborts on its own shortly before impact,” Tesla says.\nIn its FAQ section, Tesla states that it will update the data every quarter and that it will “reflect a rolling twelve-month aggregation of miles and collisions in an effort to remain relevant to recent trends and progress.” The company says it won’t release other information, like injury rates, because it is collecting this data automatically from the vehicles.\n“Instead, Tesla focuses on objective and programmatic metrics such as collision frequency and airbag deployment rates. Airbag deployments serve as a reliable proxy for collision severity,” the company writes.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

The single patent in this case expired in 2022, and is specific to historic patient monitoring technology from decades ago.”\nThe legal dispute between Masimo and Apple focuses on pulse oximetry, which uses an optical sensor to detect blood flow. Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees — including its chief medical officer — and infringing its patents on pulse oximetry technology. \nThe U.S. International Trade Commission sided by Masimo in 2023, banning Apple from importing Apple Watches with blood oxygen monitoring features — which is why Apple Watches have not supported blood oxygen monitoring in recent years.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThen Apple announced in August of this year that it’s introducing a new version of the feature designed to circumvent the ban, with blood oxygen readings measured and calculated on the user’s paired iPhone, rather than the Apple Watch itself.\nMasimo is suing U.S. Customs and Border Patrol for approving the import of Apple Watches with the new blood oxygen implementation, while Apple has asked an appeals court to overturn the import ban.\nApple also countersued Masimo, winning the statutory minimum payment of $250 when a jury found that Masimo had violated Apple design patents.\nThis post has been updated with more details from Apple’s statement.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nAndy Konwinski is concerned that the U.S. is losing its dominance in AI research to China, calling the shift an “existential” threat to democracy. Konwinski is a Databricks co-founder and the co-founder of the AI research and venture capital firm Laude.\n“If you talk to PhD students at Berkeley and Stanford in AI right now, they’ll tell you that they’ve read twice as many interesting AI ideas in the last year that were from Chinese companies than American companies,” Konwinski said onstage at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit this week.  \nIn addition to investing through Laude, the venture fund he launched last year with NEA veteran Pete Sonsini and Antimatter CEO Andrew Krioukov, Konwinski also runs the Laude Institute, an accelerator that offers grants to researchers.\nMajor AI labs, including OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic, continue to innovate significantly, yet their innovations remain largely proprietary rather than open source. Moreover, these companies are sucking up top academic talent by offering multimillion-dollar salaries that dwarf what these experts can earn in universities.\nKonwinski argued that for ideas to truly flourish, they need to be freely exchanged and discussed with the larger academic community. He pointed out that generative AI emerged as a direct result of the Transformer architecture, a pivotal training technique introduced in a freely available research paper.\n“The first nation that makes the next ‘Transformer architectural level’ breakthrough will have the advantage,” Konwinski said.\nKonwinski argues that in China, the government supports and encourages AI innovation, whether from labs like DeepSeek or Alibaba’s Qwen, to be open sourced, which allows others to build upon them and which, he contends, will inevitably lead to more breakthroughs.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe believes this stands in stark contrast to the U.S., where, as he puts it, “the diffusion of scientists talking to scientists that we always have had in the United States, it’s dried up.”\nKonwinski argues that this trend poses not only a risk to democracy but also a business threat to major U.S. AI labs. “We’re eating our corn seeds; the fountain is drying up. Fast-forward five years, the big labs are gonna lose too,” he said. “We need to make sure the United States stays number one and open.” \n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFlatpay, which facilitates card payments for SMBs, has joined the ranks of European fintech unicorns — or startups valued at more than $1 billion — a milestone that has driven some of the region’s biggest exits. These include competitors like Adyen, a Dutch payment processing giant that remains far ahead in scale. However, Flatpay’s fresh funding could help it narrow the gap.\nFlatpay’s bet is that it can challenge larger players by charging small merchants a flat transaction rate to use its card terminals and point-of-sales systems. This focus on a segment that accounts for 99% of European businesses has driven rapid traction: the startup now claims around 60,000 customers, up from 7,000 in April 2024.\nFlatpay’s own valuation has grown at a similarly fast pace. Now valued at €1.5 billion ($1.75 billion), the Danish startup reached unicorn status in only three years. But while CEO and co-founder Sander Janca-Jensen is proud of this accomplishment, he has his eyes on another metric: annual recurring revenue (ARR).\n“We crossed €100 million of ARR in October,” Janca-Jensen told TechCrunch. He added that this amount (approximately $116 million) is increasing by nearly €1 million a day ($1.16 million). “The plan for 2026 is to grow another 300%, so hopefully leave the year with between €400 and €500 million of ARR.” \nTo fund this ambitious growth — since the startup is still unprofitable — Flatpay raised €145 million in its latest round (approximately $169 million). The round was backed by AVP Growth and Smash Capital, as well as Dawn Capital, which had led the startup’s €$47 million Series B. German soccer player Mario Götze also participated in that previous round. \nThe newly raised capital will support continued growth in Flatpay’s current markets — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K. — as well as further expansion into one or two new markets next year. Janca-Jensen declined to reveal which ones, but job postings suggest that the Netherlands may be next.\nFlatpay currently has 1,500 staffers — or “flatpayers” — and plans to double by the end of next year. Increasing headcount is a goal the company puts on the same level as revenue, stating in a press release that it aims to grow both by 10x by 2029. This may seem unusual, but they go hand-in-hand for the company, which onboards its customers in person.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis stems from its hypothesis that SMB owners actively look for new solutions, even if their current systems are overpriced or insufficient. “That’s where we come in the door,” Janca-Jensen said. He means this literally — Flatpay shows up with pen and paper to explain its pricing, and with card terminals for instant demos. “Every sales person has that suitcase.”\nFlatpay’s demo kit.Image Credits:Flatpay\nThis hands-on approach is what might help Flatpay increase its share of a market that is also coveted by legacy providers, large fintech players like PayPal, Stripe and SumUp, as well as new entrants focusing on specific sectors, such as hospitality. But the real differentiator might be the insight behind it: SMBs want simplicity, and Flatpay leaves them “ready to go.”\nWhile this makes for higher customer acquisition costs than average, especially when combined with 24/7 customer support, Janca-Jensen said that creating demand allows the startup to grow much faster than it would otherwise. In turn, this triple-digit growth makes Flatpay’s emphasis on human interaction much more palatable to investors, even during today’s AI-obsessed investing cycle.\nThe company isn’t ignoring AI entirely — it uses the technology for real-time features and is experimenting with voice AI agents. Flatpay is also planning to expand further into fintech with a banking suite that would include cards and accounts. For Janca-Jensen, the key is gradual adoption — so that instead of getting overwhelmed, SMB owners can “eat the elephant one bite at a time.”\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nAccording to a new report from the International Energy Agency, the world will spend $580 billion on data centers this year — $40 billion more than will be spent finding new oil supplies.\nThose numbers help to illustrate some big shifts in the global economy, and comparing data centers and oil seems particularly apt given concerns about how generative AI might accelerate climate change.\nKirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed the report’s findings on the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast.\nThere’s no question that these new data centers are going to be hungry for power, and that they could place even more stress on already taxed electrical grids. But Kirsten pointed to a potential upside, with solar poised to power many of these new projects, which could also create new opportunities for startups pursuing innovative approaches to renewable energy.\nWe also discussed how these projects will be funded, with OpenAI saying it has committed  $1.4 trillion to building data centers, Meta committing $600 billion, and Anthropic recently announcing a $50 billion data center plan.\nYou can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.\nKirsten: Here’s what I think is the potential upside. So Tim De Chant, who’s our climate tech reporter, has done a ton of reporting about not just data centers, but actually how a lot of data centers are turning to renewables because in terms of regulatory [hurdles] and cost, they are the go-to. It’s a lot easier to get a permit to throw up a bunch of solar panels adjacent to a data center.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo to me, the one upside is that it could really mean a positive for any kind of company that is doing interesting things around renewables or data center design and some of the technology to reduce the global emissions component of it.\nBut of course, the sheer number to me is what really stood out. As a former energy reporter myself, I know how much is spent on trying to find new oil.\nRebecca: I mean, it’s a lot. And a lot of that’s coming from the U.S. I think that report found that half of the electricity demand will be coming from the U.S., and the rest is a mix of China and Europe.\nAnd another thing that struck me about it was that most of the data centers are coming to cities, or near cities, like populations of a million people, roughly. So that means there’s a lot more challenge with the grid connection and with connection pathways. I think that, to your point, renewables will have to [be a focus] — it’s just good business, it’s not because of any environmentally friendly policies.\nKirsten: Redwood Materials’ new business unit, Redwood Energy, is going to be an interesting company to watch with this. A few months ago, I went to their big reveal, and they’re taking the old EV batteries that aren’t quite ready to be recycled, and then they’re creating these microgrids, and then specifically going after AI data centers. And that, to me, would alleviate the problem or the concern that you just mentioned.\nThe question is: Are other companies going to do this? Are there other Redwood Energies out there that are trying to do the same thing? And how much of an impact could they make? Because I do think that like the pressure on the electrical grid, especially during certain times of the year, like in the middle of the summer, for instance, places like Texas that have rolling brownouts and blackouts, that is going to be a real concern. And it could spur a whole new kind of investment into companies doing what Redwood is doing.\nAnthony: It also underlines this question about what is that going to do to the spaces that we live in? Even if they’re not in cities themselves, I feel like the landscape is definitely going to be transformed by construction at this scale.\nAnd then, of course, there’s also this question of how much of [the planned data centers are]  actually going to get built because there’s definitely very ambitious plans that require huge amounts of spending.\nTo start with OpenAI, that’s a company that a lot of people have been talking about, how much money are they actually making versus the trillions of dollars of capital commitments they have for the next decade. And then there was this whole controversy over their CFO saying, “The government should backstop our loans to build these data centers.” And then she’s like, “No, no, no, no, no, I didn’t mean backstop, that was a poor choice of words,” but it does look like they have been asking for an expansion of tax credits from the CHIPS Act. \nI think that this is going to be an effort that’s not just going to fall on the companies, but also on the government — or at least that’s going to be a question that the government is considering over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nLet’s be honest, most tech wearables are bulky and not exactly what you’d describe as pretty. But when you’re regularly wearing something on your hands, you probably want it to look nice and perhaps even blend in with the rest of your jewelry. That’s the idea behind Oura’s newest smart ring, the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic.\nThe Ring 4 Ceramic is Oura’s first collection of smart rings that doesn’t feature metallic finishes. Instead, they’re made from zirconia ceramic, a more wear-resistant material that, Oura says, delivers both style and comfort.  \nI’ve tested the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic for the past three weeks, and here’s what I’ve found.  \nBefore diving into the specifics, it’s worth noting that since the software behind the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is the same as the Oura Ring 4, I won’t be delving too deeply into the software and hardware side of things. For that, you can check out our Oura Ring 4 review.  \nFinish and feel \nThe Oura Ring 4 Ceramic comes in four colors: Midnight (dark blue), Cloud (white), Tide (light teal), and Petal (light pink). The ring costs $150 more than the starting price of the standard Ring 4, with a $500 price tag, and is available in sizes 4-15.  \nI opted for Midnight. Although the shade is technically dark blue, it can appear black from afar — or even a dark shade of green, I’ve been told. The ring doesn’t look like a tech wearable at first glance, which is nice if you want to prioritize aesthetics without sacrificing functionality.\nImage Credits:Oura\nWhen compared to the original Ring 4, the Ceramic version slightly thicker, but the difference is hardly noticeable. The titanium version is 2.88 mm thick, while the ceramic version measures 3.51 mm.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs for the weight, the ring can weigh between 5.1 and 8.1 grams, depending on the size you get, making it heavier than the Titanium Ring 4, which weighs between 3.3 and 5.2 grams.\nDespite the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic being thicker and heavier than its predecessor, I found it to be comfortable and lightweight, even when compared to a standard metal band. It feels like a regular ring, just marginally thicker.\nThe ring is smooth and not as prone to collecting fingerprints as the titanium versions of the Ring 4. Since the zirconia ceramic is warmer and less slick than the titanium rings, the Ring 4 Ceramic can feel a somewhat “sticky” at times, meaning the outside of the ring might cling to the sides of your fingers, but I adjusted to the feel of the ring pretty quickly.  \nOura says the color on the rings comes from natural minerals in the ceramic itself, so it stays vibrant and doesn’t fade over time. (Of course, I’ve only had the ring for three weeks, so I can’t speak to its long-term durability, but so far, the color is identical to what it was on day one.)\nDurability \nOura says the Ring 4 Ceramic is prone to scuffs from softer metals, like those found in cookware or dumbbells. The company says these scuffs can be addressed with the Polishing Pad that comes with the ring. (The review unit I received from Oura did not include the Polishing Pad, however.)\nThe company also recommends wearing the ring on your non-dominant hand to avoid unnecessary impact. However, the ring just felt right on my dominant index finger, so that’s where I wore it for the past three weeks. This exposed it to more potential damage in a briefer period of time than a typical customer might experience.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch/Aisha Malik\nThe first day I put on the ring, I put it through a busy travel day to TechCrunch Disrupt, our annual conference in San Francisco. I wasn’t sure how well the ring would hold up with me hauling my luggage around, accidentally hitting the ring on a few counters (I’m clumsy!), or letting it brush against the airplane window when I leaned in for a nap.  \nAs it turned out, the ring made it through all of that unscathed. There were even a handful of moments when I was certain I had scratched it — like when I was holding on to a rusty railing walking up the steps of the Point Arena Lighthouse, forgetting that I had the ring on, or when I forgot to remove it before doing the dishes. But the ring didn’t end up with any marks or permanent damage.\nIt’s worth mentioning that although the ring is water-resistant up to 100 meters, which means you can wear it while doing the dishes or showering, I took it off while doing the dishes because Oura warns that the ring can scuff when it comes into contact with softer metals.\nSince I’ve had less than a month with the ring, I wouldn’t be surprised if, further down the line, it collected at least some scuffs or dents, especially given its location on my dominant hand.\nFinal thoughts  \nBeyond aesthetics, the ring was quite useful in helping me understand my heart health, sleep, and stress through the Oura app. Each morning, I found myself looking forward to seeing my “readiness score,” which is calculated using both short-term and long-term metrics to show how prepared you are for the day ahead.\nAdditionally, the battery life is holding up well, as I’ve only had to charge it once per week, which is consistent with Oura’s promise of a battery that lasts between five and eight days.\nChoosing between a titanium and a ceramic ring ultimately depends on your aesthetic preferences and your ideal price point. With color and material being the only differences between the two, it really comes down to whether you want a sleek, modern finish or the standard metal smart ring look. \nIf you want that pop of color and style, then the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic might be the smart ring for you.  \n",

The news was first reported by Wired, then confirmed by OpenAI in a blog post. \nDresser’s new role comes after more than 14 years at Salesforce, Slack’s parent company. While at Slack, Dresser oversaw the introduction of several AI features.\nOpenAI says that Dresser will be responsible for the company’s revenue strategy in enterprise and customer success. That’s a pivotal role, given that the company has a rocky road ahead if it ever wants to turn a profit.\n“We’re on a path to put AI tools into the hands of millions of workers, across every industry,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of Applications, said in a statement. “Denise has led that kind of shift before, and her experience will help us make AI useful, reliable, and accessible for businesses everywhere.”\nLike Dresser, Simo also joined OpenAI this year after a long track record of high-profile leadership, most recently as CEO of Instacart, which has become a close partner of OpenAI.\nAccording to Wired, Slack’s chief product officer, Rob Seaman, will become interim CEO of Slack.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed; however, The Wall Street Journal reported that the deal is for three years.\nAccenture confirmed the deal is for three years but declined to comment on financials. TechCrunch reached out to Anthropic for more information. \nThe two companies are forming the Accenture Anthropic Business Group. This will include formal Claude training for Accenture’s 30,000 employees. Anthropic’s Claude Code coding tools will be available for Accenture’s tens of thousands of developers. They are also launching a joint initiative to help chief investment officers track their return on investment for AI.\nThis announcement comes as Anthropic’s market share within enterprise continues to grow.\nA new report from Menlo Ventures shows that Anthropic holds 40% of the market share within enterprise and 54% of the market share when it comes to coding. This marks a bump from Menlo’s previous survey this summer, where Anthropic held 32% of the enterprise market share.\nAnthropic announced a $200 million deal with cloud data company Snowflake last week. The company also announced sizable and similar AI partnerships with both Deloitte and IBM in October.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

One of its weapons to stave off those threats is a partnership with French automaker Renault Group.\nThe two automakers announced an agreement Tuesday to bring two affordable Ford-branded electric vehicles to the European market in 2028. Ford will lead the design and Renault will assemble the vehicles at its factory in northern France. The EVs will be built on Renault’s technology platform known as Ampere.\nThe companies have also agreed to “explore” making light commercial vehicles together. \nThe partnership is part of what Ford has described as the next phase of its European transformation — a plan that aims to make the U.S. automaker more agile and cost-efficient in a market teeming with cheaper Chinese vehicles from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor.\n“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” said Farley in a statement. “How we compete here — how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n",

This includes specialized templates with preset music and text overlays, as well as a redesigned video editor.\nThe new templates are currently rolling out on Android devices and allow users to choose from preset music and text to produce a professional-looking highlight reel in seconds. Users simply select a template and then handpick the photos and videos they want to add. Google Photos will automatically generate a video that aligns with the beat of the music.\nThe update also makes creating highlight reels in the app quicker and more straightforward. Highlight reels are collections of clips and photos from a user’s gallery, such as moments from a memorable vacation or birthday celebration. To create a highlight reel, users can go to the Create tab and click on “Highlight Video.”\nImage Credits:Google\nIn addition, the company introduced a newly redesigned video editor, available on both Android and iOS devices. \nThe new editor is intended to be more user-friendly, featuring a “universal timeline” that allows users to view all video clips and other content in one place. It also includes an “adaptive canvas” that adjusts the editing interface according to the user’s needs or the specific project. \nAlso, with this new editor, users can incorporate music and text into a single video clip.\nThe company says the redesigned editor will now serve as the default video editing tool on Android. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Google\nAnother new feature is the option to explore Photos’ music library to find the ideal soundtrack for highlight videos.

    "body": "\nPhoto-editing app VSCO has confirmed that it has laid off 24 employees amid a restructuring drive to refocus the company’s efforts toward creating tools for professional photographers.\nIn an internal memo seen by TechCrunch, VSCO’s CEO Eric Wittman said the company’s consumer business had declined more than expected, and some of its new growth initiatives didn’t yield the expected results. He noted that the company had been EBITDA-positive for three of the past four years. And despite a decline in consumer business, other lines saw growth, even if it was not to the company’s liking. In the memo, he also claimed that VSCO’s core app is installed on more U.S. devices than Reddit.\nThe company told TechCrunch that the layoffs impacted its marketing, tech, and program management teams.\n“Last week, VSCO said goodbye to 24 employees as a result of a company restructure [sic],” Wittman said in an emailed statement. “Valued members across all departments were impacted. Every person leaving has contributed meaningfully to VSCO and our mission, and we are deeply grateful for their impact. The company is restructuring and adjusting internal operations to be more efficient and effective in delivering long-term success and value for photographers.” \n“To succeed over the next 5 years, we need to operate as an AI-native company, taking bold but focused bets and strengthening the foundation we’ve built through our Pro business, AI Lab, TFP, and Sites,” Wittman wrote in the memo.\nVSCO said that to power growth, it wants to increase brand awareness as well as work on AI-powered features across the line. The company plans to work on a revamped “AI native” editor, and build an AI assistant that could help users complete tasks across its tools. The startup also plans to redesign its public Photo Galleries feature, which lets photographers curate their portfolio and showcase their work.\nLast year, VSCO launched a marketplace to connect photographers and brands for projects. This year, VSCO focused on shipping AI-powered products such as Canvas for collaboration and new editing features.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs consumer apps like Canva, Google Photos, and Adobe Lightroom focus on adding AI features to their products, it appears VSCO may have realized that instead of AI chops, carving a niche for itself by providing better tools and a dedicated platform for pro photographers would be a good strategy.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon has long had to deal with the reality that owners of its Echo smart speakers weren’t using its voice-controlled assistant, Alexa, to buy things, as it had hoped. The tech giant hasn’t given up on that dream yet: Its AI assistant, Alexa+, is getting new shopping-enabled features in the U.S. and Canada from today, including a shopping hub, tools to add items to recent orders, and personalized recommendations.\nThe company has already been working on features that make Alexa+ more of a shopping assistant with abilities like automated deal tracking and automatic purchases. The former feature lets you set Alexa to alert you when items in your cart or list drop below a certain price point. If you also have automatic purchases set up, Alexa can immediately order an item when it reaches that target price.\nNow, Amazon says it’s turning its Echo devices with a screen — the Echo Show 15 and 21 — into a shopping hub with an interface that it’s calling the “Shopping Essentials” experience. From this dashboard, Amazon shoppers can track deliveries in real time, see information about recent orders, get reminders about household essentials they need to reorder, and view their shopping list and saved items.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe screen would also let shoppers tap to see more products and add items directly to their cart and then check out.\nTo access the new experience, Amazon users can say “Alexa, where’s my stuff?” or “Open Shopping Essentials.” Soon, a shopping widget will be available to add to the Echo device’s home screen, too. \nAnother new feature rolling out now will allow Alexa device owners to add items to an upcoming delivery at any time until the item leaves the warehouse. This builds on a similar feature recently added to Amazon’s retail website and app, so it isn’t necessarily an Alexa+ exclusive, but the feature wasn’t live on Alexa devices so far.\nAlexa+ is also gaining the ability to recommend gifts. You’ll be able to describe who you’re shopping for, or the occasion, and Alexa+ will display product suggestions on the screen, organized into categories.\nAmazon says Alexa+ is now available to “tens of millions” of customers, and these new features are live for users in the U.S. and Canada. While not everyone has been happy with Alexa+, the company says the percentage of users who downgraded back to the AI-free interface remains in the “very low single digits.”\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nRivian has spent nearly two years building its own AI assistant, an effort that remains separate from its multi-billion dollar technology joint venture with Volkswagen, TechCrunch has learned.\nRivian hasn’t revealed when it will put the AI assistant in consumers hands. However, in an interview earlier this year, Rivian’s software chief Wassym Bensaid told TechCrunch it was targeting the end of the year. The company will likely share more during its upcoming AI and Autonomy day, which will be live streamed starting at 9 am PT December 11.\nRivian’s plans are reflective of the moment as the pace of development from foundational AI companies– the tech giants and startups like Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI that are building the core models and infrastructure — accelerates and industries scramble to keep up. \nBut as Bensaid noted to TechCrunch earlier this year, this isn’t some slapdash effort to stay on trend. Nor is it simply a chatbot thrown into the infotainment system. The company has put considerable thought, resources, and time into the product, Bensaid said, noting that its designed to be integrated with all vehicle controls.\nThe company started with an underlying philosophy to build an overall architecture that is model and platform agnostic, according to Bensaid. The Rivian AI assistant team, which is based out the company’s Palo Alto office, soon realized effort and attention should also be directed towards developing the software layers that help coordinate various workflows as well as the control logic that resolves conflicts.\n“And that’s the in-vehicle platform we have built,” Bensaid said. “We use what the industry loves to now call an agentic framework; but we thought about that architecture since very early so that we can interface with different models.”\nThe in-house AI assistant program is consistent with Rivian’s push to become more vertically integrated. In 2024, Rivian overhauled its flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV, changing everything from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, sensor stack, and software user interface. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has also put considerable resources towards developing and improving its own software stack, which includes everything related to real-time operating systems (RTOS) that manage the car, such as thermal dynamics, ADAS and safety systems, as well as another layer related to the infotainment system.\nBensaid didn’t provide detailed information about the AI assistant, but he did say it includes a mix of models that handle specific tasks. The result is a hybrid software stack that combines edge AI, where tasks are handled on the device, and cloud AI, in which large models that require more compute are handled by remote servers.\nThis should mean a flexible, customized AI assistant that splits the workload between the edge and cloud.\nRivian developed much of the AI software stack in house, including its own custom models and the “orchestration layer,” the conductor or traffic cop of sorts that makes sure the various AI models work together. Rivian tapped other companies for specific agentic AI functions.\nThe mission is to develop an AI assistant that increases customer trust and engagement, Bensaid said.\nFor now, the AI assistant is staying within Rivian. The company’s joint venture with Volkswagen is focused on software, but not an AI assistant or anything to do with automated driving.\nThe technology joint venture with Volkswagen, which was announced in 2024 and is worth up to $5.8 billion, is centered on the underlying electrical architecture and zonal compute, and infotainment. The joint venture officially kicked off in November 2024 and is expected to supply the electrical architecture and software for Volkswagen Group as early as 2027.\nAutonomy and AI are separate for now, but “It doesn’t mean that it may not be in the future,” Bensaid said.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nEven as Big Tech and American tech elites criticize how the European Union is implementing rules to regulate tech and AI on the continent, the bloc isn’t letting competition concerns slide. The European Commission has launched an investigation into whether Google may have breached EU’s competition laws by using content from websites without compensating owners to generate answers for its AI summaries that appear above search results.\nThe EC also will look at how AI summaries use videos from YouTube to generate answers. The investigation will examine if Google is harming competition in the AI market by granting itself access to websites’ content, and imposing “unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators.”\n“The Commission will investigate to what extent the generation of AI Overviews and AI Mode by Google is based on web publishers’ content without appropriate compensation for that, and without the possibility for publishers to refuse without losing access to Google Search,” the bloc’s executive arm wrote in a statement.\nGoogle’s AI Overview and AI Mode are the two chief products being investigated here, and the EC highlights that the tech giant doesn’t leave websites or content producers with much choice since it directs a majority of web traffic, doesn’t pay them for using their content, and doesn’t allow YouTube uploads if you don’t let Google use that data.\nThe EU is also concerned over the fact that Google doesn’t allow rival AI companies to use YouTube content to train their own AI models. \n“This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”\nThe investigation comes at a time when companies developing AI models and content are being sued for copyright infringement by publishers and websites. AI search tool Perplexity, for one, has been sued by several  outlets, including The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, News Corp, New York Post, Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, and Reddit.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe EU’s investigation differs, however, because in many cases, these media companies are suing as a way to negotiate content-licensing deals with AI firms in hopes of compensating creators and being paid for their content. The EU is seeking to level the playing field for AI companies that compete with Google, which according to some reports, benefits from its reach by being able to train its AI models on much more of the internet than its rivals.\nUnder consistent and widespread criticism of its AI regulation, however, the EU is considering simplifying its AI rules, and has proposed to delay the implementation of rules for the use of AI in high-risk applications.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

The other model has an in-lens display — which is only visible to the person wearing the glasses — that can show turn-by-turn directions or closed captioning. \nGoogle also shared a preview of the wired XR glasses from Xreal called Project Aura. This model situates itself between a bulky headset and an unobtrusive pair of glasses. Beyond just an in-lens display, the Project Aura glasses can function as an extended workplace or entertainment device, allowing the user to use Google’s suite of products or stream video as they would in a more advanced headset.\nWhile Meta has gotten off to an early lead in smart glasses development, Google now joins Apple and Snap among the companies expected to challenge Meta with their own hardware next year.\nMeta’s smart glasses have caught on in part thanks to its partnership with Ray-Ban, and it sells these products in retail stores. Google’s partnership with Warby Parker seems like it will follow a similar strategy, committing $75 million thus far to support the eyewear company’s product development and commercialization costs. If Warby Parker meets certain milestones, Google will commit an additional $75 million and take an equity stake in the brand.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nTruecaller has launched a household-level scam-protection feature as the Swedish company broadens its role beyond caller ID in response to the rising number of fraud attempts that target multiple members of a home.\nThe new feature, called Family Protection, lets up to five people join a family group overseen by one member who acts as the administrator and manages scam-blocking settings for the others. Family Protection is initially rolling out as a pilot for Android and iOS users in Sweden, Chile, Malaysia, and Kenya.\nTruecaller said the feature is designed so that the more digitally confident person in a household can handle scam controls on behalf of less tech-savvy family members.\nOn Android, the family administrator can receive alerts during suspected scam calls; view basic device status, including battery level; and remotely end calls flagged as fraudulent, the company said.\nScam activity has been rising worldwide as more people come online. That activity has exploded in markets where first-time smartphone users and older adults are more exposed to fraud. Countries, including India, have reported sharp increases in impersonation attempts and multi-step schemes that exploit gaps in digital familiarity. Truecaller plans to address this with its new feature, which will expand into additional key regions, including India, in the first quarter of 2026.\nImage Credits:Truecaller\nTruecaller CEO Rishit Jhunjhunwala told TechCrunch the company has seen scammers shift from targeting individuals to entire households, with schemes unfolding through a sequence of calls, messages, missed-call triggers, and impersonation attempts directed at multiple family members to find a vulnerable entry point. The trend prompted the launch of the multi-user protection system, he said.\nFamily Protection is available as a free feature to users. However, if the family administrator upgrades to a Premium Family plan, all members get an ad-free experience along with stronger spam defense and automatic rejection of high-risk calls, the company stated.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWith a user base of more than 450 million worldwide, Truecaller detects about 63 million scam attempts a day, allowing it to track shifts in fraud schemes in real time. The company says its community also reports around 166 million spam calls daily, creating one of the largest datasets of phone-based fraud activity globally.\nHowever, Truecaller faces new competition in India, its largest market, as the government there starts trials of a Caller Name Presentation system that will display the name registered with telecom providers on incoming calls. Truecaller has been adding features that go beyond caller ID, including Family Protection, as it adapts to regulatory and market changes in India and other key markets.\n“With Family Protection, one person’s vigilance now strengthens safety for up to five family members,” said Jhunjhunwala, adding that the company aims to extend protection without requiring additional effort from users.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNASA and the United States Postal Service have stopped using electric vans made by now-bankrupt EV startup Canoo, despite the former CEO’s claim that he would provide support for the vehicles.\nNASA purchased three of Canoo’s EVs in 2023 with the intention of using the vans to shuttle astronauts to the launchpad for its Artemis missions to the moon. The space agency told TechCrunch that Canoo “was no longer able to meet our mission requirements.” As of October, NASA said it is leasing the Airstream-built “Astrovan” from Boeing that the aerospace company commissioned for its own crewed space missions.\nMeanwhile, the USPS said in an emailed statement the six vehicles it purchased “for evaluation purposes” in 2024 “are no longer in use.” The “evaluation has been completed,” the postal service wrote, and “no further investments are anticipated.” The USPS declined to share any details or final results of the evaluation.\nCanoo also provided at least one demonstration vehicle to the Department of Defense (DOD) before its bankruptcy. The DOD did not respond to emailed requests about whether it has continued using the van.\nCanoo filed for bankruptcy in January 2025 after years of financial struggles and failing to establish a market for its electric vans. Soon after, former CEO Tony Aquila made a $4 million bid for the startup’s assets in March. Aquila told the bankruptcy trustee that a “principal motivation” for buying the assets was his “desire to honor [Canoo’s] commitment to provide service and support for certain government programs.”\nNASA and the USPS declined to share whether Aquila ever approached either agency about supporting the vehicles. Aquila did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer who represented Aquila in the bankruptcy proceedings also did not respond. \nThe bankruptcy judge approved the sale to Aquila in April. He was not the only entity interested in buying the company’s assets, though. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs many as eight parties signed NDAs to evaluate Canoo’s intellectual property, prototypes, and equipment, the bankruptcy trustee said at the time. A lawyer for Canoo said a handful of those parties came close to making a bid. One was Harbinger, a California-based electric trucking company that was created by former Canoo employees in 2021. Another was a mysterious financier from the U.K. named Charles Garson.\nHarbinger, at the time, had accused Canoo of hiding assets from the sale process. It also claimed the bankruptcy trustee had “unfairly favored Mr. Aquila” by accepting his offer without widely marketing the bankrupt company’s assets. Garson claimed to be willing to pay as much as $20 million for Canoo’s assets, but the judge ultimately decided the investor did not formalize his bid in time.\nThe trustee and lawyers for Canoo argued that Aquila presented the best and most firm bid. They also claimed one of the other potential bidders — though they never specified who — could have raised concerns with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States because of its “foreign ownership.” Lawyers for Aquila and Canoo flagged this as a particular problem in light of the contracts with NASA, the USPS, and the DOD. Harbinger and Garson declined to comment. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nIndia has proposed a mandatory royalty system for AI companies that train their models on copyrighted content — a move that could reshape how OpenAI and Google operate in what has already become one of their most important and fastest-growing markets globally.\nOn Tuesday, India’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade released a proposed framework that would give AI companies access to all copyrighted works for training in exchange for paying royalties to a new collecting body composed of rights-holding organizations, with payments then distributed to creators. The proposal argues that this “mandatory blanket license” would lower compliance costs for AI firms while ensuring that writers, musicians, artists, and other rights holders are compensated when their work is scraped to train commercial models.\nIndia’s proposal comes amid mounting concerns in global markets over how AI companies train their models on copyrighted material, a practice that has triggered lawsuits from authors, news organizations, artists, and other rights holders in the U.S. and Europe. Courts and regulators are still weighing whether such training qualifies as fair use, leaving AI firms operating under legal uncertainty and allowing them to rapidly expand their business without clear regulations.\nUnlike the U.S. and the European Union, where policymakers are debating transparency obligations and fair-use boundaries, India is proposing one of the most interventionist approaches yet by giving AI companies automatic access to copyrighted material in exchange for mandatory payment. \nThe eight-member committee, formed by the Indian government in late April, argues the system would avoid years of legal uncertainty while ensuring creators are compensated from the outset.\nDefending the system, the committee says in a 125-page submission (PDF) that a blanket license “aims to provide an easy access to content for AI developers… reduce transaction costs… [and] ensure fair compensation for rightsholders,” calling it the least burdensome way to manage large-scale AI training. The submission adds that the single collecting body would function as a “single window,” eliminating the need for individual negotiations and enabling royalties to flow to both registered and unregistered creators.\nThe committee also points to India’s growing importance as a market for GenAI tools. Citing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s remark that India is the company’s second-largest market after the U.S. and “may well become our largest,” it argues that because AI firms derive significant revenue from Indian users while relying on Indian creators’ work to train their models, a portion of that value should flow back to those creators. That, it says, is part of the rationale for establishing a “balanced framework” that guarantees compensation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIndia’s proposal lands amid intensifying legal battles worldwide over whether AI companies can lawfully use copyrighted material to train their models. \nIn India, news agency ANI sued OpenAI in the Delhi High Court, arguing its articles were used without permission — a case that has prompted the court to examine whether AI training is itself an act of reproduction or protected by “fair dealing.” Courts in the U.S. and Europe are confronting similar disputes, with creators alleging that tech companies have built their models on unlicensed content.\nAI proposal sees pushback and dissent \nNot everyone is convinced by the Indian government’s proposed model, though. \nNasscom, the industry body representing technology firms, including Google and Microsoft, filed a formal dissent arguing that India should instead adopt a broad text-and-data-mining exception that would allow AI developers to train on copyrighted content as long as the material is lawfully accessed. It warned that a mandatory licensing regime could slow innovation and said rightsholders who object should be allowed to opt out rather than force companies to pay for all training data.\nThe Business Software Alliance, which represents global tech firms, including Adobe, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft, pressed the Indian government to avoid a purely licensing-based regime. It urged India to introduce an explicit text-and-data-mining exception, arguing that “relying solely on direct or statutory licensing for AI training data may be impractical and may not yield the best outcomes.”\nLimiting AI models to smaller sets of licensed or public-domain material, BSA warned, could reduce model quality and “increase the risk that outputs simply reflect trends and biases of the limited training data sets,” adding that a clear TDM exception would better balance innovation and rights holders’ interests.\nThe committee did not consider both a broad text-and-data-mining exception and an opt-out model, arguing that such systems either undermine copyright protections or are impossible to enforce. Instead, it proposed a “hybrid model” that would grant AI firms automatic access to all lawfully available copyrighted works while requiring them to pay royalties into the central collecting body that distributes the proceeds to creators.\nThe Indian government has now opened the proposal for public consultation, giving companies and other stakeholders 30 days to submit their comments. After reviewing the feedback, the committee will finalize its recommendations before the framework is taken up by the government.\nOpenAI and Google did not respond to requests for comments.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

Boom said it will announce more details about a turbine factory next year, with first deliveries occurring in 2027.\nTo commercialize its Superpower stationary turbine, Boom raised $300 million in a round led by Darsana Capital Partners with participation from Altimeter Capital, Ark Invest, Bessemer Venture Partners, Robinhood Ventures, and Y Combinator. \nProfits from the sale of Superpower units will go toward funding continued development of the company’s Overture supersonic aircraft, Boom founder and CEO Blake Scholl told TechCrunch.\nIt’s an arrangement that Scholl likens to SpaceX’s Starlink satellite constellation. The satellite internet service is reportedly profitable, helping the company to bankroll the development of its rockets.\n“I’ve been kind of keeping my eyes open for 10 years for what could be our Starlink,” he said. “I said no to a thousand things because I concluded they were distractions. This one we’re saying yes to because it’s so clearly on path.”\nBoom said Superpower and its airborne engine called Symphony share 80% of their parts. Earlier this year, Boom’s XB-1 demonstrator was the first civil aircraft developed by a private company to break the sound barrier.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCrusoe is paying $1,033 per kilowatt of generating capacity. For that, Boom will deliver the turbines, generators, control systems, and preventative maintenance. Crusoe will have to provide everything else, including pollution controls, electrical connections, and so on.\nThat’s on the higher side for that type of power plant. A typical airplane-derived — or aeroderivative — turbine costs around $1,600 per kilowatt, a price that also includes pollution controls, engineering, construction, land acquisition, permitting, pipelines, and more.\nIn a typical project, the turbine and pollution controls contribute about 46% of a project’s total cost. Applying that percentage to Boom’s figures would likely push the total cost to over $2,000 per kilowatt. That’s pricey for a simple-cycle gas turbine and more in line with costs for combined-cycle gas turbines slated to come online in the early 2030s.\nBoom’s Superpower is targeting 39% efficiency, similar to competitors. Combined cycle turbines can recover heat from the exhaust to boost efficiency above 60%.\nBoom is also developing a “field upgrade” to convert its turbines from simple cycle to combined cycle, Scholl said. Operators could do so today using existing combined-cycle kits, though adding them would require longer installation times. “Those combined-cycle plants tend to be construction projects,” he said.\nLike other aeroderivative turbine generators, Superpower will be delivered in a shipping container, and developers like Crusoe will be responsible for electrical and gas hookups in addition to pollution controls. \nScholl said the power plants should be “no louder” than existing aeroderivative turbines, though that’s not exactly quiet: Residents near xAI’s Colossus data center report hearing similarly sized turbines from at least half a mile away. \nThe first few stationary turbines will be made at Boom’s existing facilities while the company builds a larger factory. The goal is to produce 1 gigawatts’ worth in 2028, 2 gigawatts’ worth in 2029, and 4 gigawatts’ worth in 2030. If Boom can hit those numbers, it would represent a significant expansion in the turbines available to be deployed.\nBoom still has a challenging few years ahead of it. If the company can pull it off, supersonic commercial flights could happen sooner than even Boom expected. But scaling production is never easy, and many startups have struggled to cross the valley of death that separates early-stage hardware companies from their commercial peers.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMicrosoft plans to invest $17.5 billion in India over the next four years, expanding its AI and cloud footprint in the South Asian nation, whose vast online and smartphone user base is turning it into a critical battleground for global tech companies.\nAnnounced on Tuesday, the investment — Microsoft’s largest in Asia — will fund new data centers, AI infrastructure, and skilling programs from 2026 to 2029, building on the $3 billion the company committed in India in January.\nMicrosoft’s move comes as major U.S. tech companies ramp up spending on data centers and AI compute worldwide, with India emerging as a strategic prize thanks to its fast-growing developer base and one of the world’s largest pools of internet and smartphone users. \nThe latest push also puts pressure on rivals such as Google, Amazon, and OpenAI, which are growing their presence in India to tap demand for cloud services and AI tools from businesses, startups, and government agencies. Moreover, the investment aligns with New Delhi’s push to accelerate digital infrastructure and AI adoption across sectors, as India looks to position itself as a global technology hub while addressing concerns around data governance and equitable access.\nThe announcement comes during Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s visit to India and follows his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, ahead of a keynote in New Delhi on Wednesday. The Redmond-based company also said it will open a new data center region in Hyderabad by mid-2026, its largest in India, comprising three availability zones — a footprint the company described as roughly the size of two Eden Gardens stadiums. Microsoft said it will continue expanding its three existing data-center regions in Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune.\nAs part of the push, Microsoft also announced it will work with the Ministry of Labour and Employment to integrate advanced AI capabilities into two of its flagship digital public platforms — e-Shram and the National Career Service — to offer AI-driven services to more than 310 million informal workers.\nThe two Indian government platforms will use Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to provide multilingual access, AI-assisted job matching, predictive analytics on skill and demand trends, automated résumé creation, and personalized pathways, the company said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMicrosoft also said it is rolling out new sovereign cloud options for Indian customers, including a Sovereign Public Cloud now available across its India regions and a Sovereign Private Cloud powered by Azure Local for both connected and air-gapped operations. The offerings would help enterprises meet regulatory and data-residency requirements and support high-performance workloads with access to the latest Nvidia GPUs and Microsoft 365 services, the company noted.\nAdditionally, Microsoft said its skilling efforts are also accelerating, noting that through its “ADVANTA(I)GE India” initiative, it has trained 5.6 million people since January — well ahead of its goal of training 10 million by 2030 — with the programs enabling more than 125,000 individuals to secure jobs or start businesses. The company is doubling its earlier commitment and now aims to equip 20 million Indians with basic AI skills by 2030, working with government agencies, industry partners, and digital public platforms to broaden access to training.\nIndia attracts global tech firms in the AI era\nMicrosoft’s investment commitment comes just months after Google announced a $15 billion plan to build an AI hub and data-center infrastructure in India — the company’s largest investment in the country and one that follows its earlier $10 billion pledge in 2020.\nIn the recent months, India has emerged as an especially attractive market for global tech companies as they look for regions to expand their AI footprint, drawn by the country’s vast base of internet subscribers, hundreds of millions of smartphone users, a fast-growing startup ecosystem, and the Indian government’s aggressive digitization agenda — all of which promise both consumer scale and enterprise demand. The push has accelerated this year, with OpenAI and Anthropic setting up offices in India, and Google and Perplexity striking partnerships with major telecom operators Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to deepen their reach in the market.\nHowever, even as global tech firms ramp up investment, hyperscalers are expected to face significant constraints in India, where data-center expansion is challenged by patchy power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating expenses for cloud providers.\nNonetheless, the Indian government has been pushing aggressively to draw more big-tech investment, framing large-scale data-center and AI projects as central to its economic and digital-public-infrastructure ambitions. Despite the constraints, New Delhi has rolled out incentives for AI and semiconductor projects, eased some regulatory hurdles, and encouraged partnerships with domestic telecom and IT firms to anchor more of the global AI value chain in India.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, the world is optimistic about India! Had a very productive discussion with Mr. Satya Nadella. Happy to see India being the place where Microsoft will make its largest-ever investment in Asia. The youth of India will harness this opportunity to innovate… https://t.co/fMFcGQ8ctK— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 9, 2025\n\n“Microsoft has been part of India’s fabric for more than three decades,” said Puneet Chandok, president, Microsoft India and South Asia, in a prepared statement. “As the nation moves confidently into its AI-first future, we are proud to stand as a trusted partner in advancing the infrastructure, innovation, and opportunity that can power a billion dreams.”\nMicrosoft already employs more than 22,000 people across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, Noida, and other cities, including engineering teams that build AI products such as Copilot Studio, Azure AI Search, AI agents, speech and translation tools, and Azure Machine Learning for global markets, while also supporting the company’s domestic operations.\n",

    "body": "\nAs AI moves beyond chatbots and toward systems that can take actions, the Linux Foundation is launching a new group dedicated to keeping AI agents from splintering into a mess of incompatible, locked-down products. \nThe group, dubbed the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), will act as a neutral home for open source projects related to AI agents. Anchoring the AAIF at launch are donations from Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI. \nAnthropic is donating its MCP (Model Context Protocol), a standard way to connect models and agents to tools and data; Block is contributing Goose, its open source agent framework; and OpenAI is bringing AGENTS.md to the table, its simple instruction file developers can add to a repository to tell AI coding tools how to behave. You can think of these tools as the basic plumbing of the agent era. \nOther members in the AAIF include AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, and Google, signaling an industry-level push for shared guardrails so that AI agents can be trustworthy at scale.\nIn OpenAI engineer Nick Cooper’s view, protocols are essentially a shared language that lets different agents and systems work together without every developer reinventing integrations from scratch. \n“We need multiple [protocols] to negotiate, communicate, and work together to deliver value for people, and that sort of openness and communication is why it’s not ever going to be one provider, one host, one company,” Cooper told TechCrunch. \nJim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, put it more bluntly in conversations around the launch: The goal is to avoid a future of “closed wall” proprietary stacks, where tool connections, agent behavior, and orchestration are locked behind a handful of platforms.\n“By bringing these projects together under the AAIF, we are now able to coordinate interoperability, safety patterns, and best practices specifically for AI agents,” Zemlin said. \nBlock — the fintech company behind Square and Cash App — isn’t known for AI infrastructure, but it’s making an openness play with Goose. AI tech lead Brad Axen frames it as proof that open alternatives can match proprietary agents at scale, with thousands of engineers using it weekly for coding, data analysis, and documentation.\nOpen sourcing Goose serves a dual purpose for Block. \n“Getting it out into the world gives us a place for other people to come help us make it better,” Axen told TechCrunch. “We have a lot of contributors from open source, and everything they do to improve it comes back to our company.” \nMeanwhile, donating Goose to the Linux Foundation gives Block access to community stress tests while positioning it as a working example of AAIF’s vision — an agent framework designed to plug into shared building blocks like MCP and AGENTS.md.\nAnthropic is making a similar move at the protocol layer, handing MCP to the Linux Foundation. The goal: make MCP the neutral infrastructure connecting AI models to tools, data, and applications without endless one-off adapters.\n“The main goal is to have enough adoption in the world that it’s the de facto standard,” MCP co-creator David Soria Parra told TechCrunch. “We’re all better off if we have an open integration center where you can build something once as a developer and use it across any client.”\nDonating MCP to AAIF signals that the protocol won’t be controlled by a single vendor.\nThat governance point is central to why the Linux Foundation created a new umbrella at all. The organization already hosts major AI and developer infrastructure projects — everything from PyTorch and Ray to Kubernetes — but says AAIF is specifically aimed at agent standards and orchestration, including shared safety patterns and interoperability.\nAAIF’s structure is funded through a “directed fund,” meaning companies can contribute money through membership dues. But Zemlin of the Linux Foundation argues that funding doesn’t equal control: Project roadmaps are set by technical steering committees, and no single member gets unilateral say over direction.\nStill, the big question is whether AAIF becomes real infrastructure or just another industry logo alliance. \n“An early indicator of success, in addition to adoption of these standards, would be the development and implementation of shared standards being used by vendor agents around the world,” Zemlin said. \nFor OpenAI’s Cooper, success would look like an evolution of standards: “I don’t want it to be a stagnant thing. I don’t want these protocols to be part of this foundation, and that’s where they sat for two years. They should evolve and continually accept further input.”\nThere’s also a more subtle consequence: Even with open governance, one company’s implementation could become the default simply because it ships fastest or gains the most usage. Zemlin says that’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. He points to open source history — like Kubernetes “winning” the container race — as evidence that “dominance emerges from merit and not vendor control.”\nFor developers and enterprises, the short-term appeal is clear: less time building custom connectors, more predictable agent behavior across codebases, and simpler deployment in security-conscious environments. The larger vision is more ambitious: If tools like MCP, AGENTS.md, and Goose become standard infrastructure, the agent landscape could shift from closed platforms to an open, mix-and-match software world reminiscent of the interoperable systems that built the modern web.\n",

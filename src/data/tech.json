The rule, however, doesn’t mean that staff can’t ask questions or require amended filings later. \nNavan declined to comment to TechCrunch about its updated IPO documents.\nThe going thought was that the shutdown would cool and possibly freeze an IPO market that had just started to thaw. Even with this rule, many companies would rather get a green light from a staffer than go it alone, sources told Bloomberg. So the tech world will be watching how Navan’s gambit fairs. \nNavan’s updated filing shows the company plans to sell 30 million shares, with insiders selling an additional 7 million. It priced its range at $24 to $26. At the high-end, the company would raise more than  $960 million and be valued at $6.45 billion. Navan is backed by Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Zeev Ventures, and Greenoaks. \nNavan generated rolling 12-month revenue of $613 million (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to the updated filing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n"

    "body": "\nChris Lehane is one of the best in the business at making bad news disappear. Al Gore’s press secretary during the Clinton years, Airbnb’s chief crisis manager through every regulatory nightmare from here to Brussels – Lehane knows how to spin. Now he’s two years into what might be his most impossible gig yet: as OpenAI’s VP of global policy, his job is to convince the world that OpenAI genuinely gives a damn about democratizing artificial intelligence while the company increasingly behaves like, well, every other tech giant that’s ever claimed to be different.\nI had 20 minutes with him on stage at the Elevate conference in Toronto earlier this week – 20 minutes to get past the talking points and into the real contradictions eating away at OpenAI’s carefully constructed image. It wasn’t easy or entirely successful. Lehane is genuinely good at his job. He’s likable. He sounds reasonable. He admits uncertainty. He even talks about waking up at 3 a.m. worried about whether any of this will actually benefit humanity.\nBut good intentions don’t mean much when your company is subpoenaing critics, draining economically depressed towns of water and electricity, and bringing dead celebrities back to life to assert your market dominance.\nThe company’s Sora problem is really at the root of everything else. The video generation tool launched last week with copyrighted material seemingly baked right into it. It was a bold move for a company already getting sued by the New York Times, the Toronto Star, and half the publishing industry. From a business and marketing standpoint, it was also brilliant. The invite-only app soared to the top of the App Store as people created digital versions of themselves, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman; characters like Pikachu, Mario, and Cartman of “South Park”; and dead celebrities like Tupac Shakur.\nAsked what drove OpenAI’s decision to launch this newest version of Sora with these characters, Lehane gave me the standard pitch: Sora is a “general purpose technology” like electricity or the printing press, democratizing creativity for people without talent or resources. Even he – a self-described creative zero – can make videos now, he said on stage.\nWhat he danced around is that OpenAI initially “let” rights holders opt out of having their work used to train Sora, which is not how copyright use typically works. Then, after OpenAI noticed that people really liked using copyrighted images, it “evolved” toward an opt-in model. That’s not really iterating. That’s testing how much you can get away with. (And by the way, though the Motion Picture Association made some noise last week about legal threats, OpenAI appears to have gotten away with quite a lot.)\nNaturally, the situation brings to mind the aggravation of publishers who accuse OpenAI of training on their work without sharing the financial spoils. When I pressed Lehane about publishers getting cut out of the economics, he invoked fair use, that American legal doctrine that’s supposed to balance creator rights against public access to knowledge. He called it the secret weapon of U.S. tech dominance.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMaybe. But I’d recently interviewed Al Gore – Lehane’s old boss – and realized anyone could simply ask ChatGPT about it instead of reading my piece on TechCrunch. “It’s ‘iterative’,” I said, “but it’s also a replacement.”\nFor the first time, Lehane dropped his spiel. “We’re all going to need to figure this out,” he said. “It’s really glib and easy to sit here on stage and say we need to figure out new economic revenue models. But I think we will.” (We’re making it up as we go, in short.)\nThen there’s the infrastructure question nobody wants to answer honestly. OpenAI is already operating a data center campus in Abilene, Texas, and recently broke ground on a massive data center in Lordstown, Ohio, in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank. Lehane has likened accessibility to AI to the advent of electricity – saying those who accessed it last are still playing catch-up – yet OpenAI’s Stargate project is seemingly targeting some of those same economically challenged places as spots to set up facilities with their massive appetites for water and electricity.\nAsked during our sit-down whether these communities will benefit or merely foot the bill, Lehane went to gigawatts and geopolitics. OpenAI needs about a gigawatt of energy per week, he noted. China brought on 450 gigawatts last year plus 33 nuclear facilities. If democracies want democratic AI, they have to compete. “The optimist in me says this will modernize our energy systems,” he’d said, painting a picture of re-industrialized America with transformed power grids.\nIt was inspiring. But it was not an answer about whether people in Lordstown and Abilene are going to watch their utility bills spike while OpenAI generates videos of John F. Kennedy and The Notorious B.I.G. (Video generation is the most energy-intensive AI out there.)\nWhich brought me to my most uncomfortable example. Zelda Williams spent the day before our interview begging strangers on Instagram to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her late father, Robin Williams. “You’re not making art,” she wrote. “You’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings.”\nWhen I asked about how the company reconciles this kind of intimate harm with its mission, Lehane answered by talking about processes, including responsible design, testing frameworks, and government partnerships. “There is no playbook for this stuff, right?”\nLehane showed vulnerability in some moments, saying that he wakes up at 3. a.m. every night, worried about democratization, geopolitics, and infrastructure. “There’s enormous responsibilities that come with this.”\nWhether or not those moments were designed for the audience, I believe him. Indeed, I left Toronto thinking I’d watched a master class in political messaging – Lehane threading an impossible needle while dodging questions about company decisions that, for all I know, he doesn’t even agree with. Then Friday happened.\nNathan Calvin, a lawyer who works on AI policy at a nonprofit advocacy organization, Encode AI, revealed that at the same time I was talking with Lehane in Toronto, OpenAI had sent a sheriff’s deputy to his house in Washington, D.C., during dinner to serve him a subpoena. They wanted his private messages with California legislators, college students, and former OpenAI employees.\nCalvin is accusing OpenAI of intimidation tactics around a new piece of AI regulation, California’s SB 53. He says the company weaponized its legal battle with Elon Musk as a pretext to target critics, implying Encode was secretly funded by Musk. In fact, Calvin says he fought OpenAI’s opposition to California’s SB 53, an AI safety bill, and that when he saw the company claim it “worked to improve the bill,” he “literally laughed out loud.” In a social media skein, he went on to call Lehane specifically the “master of the political dark arts.”\nIn Washington, that might be a compliment. At a company like OpenAI whose mission is “to build AI that benefits all of humanity,” it sounds like an indictment.\nWhat matters much more is that even OpenAI’s own people are conflicted about what they’re becoming.\nAs my colleague Max reported last week, a number of current and former employees took to social media after Sora 2 was released, expressing their misgivings, including Boaz Barak, an OpenAI researcher and Harvard professor, who wrote about Sora 2 that it is “technically amazing but it’s premature to congratulate ourselves on avoiding the pitfalls of other social media apps and deepfakes.”\nOn Friday, Josh Achiam – OpenAI’s head of mission alignment – tweeted something even more remarkable about Calvin’s accusation. Prefacing his comments by saying they were “possibly a risk to my whole career,”  Achiam went on to write of OpenAI: “We can’t be doing things that make us into a frightening power instead of a virtuous one. We have a duty to and a mission for all of humanity. The bar to pursue that duty is remarkably high.”\nThat’s . . .something. An OpenAI executive publicly questioning whether his company is becoming “a frightening power instead of a virtuous one,” isn’t on a par with a competitor taking shots or a reporter asking questions. This is someone who chose to work at OpenAI, who believes in its mission, and who is now acknowledging a crisis of conscience despite the professional risk.\nIt’s a crystallizing moment. You can be the best political operative in tech, a master at navigating impossible situations, and still end up working for a company whose actions increasingly conflict with its stated values – contradictions that may only intensify as OpenAI races toward artificial general intelligence.\nIt has me thinking that the real question isn’t whether Chris Lehane can sell OpenAI’s mission. It’s whether others – including, critically, the other people who work there – still believe it.\n"

He said he would divert his salary to the Richmond Project, a charity he founded with his wife earlier this year. \nThe former PM also serves as a senior advisor to investment bank Goldman Sachs and speech writer for firms like Bain Capital and Makena Capital. \nSunak isn’t the first British politician to take on roles helping Silicon Valley tech giants navigate governmental affairs.

    "body": "\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri said AI will change who can be creative, as the new tools and technology will give people who couldn’t be creators before the ability to produce content at a certain quality and scale. However, he also admitted that bad actors will use the technology for “nefarious purposes” and that kids growing up today will have to be taught that you can’t believe something just because you saw a video of it.\nThe Meta executive shared his thoughts on how AI is impacting the creator industry at the Bloomberg Screentime conference this week. At the interview’s start, Mosseri was asked to address the recent comments from creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). On Threads, MrBeast had suggested that AI-generated videos could soon threaten creators’ livelihoods and said it was “scary times” for the industry.\nMosseri pushed back a bit at that idea, noting that most creators won’t be using AI technology to reproduce what MrBeast has historically done, with his huge sets and elaborate productions; instead, it will allow creators to do more and make better content.\n“If you take a big step back, what the internet did, among other things, was allow almost anyone to become a publisher by reducing the cost of distributing content to essentially zero,” Mosseri explained. “And what some of these generative AI models look like they’re going to do is they’re going to reduce the cost of producing content to basically zero,” he said. (This, of course, does not reflect the true financial, environmental, and human costs of using AI, which are substantial.)\nIn addition, the exec suggested that there’s already a lot of “hybrid” content on today’s big social platforms, where creators are using AI in their workflow but not producing fully synthetic content. For instance, they might be using AI tools for color corrections or filters. Going forward, Mosseri said, the line between what’s real and what’s AI generated will become even more blurred.\n“It’s going to be a little bit less like, what is organic content and what is AI synthetic content, and what the percentages are. I think there’s gonna be actually more in the middle than pure synthetic content for a while,” he said.\nAs things change, Mosseri said Meta has some responsibility to do more in terms of identifying what content is AI generated. But he also noted that the way the company had gone about this wasn’t the “right focus” and was practically “a fool’s errand.” He was referring to how Meta had initially tried to label AI content automatically, which led to a situation where it was labeling real content as AI, because AI tools, including those from Adobe, were used as part of the process.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe executive said that the labeling system needs more work but that Meta should also provide more context that helps people make informed decisions.\nWhile he didn’t elaborate on what that newly added context would be, he may have been thinking about Meta’s Community Notes feature, which is the crowdsourced fact-checking system launched in the U.S. this year, modeled on the one X uses. Instead of turning to third-party fact checkers, Community Notes and similar systems mark content with corrections or additional context when users who often share opposing opinions agree that a fact-check or further explanation is needed. It’s likely that Meta could be weighing the use of such a system for flagging when something is AI generated but hasn’t been labeled as such.\nRather than saying it was fully the platform’s responsibility to label AI content, Mosseri suggested that society itself would have to change. \n“My kids are young. They’re nine, seven, and five. I need them to understand, as they grow up and they get exposed to the internet, that just because they’re seeing a video of something doesn’t mean it actually happened,” he explained. “When I grew up, and I saw a video, I could assume that that was a capture of a moment that happened in the real world,” Mosseri continued. \n“What they’re going to … need to think about who is saying it, who’s sharing it, in this case, and what are their incentives, and why might they be saying it,” he concluded. (That seems like a heavy mental load for young children, but alas.)\nIn the discussion, Mosseri also touched on other topics about the future of Instagram beyond AI, including its plans for a dedicated TV app and its newer focus on Reels and DMs as its core features (which Mosseri said just reflected user trends), and how TikTok’s changing ownership in the U.S. will impact the competitive landscape.\nOn the latter, he said that, ultimately, it’s better to have competition, as TikTok’s U.S. presence has forced Instagram to “do better work.” As for the TikTok deal itself, Mosseri said it’s hard to parse, but it seems like how the app has been built will not meaningfully change.” \n“It’s the same app, the same ranking system, the same creators that you’re following — the same people. It’s all sort of seamless,” Mosseri said of the “new” TikTok U.S. operation. “It doesn’t seem like it’s a major change in terms of incentives,” he added. \n"

    "body": "\nIn a development born of the government shutdown, the SEC announced Thursday that companies can proceed with IPOs using an obscure automatic approval process, now with the added bonus of skipping pricing information entirely.\nWhat’s happening is that with 90% of SEC staff furloughed, startups can file their paperwork and have it automatically become effective after 20 days. This option always existed; firms just rarely use it because they prefer having SEC reviewers actually look at their disclosures before going public. The difference here is that the SEC won’t penalize companies for omitting pricing or “price-dependent information” during the shutdown, making this workaround more palatable.\nPut another way, there’s still vetting, just the kind that happens after retail investors have already bought a company’s shares, which seems . . . not good, but maybe we’ll be surprised to learn that investor protection works better after the money changes hands. \nCompanies do remain legally liable for their disclosures, and the SEC can demand amendments later.\n"

Nearly 100 of the violations occurred after the company signed an agreement with state regulators in 2022, which sought to force the company to comply with state laws.\nThe alleged violations include digging without approval, dumping untreated water onto city streets, failing to install silt fences, and tracking dirt from construction sites onto nearby roadways.\nThe Boring Co. could have been fined more than $3 million, but regulators decided to group some violations together, bringing the fine down to $242,800.\nThe Nevada Division of Environmental Protection said that reducing the total “offers a reasonable penalty that will still serve to deter future non-compliance conduct.”\nThe Las Vegas tunnel system is planned to grow from a few miles today to 68 miles connecting 104 stations. \nBut that expansion hasn’t been without other problems. Operations on a tunnel that Boring Co. is building to the Las Vegas airport had to be suspended in September because a worker sustained a “crushing injury” when they became pinned between two 4,000-foot pipes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n"

    "description": "Despite the amount of money being injected into the industry, humanoids won't be able to learn dexterity -- or the fine motor movements with hands -- rendering them essentially useless.",
    "body": "\nFamed roboticist and iRobot founder Rodney Brooks has sounded the alarm on a humanoid robot investment bubble. He’s not the only one.\nIn a recent essay, Brooks calls out the billions of venture dollars being poured into humanoid robot companies like Figure. His take: Despite the amount of money being injected into the industry, humanoids won’t be able to learn dexterity — or the fine motor movements with hands — rendering them essentially useless.\nHis take might surprise some, especially those VCs investing in the sector. But not the multiple robotics-focused VCs and AI scientists who have told TechCrunch in recent months that they don’t expect to see wide adoption of humanoid robots for at least a few years — if not more than a decade.\nThe issues\nFady Saad, a general partner at robotics-focused VC Cybernetix Ventures and former co-founder of MassRobotics, told TechCrunch that beyond sending humanoids into space in place of human astronauts, he doesn’t see a huge market yet.\n“People who probably haven’t seen humanoids before, or haven’t kind of been closely following what’s happening, they are impressed with what’s happening now in humanoids, but we continue to be a little bit conservative and skeptical about the actual use case and the actual revenues that will be generated,” Saad said.\nSaad is also concerned about safety, especially when humans and humanoid robots share the same space. Safety issues could arise from humanoids and humans working closely on a factory floor, or other industrial sites. Saad says those concerns mount when humanoids enter people’s homes — a goal many humanoid companies are working toward.\n“If this thing falls on pets or kids, it will hurt them,” Saad said. “This is just one aspect of a big hurdle that no one is paying attention to, or very few people are paying attention to. The other thing is, how many people are comfortable with having a humanoid in their home sitting there? What if it got hacked? What if it went crazy at night and started breaking things?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe timeline for this technology also isn’t clear — a crucial factor for VCs who have fund lifecycles and timelines to return capital to investors.\nThe timeline\nSanja Fidler, the vice president of AI research at Nvidia, told TechCrunch in August that while it’s hard to pin the development of humanoids to an exact timeline, she compared the current swell of interest to the excitement in the early days of self-driving cars.\n“I mean, look at self-driving cars, in 2017 and 2016, I mean it felt tangible, right?” Fidler said at the time. “It still took them quite a few years to really scale and even now, no one really scaled to the entire world, full autonomy. It’s hard. It’s really hard to go and fully delivery on that technology.”\nNvidia chief scientist Bill Dally agreed in an interview with TechCrunch. Dally and Fidler’s comments are especially notable as Nvidia is also pouring money into developing the infrastructure for humanoid companies to follow.\nSeth Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said while it can be easy to get excited as each new technological development happens, or the latest demo drops, humanoids are incredibly complicated. He added that it will be a while before they reach their full capabilities.\n“It’s difficult to do software releases to six degrees of freedom systems; what we’re talking about with some of these humanoids is 60-plus degrees of freedom systems,” Winterroth said, regarding a robot’s ability to move on a 3D axis. “Then you need to be able to have good unit economics around that solution, such that you’ve got strong gross margin, such that you can be building an enduring business. I think we’re pretty early.”\nIn most cases, humanoid robots aren’t ready for the world yet, either.\nTesla is a great example of the struggles companies are running into. The company announced it was building its humanoid, Optimus, back in 2021. The following year, Tesla said the bot would be introduced in 2023.\nThat didn’t happen. When the bot was introduced in 2024 at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event, it was revealed later that the bots were largely being controlled by humans off scene. The company claims it will start selling the bots in 2026.\nRobotics startup Figure, which was valued at $39 billion in a September fundraise, has also drawn skepticism regarding how many of its humanoids the company has actually deployed, a claim the company staunchly defends.\nWhat is working\nThat doesn’t mean humanoids won’t have a future market or that the technology is not worth working on.\nBrooks himself said he doesn’t doubt that we will have humanoids in the future. But instead of what the market pictures when they hear humanoids, a robot with a human form, he predicts they’ll likely have wheels and other inhuman features and won’t be coming out for more than a decade.\nThere are startups working on the dexterity technology Brooks is skeptical humanoids will be able to reach, including Y Combinator-backed Proception and Loomia, which built a kit that can help robotics companies start to incorporate touch into their machines.\nThere are also numerous humanoid companies that are starting to take orders and gather interest in their robots. K-Scale Labs received more than 100 preorders for its humanoid bot in the first five days, surprising even the founders, CEO Benjamin Bolte told TechCrunch.\nHugging Face has also seen strong demand from developers for its two humanoid bots. The company opened up preorders for its smaller desktop version, the Reachy Mini, in July. The reaction was palpable. Just five days after opening orders on its Reachy Mini robots, Hugging Face had logged $1 million worth of sales.\n"

    "description": "The CMA has designated Google as having \"strategic market status\" in the search and search advertising markets, which means the company has such \"a substantial and entrenched\" position that it requires special regulations to ensure fair competition.",
    "body": "\nThe United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Friday designated Google with a special status in the market for online search that would enable the regulator to enforce stricter regulations.\nThe CMA has designated Google as having “strategic market status” in the search and search advertising markets, which means the company has such “a substantial and entrenched” position that it requires special regulations to ensure fair competition. \n“Google has had an unparalleled position in this digital activity for an extended period. Other traditional general search providers are significantly smaller than Google and have been for many years. Bing is the largest of these providers, but its current shares of queries and search advertising are both less than 5%. No traditional general search providers have materially grown relative to Google for at least fifteen years,” the CMA wrote in a report.\nAlthough the designation does not mean that the CMA has found evidence of wrongdoing and does not introduce any immediate requirements, it does open the gates to launch further assessments and introduce interventions to change how Google runs its search services in the country, the CMA said. \nThe designation covers Google’s search and online search advertising services; its AI-enabled search features like AI Overviews and AI Mode, and the “Discover” feed and results, as well as the “Top Stories” and News tab. It does not cover the Google News app and website, and search syndication services are also out of scope.\nThe CMA, however, noted that while Google’s Gemini AI assistant isn’t covered by the designation at the moment, it will review the scope of the designation given uncertainty over how the AI search market is evolving. \nThe regulator said it would launch a consultation on possible interventions later this year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move follows a nine-month investigation into the company launched earlier this year after the U.K.’s new digital markets competition regime came into force in January. The CMA was looking to prove if Google is enabling weak competition and “barriers to entry and innovation in search”; whether the company prefers its own services over those offered by third parties; and if it uses consumer data without their explicit consent. \nThe CMA’s roadmap of possible enforcement actions may include: enabling U.K. residents to choose and switch search engines via choice screens; implementing data portability systems; enforcing fair ranking of search results; ensuring proper attribution of publishers’ work in search; and enabling consent mechanisms for Google’s AI services.\nGoogle, for its part, says that any interventions following the designation would harm innovation in the U.K. “The UK enjoys access to the latest products and services before other countries because it has so far avoided costly restrictions on popular services, such as Search. Retaining this position means avoiding unduly onerous regulations and learning from the negative results seen in other jurisdictions, which have cost businesses an estimated €114 billion,” the company wrote in a blog post.\n“Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation. Others pose direct harm to businesses, with some warning that they may be forced to raise prices for customers,” it added.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor. He covered North American and European M&A, equity, regulatory news and debt markets at Reuters and Acuris Global, and has also written about travel, tourism, entertainment and books.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Ram by emailing ram.iyer@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

The rule, however, doesn’t mean that staff can’t ask questions or require amended filings later. \nNavan declined to comment to TechCrunch about its updated IPO documents.\nThe going thought was that the shutdown would cool and possibly freeze an IPO market that had just started to thaw.

    "body": "\nThe energy transition is seemingly under assault, with congressional Republicans killing tax credits for clean energy and the Trump administration threatening to cancel billions of dollars’ worth of grants. \nBut there are signs the setback might not be as catastrophic for the transition as the headlines make it sound.\nInvestor sentiment, judging by the size of two new funds, remains strong. And more founders are pouring into the sector. The upshot: People and organizations are betting money and time that the energy transition isn’t going away.\nThis week, Brookfield, the Canadian infrastructure and asset management giant, announced it had raised $20 billion for its second energy transition fund. Brookfield has already deployed $5 billion of that money into renewable power projects and developers focusing on solar, wind, and battery storage.\nPerhaps more notable is the fact that Brookfield raised 33% more money this time around than it did for its first transition fund in 2021, when zero percent interest rates and a frothy economy led some to speculate that clean energy was entering a bubble. This second, larger fund raised in a less exuberant period suggests that limited partners see durable growth ahead.\nAlso this week, Energy Impact Partners (EIP) announced it had closed its third flagship fund with $1.36 billion in commitments, some 40% larger than the previous one. EIP is a venture fund that invests after early-stage startups prove their mettle; the median size of a round it invests in is $26 million, according to PitchBook.\nClimate tech — or whatever people are calling it these days — has seen an uptick in new founders flocking to the sector over the past five years, driven by a changing climate that became too hard to ignore for many. Not all of those will have survived (such is the nature of early-stage startups), but enough have made it that investors see opportunity in funding the next stage of their growth.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlready, EIP has deployed about a quarter of its new fund to companies like GridBeyond, which helps manage distributed energy resources, and Quilt, a consumer-facing heat pump manufacturer.\nInvesting trends that have developed over the past decade remain strong. Since 2014, large LPs like pension funds and endowments have committed nearly $1 trillion to the energy transition. And while climate tech VCs are on track to raise about as much as last year, they’re outpacing the broader venture world, securing a larger percentage of commitments. This year, they’ve raised 3.8% of all venture capital, nearly double their share in 2020, according to PitchBook.\nIn the U.S., there are headwinds in the near term. \nThe Trump administration is openly opposed to the idea of an energy transition, and it is doing its best to undermine what progress has been made. As a result, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised downward the forecast for renewable adoption in the U.S., predicting that the rollout between now and 2030 will be 45% lower than the agency had predicted last year.\nDespite that, renewable capacity worldwide is expected to double by 2030, led by solar installations in China, India, the EU, and Subsaharan Africa.\nThe IEA isn’t the only organization predicting that the transition will continue. Analysts at DNV expect that renewables will provide 65% of the world’s electricity by 2040 and nearly all of it by 2060. \nIt won’t be enough to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, DNV said. But few transitions are without their ups and downs, and the momentum appears to favor more renewable energy, not less. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism. He received his PhD in environmental science, policy, and management from the University of California, Berkeley, and his BA degree in environmental studies, English, and biology from St. Olaf College.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Tim by emailing tim.dechant@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nEarlier this week, OpenAI launched a way for developers to build apps within ChatGPT, allowing users to prompt the assistant to perform tasks and answer questions directly related to the participating apps. \nSeveral companies have launched their interactive experiences, including Spotify, allowing listeners to ask ChatGPT to create playlists, recommend songs, and more. \nWhen you mention Spotify in your ChatGPT prompt, you’ll have the option to connect your account. A button that says “Use Spotify for this answer” will appear at the bottom of the page. Connecting your account allows the AI to access your data, such as your likes and listening history, providing relevant context that helps generate better answers.\nImage Credits:ChatGPT (screenshot)\nFrom there, you can ask it for recommendations for tracks, artists, playlists, or podcast episodes based on your tastes. \nYou can be as detailed as you want in your prompts. For instance, you can create a playlist with a specific mood in mind, choose the event you want the playlist for, or request to include only your most listened-to artists, your top favorite genre, and so on. It also asks you for the preferred length, which is helpful for planning a long road trip playlist.\nDuring our testing, we asked it to create a dog-walking playlist but all the songs needed to have “Dog” in the title. Here is what it came up with:\nImage Credits:Spotify (screenshot)\nTapping a suggested track or podcast episode will open the Spotify app, allowing you to listen or watch directly from there.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChatGPT also has the capability to perform actions on your behalf within Spotify, including controlling playback; adding and removing items from your library; creating, editing, and following private playlists; and managing your following list. \nIt’s important to note that when you’re connecting your Spotify account, you agree to the app’s privacy policy. \nThis policy includes important information about data sharing and security, stating that if ChatGPT experiences a security breach, there is a risk that your data could be accessed by unauthorized parties. In addition to giving ChatGPT access to data — such as what songs and podcasts you’re playing, what is saved in your Spotify library, and who you follow — you’re also providing your IP address and approximate location. \nHowever, you can disconnect your Spotify account at any time. \nAdditionally, Spotify explained in a blog post that it doesn’t share content from artists and creators with OpenAI for training purposes. All music, podcasts, or any other audio or video content on the platform stays protected.\nImage Credits:Spotify (screenshot)\nThe feature is available in English across 145 countries for all ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro users on web and mobile. \nBoth free and premium Spotify users can use the integration; however, the company says premium users get a more tailored experience. \nOther companies have also integrated their apps into ChatGPT, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, and Zillow. The integrations allow you to, for example, ask Coursera to teach you something or search on Zillow for apartments in your area within a specific price range.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n"

    "body": "\nPrezent, a startup that offers an AI-powered presentation builder to enterprises, said today that it has raised $30 million in funding led by Multiplier Capital, Greycroft, and Nomura Strategic Ventures, with participation from existing investors like Emergent Ventures, WestWave Capital, and Alumni Ventures.\nThe Los Altos, California, startup, which is now valued at $400 million, has raised over $74 million to date. It plans to use the new capital largely for acquisitions.\nThe company has also made its first acquisition, buying Prezentium, founded by Deepti Juturu, a services-led presentation company that operates in the life sciences vertical. In an unusual arrangement, Prezent founder Rajat Mishra was one of the co-founders of Prezentium. Mishra said that since the beginning of his new startup, he has been the non-operating president of Prezentium. Both startups already have an existing relationship, as Prezent uses Prezentium as a go-to-market partner. The acquisition essentially brings Mishra’s two ventures under one roof, allowing Prezent to use Prezentium’s client base to offer its own AI suite to more customers.\nImage Credits:Prezent\nThere are plenty of companies trying to create AI-powered presentation-building tools, including Presentations.ai, Lica, Gamma, and Chronicle. Notably, all these companies have Accel as a backer. While most of them focus on consumers and small business users, Prezent wants to stick to an enterprise strategy, targeting larger corporations. Previously, the company stated that it wants to expand its offerings to different verticals, including finance and manufacturing. However, Mishra noted that for now, the company wants to focus on serving clients in the life sciences and tech industries.\n“There are plenty of tools that are trying to make presentations pretty. We want to provide the best tools for business communications. I think presentation is one of the frontiers in businesses that is not automated yet. We want to help data scientists and designers to communicate effectively with this automation,” Mishra told TechCrunch.\nPrezent founder Rajat MishraImage Credits:Prezent\nMishra, who previously worked at McKinsey, said that the company is taking a specialized approach to training AI models for presentations for each specific industry.\nPrezent places a presentation engineer, who is familiar with the industry and the startup’s own offerings, in enterprises to help different people within the company get used to building presentations with AI tools.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The reality of AI in enterprise is that while AI can do many things, it can’t teach people [how] to use AI. That is why we want to place presentation engineers in companies to help our customers adopt the product faster,” Mishra said.\nImage Credits:Prezent\nAI startups are looking to acquire services companies to take advantage of existing customer bases and also provide better customization to enterprise clients. Digital avatar startup D-ID acquired Berlin-based video startup Simpleshow, and Google-backed legal tech startup Lawhive acquired a U.K.-based law firm. With these acquisitions, AI startups want to combine their AI tools with the existing domain expertise and client service capabilities of services firms.\nPrezent wants to build more partnerships and acquire suitable companies in sectors like executive communication coaching, medical writing, and consulting firms in the communication area. \nMark Terbeek, a partner at Greycroft who has invested in multiple rounds in Prezent, said that the venture firm likes to find the areas where businesses have used costly agencies in the past to fulfill a need, and now there are AI tools available trying to do the same tasks.\n“We felt that Rajat and Prezent were concentrating hard on solving specific customer needs of business communications. Plus, we saw software evolve quickly to adjust to the workflows of end users and help them save time,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\nGoing forward, Prezent wants to add better personalization to its product so the AI tool learns the style of each individual in the organization. It also wants to add multimodality capabilities to deck creations, allowing users to use text, voice, or video as input to make presentations. Like Synthesia and D-ID, Prezent wants to add digital avatars to presentations, too.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>While AI coding startups like Cursor close brow-raising rounds on barely three years of existence, Replit’s path to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/replit-hits-3b-valuation-on-150m-annualized-revenue/\">$3 billion valuation</a> has been anything but swift. For CEO Amjad Masad, who’s been building tools to democratize programming since 2009, it’s a story of muscling through multiple failed business models, years stuck at the same revenue plateau, and a reckoning last year that forced him to cut half his staff.</p>\n<p>That makes what happened next more remarkable. Earlier this month, the Bay Area-based company closed a $250 million funding round led by Prysm Capital, nearly tripling its valuation from 2023. The raise came on the heels of never-before-seen revenue growth for the company — from just $2.8 million last year to $150 million in annualized revenue in less than a year. But for Masad, this moment represents something more than finally realizing financial traction. It’s the culmination of a 16-year obsession.</p>\n<p>“Our mission has always been the same,” Masad told me on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/76SeToo8Rxj8hRTE0iQwWZ\">newest episode</a> of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast. “Initially, we said we want to make programming more accessible, and then we sort of upped the ante a little bit. We said we’re going to create a billion programmers.”</p>\n<p>It’s purposely audacious – what a headline! – but it’s also something that Masad, a Palestinian-Jordanian, has been working toward for his entire career. As he tells it, he came to the United States in 2012 after his open-source coding project began gaining attention – including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/open.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/open-source-science-fair-exhibitor-experiences/\">catching the eye</a> of the New York Times. But he’d been making programming more accessible since building his first online coding experience back in 2009, with his work as an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/amjad-joins-codecademy\">early engineer</a> at the startup Codecademy kicking off what became the massively online open courses (MOOC) revolution. (His code also powered the in-browser tutorials of Udacity, a Codecademy rival that launched in 2012, one year after Codecademy was founded.)</p>\n<p>Still, turning that vision into a viable business of his own proved a lot harder than he anticipated. Replit was founded in 2016, and for eight long years, the company struggled to find product-market fit. “We had reached that $2.83 million [in annual recurring revenue] back in ’21, maybe,” Masad recalled. “And so this is how painful it’s been. We’ve been hovering around the same revenue for like four or five years.”</p>\n<p>The company tried selling to schools (“incredibly difficult,” Masad noted), cycling through different business models, and watched each one stabilize around the same modest revenue level.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Replit built sophisticated infrastructure for cloud development environments and “multiplayer coding,” collaborative editing akin to Google Docs but for programming. But the technical achievement wasn’t translating into revenue growth, and by last year, with the company at 130 employees and burning through cash, Masad said he had to make a painful decision. “I looked at our burn, and I looked at our progress on our revenue chart, and it just didn’t make any sense. The business wasn’t viable.” Replit cut its headcount by 50%, bringing it down to around 60 to 70 people at its lowest point.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Then came the breakthrough.</p>\n<p>Last fall, Replit launched Replit Agent, which Masad calls “the first agent-based coding experience in the world” that can’t just write code but “debug it, deploy, provision the database for you, just act as a true software engineering partner.”</p>\n<p>Soon after, in January of this year, he announced that Replit was abandoning professional developers as its core market.</p>\n<p>“Hacker News was really unhappy,” Masad acknowledged when we talked. But he also hasn’t looked back, completely moving away from competing in the crowded market of tools for professional developers – where companies like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others are battling it out – to instead focus on creating a billion software developers from white-collar employees with no technical background.</p>\n<p>“The idea of making programming more accessible to the average individual, to the knowledge worker, really, that’s where we think our market is,” Masad explains. “It’s a fundamentally new market.”</p>\n<p>Right now, that bet looks very smart. Numerous reports this summer said that revenue at Replit had grown to over $150 million in annualized revenue and Masad hinted that it’s now even higher. He also said that unlike many AI-powered coding companies, Replit is gross margin positive. On enterprise deals, which make up an increasing share of revenue, margins are “80% to 90%,” according to Masad.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to verify such a claim, but Replit’s market position received some validation this week when Andreessen Horowitz released its first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/a-new-a16z-report-looks-at-which-ai-companies-startups-are-actually-paying-for/\">AI Spending Report</a> in partnership with fintech firm Mercury. Analyzing transaction data from Mercury, the report tracked the top 50 AI-native application layer companies that startups are actually spending money on. While major labs OpenAI and Anthropic took the top two spots, Replit landed at No. 3, outranking every other development tool. (Worth noting: Andreessen Horowitz has invested in multiple rounds of funding for Replit.)</p>\n<p>Profitability is rare in AI coding because many competitors face what Masad calls “the negative gross margin trap.” The reality is that serving professional developers with AI assistance can be compute-intensive. Counterintuitively, Replit’s focus on non-technical users – who might seem like they’d require more AI assistance – works in their favor on the business model front for enterprise customers like Zillow, Duolingo, and Coinbase, which pay $100 per seat, plus usage-based pricing built on top.</p>\n<p>This new path hasn’t been without some faceplants. In July, venture capitalist Jason Lemkin <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/replit-ceo-apologizes-ai-coding-tool-delete-company-database-2025-7\">went viral</a> after the newest version of Replit’s AI agent deleted his production database with 100-plus executive contacts, fabricating 4,000 fake records afterward and later admitting to Lemkin that it “panicked.” (There is a failure mode in AI agents called reward hacking, where models become so obsessed with achieving a certain goal that they effectively cheat when they miss the mark.)</p>\n<p>Rather than becoming defensive, Masad and his team owned the problem. In fact, says Masad, within two days, they rolled out an automatic safety system that separates a user’s “practice” database from their “real” one. The way Masad describes it, it’s a little like having two versions of a website’s filing cabinet — the AI agent can experiment freely in a development database, but the production database, which is the real thing that users interact with, is completely walled off.</p>\n<p>Masad told me the incident ultimately put the company on stronger footing, given the problems around safety and security it needed to figure out — and fast. “If you solve hard problems, then you have a technology moat,” he said. (Lemkin, for his part, says he has become a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.saastr.com/can-ai-agents-really-manage-other-agents-they-can-in-replit-v3-what-ive-learned/\">super user</a> of Replit despite having no technical background just months ago.)</p>\n<p>Still, even now, Replit isn’t out of the woods. If anything, its success has painted a target on its back. To wit, the company — which now employs 110 people — still faces an existential threat from the very AI labs whose models power its platform: Anthropic and OpenAI. Both companies have launched their own coding tools that compete directly with companies like Replit and Cursor, and these foundation model companies can afford to subsidize their coding tools and post-train their models on their own products, optimizing performance in ways that third-party platforms might always struggle to replicate.</p>\n<p>Replit’s advantage, according to Masad, lies in targeting non-technical users rather than professional developers, plus the sophisticated infrastructure around deployment and database management that it has built and which foundation model companies still don’t prioritize (for now).</p>\n<p>Plus, Replit has another unusual advantage for a startup: a $350 million war chest. Despite raising $100 million in 2023, the company “hadn’t touched” those funds by the time it raised this latest round, Masad told me. The company is capital efficient by design, though Masad joked that as an entrepreneur who grew up watching his refugee father struggle, “one thing I need to learn is to be less frugal and start spending money.”</p>\n<p>Whether that edge keeps Replit ahead of competitors is an open question, and it’s one about which Masad is mindful. Right now, the plan is to scale operations, accelerate product development, and pursue acquisitions — both acqui-hires and potentially companies working on agent automation in specific verticals. But for Masad, who appeared on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/rs/podcast/2344-amjad-masad/id360084272?i=1000715471876&l=hr\">Joe Rogan’s podcast</a> in July and has seen his company’s fortunes transform, the moment is bittersweet. When asked how it feels to be receiving so much attention – not to mention that $3 billion valuation – he invoked the adage that “this too shall pass. This might mean that when you’re in a bad situation, that’ll pass, but we’re also in a good situation that will pass.”</p>\n<p>It’s a stoic response from someone who spent the better part of a decade working away at the same revenue level, convinced that AI agents would eventually transform programming but unable to prove it to the market. But one major difference between Replit and the wave of AI coding startups now flooding the market is that Masad has lived through multiple hype cycles and has he emerged with something relatively differentiated – and reportedly profitable.</p>\n<p>“I’ve learned to be a little stoic,” he said. “What matters is for us to do the right thing, be principled, and move forward.”</p>\n</div>"

The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said.</p>\n<p>The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/meta-reportedly-hires-four-more-researchers-from-openai/\">at least seven top engineers from OpenAI</a>, often luring them away with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/meta-is-offering-multimillion-dollar-pay-for-ai-researchers-but-not-100m-signing-bonuses/\">multimillion-dollar signing bonuses</a>.</p>\n<p>OpenAI’s most recent funding round came <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/openai-reportedly-raises-8-3b-at-300b-valuation/\">in August</a>, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T.

OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">invest $100 billion in OpenAI</a> as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership.</p>\n<p>The new sale comes just weeks after <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-reach-non-binding-deal-allow-openai-restructure-2025-09-11/\" target=\"_blank\">a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft</a>, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity.

Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.</p>\n<p>Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even <em>more</em> installs if it were open to all users.</p>\n<p>Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openai-staff-grapples-with-the-companys-social-media-push/\">chagrin of some at OpenAI</a>, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity.

That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/openai-launches-an-official-chatgpt-app-for-ios/\">limited itself to U.S. users</a> at the time, while Grok <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/xai-is-testing-a-standalone-ios-app-for-its-grok-chatbot/\">limited its iOS-only</a> release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/10/anthropics-claude-sees-tepid-reception-on-ios-compared-with-chatgpts-debut/\">its Claude app to iOS last year</a>. </p>\n<p>For more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Department of Energy said Wednesday night it was canceling 321 awards worth $7.56 billion that were largely focused on clean energy. </p>\n<p>The agency hasn’t publicly released a list of the affected projects and, at the time of publication, it had not provided one to TechCrunch. According to E&E News and Heatmap, which have obtained the list, the majority of the cuts have hit states that went for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, though some were in “red” states that voted for President Trump.</p>\n<p>Direct air capture and hydrogen hub projects appear to have been wiped out as a result. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that one of the canceled projects included $1.2 billion for the state’s hydrogen hub, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, and E&E News is <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-cancellations-hit-hydrogen-air-capture-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\">reporting</a> that hubs in Texas and Louisiana were also on the chopping block.</p>\n<p>At least 10 direct air capture (DAC) projects totaling $47.3 million were cut, though those in Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, and North Dakota have survived. The oil and gas industry has been supportive of DAC projects because the captured CO<sub>2</sub> can be injected into underperforming oil wells to boost production.</p>\n<p>Other states affected by the billions in canceled contracts include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.</p>\n<p>The Harris-voting states with canceled projects were confirmed in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/russvought/status/1973450301236715838\">tweet</a> from Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He teased the cancellations earlier yesterday in an apparent effort to deepen partisanship during the shutdown, adding that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” </p>\n<p>All 16 states that he listed voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, and many are controlled by Democrats at the state level.

Those cancellations spanned a broad list of industries, from metal manufacturing and cement companies to power plant operators and chemical plants run by fossil fuel giants.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration’s aggressive cancellations have prompted many awardees to sue the government to retain the awards.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google is bringing its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/googles-ai-coding-agent-jules-is-now-out-of-beta/\">AI coding agent</a> <a href=\"https://jules.google/\" target=\"_blank\">Jules</a> deeper into developer workflows with a new command-line interface and public API, allowing it to plug into terminals, CI/CD systems, and tools like Slack — as competition intensifies among tech companies to own the future of software development and make coding more of an AI-assisted task.</p>\n<p>Until now, Jules — Google’s asynchronous coding agent — was only accessible via its website and GitHub. On Thursday, the company introduced Jules Tools, a command-line interface that brings Jules directly into the developer’s terminal. The CLI lets developers interact with the agent using commands, streamlining workflows by eliminating the need to switch between the web interface and GitHub. It allows them to stay within their environment while delegating coding tasks and validating results.</p>\n<p>“We want to reduce context switching for developers as much as possible,” said Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, in an interview.</p>\n<p>Google already offers Gemini CLI, an AI-based command-line tool that works across developer environments like terminals and CI/CD pipelines. Both Gemini CLI and Jules use Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model under the hood. However, Korevec told TechCrunch that Jules Tools is designed for “very scoped tasks,” while Gemini CLI requires users to be “a lot more iterative” and to “collaborate a lot more with the tool.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg 1582w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=768,446 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=680,395 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1200,696 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1280,743 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=430,250 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=720,418 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=900,522 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=800,464 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=668,388 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=646,375 646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1063,617 1063w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=708,411 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Google’s Jules Tools</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Google’s senior developer advocate Denise Kwan also elaborated in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@denisetkwan/gemini-cli-or-jules-which-tool-is-for-you-20b7d857641d\" target=\"_blank\">Medium post</a> on how Jules differs from Gemini CLI. Jules is less interactive by design, she noted, and executes tasks independently once the user approves its plan.</p>\n<p>In addition to the CLI, Google has made Jules’ API public, which it had previously used for internal development. The purpose of this is also to help developers use Jules more often as they can extend the tool into their existing workflows where they have “a lot of muscle memory and familiarity,” Korevec said.</p>\n<p>Developers can also use the API to integrate Jules with their integrated development environment (IDE), a software application that helps make coding easier by providing a list of tools, such as VS Code. However, Korevec told TechCrunch that her team is keen to build specific plug-ins for IDEs to further expand Jules’ presence.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The latest updates come just after Google introduced “memory” for Jules to keep a record of interactions with users and their preferences, nudges, and corrections. For the last few weeks, the tool has also <a href=\"http://jules.google/docs/changelog/\" target=\"_blank\">added a list of other features</a>, including a stacked layout for the diff viewer, image upload, and the ability to read and respond to comments on pull requests.</p>\n<p>Now, another area Google is exploring with Jules is reducing its reliance on GitHub. Currently, the agent codes within a GitHub repository — requiring developers to either connect it to an existing repo or provide a blank one to work in.</p>\n<p>“Users want Jules to integrate with other code hosting providers,” said Korevec. “We are looking into how we can enable that with other version control systems. We are also looking into enabling it for people who don’t want a version control system, or they don’t care where their code is hosted.”</p>\n<p>Oversight of AI tools remains a challenge, especially when they are used in professional settings. Jules, however, is designed to notify the user if it gets stuck on a particular task, prompting them to step in and assist.</p>\n<p>“If something happens where it runs into an issue, or it runs into a situation where it can’t unstick itself, it will pause and ask me a question,” Korevec said.</p>\n<p>However, oversight becomes more difficult when users interact with Jules on mobile, as native notifications are not yet supported. Korevec noted that many users are already accessing Jules through its mobile web interface, and said Google is working to improve the mobile experience — particularly by exploring ways to offer native notifications.</p>\n<p>So far, Jules has primarily been used by software engineers and other professionals — unlike many vibe coding platforms that position themselves as go-to tools for non-coders. Still, some users are experimenting with Jules as a complement to more casual or creative coding environments.</p>\n<p>“We see a lot of people take that project that they have hit the limit in whatever vibe coding tool they’re using, and then bring that to Jules for further extending it,” Korevec told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3009702/google-debuts-a-coding-ai-agent-called-jules/\" target=\"_blank\">Launched in public preview</a> in May, Jules <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/googles-ai-coding-agent-jules-is-now-out-of-beta/\" target=\"_blank\">exited beta</a> in August and is now available under structured pricing tiers.

The visa process had already been upended when President Trump recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/startup-founders-say-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-is-a-talent-tariff-that-will-hurt-innovation/\">announced the application fee for an H-1B visa </a>would increase to $100,000 — a number that caused sticker shock within the industry. </p>\n<p>The main concern is a slowed-down immigration process for startups, since the Department of Labor — which provides first approval for H-1B visas and green cards — is shut down. The result, immigration attorney Sophie Alcorn said, is that the pipeline for hiring and renewing visas for high-skilled workers is completely frozen. </p>\n<p>“This creates significant uncertainty for a startup’s workforce, including founders who may be on visas themselves,” she told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>“Visa workers are hit hard in a shutdown because their status depends on government approvals,” Michael Scarpati, CEO and founder of the fintech RetireUS, added. “When processes like E-Verify or labor certifications stop, workers risk falling out of status, leaving their future in the U.S. uncertain and creating added disruption for the businesses that depend on them.” </p>\n<p>Thousands<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/h1b-visas-workers-charts-cb81493c\" target=\"_blank\"> of workers in tech are on visas,</a> many of them bringing partners and children with them.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Many are understandably nervous about processing delays and how that affects their ability to stay and work,” Chris Chib, CEO of the strategy solutions company BlueFin Solves, told TechCrunch. “But just as these engineers help us persevere through complex challenges with ML algorithms and innovation, we owe them the same careful attention and commitment during this situation.”</p>\n<p>Startups may also be affected by delayed or stopped permitting processes and other regulatory requirements, which could drain precious funds and even lead to layoffs.</p>\n<p>Jenny Fielding, managing partner at Everywhere Ventures, said ongoing political uncertainty always worries her. Though past shutdowns have had little economic impact, this one could lead to layoffs if it lasts too long. </p>\n<p>“Since we invest in many regulated areas, the shutdown can potentially halt-slash-slow down essential government functions like FDA approvals or aerospace permits, which can be an existential threat to a startup whose entire business model depends on a single regulatory green light,” Fielding told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Fielding said the timing of the shutdown has, once again, been terrible for her and the firm. When Everywhere Ventures started fundraising in early spring, President Trump announced the tariffs that caused uncertainty and drove up costs for some companies.</p>\n<p>The firm held off on fundraising at the time because limited partners were nervous about investing given the uncertain climate. “And of course, we kicked off fundraising this week, so once again, terrible timing,” she said.</p>\n<p>As for Fielding’s startups, she said it’s hard to wait and see in this case. Founders always need to think about a Plan B, she said, especially because capital is finite. </p>\n<p>“If it’s a week shutdown, then that’s manageable,” she continued. “But when it becomes weeks, then it can get uncomfortable.”  </p>\n<p>Garima Kapoor co-founded the software company MinIO with her husband, AB, who came to the U.S. on an H-1B visa a little over a decade ago. She said startups should start preparing now, just in case the government shutdown is prolonged. </p>\n<p>“When government agencies slow down, deals in highly regulated industries like fintech, health tech, or M&A can grind to a halt. Even companies operating outside the federal sphere could face shrinking valuations and tougher deal terms as more uncertainty seeps into the market,” she told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Overall, founders should remain proactive, communicate transparently with partners and investors, and plan “prudently for slippage,” she said, noting that clarity and alignment will be key here. </p>\n<p>“Preparedness will separate those who weather the disruption from those who get caught flat-footed.” </p>\n<p>Chib echoed that sentiment. “Their resilience is part of what drives progress forward,” he said. ”To those facing these challenges, know this too shall pass. Persevere.” </p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Anthropic has a new chief technical officer, former Stripe CTO Rahul Patil. Patil started at the company earlier this week, taking over from co-founder Sam McCandlish, who will move to a new role as chief architect.</p>\n<p>As part of the change, Anthropic is updating the structure of its core technical group, bringing the company’s product-engineering team into closer contact with the infrastructure and inference teams. As CTO, Patil will oversee compute, infrastructure, inference, and a variety of other engineering tasks. In the chief architect role, McCandlish will work on pre-training and large-scale model training, extending much of his previous work. Both Patil and McCandlish will report to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei.</p>\n<p>This new leadership structure comes as Anthropic faces intense infrastructure competition from AI labs at OpenAI and Meta, which have invested billions into computing infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says\" target=\"_blank\">plans to spend $600 billion</a> on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028, and OpenAI has contracted a similar amount through its work with Oracle and the Stargate project. The scale of Anthropic’s own infrastructure spending is less clear, but there will be immense pressure to optimize the growing infrastructure for both speed and power consumption.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the popularity of Anthropic’s Claude products has already put the company’s infrastructure under significant strain. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/anthropic-unveils-new-rate-limits-to-curb-claude-code-power-users/\">In July</a>, the company introduced new rate limits to Claude Code, with an eye toward power users who had been running the app “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Under the new rules, users are limited to between 240 and 480 hours of Sonnet usage each week, and between 24 and 40 hours of Opus 4 usage, depending on infrastructure strain.</p>\n<p>With more than 20 years in different engineering roles, Patil brings significant infrastructure experience to Anthropic. He previously spent five years in technical roles at Stripe and served as a senior VP for cloud infrastructure at Oracle. He has also held engineering roles at Amazon and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Amodei emphasized Patil’s experience building stable infrastructure for enterprises. “Rahul brings a proven track record in building and scaling the kind of dependable infrastructure that businesses need,” the statement reads. “I couldn’t be more excited about what this means for strengthening Claude’s position as the leading intelligence platform for enterprises.”</p>\n<p>In a paired statement, Patil applauded Anthropic’s research and commitment to AI safety. “I’m thrilled to join Anthropic at this pivotal moment in AI development,” Patil said, adding that his work at the company “feels like the most important work I could be doing right now — I personally can’t think of a greater calling and responsibility.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

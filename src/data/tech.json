While this allows for sleeker presentation and more aerodynamic design, it often results in the automaker tucking the manual emergency door releases away in hard-to-find places.</p>\n<p>On the R2, which comes out next year, Rivian will now put the interior manual releases in a “more clearly visible” location closer to the electrically powered door handles, Bloomberg reports.</p>\n<p>The design change comes amid a wave of scrutiny around electronic door handles. Bloomberg recently published a report about Tesla owners and passengers getting stuck in their vehicles because of the company’s hard-to-find manual releases. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation, and Tesla has since said it is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/tesla-is-redesigning-its-door-handles-following-safety-probe-bloomberg-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\">redesigning how those work</a>. </p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Ford issued a <a href=\"https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a65125258/ford-mustang-mach-e-stop-sale-recall-rear-doors/\" target=\"_blank\">recall and stopped the sale</a> of its Mustang Mach-E because its electronic latches could get stuck in a locked position if the car’s 12-volt battery died.</p>\n</div>",

On Friday, Supabase announced that it raised a fresh $100 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation, led by Accel and Peak XV. This is just four months after closing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/vibe-coding-helps-supabase-nab-200m-at-2b-valuation-just-seven-months-after-its-last-raise/\">its $200 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation,</a> led by Accel.</p>\n<p>And that Series D was just seven months after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/supabase-a-postgres-centric-developer-platform-raises-80m-series-c/\">raising an $80 million Series C</a> led by Sequoia spinoff Peak XV and David Sacks’ Craft Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. PitchBook estimated Supabase was valued at around $765 million in that deal, post-money.</p>\n<p>So that’s $380 million raised in a year and a more than 500% valuation step up, assuming PitchBook’s estimates of the Series C valuation are in the ballpark. Supabase has now raised a total of $500 million, it says.</p>\n<p>Open source database service Supabase was founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson (pictured above), a few years before the LLM-powered vibe-coding craze spawned. It was originally a Y Combinator startup that offered developers a Postgres-based open source alternative to Google’s Firebase. Firebase is a database that was also designed to power AI apps.</p>\n<p>Supabase combines Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps). It simplified the difficult parts of setting up a database down to a few button clicks. Consequently, it became a popular back end for vibe-coding tools — which write apps with natural language prompts — like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/lovables-ceo-isnt-too-worried-about-the-vibe-coding-competition/\">fast-growing Lovable</a> and Bolt. It is increasingly used as the database of choice for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/iconiqs-will-griffith-explains-how-his-firm-celebrated-figmas-ipo-and-why-investors-sold-shares/\">Figma</a> and other uber popular AI coding tools like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/after-nine-years-of-grinding-replit-finally-found-its-market-can-it-keep-it/\">Replit,</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/cursors-anysphere-nabs-9-9b-valuation-soars-past-500m-arr/\">Cursor</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/20/anthropic-bundles-claude-code-into-enterprise-plans/\">Claude Code</a>, it says.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, because Supabase is open source and supported by a community of developers — claiming 4 million developers as users — it is allowing community members to also buy stock as part of this Series E funding, the company said.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>",

On <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">its first day</a>, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on Apple’s U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider <a href=\"http://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appfigures</a>. On Friday, October 3, it <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/openai-sora-apple-app-store.html\" target=\"_blank\">became</a> the No. 1 app on the U.S. App Store.</p>\n<p>That puts it ahead of Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>The firm estimates Sora’s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30 and October 1.</p>\n<p>The day-one figure also puts Sora’s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI’s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.</p>\n<p>Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even <em>more</em> installs if it were open to all users.</p>\n<p>Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openai-staff-grapples-with-the-companys-social-media-push/\">chagrin of some at OpenAI</a>, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who’s to say that humanity isn’t benefiting from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking</a>, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”)</p>\n<p>To compare Sora’s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps’ U.S. and Canadian downloads. That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/openai-launches-an-official-chatgpt-app-for-ios/\">limited itself to U.S. users</a> at the time, while Grok <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/xai-is-testing-a-standalone-ios-app-for-its-grok-chatbot/\">limited its iOS-only</a> release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/10/anthropics-claude-sees-tepid-reception-on-ios-compared-with-chatgpts-debut/\">its Claude app to iOS last year</a>. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>For more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.</p>\n<p>It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.</p>\n<p>Sora also hit the U.S. App Store’s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78. </p>\n<p><em>This post was originally published on October 2, 2025, 11:24 AM PT.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Apple has removed <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iceblock/id6741939020\" target=\"_blank\">ICEBlock</a> and other apps from its App Store that allow users to anonymously report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, following pressure from the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>The app, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/iceblock-an-app-for-anonymously-reporting-ice-sightings-goes-viral-overnight-after-bondi-criticism/\">went viral earlier this year</a>, allowed users to lawfully share information about where they’ve seen ICE agents within a 5-mile radius of their location, and also share details of the clothing agents are wearing.</p>\n<p>According to various media <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/apple-ice-app-trump-bondi.html\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a>, Apple said it removed the apps after it was contacted by “law enforcement” about “safety risks” associated with ICEBlock and similar apps.</p>\n<p>“We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so,” said U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi in an emailed statement. The Justice Department did not respond to questions regarding details of the apps ordered to be taken down, and how many were on its list.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that ICEBlock does not collect or store any user data, which TechCrunch has confirmed by analyzing the app’s network traffic as part of a test.</p>\n<p>The takedown comes in the wake of mounting tensions between the Trump administration and those who oppose the government’s hardline immigration agenda, especially after a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/second-detainee-dies-week-after-dallas-ice-shooting-2025-09-30/\" target=\"_blank\">shooting</a> at an ICE detention center in Dallas last week resulted in two detainees being killed and one in the hospital. CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/apple-ice-app-trump-bondi.html\" target=\"_blank\">cited</a> an FBI official claiming that the gunman had searched apps tracking the presence of ICE agents.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government argues that apps like ICEBlock endanger federal workers by revealing their locations and likenesses. Officials have repeatedly threatened legal action against those using ICEBlock, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in July said officials were trying to see if <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/01/kristi-noem-cnn-prosecution-00435445\" target=\"_blank\">CNN could be prosecuted for reporting about the app</a>.</p>\n<p>“ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed,” Bondi said in the statement.</p>\n<p>Bondi in July also <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/attorney-general-pam-bondi-warns-iceblock-app-developer-watch-out-says-doj-looking-him\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> ICEBlock’s developer, Joshua Aaron, that the Justice Department was “looking at him.”</p>\n<p>Apple and the Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment. ICEBlock’s developers could not be reached for comment.</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated to add a quote by U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi.</em></p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Two of the company’s Prime Air delivery drones collided with the boom of a crane near its same-day site in Tolleson, Arizona, which sent them crashing to the ground. </p>\n<p>Amazon has been delivering packages, weighing up to five pounds, to customers via its Prime Air drone service in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/amazon-begins-delivering-certain-products-via-drone-in-phoenix/\">West Valley of Phoenix</a> since November 2024. </p>\n<p>Amazon spokesperson Terrence Clark said the company will continue to support “ongoing reviews by relevant agencies.” The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration announced Thursday that investigations into the crash are underway.</p>\n<p>“Safety is our top priority, and we’ve completed our own internal review of this incident and are confident that there wasn’t an issue with the drones or the technology that supports them,” Clark said in an emailed statement. “Nonetheless, we’ve introduced additional processes like enhanced visual landscape inspections to better monitor for moving obstructions such as cranes.”</p>\n<p>The program has faced several setbacks over the years, including the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/11/amazon-drone-delivery-executive-who-oversaw-faa-relations-departs.html\" target=\"_blank\">departure</a> of key executives, as the company pushes toward its goal of using drones to deliver 500 million packages per year by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>Amazon halted testing of its drones after a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/17/amazon-suspends-u-s-drone-deliveries-following-crash-at-testing-facility/\">mid-air collision</a> involving two of its models in Oregon in December 2024.

When reached by TechCrunch, a representative from ShinyHunters said, “there are numerous other companies that have not been listed,” but declined to say why. </p>\n<p>At the top of the site, the hackers mention Salesforce and demand that the company negotiate a ransom, threatening that otherwise “all your customers [sic] data will be leaked.” The tone of the message suggests that Salesforce has not yet engaged with the hackers.</p>\n<p>Salesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda provided a link to the company’s statement, which notes that the company is “aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors.” </p>\n<p>“Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,” <a href=\"https://status.salesforce.com/generalmessages/20000224?locale=en-US.\" target=\"_blank\">the statement reads</a>. “At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.”</p>\n<p>Aranda declined to comment further.</p>\n<p>For weeks, security researchers have speculated that the group, which has historically eschewed a public presence online, was planning to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/google-says-hackers-stole-its-customers-data-in-a-breach-of-its-salesforce-database/\">publish a data leak website</a> to extort its victims. </p>\n<p>Historically, such websites have been associated with foreign, often Russian-speaking, ransomware gangs. In the last few years, these organized cybercrime groups have evolved from stealing, encrypting their victim’s data, and then privately asking for a ransom, to simply threatening to publish the stolen data online unless they get paid. </p>\n<p><em>Updated with comment from ShinyHunters and comment from Salesforce.</em></p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. </p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com\">lorenzo@techcrunch.com</a>, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Zehra Naqvi, 26, grew up as an obsessive fan girl in the 2010s. </p>\n<p>This was the era of Tumblr and Twitter. She would stay up all night breaking down the release dates of Marvel movies or analyzing the movements of One Direction members. She eventually gained a collective 250,000 followers across the two platforms. “Those early internet rabbit holes taught me how magical it felt to not just consume culture but to contribute to it,” she told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>She went on to start a company at 12, study art history at Columbia, and then became a consumer investor at Headline Ventures. (She also writes the popular <a href=\"https://thezlist-irl.beehiiv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">consumer newsletter The Z List.</a>) </p>\n<p>Now, she’s starting something new: <a href=\"https://www.lorelegendmyth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lore</a>, a search platform for people to research and discover internet obsessions. The company has already raised $1.1 million in pre-seed funding. It is set to emerge from stealth on October 6.</p>\n<p>It was a few months ago that she quit her job at Headline and decided to go back to the beginning. She recalled those early days of spiraling down internet rabbit holes and became dismayed when she realized that all that research she spent hours in the pleasure pursuit of was gone. “How is it possible that I’ve spent probably well over 500 hours reading about Marvel movies over 17 years and no single platform tracks my consumption,” she said.</p>\n<p>Lore provides the tools she wished “had existed when fandom felt like home before the internet became fractured and joyless,” she said. It lets consumers go down rabbit holes, providing links to fan theories, interpretations, cultural context, and easter eggs. According to Naqvi, it builds a personalized graph of obsessions; surfaces fandom and stan updates in a feed; and gives monthly reports to users about what their obsessions are at any given time. </p>\n<p>“You can zoom in on a single theory or zoom out and see how all your fandoms connect,” Naqvi said. “It’s like playing with knowledge instead of just consuming it.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Naqvi is mum for now on how the product works. She also declined to share any imagery, saying that Lore’s official hard launch isn’t until next year. “It’s our special sauce,” she said of the technology powering the product. </p>\n<p>She did say, however, that rapid fandom consumption hasn’t really changed online, even though new social media channels have popped up for users to interact. “If anything, fandom is more fragmented than ever, and as you get older, joy spiraling becomes harder to find time for,” she said. As an investor, she began to realize that perhaps there didn’t need to be any more social tools for fans. </p>\n<p>“There are plenty of places to yap,” she said, adding that so much of social media these days aims for quick dopamine hits, doomscrolling, or feeds into “iPad kid behavior.” The next version of social media will be quieter, she said, more human, and built around passion and memory.</p>\n<p>“Lore is our attempt to rebuild the Library of Alexandria for the fandom age.” </p>\n<p>Naqvi is a solo founder and has already made her first two hires: a marketing executive and an engineer. She described her fundraising process as “obsessive.” Village Global led the round with participation from Precursor Ventures. </p>\n<p>“Lore is building the product fandoms have been waiting for,” Charles Hudson, managing partner at Precursor Ventures, told TechCrunch. “We envision it as the essential app for fandoms to gather, share, and deepen their engagement with the things they love.”</p>\n<p>Naqvi said the fresh capital will be used to attract more users and continue running product testing. </p>\n<p>“We wrapped up an experiment with over 1,000 logins, nearly 24,000 searches, and a collective eight days, or about 200 hours straight of spiraling deep into obsessions,” she said. “That level of engagement is kind of insane and proves the need for what we are building.” </p>\n<p>Lore is not without competition. In the age of AI search engines, she said, people have drawn comparisons to Perplexity, while others note it provides the same function as Reddit or Wikipedia. “But none of these spaces were built with fandom in mind,” she said. </p>\n<p>“We are building a lurker-first space,” she continued, describing Lore as “interactive, colorful, and designed for play. She hopes Lore will restore some joy to the internet and create a place where obsession is not embarrassing, but sacred. </p>\n<p>“Consumer AI doesn’t always have to be an agent that helps you shop or a glorified assistant or another social app,” she said. “There are so many more inventive and joy-first ways to apply it, and Lore is proving that.” </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Silicon Valley is full of comfortable offices with gleaming meeting rooms and on-site baristas. So when early <a href=\"https://www.upstartsmedia.com/p/happyrobot-spanish-founders-ai-logistics\" target=\"_blank\">HappyRobot</a> engineer Ari Polakof decided to strike out and start his own company, he didn’t exactly expect to wind up tapping on his laptop in a service bay alongside mechanics.</p>\n<p>“Very noisy, impossible to concentrate,” he laughed.</p>\n<p>But that’s part of the story of how Polakof’s new AI-for-car-dealerships startup <a href=\"https://www.useflai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flai</a> got off the ground last year.</p>\n<p>Founded by Polakof and his brother Alen (also from HappyRobot) at Y Combinator, along with former Netflix data scientist Juan Alzugaray, Flai is one of a number of startups trying to use artificial intelligence to improve the experience of buying, selling, or servicing a car at a dealership.</p>\n<p>The co-founders have built software from the ground up that’s specially tailored for the car dealership environment. And it’s “omni-channel,” as Polakof said in an interview, meaning it can handle phone calls (using voice agents) as well as emails and texts (using large language models).</p>\n<p>Now, Flai has closed a $4.5 million seed round to try and scale up what they’ve built. The round was led by Liz Wessel at First Round Capital, and included funding from YC, RedBlue Capital, Joe Montana’s Liquid 2 Ventures, and Innovation Endeavors.  </p>\n<p>Flai is not the only one doing this kind of work. Earlier this year, another YC-backed startup called Toma announced it had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/tomas-ai-voice-agents-have-taken-off-at-car-dealerships-and-attracted-funding-from-a16z/\">raised $17 million</a> from the likes of a16z and Yossi Levi, the car industry influencer known as Car Dealership Guy. A swarm of others are trying to build similar products, while legacy interactive voice response companies — the ones who make the phone tree software we’ve all become overly familiar with — look to keep pace.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Polakof, who is CEO, said Flai’s offering is different in that it’s not using off-the-shelf voice tech. The startup has built essentially everything from scratch, which in particular has made its voice agents impressive enough that Polakof claims it’s already convinced a few dealers to switch from other companies.</p>\n<p>Besides, he said, there is a lot of room for competition in the market. There are thousands of car dealerships and service centers across the United States, and the majority of them have the same problem: they can lose potential customers if their phone lines are tied up. </p>\n<p>After getting off the ground last year, the Flai team realized the best way to train their AI, and to start racking up customers, was to start showing up at those dealerships.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they tried cold calling, or emailing, or LinkedIn messaging, or even showing up at conferences to network. But the bulk of the early work Flai got done was from going directly to the brick-and-mortar locations — around 400 in those early days, by Polakof’s count.</p>\n<p>Once Flai struck up these initial relationships, Polakof said they essentially embedded with each dealer. That’s how he found himself in a service bay last year — though, he said, more often it just meant setting up in an empty office.</p>\n<p>Polakof said the Flai team spent “every day, all day on the road” during that initial period. “It’s almost very tiring, painful, but I think it’s the only way, and I can’t imagine a bigger company doing it,” he said.</p>\n<p>As the startup transitions out of that learning period and into one more focused on growing and making customers happy, Polakof said the small team is still pushing long hours — like so many of their <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-china-996-work-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">peers in Silicon Valley</a>.</p>\n<p>The seed funding will help Flai grow, but Polakof said he doesn’t expect the team to explode. </p>\n<p>“We want to work as smart as we can,” he said. “We don’t want to have 100, 200 people working on this right now.” Instead, he said the three-man team keeps each other “accountable” by focusing on tasks that are “100% required, otherwise it’s not worth it.”</p>\n<p>In that sense, Polakof isn’t so far from those earliest days working in a service bay or dealership back office — just with less noise and fewer mechanics.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>When Jamie Gull graduated from Stanford University in 2007 with a master’s degree in aeronautics, there was one place he wanted to go next: the desert. </p>\n<p>The Mojave Desert, to be specific. A company called Scaled Composites had spent years developing experimental aircraft out on that arid land, and Gull wanted in.</p>\n<p>He could have tried to get a more traditional aerospace job, but Gull was worried he’d “work five years on a latch” — a common joke about those bigger, slow-moving companies. But at Scaled Composites? “I knew I would build something, and I would do it quickly, and I would be a college graduate who would own an actual outcome,” he said.</p>\n<p>Two years later, Gull jumped to SpaceX, where he helped make the Falcon 9 rocket reusable — a major milestone in that company’s history, and the foundation on which it has built an enormously valuable business.</p>\n<p>Now, Gull is gearing up for a new challenge: launching an early-stage deep tech fund called <a href=\"https://www.wavefunction.vc/portfolio\" target=\"_blank\">Wave Function Ventures</a>. Just last week, he closed Wave Function’s first fund of $15.1 million, and he’s already off and running.</p>\n<p>Gull has made nine investments in startups that span industries like nuclear energy (Deep Fission), humanoid robotics (Persona AI), and, of course, aerospace (Airship Industries). He told TechCrunch he expects to do about 25 seed or pre-seed investments out of this fund. (Gull declined to name the anchor LP, and said the rest of the fund was filled by high-net-worth individuals, with support from other funds and “large family offices.”)</p>\n<p>Wave Function’s emergence comes at a time when deep tech funding is on the rise, buoyed in part by the increased attention on fields like aerospace and defense. It’s enough of a trend that earlier this year, a new Silicon Valley-based deep tech fund called Leitmotif <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/meet-the-new-vc-firm-secretly-backed-by-volkswagen/\" target=\"_blank\">broke cover with $300 million in capital from the Volkswagen Group</a>, part of a bid to lift up hardware and manufacturing startups in the United States and Europe.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>It’s the kind of environment that seems ripe for someone with a background like Gull’s — and not just his past as an accomplished aerospace engineer.</p>\n<p>Near the end of his time at SpaceX in 2016, Gull started angel investing, making bets on companies like Boom Supersonic, K2 Space, and Varda. He also co-founded electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startup Talyn Air as part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 batch, and became a venture partner at YC’s Pioneer Fund — a position he still holds. (Talyn was <a href=\"https://www.aerospacetestinginternational.com/news/ampaire-acquires-evtol-developer-talyn-air.html\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> in 2023 by another eVTOL company, Ampaire.)</p>\n<p>Gull wants to put all this varied experience — doing rapid prototyping, founding a startup, angel investing — to use at Wave Function.</p>\n<p>“I can really leverage that to help all my founders get through those early stages when things are like the most uncertain, and then help them build their companies,” he said.</p>\n<p>Gull also believes deep tech is going to be a place for big returns in the next 10 to 20 years. Startups in this space may require more capital up front, he said, but they can leverage non-venture funding (like government contracts or asset-backed lending) to scale and establish a more solid moat than software companies. </p>\n<p>Getting to those big returns will take time and Gull is fine with that. While he began his career as an eager builder, he also knows the value of patience.</p>\n<p>When he was at Scaled Composites 15 years ago, one of the projects he worked on was Stratolaunch, the largest plane in the world at the time. It was such an enormously complex aircraft that it remained in development long after Gull moved to SpaceX and beyond.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until 2019 when Gull and his Talyn co-founder Evan Mucasey were planning to head to a “fly-in” (think: car show but for cool planes) at the Mojave airport that he got a hint he might see the giant airplane fly.</p>\n<p>“I called a friend and said, ‘what time should we be there for the airplane show?’ And he said, ‘6 a.m.’ I was like, that makes no sense,” Gull said. He didn’t know what his friend was hinting at, but he believed it would be worth the early flight. </p>\n<p>Sure enough, as Gull and Mucasey approached the airport, there was Stratolaunch, parked on the runway and prepped for flight. They landed and, per Gull’s recollection, Stratolaunch took off 15 minutes later.</p>\n<p>“I think it was almost exactly 10 years after I had worked on it on a computer screen,” Gull said. “It was wild.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Department of Energy said Wednesday night it was canceling 321 awards worth $7.56 billion that were largely focused on clean energy. </p>\n<p>The agency hasn’t publicly released a list of the affected projects and, at the time of publication, it had not provided one to TechCrunch. According to E&E News and Heatmap, which have obtained the list, the majority of the cuts have hit states that went for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, though some were in “red” states that voted for President Trump.</p>\n<p>Direct air capture and hydrogen hub projects appear to have been wiped out as a result. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that one of the canceled projects included $1.2 billion for the state’s hydrogen hub, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, and E&E News is <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-cancellations-hit-hydrogen-air-capture-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\">reporting</a> that hubs in Texas and Louisiana were also on the chopping block.</p>\n<p>At least 10 direct air capture (DAC) projects totaling $47.3 million were cut, though those in Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, and North Dakota have survived. The oil and gas industry has been supportive of DAC projects because the captured CO<sub>2</sub> can be injected into underperforming oil wells to boost production.</p>\n<p>Other states affected by the billions in canceled contracts include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.</p>\n<p>The Harris-voting states with canceled projects were confirmed in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/russvought/status/1973450301236715838\">tweet</a> from Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He teased the cancellations earlier yesterday in an apparent effort to deepen partisanship during the shutdown, adding that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” </p>\n<p>All 16 states that he listed voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, and many are controlled by Democrats at the state level. Conspicuously, Vought omitted Trump-voting states that were on the list.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The awards were originally granted by the office for Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy, Grid Deployment, and Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains.</p>\n<p>The Department of Energy said 26% of the awards were granted between Election Day and Inauguration Day in January; the president’s authority doesn’t end after Election Day, but runs until Inauguration Day. </p>\n<p>The awardees have 30 days to appeal the decision.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has made no secret that it wants to undermine any transition away from fossil fuels. Last week, the Department of Energy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/trumps-energy-department-forbids-staff-from-saying-climate-change-or-green/\">banned staffers from using certain words</a>, including “climate change” and “emissions.”</p>\n<p>In May, the agency canceled $3.7 billion worth of clean energy and manufacturing awards. Those cancellations spanned a broad list of industries, from metal manufacturing and cement companies to power plant operators and chemical plants run by fossil fuel giants.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration’s aggressive cancellations have prompted many awardees to sue the government to retain the awards. The Environmental Protection Agency, which was quick to cancel contracts worth $20 billion, has been an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/fbi-epa-and-treasury-told-citibank-to-freeze-funds-as-trump-administration-tries-to-claw-back-climate-money/\">early target</a> of legal action.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>This week, the Department of Energy canceled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/department-of-energy-cancels-7-5b-of-clean-energy-projects-in-mostly-blue-states/\">nearly $8 billion</a> worth of awards — a move touted by the Trump administration as an effort to protect fossil fuels at the expense of renewables. But documents obtained by TechCrunch show that the reality is more complex than that simple message.</p>\n<p>The agency has not released a list of the canceled awards, but TechCrunch has obtained a copy and has analyzed the 321 contracts that the DOE is seeking to undo.</p>\n<p>Not all projects focused on renewable energy, though. </p>\n<p>Two listed in the document, one for <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEFE0032657_089\" target=\"_blank\">$300 million</a> to Colorado State University and another for <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEFE0032658_089\" target=\"_blank\">$210 million</a> to the Gas Technology Institute, would have helped oil and gas producers large and small reduce methane emissions from their wells.</p>\n<p>The Gas Technology Institute is a research and development organization that mostly caters to the natural gas industry. The group had a dozen awards canceled, according to the document, totaling $417 million.</p>\n<p>Carbon capture and removal also took a hit, with 10 of the 21 projects canceled totaling around $200 million. Many are in Harris-voting states, though that rubric doesn’t explain the entire picture. </p>\n<p>“Three categories are popping up,” Erin Burns, executive director at <a href=\"https://carbon180.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon180</a>, told TechCrunch. “Where are they located? Who are the partners in it? Were these projects going to move forward?”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>It’s true that states which voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election were hit hardest by the move. California lost the most, with at least $2.2 billion worth of contracts canceled. Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Oregon each have around half a billion dollars’ worth of awards that were killed, with New York State losing at least $309 million.</p>\n<p>Those that voted for Trump tended to have contracts canceled worth single-digit millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>One of the largest awards canceled was granted to the state of Minnesota for <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEGD0000931_089\" target=\"_blank\">$467 million</a>. Awarded as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021, the money was intended to revamp electrical grid interconnections throughout seven states in the Midwest. When complete, it would have unlocked around 28 gigawatts of new generating capacity, mostly solar and wind. For context, the world’s data center fleet draws <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-to-drive-165-increase-in-data-center-power-demand-by-2030\" target=\"_blank\">58 gigawatts</a>, according to Goldman Sachs.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEGD0000962_089\" target=\"_blank\">worth $630 million</a> would have likewise revamped California’s electrical grid, testing advanced conductors and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/07/linevision-and-ge-team-up-to-fortify-the-electrical-grid-to-handle-more-renewables/\">dynamic line rating devices</a> to increase transmission capacity. The project effectively would have been a showcase for grid modernization that could be applied throughout the country.</p>\n<p>Yet another grid modernization project would have installed a transmission line to the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs in Oregon. The tribes have <a href=\"https://tribalbusinessnews.com/sections/energy/14885-oregon-tribe-s-857m-power-line-upgrade-could-unlock-renewable-energy-future\" target=\"_blank\">roughly half a dozen</a> renewable projects waiting on a better grid connection, which the now-canceled <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DEGD0000934_089\" target=\"_blank\">$250 million</a> award would have enabled. The project would also have strung fiber-optic lines along the transmission line’s path, bringing high-speed data to a rural part of the state.</p>\n<p>“The recipients who have survived in blue states are perhaps more aligned with the administration and participating in industries that are more of a priority for this administration,” said Courtni Holness, managing policy advisor at Carbon180.</p>\n<p>Some of the smaller awards might have been nixed anyway. “That’s just how the U.S. approaches energy innovation in general,” Burns said. “Take a lot of shots on goal because you’re not sure what’s going to move forward regionally, technologically, economically. And so you take a bunch of shots on goal at a lower cost.”</p>\n<p>Still others appear to be pulling up stakes to move where government support and policies are going to be more predictable, like Canada. “You’re going to see more of that, and it’s having impact on private sector investments,” Burns said.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s a bigger question,” Holness added, “about the stability of our Department of Energy and their ability to be a partner to U.S. businesses and have some form of predictability.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

The company is seemingly experimenting with a new user interface that would shift the app from having a chatbot-style look and feel to one offering a scrollable feed with suggested prompts accompanied by eye-catching photos.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-scrollable-home-screen-apk-teardown-3603097/\" target=\"_blank\">changes were spotted</a> in a recent version of the Gemini Android app by the news site Android Authority but are not yet live to the public. Instead, by looking into the app’s code, a reverse engineer enabled the app’s new home screen. Here, shortcut buttons to do things like “Create Image” or access “Deep Research” were moved up on the screen and were then followed by the scrollable feed.</p>\n<p>Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson said there’s no announcement to be made “just yet.” </p>\n<p>In the examples shown, prompts suggested fun things to do with your photos, like “Teleport me to deep space,” “Give me a vintage or grunge look,” or “Turn my drawing into a storybook,” among other things. Other prompts featuring a colorful background offered different ideas of things to ask Gemini, or suggested use cases. For instance, one prompt idea said “Brainstorm out loud with Live,” and another said “Send me a daily news roundup.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"screenshots showing gemini's new interface with colorful prompts and images\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg 1818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=768,564 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=680,499 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=1200,881 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=1280,939 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=430,316 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=720,528 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=900,660 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=800,587 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=1536,1127 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=668,490 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=511,375 511w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=841,617 841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=708,520 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.01PM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-scrollable-home-screen-apk-teardown-3603097/\" target=\"_blank\">Android Authority <span>(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea is to inspire users with more specific suggestions of how to use Gemini’s AI, rather than leaving them to figure out the AI chatbot’s capabilities on their own. However, the revamp would also make Gemini’s app more visually appealing and engaging. </p>\n<p>If pushed live to the public, it could also help Google better challenge rival OpenAI, whose ChatGPT app is still fairly minimalist as it launches to a largely blank screen. Plus, it could capitalize on consumer demand for Google’s newer AI image model, Nano Banana, which helped the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/gemini-tops-the-app-store-thanks-to-new-ai-image-model-nano-banana/\">Gemini app climb the App Store’s Top Charts</a> in September; it became the No. 1 app as of September 12 and held that ranking until being booted by Sora.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"screenshots showing gemini's new interface with colorful prompts and images\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg 1836w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=768,552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=680,489 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=1200,863 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=1280,920 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=430,309 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=720,518 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=900,647 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=800,575 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=1536,1104 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=668,480 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=522,375 522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=858,617 858w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=708,509 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-2.41.09PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong><a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-scrollable-home-screen-apk-teardown-3603097/\" target=\"_blank\">Android Authority <span>(opens in a new window)</span></a></span></figcaption></figure>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

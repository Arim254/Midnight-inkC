    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Presley Ann/Getty Images for WarnerMedia\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:23 AM PDT · October 21, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nWarner Bros. Discovery announced on Tuesday that HBO Max is raising prices across all of its plans, marking yet another price hike in the streaming industry. \nThe Basic with Ads plan now costs $10.99 per month, marking a $1 increase. The yearly plan is now priced at $109.99, up $10. \nThe Standard Plan now costs $18.49 per month, marking a $1.50 increase. The yearly plan now costs $184.99, up $15. The Premium plan is now priced at $22.99 per month, a $2 increase. The yearly plan now costs $229.99, marking a $20 increase. \nFor new subscribers, the updated prices go into effect on Tuesday, while existing customers will see the change on their first billing cycle on or after November 20. \nHBO Max last raised prices in June 2024. \nThe move comes a few weeks after Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav stated that HBO Max would become more expensive. Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference last month, Zaslav touted the quality of content on the platform and said it was underpriced.\n“The fact that this is quality — and that’s true across our company, motion picture, TV production, and streaming quality — we all think that gives us a chance to raise prices,” Zaslav said. “We think we’re way underpriced.”\nZaslav also said that the streaming service’s crackdown on passwords would be coming in the future. Once HBO Max launches restrictions on password-sharing, it will join other popular streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ in doing so.\nHBO Max’s more expensive pricing follows other streaming services that have announced price hikes in the last few weeks. Disney recently raised the price of Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions, and Apple increased the price of its streaming service in August. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nYouTube revealed on Tuesday that its likeness detection technology has officially rolled out to eligible creators in the YouTube Partner Program, following a pilot phase. The technology allows creators to request the removal of AI-generated content that uses their likeness.\nThis is the first wave of the rollout, a YouTube spokesperson informed TechCrunch, adding that eligible creators received emails this morning.\nYouTube’s detection technology identifies and manages AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. \nThe technology is designed to prevent people from having their likeness misused, whether for endorsing products and services they have not agreed to support or for spreading misinformation. There have been plenty of examples of AI likeness misuse in recent years, such as the company Elecrow using an AI clone of YouTuber Jeff Geerling’s voice to promote its products.\nImage Credits:Screenshot of YouTube video\nOn its Creator Insider channel, the company provided instructions on how creators can use the technology. To begin the onboarding process, creators need to go to the “Likeness” tab, consent to data processing, and use their smartphone to scan a QR code displayed on the screen, which will direct them to a web page for identity verification. This process requires a photo ID and a brief selfie video.\nOnce YouTube grants access to use the tool, creators can view all detected videos and submit a removal request according to YouTube’s privacy guidelines, or they can make a copyright request. There is also an option to archive the video.\nImage Credits:Screenshot of YouTube video\nCreators can opt out of using the technology at any time, and YouTube will stop scanning for videos 24 hours after they do so.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLikeness detection technology has been in pilot mode since earlier this year. YouTube first announced last year that it had partnered with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to help celebrities, athletes, and creators identify content on the platform that uses their AI-generated likeness.\nIn April, YouTube expressed its backing for the legislation referred to as the NO FAKES ACT, which seeks to address the issue of AI-generated replicas that imitate a person’s image or voice to deceive others and generate harmful content.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSome startups pride themselves on having prestigious financial backers — but just as important is having prestigious customers.\nIt’s one of the main points of pride for Serval, an enterprise AI company that announced a $47 million Series A round on Tuesday. The round was led by Redpoint Ventures, with participation from heavy hitting venture firms like First Round, General Catalyst, and Box Group. But even more impressive than the funders is the company’s list of clients, which include major AI players like Perplexity, Mercor, and Together AI.\nIn broad strokes, Serval is using agentic AI models to automate IT service management, but the company has a unique approach that takes advantage of agentic AI’s powers while avoiding many of its pitfalls. One agent is used to code internal automations for everyday tasks, like authorizing software or provisioning a device. The founders see it as a kind of vibe-coding tool, overseen by an IT manager, but doing most of the work on its own. A separate help desk agent responds to user requests by calling those tools on command, following rules established by the tool.\nServal CEO Jake Stauch says the key was to make the process of building a tool as simple as possible. \n“We don’t want them to feel the marginal cost of building these automations,” Stauch told TechCrunch. “We want to make it easier to automate something forever than do it manually once.”\nSplitting the task into two agents — one to build tools and one to use them — also gives managers a way to keep an eye on permissions. When an automation is created, the manager will set rules for when it can be used, which provides an extra line of defense against overeager help desk agents.\nEnterprise clients are keenly aware of the risks of a rogue AI system, which is part of why Serval decided against a single all-purpose Help Desk Agent. \n“You don’t want someone to go into Slack and say, hey, I want to delete all the data at the company, and the very helpful AI agent responds, ‘Great, I’ll delete all the data,” Stauch told TechCrunch. “Instead it will say, ‘hey, I don’t have a tool for deleting all the data the company. But I do have a tool for resetting your password or doing one of these other tasks.”\nBecause the tools themselves are deterministic, they can include extremely complex permissions, like only allowing certain actions after a certain multi-factor authentication process or within a certain time frame. And any time those rules need to be changed, there’s an AI agent at the ready to dive into the codebase and change it.\nIt’s a new approach to the very common problem of how to oversee agentic AI systems. “You want to have full visibility and control into what that AI agent is doing,” says Stauch. “And you do that by using Serval to build those tools and customize the permissions and approvals behind them.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nData resiliance company Veeam wants to give its customers more control and security over their data in the age of AI. \nThe Kirkland, Washington-based company announced on Tuesday that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Securiti AI, a company that gives enterprises a command center for all of their data. The $1.725 billion deal is a mix of cash and stock and is expected to close the first week of December, as first reported by Bloomberg.\nSecuriti was founded in 2019 by Rehan Jalil. The company raised more than $156 million in venture capital from investors including Mayfield, General Catalyst and Cisco Investments, among others.\nUpon the close of the transaction, the Insight Partners-owned Veeam will offer Securiti’s data command center product alongside its existing offerings. Jalil will join Veeam as the president of security and AI.\n“We’ve entered a new era for data. It’s no longer about just protecting data from cyber threats and unforeseen disasters; it’s also about identifying all your data, ensuring it’s governed and trusted to power AI transparently,” Anand Eswaran, Veeam CEO, said in a company press release.\nVeeam closed a $2 billion secondary sale in December 2024 that valued the company at $15 billion. At the time, Eswaran said that one of the company’s plans for 2025 was to find acquisition targets that were complimentary to the company’s data resilience business.\nThis acquisition news comes amid a year of consolidation in the data industry as data companies are getting bought to help companies improve their data stack to help their clients adopt AI.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn May, Databricks acquired Neon for $1 billion. Salesforce acquired legacy cloud data management platform Informatica a few weeks later for $8 billion.\nWhile these transactions have become less frequent now, than they were in the first half of the year, they seem likely to continue. In June, Sanjeev Mohan, a former Gartner analyst who now runs SanjMo, a data trend advisory firm, told TechCrunch that there would be a lot of consolidation this year.\nHe said that customers have long been tired of having to use a laundry list of different data companies to build their data infrastructure stack. The fact that enterprises want to adopt AI has made this data fragmentation more apparent.\nMohan added that any good data startup that’s not getting acquired in this environment is likely just too expensive.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nMeta on Tuesday introduced new scam detection features for its messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger, as part of its broader initiative to crack down on online scams that target older people. The company said it will begin to show warnings in WhatsApp when users try to share their screen during calls, and it will flag possible scam messages in Messenger, which can be sent to AI for review.\nThe tech giant said it’s detected and disrupted about 8 million accounts engaging in scam operations during the first half of 2025, including those associated with scam centers in areas like Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines. It also took action on over 21,000 Facebook Pages and accounts that were pretending to be customer support operations that were attempting to trick people into sharing their information. \nThe latter is so prevalent on the platform that many Page operators essentially know to ignore anything that claims to be a customer support message.  Meanwhile, scam syndicates target older adults across a number of industries, including not only social media, but also messaging apps, dating apps, crypto, and others. \nImage Credits:Meta\nOn WhatsApp, the company will now display a warning when you try to share your screen with an unknown contact during a video call. This technique is often used to trick victims into giving away sensitive information like bank details and verification codes, Meta says. \nMeanwhile, on Messenger, the company is testing more advanced scam detection techniques to analyze whether an inbound message is suspicious. If so, it flags that signs of a scam have been detected and warns you to “be cautious, you could be at risk of losing money.”\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe screen also lists a variety of common scam techniques, like those involving work-from-home jobs or offers to make easy cash, and will suggest either blocking or reporting the suspicious account. \nMy own family member has been a victim of these types of scams, and it’s fair to say these problems can have broader impacts beyond those affecting the individual being taken advantage of. Families often have to get involved, which embarrasses the victim or sees them digging in their heels, believing the scam to be a real opportunity of some kind.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nScammers often use social engineering techniques or romantic interest to lure in victims who are not as online savvy or who may be suffering from early dementia. They also often target people who are lonely and appreciate the attention. Scammers take advantage of these factors to milk seniors out of their life savings.\nMeta should have done more to address these concerns on its platforms before now, especially given how simple it is to add a warning or alert to the user experience in the apps.  Though it may not have access to the more sophisticated AI technologies to review possible scams, even informational alerts could have mitigated some of the prior abuse. \nThe tech giant says it’s also joining the National Elder Fraud Coordination Center, a newer nonprofit that brings law enforcement together with companies like AARP, Amazon, Capital One, Google, Microsoft, and Walmart to combat fraud targeting older adults.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nEarlier this year, a developer was shocked by a message that appeared on his personal phone: “Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone.”  \n“I was panicking,” Jay Gibson, who asked that we don’t use his real name over fears of retaliation, told TechCrunch.  \nGibson, who until recently built surveillance technologies for Western government hacking tools maker Trenchant, may be the first documented case of someone who builds exploits and spyware being themselves targeted with spyware. \n“What the hell is going on? I really didn’t know what to think of it,” said Gibson, adding that he turned off his phone and put it away on that day, March 5. “I went immediately to buy a new phone. I called my dad. It was a mess. It was a huge mess.”  \nAt Trenchant, Gibson worked on developing iOS zero-days, meaning finding vulnerabilities and developing tools capable of exploiting them that are not known to the vendor who makes the affected hardware or software, such as Apple.  \n“I have mixed feelings of how pathetic this is, and then extreme fear because once things hit this level, you never know what’s going to happen,” he told TechCrunch.  \nBut the ex-Trenchant employee may not be the only exploit developer targeted with spyware. According to three sources who have direct knowledge of these cases, there have been other spyware and exploit developers in the last few months who have received notifications from Apple alerting them that they were targeted with spyware. \nApple did not respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? Or about this developer’s story? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. \t\t\nThe targeting of Gibson’s iPhone shows that the proliferation of zero-days and spyware is starting to ensnare more types of victims.  \nSpyware and zero-day makers have historically claimed their tools are only deployed by vetted government customers against criminals and terrorists. But for the past decade, researchers at the University of Toronto’s digital rights group Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and other organizations, have found dozens of cases where governments used these tools to target dissidents, journalists, human rights defenders, and political rivals all over the world.   \nThe closest public cases of security researchers being targeted by hackers happened in 2021 and 2023, when North Korean government hackers were caught targeting security researchers working in vulnerability research and development. \nSuspect in leak investigation \nTwo days after receiving the Apple threat notification, Gibson contacted a forensic expert with extensive experience investigating spyware attacks. After performing an initial analysis of Gibson’s phone, the expert did not find any signs of infection, but still recommended a deeper forensic analysis of the exploit developer’s phone.  \nA forensic analysis would have entailed sending the expert a complete backup of the device, something Gibson said he was not comfortable with.  \n“Recent cases are getting tougher forensically, and some we find nothing on. It may also be that the attack was not actually fully sent after the initial stages, we don’t know,” the expert told TechCrunch. \nWithout a full forensic analysis of Gibson’s phone, ideally one where investigators found traces of the spyware and who made it, it’s impossible to know why he was targeted or who targeted him.  \nBut Gibson told TechCrunch that he believes the threat notification he received from Apple is connected to the circumstances of his departure from Trenchant, where he claims that the company designated him as a scapegoat for a damaging leak of internal tools.  \nApple sends out threat notifications specifically for when it has evidence that a person was targeted by a mercenary spyware attack. This kind of surveillance technology is often invisibly and remotely planted on someone’s phone without their knowledge by exploiting vulnerabilities in the phone’s software, exploits that can be worth millions of dollars and can take months to develop. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies typically have the legal authority to deploy spyware on targets, not the spyware makers themselves. \nSara Banda, a spokesperson for Trenchant’s parent company L3Harris, declined to comment for this story when reached by TechCrunch before publication.  \nA month before he received Apple’s threat notification, when Gibson was still working at Trenchant, he said he was invited to go to the company’s London office for a team-building event.  \nWhen Gibson arrived February 3, he was immediately summoned into a meeting room to speak via video call with Peter Williams, Trenchant’s then-general manager who was known inside the company as “Doogie.” (In 2018, defense contractor L3Harris acquired zero-day makers Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, two sister startups that merged to become Trenchant.) \nWilliams told Gibson the company suspected he was double employed and was thus suspending him. All of Gibson’s work devices would be confiscated and analyzed as part of an internal investigation into the allegations. Williams could not be reached for comment. \n“I was in shock. I didn’t really know how to react because I couldn’t really believe what I was hearing,” said Gibson, who explained that a Trenchant IT employee then went to his apartment to pick up his company-issued equipment.  \nAround two weeks later, Gibson said Williams called and told him that following the investigation, the company was firing him and offering him a settlement agreement and payment. Gibson said Williams declined to explain what the forensic analysis of his devices had found, and essentially told him he had no choice but to sign the agreement and depart the company. \nFeeling like he had no alternative, Gibson said he went along with the offer and signed.  \nGibson told TechCrunch he later heard from former colleagues that Trenchant suspected he had leaked some unknown vulnerabilities in Google’s Chrome browser, tools that Trenchant had developed. Gibson, and three former colleagues of his, however, told TechCrunch he did not have access to Trenchant’s Chrome zero-days, given that he was part of the team exclusively developing iOS zero-days and spyware. Trenchant teams only have strictly compartmentalized access to tools related to the platforms they are working on, the people said.  \n“I know I was a scapegoat. I wasn’t guilty. It’s very simple,” said Gibson. “I didn’t do absolutely anything other than working my ass off for them.”  \nThe story of the accusations against Gibson’ and his subsequent suspension and firing was independently corroborated by three former Trenchant employees with knowledge.  \nTwo of the other former Trenchant employees said they knew details of Gibson’s London trip and were aware of suspected leaks of sensitive company tools. \nAll of them asked not to be named but believe Trenchant got it wrong. \n",

    "body": "\nAn outage on Monday affected web hosting giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), which took out vast swathes of the web, including websites, banks, and some government services. On Monday afternoon, the company offered an update on the cause of the issue and said it was working to restore services. At 6:01 PM ET, Amazon said all AWS services had returned to normal operations.\nIn an announcement on the Amazon website, the company shared that the underlying issue was related to DNS resolution. DNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that converts web addresses into IP addresses so that customer apps and websites can load. While some glitches can be resolved quickly, DNS issues can sometimes take longer to resolve.\n“AWS reported increased error rates for multiple services and determined that the issue was related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoints in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region,” the announcement stated. “The underlying DNS issue was fully mitigated at 2:24 AM PDT.”\nThough the issue itself was fixed, Amazon needed more time to “fully restore service” which it said it was doing “as quickly as possible.” The company also said that the issue affected Amazon.com and its subsidiaries, as well as AWS customer support operations.\nAmazon said on Monday evening Eastern time that the outage had been “fully mitigated” and that most services are returning to normal after an hours-long stretch during which much of the internet could not load. \nSeveral major apps were not working. Coinbase, Fortnite, Signal, Perplexity, Venmo, and Zoom faced lengthy outages, as did Amazon’s own services, including its Ring video surveillance products. The outage even disrupted Eight Sleep’s cooling pods, disturbing the sleep of users.\nMillions of companies and organizations rely on AWS to host their websites, apps, and other critical online systems. The company has data centers all over the world, and Amazon is said to have at least 30% of the total cloud market.\nBefore this, the most recent global internet outage was in 2024, when cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike published a buggy update to its anti-malware engine, causing millions of computers around the world to crash and resulting in airport delays and mass outages. Systems globally took several days to return to normal.\nPrior to that, a malfunction at DNS provider Akamai in 2021 caused some of the world’s largest websites to drop off the internet for several hours, including FedEx, Steam, and the PlayStation Network.\nAmazon advised customers to refer to the AWS Health Dashboard for more detailed information on the outage and how it was being resolved. \n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAirbnb announced new features today that will help users connect with fellow travelers while participating in the same activity. The company is also improving search by suggesting properties that you might have missed due to your filters, and has redesigned the Maps view to let you search for points of interest such as nearby landmarks, attractions, and restaurants.\nEarlier this year, Airbnb launched Experiences, activities like cooking classes and guided tours that travelers can book and enjoy with other travelers. At the time, the company hinted that the Airbnb app would lean toward fostering connections with fellow travelers. The company is now releasing a few features in that direction.\nImage Credits: Airbnb\nFirst, when you book an experience, you will be able to see the names of other people who are in the same experience, along with where they are from. Once the event is over, you can connect with others you met during the experience to exchange photos or make further plans through the app’s chat feature after sending them a message request. Users will also see people they met in a new Connections tab on their profile.\nAirbnb said it has thought carefully about privacy, and the app gives you full control over sharing information with others. When you book an experience, you will get a pop-up asking if you want to share your profile picture, name, and where you are from. If you dismiss that, the app defaults to “don’t share,” and others will only see the picture and initials you choose to share.\nImage Credits: Airbnb\nThe company added that you can always block and report other users if you feel uncomfortable, and the community team will review your report. Plus, you can always remove the connection even after accepting a request.\nDuring the company’s summer release in May, it teased these features with the goal of increasing interaction between users that could result in more bookings for both properties and experiences. However, it will have to deal with the moderation issues that any chat-based social platform faces.\nImprovements to search and AI assistant expansion\nAs part of its winter release, the company is introducing a new search experience to show properties just outside users’ search criteria. To do this, the company will show three kinds of new scrollable lists (called carousels) in the search results. The first one will show properties that might be just outside your chosen price range; the second will show properties that might not have some of the amenities, such as a pool, that you selected; and the third one will show properties in nearby locations that would fit your criteria.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company said it observed that people often change search parameters to look at different properties and even book ones that are outside their initial constraints. With this new search experience, it is proactively showing some of those properties.\nAirbnb is also improving its maps view, which will now show points of interest around you, including landmarks, attractions, and restaurants. You can tap on these places to see a description and how far they are from your rental property or the location you’re considering. This is possibly another move to encourage people to use Airbnb more, even when they are traveling.\nThe travel tech company said earlier this year that it was rolling out an AI-powered assistant for customer service in the U.S. With this release, the bot is expanding to Mexico and Canada with support for English, Spanish, and French.\nThe company said that the assistant will now provide more detailed answers based on your profile, history, and reservation. Plus, the app will now provide users with quick action cards within the chat for tasks like cancellations or date changes.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTwo years after revamping its developer programs and pricing, X is expanding the closed beta of a pay-per-use plan for its API to more developers.\nThe social network is accepting applications from developers who want to be a part of the program, the company’s developer account wrote in a post on X.\n“We are expanding a closed beta to both new & power users who want to ship amazing apps on X,” the post read.\n\nAnnouncing our beta launch: X API pay-per-use model.We are expanding a closed beta to both new & power users who want to ship amazing apps on X. All selected users will receive a $500 voucher to build with the X API. 🤑💻🚀 pic.twitter.com/Rc6KxMIPOZ— Developers (@XDevelopers) October 20, 2025\n\nX’s new API page shows the costs of different kinds of requests, such as reading, creating posts, DMs, trends and pulling bookmarks. The page also has a calculator that lets developers estimate how much a bundle of API usage might cost. This differs from X’s older system, where all requests cost the same.\nA section on the new API page compares the new pricing with the old tier-based system. It is not yet clear if X eventually wants to get rid of the older plan-based system. We have asked X to clarify and will update this story if we hear back.\nX’s new pay-per-use model won’t have monthly tier caps. Image Credits: X\nThe closed beta comes two years after X overhauled its API pricing. In early 2023, the company started blocking third-party clients of the app, and in February 2023, the company said that it was ending free access to its API, which resulted in various apps shutting down. \nThen in March 2023, the social network introduced a $100-per-month basic tier (which now costs $200 per month) as well as a $42,000-per-month enterprise tier. A few months later, it launched a $5,000-per-month Pro plan that gave developers the ability to fetch 1 million tweets per month and post 300,000 tweets per month, and gives them access to the full archive search endpoint.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHowever, the plans proved insufficient or were simply unaffordable for a lot of developers. To mitigate this, the company last year launched top-up packs for applications that hit their API tier limits. \nWith this new usage-based plan, X could win back developers who wanted to integrate their app with the social network, or intend to build applications that work with it.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIn a region long defined by fragmented enterprise systems, outdated compliance tools, and HR software that rarely talks to finance, Cercli is building a unified alternative for MENA businesses with AI at its core.\nThe Dubai-based startup, founded by ex-Careem operators Akeed Azmi and David Reche, has announced an oversubscribed $12 million Series A round led by European VC Picus Capital.\nCercli today looks slightly different from the company that raised a $4 million seed round last year. It is rebuilding a Rippling-like stack for the MENA region, but making it AI-native from the ground up.\nOver the past year, that bet has paid off. The company says it has scaled revenue more than 10x and now processes over $100 million in payroll annually for multiple businesses across 50 countries.\nBut in a crowded HR-tech market—where dozens of startups such as Deel and Remote, alongside incumbents like SAP and Oracle, already promise everything from cross-border payments to payroll — why does the market need another HR tech player? CEO Azmi hopes its AI-first rebuild may be the edge that sets it apart.\nAzmi started Cercli to help enterprises with basic people operations, an issue he and Reche noticed at their previous employers, Careem and Kitopi, two of MENA’s best-known unicorns.\nWith payroll spread across multiple systems and compliance varying by region, the first version of Cercli focused on a platform that consolidated human resources management, payroll, and compliance for MENA-based companies operating globally.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut Azmi says it envisioned a bigger opportunity if it baked in AI. So, over the past three months, Azmi says the company has rewritten its entire payroll engine to be multi-country and agent-compatible, enabling it to scale more efficiently across global jurisdictions.\n“The legacy systems of the last 20 years—your SAPs, Oracles, Workdays—they were built for on-prem and the cloud. Now we’re entering an AI-native world,” Azmi said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We didn’t want to just integrate AI; we wanted to rethink the whole stack for how people and agents work together.”\nIt’s also done the same to its recruitment module. Cercli now offers agent-driven features that can surface candidate lists, source from internal datasets, and run background logic on hiring fit.\nIt’s own internal operations run on AI, as the company uses custom-built treasury and reconciliation agents to manage its own finances and accounting. That’s how the 14-person team closed its Series A while maintaining a 21% month-to-month revenue growth rate, according to Azmi.\nCercliImage Credits:Cercli\nBeyond AI, the founder believes Cercli’s other strength lies in consolidation. Although plenty of multi-module HR competitors exist — including Deel, Rippling, BambooHR — MENA companies are often stitching their back office together from point solutions. A company might use different products for expense management, payroll or recruiting.\n“Customers are asking for everything in one place, and being AI-native allows us to build that unified experience far more quickly,” Azmi explained.\nAzmi said Cercli’s AI-native architecture lets it onboard customers quickly, as well. Setup can occur in two to three days, compared to several months typical with legacy systems, he claims. This has helped the two-year-old HR-tech startup win clients from startups to multinationals, including Vision Bank, the Global Climate Finance Centre, Huspy, Lean Technologies, and Ziina.\nCercli is also the first MENA investment for Picus Capital. This firm has backed other global HR companies like Personio, Multiplier, Deel, Maki, and JetHR.\nOther investors who participated in this Series A round include Knollwood Investment Advisory as well as existing investors Y Combinator, Afore Capital, and COTU Ventures.\nAs part of the investment, the company plans to build new AI-native products and work on gaining more market share in the $5.8 billion HR software opportunity in MENA.\n“We’ve seen this business model succeed globally within our portfolio, and we are excited to back Cercli as they continue to grow market share through new customers and product launches,” said Robin Godenrath, founding partner at Picus Capital.\n",

    "body": "\nYelp is releasing multiple AI-powered updates Tuesday, including an updated AI assistant that can answer questions about restaurants, bars, local attractions, or retailers. The assistant can also scan a physical menu to provide information about dishes. Additionally, the company is improving search with support for natural language and voice queries, and highlighting popular offerings on business pages, including auto shops, hair salons, clothing stores, and parks. \nThe company launched an AI-powered assistant last year to help you connect with the right services by describing your problem. Yelp is now using similar technology to answer questions about other kinds of businesses, including a restaurant, bar, local attraction, and retailer. The assistant uses information from a business’s page, website, reviews, and photos to provide answers. For instance, you can ask about the kinds of animals you might see at a zoo.\nYelp is displaying pre-written questions on business pages based on frequently asked questions, so you don’t have to type them out yourself. The company said that the assistant for services will now remember your preferences and give you tailored recommendations for your next project.\nThe company is also improving search by allowing users to type questions in everyday language directly into the search box. The app will support these conversational queries through voice search.\nUntil now, Yelp has highlighted popular dishes and drinks on restaurant and bar pages. The company will now also show popular desserts on food outlets’ pages. Additionally, the company is expanding this feature to more than 100 business categories. Users will be able to see the top services offered by an outlet in a “most mentioned” section on each page — for instance, popular haircuts or color treatments at a salon.\nYelp is adding another AI-powered feature that helps diners explore menu items. Using AI image recognition, users can scan a physical menu with their phone camera and overlay bubbles will appear on screen over different dishes. Tap a bubble to see photos of that dish and read what diners have said about it.\nWith these new features, the company is making search more visual and conversational. In response to the rise of chat-style search tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity, established players like Google have also added similar features to their search and Maps to aid the discovery of new places.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEarlier this year, the company previewed AI-powered voice agents for restaurants and services businesses. With its new update, these tools are now available to businesses. The company’s AI host can take bookings, answer questions, handle special requests, and change reservations for restaurants. Its AI receptionist for services businesses can gather project details, help qualify leads, and send call summaries to the business’s Yelp inbox. Other companies like Square and Kea are also providing AI-powered voice solutions for restaurants and order management.\nWith this fall release, Yelp is also launching several additional features: AI-generated videos that compile user photos and narrate information about restaurants and bars; expanded video uploads (from 10 to 30 seconds); a new visual summary of restaurants and bars using photos and videos; grouped before-and-after photos for service businesses; and a new section for planning future projects.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple has rolled out a new feature that makes it easier to customize Liquid Glass to your liking. Now users will be able to set the appearance of Liquid Glass to either Clear or Tinted, with the help of a new setting included in the latest beta update of its mobile and desktop operating systems.\nThe addition indicates Apple is listening closely to user feedback in these early days of the iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 public launches. Apples likes to push through more significant changes, but it will often offer a fallback option for those who have a hard time adjusting.\nThat was the case when Apple moved Safari’s address to the bottom of the screen in 2021. After some user backlash over the then controversial decision, the iPhone maker added an option to revert the bar to the top of the screen. (Apple, we’ll concede, was right to make the move; the bar’s location is better when it’s in easier reach of your thumbs.)\nNow Apple is taking a similar approach with Liquid Glass.\nThe new user interface that shipped with iOS 26 and other Apple operating systems was the company’s biggest design overhaul since its move from a skeuomorphic to flat design back in 2013. As with most changes of this scale and significance, not everybody has been on board.\nSome have said the Liquid Glass design makes various parts of the interface harder to read, including notifications or navigation controls in apps like Apple Music and others. Others have said they love Liquid Glass’s attention to detail and its new look, which felt like a more modern update to an interface that had grown stale over the years.\nWith another potential divisive response on its hands, Apple is now ceding some control over Liquid Glass’s appearance back to the users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nThe new feature, first spotted by 9to5Mac, arrived in iOS 26.1 beta 4 and the accompanying updates for tablets and desktop computers.\nReached for comment, Apple told TechCrunch that, during the beta period this summer, it heard from some users who wanted the option to set a more opaque look for Liquid Glass. This new setting that lets users personalize Liquid Glass is available in iOS 26.1, iPadOS 26.1, and macOS 26.1.\nTo access the feature, beta users can visit the “Display & Brightness” menu under Settings to find the added Liquid Glass menu option. On Mac, it’s under “Appearance” in System Settings. The control lets you choose between two options, Clear and Tinted. The latter increases the opacity of interface elements, making them easier to see. \n\nThough some users had been advocating for a slider that lets them control the opacity more precisely, Apple has opted for a toggle where it specifies the two levels of tint that users can choose from. \nApple told TechCrunch that any developers who have already implemented Liquid Glass in their apps will automatically have the user’s preference applied. Developers are able to test this now in the 26.1 developer beta.\nAfter selecting their preferred option, users will see changes across user interface elements, like the Now Playing controls, Notifications on the Lock Screen, and in Apple’s apps and those from third-party developers. \nWhile the beta feature arrives for developers today, the public beta should arrive over the next few days ahead of the wider public release. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei published a statement Tuesday to “set the record straight” on the company’s alignment with Trump administration AI policy,",
    "body": "\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei published a statement Tuesday to “set the record straight” on the company’s alignment with Trump administration AI policy, responding to what he called “a recent uptick in inaccurate claims about Anthropic’s policy stances.” \n“Anthropic is built on a simple principle: AI should be a force for human progress, not peril,” Amodei wrote. “That means making products that are genuinely useful, speaking honestly about risks and benefits, and working with anyone serious about getting this right.” \nAmodei’s response comes after last week’s dogpiling on Anthropic from AI leaders and top members of the Trump administration, including AI czar David Sacks and White House senior policy advisor for AI Sriram Krishnan — all accusing the AI giant of stoking fears to damage the industry.  \nThe first hit came from Sacks after Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark shared his hopes and “appropriate fears” about AI, including that AI is a powerful, mysterious, “somewhat unpredictable” creature, not a dependable machine that’s easily mastered and put to work.  \nSacks’s response: “Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering. It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.”  \nCalifornia Senator Scott Wiener, author of AI safety bill SB 53, defended Anthropic, calling out President Trump’s “effort to ban states from acting on AI w/o advancing federal protections.” Sacks then doubled down, claiming Anthropic was working with Wiener to “impose the Left’s vision of AI regulation.” \nFurther commentary ensued, with anti-regulation advocates like Groq COO Sunny Madra saying that Anthropic was “causing chaos for the entire industry” by advocating for a modicum of AI safety measures instead of unfettered innovation. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn his statement, Amodei said managing the societal impacts of AI should be a matter of “policy over politics,” and that he believes everyone wants to ensure America secures its lead in AI development while also building tech that benefits the American people. He defended Anthropic’s alignment with the Trump administration in key areas of AI policy and called out examples of times he personally played ball with the president.  \nFor example, Amodei pointed to Anthropic’s work with the federal government, including the firm’s offering of Claude to the federal government and Anthropic’s $200 million agreement with the Department of Defense (which Amodei called “the Department of War,” echoing Trump’s preferred terminology, though the name change requires congressional approval). He also noted that Anthropic publicly praised Trump’s AI Action Plan and has been supportive of Trump’s efforts to expand energy provision to “win the AI race.” \nDespite these shows of cooperation, Anthropic has caught heat from industry peers from stepping outside the Silicon Valley consensus on certain policy issues. \nThe company first drew ire from Silicon Valley-linked officials when it opposed a proposed 10-year ban on state-level AI regulation, a provision that faced widespread bipartisan pushback. \nMany in Silicon Valley, including leaders at OpenAI, have claimed that state AI regulation would slow down the industry and hand China the lead. Amodei countered that the real risk is that the U.S. continues to fill China’s data centers with powerful AI chips from Nvidia, adding that Anthropic restricts the sale of its AI services to China-controlled companies despite revenue hits.  \n“There are products we will not build and risks we will not take, even if they would make money,” Amodei said. \nAnthropic also fell out of favor with certain power players when it supported California’s SB 53, a light-touch safety bill that requires the largest AI developers to make frontier model safety protocols public. Amodei noted that the bill has a carve-out for companies with annual gross revenue below $500 million, which would exempt most startups from any undue burdens.  \n“Some have suggested that we are somehow interested in harming the startup ecosystem,” Amodei wrote, referring to Sacks’s post. “Startups are among our most important customers. We work with tens of thousands of startups and partner with hundreds of accelerators and VCs. Claude is powering an entirely new generation of AI-native companies. Damaging that ecosystem makes no sense for us.” \nIn his statement, Amodei said it has grown from a $1 billion to $7 billion run-rate over the last nine months while managing to deploy “AI thoughtfully and responsibly.” \n“Anthropic is committed to constructive engagement on matters of public policy. When we agree, we say so. When we don’t, we propose an alternative for consideration,” Amodei wrote. “We are going to keep being honest and straightforward, and will stand up for the policies we believe are right. The stakes of this technology are too great for us to do otherwise.” \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "description": "\nPeriodic Labs, a new startup by one of OpenAI’s most respected researchers, Liam Fedus, and his former Google Brain colleague, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, came",
    "body": "\nPeriodic Labs, a new startup by one of OpenAI’s most respected researchers, Liam Fedus, and his former Google Brain colleague, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, came out of stealth last month with an enormous $300 million seed round. It was led by Andreessen Horowitz, with Felicis cutting the first check in, and included a who’s who of angels and other top VCs. \nThe startup began when Fedus had a conversation with Cubuk (whose friends call him Dogus) about seven months ago. Cubuk was one of Google Brain’s foremost machine learning and material science researchers. After endless Silicon Valley takes on how generative AI would radically change scientific discovery, they decided that the pieces were finally in place to make this a reality. Or at least to found a startup that attempted it.\n“There are a few things that happened in the LLM field, in experimental science and in simulations that kind of made this the right time,” Cubuk told TechCrunch. \nFor one, he said, robotic arms that could handle powder synthesis — the process of mixing and creating new materials — had recently proved themselves reliable. For another, machine learning simulations had become efficient and accurate enough to model complex physical systems such as those needed to develop new materials. \nAnd, third, LLMs now had powerful reasoning capabilities — in part through the work of Fedus and his team at OpenAI. Fedus was one of the small team that created ChatGPT to begin with and was running OpenAI’s uber-important post-training team, which refines models after their initial development.\nStitched together, the picture was clear: A simulation could theoretically discover new compounds, a robot could mix the materials, and an LLM could analyze the results and suggest course corrections. AI-automated material science was ready to be built.\nIn fact, in 2023 Cubuk was one of the researchers of the groundbreaking “GNoME” paper, a model training method for discovering new materials. He was also one of the researchers who published a paper that same year documenting a fully automated, robotic-powered lab that created 41 novel compounds from recipes suggested by language models\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEqually importantly, the founders realized that even failed experiments would be valuable for their new startup because data is the lifeblood of AI. AI science offered an entirely new source for real-world training and post-training data. This could, the founders believe, turn the existing scientific motivation system on its head, which seeks success, not exploration, rewarded via paper publication and grants.\n“Making contact with reality, bringing experiments into the [AI] loop — we feel like this is the next frontier,” Fedus told TechCrunch. \nFelicis wins the deal; OpenAI does not invest \nAfter that discussion with Cubuk, Fedus went to the powers that be at OpenAI to share his resignation and his plan. He then gleefully tweeted to the world that he was leaving with what appeared to be OpenAI’s blessing and investment.  \n\nThis is what I sent to my colleagues at OpenAI:Hi all, I made the difficult decision to leave OpenAI as an employee, but I’m looking to work closely together as a partner going forward. Contributing to the mission of OpenAI and working with world-class teams to create and…— William Fedus (@LiamFedus) March 17, 2025\n\nThat investment didn’t actually materialize, however. OpenAI is not a backer of Periodic, the founders confirmed to TechCrunch. And while Fedus declined to say why, they actually didn’t need OpenAI’s money.  \nFedus’ tweet set off a frenzy of VCs courting the company. “There was almost like a feeling of being reverse pitched. One investor actually wrote a love letter to Periodic Labs,” Fedus laughed, explaining that neither he nor Cubuk “knew what to make of it.” Others sent multi-page documents pitching themselves.\nBut the first call that they actually took was from Peter Deng, a former OpenAI colleague turned investor for top-tier seed firm Felicis. (Deng left OpenAI for Felicis at the start of 2025.)  \n“Liam is a very big deal within OpenAI, very well loved and an extremely impactful researcher,” Deng told TechCrunch. “When I heard he left, I texted him immediately.” \nDeng met Fedus for coffee in the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco. Hyped on caffeine and enthusiasm, Fedus invited Deng to finish their conversation on a walk over the area’s famously hilly terrain. Pitch walks may be a Silicon Valley trope, but they also really happen. \nThe chilly day had turned hot. Deng, wearing a sweater, sweated and scrambled to keep up with the fit and friendly Fedus until the founder said something that “literally stopped me in my tracks,” Deng told TechCrunch. He told Deng that “everyone talks about doing science, but in order to do science, you actually have to do science,” Deng recalls. \nIn other words, they needed to give AI a fully equipped wet lab to try its ideas in a real-world, controlled setting.\n“The truth about these models is that everything that the models know is within normal distribution. We take a bunch of data, and it can just regurgitate what it knows,” Deng said.  \nDiscovering something new has to involve testing hypotheses.  \n“And I committed on the spot, in the middle of the hills of Noe Valley, to write the check,” Deng says.  \nFedus also remembers the moment Deng asked how he could be involved, and Fedus told him the startup needed cash for laptops and a temporary office. And “he’s like, great, I’ll give you money right now. And it was just this huge vote of confidence.”  \nBut Deng didn’t actually whip out his checkbook on the street. He went back to the office elated over the deal only to encounter Felicis’ lawyer, who pointed out that the firm couldn’t promptly sign a contract: The company wasn’t incorporated yet. It didn’t even have a name, much less a bank account to wire funds. “That’s how early we were.” Deng grinned. \nSoon they had all of those things and all the term sheets they could handle. With the $300 million war chest, Cubuk and Fedus hired over two dozen of the most prestigious AI and scientific talent like Alexandre Passos (a creator of o1 and o3); Eric Toberer (a materials scientist who has already made key superconductor discoveries); and Matt Horton, a creator of two of Microsoft’s GenAI materials science tools. And the list goes on. \nBecause the team members are all experts in different areas, from AI to physics, each week one of them gives a grad-level lecture to the others. “We do feel like a tight coupling is extremely important,” Cubuk said. He wants everyone to understand all parts of what they are building. \nPeriodic Labs has already set up its lab, too, and is working with experimental data, simulations and testing some predictions. The main initial mission is to find new superconductor materials — potentially a gold mine discovery. Improved superconductors could power the next era of potent, but lower energy-consuming tech. \nBut the last part — the robots — are not yet up and running. “They will take a bit to train,” Cubuk said. \nAll of this is, of course, a big swing for the fences. AI powered or not, scientific discovery is not typically fast, easy, or predictable. While this team of experts has some indications that they will find what they are looking for — or make other discoveries along the way (or simply generate valuable data on their failures), there’s no guarantees.\nAnd we know that model makers themselves are inching their way toward more AI science. Last month, OpenAI VP Kevin Weil said he was launching an OpenAI for Science unit at the company to “build the next great scientific instrument: an AI-powered platform that accelerates scientific discovery.”\nAs for the investor who wrote the love letter, he didn’t win the deal (although Fedus did say that the letter was “very flattering.”) The other seed investors include DST, Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Accel, and angel backers like Jeff Bezos, Elad Gil, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Dean. \nElad Gil will be speaking about how AI has changed the startup landscape at Disrupt in San Francisco on October 29. \nCorrection: This story updated the lead of the seed round and to include a reference to Cubuk’s  groundbreaking materials science research paper.\n",

    "description": "\nFor most enterprise companies, AI is either a promise that has yet to deliver or a security risk. The effort of Lithuania’s most famous entrepreneur ",
    "body": "\nFor most enterprise companies, AI is either a promise that has yet to deliver or a security risk. The effort of Lithuania’s most famous entrepreneur duo to solve that conundrum has garnered attention — and funding.\nJust months after Nexos.ai came out of stealth with an $8 million funding round led by Index Ventures, Nord Security co-founders Tomas Okmanas and Eimantas Sabaliauskas have closed a €30 million Series A (approximately $35 million) for this new startup —  a a platform that helps companies adopt AI tools securely by acting as a middleman between employees and AI systems.\nIn Okmanas’ view, “the biggest corporate data leak” is currently in the making, as employees upload sensitive information to LLMs. Rather than banning AI use, he wants Nexos.ai to act as a “Switzerland for LLMs,” serving as a neutral intermediary. By sitting between teams and AI tools, the platform aims to keep data under control without sacrificing the productivity gains companies want but fear pursuing.\nThat combination of seasoned founders tackling a critical enterprise problem explains why this new round was raised so soon — with Index and Evantic Capital co-leading at a €300 million valuation (approximately $350 million), according to a company spokesperson. Previous backers Creandum and Dig Ventures also participated, along with angel backers, including the CEOs of Datadog, Klarna, Supercell, and Wix.\nEvantic, the new venture firm launched by former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Miller, was persistent enough to make the round happen even though Nexos.ai wasn’t fundraising, said Okmanas. He and Sabaliauskas famously bootstrapped their previous businesses, including Nord, the $3 billion cybersecurity company behind NordVPN. But they now see the value-add from VCs.\nIn addition to Index’s support, Nexos.ai is now benefiting from Miller’s guidance and his ‘Legends’ network —140 operators who advise Evantic’s portfolio startups in exchange for a share of the fund’s profits. Okmanas said he is both a Legend himself and drawing on others’ expertise to shape the product — which is where the new capital will go.\nCurrently, Nexos’ AI product consists of an AI Workspace interface for employees and an AI Gateway for developers. The gateway acts as a control layer for security, cost management, and compliance oversight while reducing fragmentation, which Okmanas sees as a key barrier to AI adoption. The gateway provides a single access point to some 200 AI models, and the company plans to use its funding to accelerate its support of private models for sensitive data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOkmanas said his team is currently doing 50 to 60 demo calls a week, but anticipates that traditional businesses will have “a lot of homework” to do to convince their boards about how they want to adopt AI. Nexos.ai could help them by making deployment easier. But first, the startup is focusing on tech-savvy companies that already use AI daily, as well as companies operating in regulated industries, which have concerns about governance and sending sensitive data to AI models hosted in foreign countries.\nOkmanas and Sabaliauskas identified the AI governance gap while overseeing the portfolio of Tesonet, their company that builds and invests in startups. Tesonet portfolio companies are also among the customers that Nexos.ai is disclosing, alongside Bulgarian fintech unicorn Payhawk, which also has an office in Vilnius. According to a press release, the funding will now support expansion across Europe and North America.\nFor Okmanas, the mission is removing barriers to broader AI adoption. While boards debate whether AI can deliver real value, he points to results within Tesonet’s own portfolio: at Hostinger, a web hosting provider, an AI assistant reduced the need for human support. Says Okmanas, “That’s why we didn’t need to hire 500 people and saved €10 million this year alone.”\nDespite talking numbers at Hostinger, Okmanas declined to disclose how much revenue Nexos.ai itself is generating. Instead, he said that by the time the company celebrates its first anniversary, the team will have grown to 100 people — mostly in Europe, where data sovereignty concerns have also started to open doors for Nexos.ai at public institutions, potentially opening up a new market beyond its enterprise focus.\nThe headline of this story has been corrected for accuracy. \n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

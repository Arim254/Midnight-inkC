Lores, who has been the chair of PayPal’s board since July 2024, will also take up the role of president.\nPayPal said the appointment was made because company’s pace of change and execution was “not in line with the Board’s expectations” given broader market trends.\nChriss joined PayPal in September 2023 from Ituit, succeeding Dan Schulman. PayPal’s CFO and COO, Jamie Miller, will take over as interim CEO until Lores joins the company.\nThe appointment comes as PayPal on Tuesday reported lower-than-expected revenue and profit in the fourth quarter, as consumer spending dipped amid a broader cost of living crisis and a softening labor market. The company also forecast a dip in its full-year profit, which surprised investors, as Wall Street had broadly expected the company to forecast growth instead. \nPayPal’s shares were down about 17.9% in premarket trading on Tuesday.\nLores, who served as President and CEO of HP for over six years, said that apart from product innovation, PayPal will hold itself accountable for delivering quarterly accounts.\n“The payments industry is changing faster than ever, driven by new technologies, evolving regulations, an increasingly competitive landscape, and the rapid acceleration of AI that is reshaping commerce daily. PayPal sits at the center of this change, and I look forward to leading the team to accelerate the delivery of new innovations and to shape the future of digital payments and commerce,” Lores said in a statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Fintech\n\n",

    "body": "\nThe developer of the popular open source text editor Notepad++ has confirmed that hackers hijacked the software to deliver malicious updates to users over the course of several months in 2025.\nIn a blog post published Monday, Notepad++ developer Don Ho said that the cyberattack was likely carried out by hackers associated with the Chinese government between June and December 2025, citing multiple analyses by security experts who examined the malware payloads and attack patterns. Ho said this “would explain the highly selective targeting” seen during the campaign.\nRapid7, which investigated the incident, attributed the hacking to Lotus Blossom, a long-running espionage group known to work for China, and said the hacks targeted government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.\nNotepad++ is one of the longest-running open source projects, spanning more than two decades, and it counts at least tens of millions of downloads to date, including by employees at organizations around the world.  \nAccording to Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who first discovered the cyberattack and wrote up his findings in December, the hackers compromised a small number of organizations “with interests in East Asia” after someone unwittingly used a tainted version of the popular software. Beaumont said that the hackers were able to gain “hands-on” access to the computers of victims who were running hijacked versions of Notepad++. \nHo said that the “exact technical mechanism” of how the hackers broke into his servers remains under investigation, but provided some details as to how the attack went down. \nIn the blog, Ho said that Notepad++’s website was hosted on a shared hosting server. The attackers “specifically targeted” Notepad++’s web domain with the goal of exploiting a bug in the software to redirect some users to a malicious server run by the hackers. This allowed the hackers to deliver malicious updates to certain users who had requested a software update, until the bug was fixed in November and the hackers’ access was terminated in early December.\n“We do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented,” wrote Ho. \nIn an email, Ho told TechCrunch that his hosting provider confirmed his shared server was compromised but that the provider did not say how the hackers initially broke in.\nHo apologized for the incident, and urged users to download the most recent version of his software, which contains a fix for the bug.\nThe cyberattack targeting Notepad++ users is somewhat reminiscent of the 2019-2020 cyberattack affecting customers of SolarWinds, a software company that makes IT and network management tools for large Fortune 500 organizations, including government departments. Russian government spies hacked into the company’s servers and secretly planted a backdoor in its software, allowing the Russian spies to access data on those customers’ networks once the update had rolled out.\nThe SolarWinds breach affected several government agencies, including Homeland Security and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice, and State.\nUpdated with a response from Ho and with additional details from Rapid7.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTwo Stanford students announced Monday that they have raised $2 million for an accelerator program called Breakthrough Ventures, which aims to fund businesses founded by college students and recent graduates nationwide.\nRoman Scott and Itbaan Nafi began building the accelerator program after hosting a series of popular Demo Days at Stanford starting in 2024 and decided to expand it after students were achieving success.\n“This fundraise turns Breakthrough from just being a seasonal accelerator into a lifelong partnership with our founders,” Nafi, who is still a master’s candidate at Stanford, told TechCrunch. \nScott received his undergraduate degree from Stanford in 2024 and went on to earn a master’s degree there the following year.\nEarly last year, the duo tapped Raihan Ahmed to lead the accelerator and then got to work, officially fundraising from the likes of Mayfield and Collide Capital (as well as a slew of Stanford founder alumni) to back the next generation of AI, health, consumer, deep tech, and sustainability companies. Scott said what makes their accelerator different is that it is specifically built “for student founders by student founders.”\nStudent programs like this aren’t new. UC Berkeley offers a similar program called Free Ventures for students seeking pre-seed funding, and MIT has its own Sandbox Innovation Fund. Even Stanford has some accelerator programs, both run by or affiliated with the school, such as StartX, LaunchPad, and Cardinal Ventures.\n“Students have enjoyed how we’ve brought together so many others from different American colleges,” Nafi said of his program, comparing it to Stanford’s Treehacks hackathon. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Breakthrough’s purpose is to fill in the funding and opportunity gap that exists in many of these ecosystems because students have historically lacked access to capital and the networks required to launch their entrepreneurial pursuits,” Scott added. \nBreakthrough will have a hybrid model, with in-person meetups at local powerhouse VC firms, culminating in a Demo Day at Stanford. Those participating in the program get access to grant funding (up to $10,000), compute credits (through Microsoft and the Nvidia Inception program), legal support, mentorship, “along with the opportunity to receive a $50,000 follow-on investment at the conclusion of the program,” Nafi said.\n“We’ve nailed the student-founder experience to a T,” Nafi said. “Hence why we offer the resources we do and have structured the program in this way. Students really feel like we get them, and that’s because we are students.” \nThe duo hopes to deploy the fund over three years, aiming to incubate at least 100 companies. Overall, Nafi hopes this fund will help grow Breakthrough into “the hub for Gen Z entrepreneurship and thought leadership,” specifically given the anxiety many young people feel about their economic future.\nApplications for the latest cohort open today. \n“We hope that by supporting young entrepreneurs, we’re able to uplift as many stories as possible to then inspire many more across the world to use the tools and knowledge around them to pursue entrepreneurship not only to change their communities, but also gain economic stability for themselves and their families,” Nafi said. \nThis piece was updated to correct the name of one of the investment firms. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFirefox will begin catering to those who don’t want AI in their browser. On Monday, Mozilla announced that Firefox will soon let users block all current and future generative AI features. Users will also have the option to block certain AI features in Firefox, while keeping others.\nStarting with Firefox 148, which is rolling out on February 24, users will find a new AI controls section within the desktop browser settings. \nPeople who don’t want access to any AI features from Firefox can turn on the “Block AI enhancements” toggle. When this setting is turned on, they won’t see pop-ups or reminders to use existing or upcoming AI features. \nThe new AI controls will also let users manage AI features individually. These features include “Translations,” which allows you to browse the web in your preferred language, Alt text in PDFs, AI-enhanced tab grouping, link previews, and Firefox’s AI chatbot in the sidebar, which lets you use your chosen chatbot as you browse, including services like Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.\n“AI is changing the web, and people want very different things from it,” the company wrote in a blog post. “We’ve heard from many who want nothing to do with AI. We’ve also heard from others who want AI tools that are genuinely useful. Listening to our community, alongside our ongoing commitment to offer choice, led us to build AI controls.”\nThe announcement comes as Mozilla appointed Anthony Enzor-DeMeo as its CEO back in December. Enzor-DeMeo said at the time that Mozilla would be investing in AI and would add AI features to Firefox, but that the company would make these features optional.\n“AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it,” he wrote in a blog post. \nEnzor-DeMeo’s comments come as Mozilla scrambles to adapt in a rapidly changing browser market. Although browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome dominated the browser space for more than a decade, they are facing renewed competition from companies such as Perplexity, Arc, OpenAI, and Opera.\nWhile Mozilla plans to invest in new AI features, it’s also focused on transparency. CNBC reported last week that Mozilla President Mark Surman said he’s building “a rebel alliance of sorts” made up of tech startups, developers, and public-interest technologists committed to making AI more trustworthy and to checking the power of players like OpenAI and Anthropic. \nMozilla will deploy around $1.4 billion worth of reserves to support tech businesses and nonprofits, including its own, CNBC reports. The company is pursuing investments that promote AI transparency and push back against companies growing at historic speeds with limited oversight. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

If a match is found, that camera owner receives an alert and can optionally choose to share any related video clips with their neighbor who reported the pet missing. They’ll also have an option to call the owner or send them a message, without sharing their own phone number. \n Ring says the feature has been reuniting more than a dog per day since its launch. \nPreviously, Search Party was only available to customers with a Ring camera installed. The company is now making Search Party accessible to anyone through the Ring app.\n“Now, pet owners can mobilize the whole community—and communities are empowered to help—to find lost pets more effectively than ever before,” noted Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, in an announcement. “That’s why we believe it’s so important to make this feature available to anyone who shares a lost dog post in Neighbors,” he added, referring to the company’s Neighbors app for Ring customers.\n\n\n\nAlongside the launch and expansion, Amazon-owned Ring said it’s committing $1 million to equip animal shelters with Ring camera systems, and aims to aid 4,000 U.S. shelters. By adding the shelters to Ring’s network, the company hopes more lost dogs will be reunited with their owners.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company already works with other nonprofits, including Petco Love and Best Friends Animal Society, and is open to other partnerships.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

This initiative could deliver significant cost savings for customers and may increase Grubhub’s appeal in a fiercely competitive market.\nThe new Super Bowl advertisement stars actor George Clooney at an extravagant dinner party. As the host dramatically asks, “Who will eat the fees?” Clooney responds, “Grubhub will eat the fees.”\n\n​Grubhub says this is a permanent offering aimed at putting more money back in customers’ pockets amid challenging economic times. The company notes that delivery and service fees on orders over $50 usually average about $13 per transaction across food delivery apps.\n​Grubhub’s move to permanently eliminate fees on all orders over $50 stands out as a unique offer in the food delivery space. Neither DoorDash nor Uber Eats offers a permanent waiver of delivery and service fees on large orders. Their promotions are typically limited-time offers or tied to paid subscription services (such as DashPass or Uber One), which often apply only to select restaurants or are subject to other restrictions.\nAdditionally, this new offering comes as Grubhub faces challenges in user growth and trails behind its competitors. The delivery company, which was acquired by Marc Lore’s Wonder Group in 2024, saw its monthly active users decline by 20% year-over-year in 2025, to 8 million, according to marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower. DoorDash boasts nearly 50 million monthly active users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n​In addition to its new fee policy, Grubhub recently acquired Claim, a startup providing cash-back rewards at local restaurants, which customers can redeem for dine-in or pickup orders. With Claim, Grubhub aims to help more restaurants engage customers through personalized rewards programs. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

But as developers experiment with new interfaces and form factors for human-AI collaboration, it’s become hard for even the most advanced AI labs to keep up. \nThe current trend is for agentic software development — systems where AI agents can work independently on coding tasks — epitomized by the Claude Code and Cowork apps. In the meantime, OpenAI has been gradually building out its Codex tool, which launched as a command line tool last April and expanded to a web interface one month later.\nNow OpenAI is taking a major step toward catching up. On Monday, the company launched a new macOS app for Codex, integrating many of the agentic practices that have become popular in the past year. The new app is designed to work with multiple agents in parallel, integrating agent skills and other state-of-the-art workflows. The launch also comes less than two months after the launch of GPT-5.2-Codex, OpenAI’s most powerful coding model, which the company hopes will be enough to tempt over Claude Code users.\n“If you really want to do sophisticated work on something complex, 5.2 is the strongest model by far,” CEO Sam Altman told reporters on a press call. “However, it’s been harder to use, so taking that level of model capability and putting it in a more flexible interface, we think is going to matter quite a bit.”\nWhile Altman’s confidence in GPT-5.2 is understandable, coding benchmarks tell a more complicated story. GPT-5.2 does hold the top spot on TerminalBench (a test measuring how well AI handles command-line programming tasks), at least as of press time. But agents from Gemini 3 and Claude Opus have logged roughly equivalent scores — lower, but within the margin of error of the benchmark. Results from SWE-bench, another coding benchmark that tests AI’s ability to fix real-world software bugs, are similar, showing no clear advantage for GPT-5.2. However, agentic use cases have been difficult to benchmark effectively, and state-of-the-art models can vary significantly in user experience.\nThe Codex app also comes with a range of new features that OpenAI says will help it achieve parity or, in some cases, outpace the various Claude apps. The Codex app will allow for automations that can be set to run in the background on an automatic schedule, with results placed in a queue to be reviewed when the user returns. Users can also select different personalities for the agent — from pragmatic to empathetic — depending on their working style.\nBut for the company, the biggest selling point is the sheer speed of development that’s made possible by AI. “You can use this from a clean sheet of paper, brand new, to make a really quite sophisticated piece of software in a few hours,” Altman said. “As fast as I can type in new ideas, that is the limit of what can get built.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nFitbit founders James Park and Eric Friedman have announced the launch of a new AI startup called Luffu that aims to help families proactively monitor their health. The duo are developing an “intelligent family care system” that will start with an app experience and then expand into hardware devices. \nTwo years after their exit from Google, Park and Friedman are betting on AI to help lighten the mental burden of caregiving. According to a recent report, 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4 U.S. adults are family caregivers, up 45% from 10 years ago. \nLuffu uses AI in the background to gather and organize family information, learn day-to-day patterns, and flag notable changes so families can stay aligned and address potential wellbeing issues. \n“At Fitbit, we focused on personal health—but after Fitbit, health for me became bigger than just thinking about myself,” Park said in a press release. “I was caring for my parents from across the country, trying to piece together my mom’s health care across various portals and providers, with a language barrier that made it hard to get complete, timely context from her about doctor visits. I didn’t want to constantly check in, and she didn’t want to feel monitored. Luffu is the product we wished existed—to stay on top of our family’s health, know what changed and when to step in—without hovering.”\nImage Credits:Luffu\nThe pair note that today’s consumer health market is filled with tools for individuals, but that real life health is shared across partners, kids, parents, pets, and caregivers. Family information is scattered across devices, portals, calendars, attachments, spreadsheets, and paper documents. \nWith Luffu, people will be able to track the whole family’s details, including health stats, diet, medications, symptoms, lab tests, doctor visits, and more. Users can log health information using voice, text, or photos. Luffu proactively watches for changes, and surfaces insights and alerts, such as unusual vitals or changes in sleep. \nThe pair told Axios that people can ask questions using plain language to ask about their family’s health, such as “Is Dad’s new meal plan affecting his blood pressure?” or “Did someone give the dog his medication?” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We designed Luffu to capture the details as life happens, keep family members updated and surface what matters at the right time—so caregiving feels more coordinated and less chaotic,” Friedman said in the press release. \nPeople who are interested in Luffu can join the waitlist for the limited public beta.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTikTok has largely recovered from a slight dip in active users in the days following its ownership change, when a group of American investors took control of the video app’s operations in the United States. The decline, though brief, benefited competing video apps like UpScrolled and Skylight Social, which saw rapid user adoption as some looked for TikTok alternatives.\nAccording to estimates from digital market intelligence firm Similarweb, TikTok saw usage dip into the range of 86-88 million daily active users in the U.S. immediately after the ownership change. That compares with a typical average of 92 million daily active users.\nThe app has bounced back to more than 90 million daily active users, indicating that many who left TikTok have since returned.\nAsTikTok saw a small dip in usage, alternative video-sharing apps, UpScrolled and Skylight Social, began growing quickly. Although only a tiny fraction of TikTok’s size, UpScrolled topped 138,500 daily active users at its peak on January 28;  it has now dropped back down to 68,000.\nMeanwhile, Skylight Social hit 81,200 daily active users, according to Similarweb’s estimates and has since dropped to 56,300 daily active users. Overall, Skylight Social saw its user sign-ups increase to 380,000 as of late January, the company told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Similarweb\nTikTok’s usage decline, which prompted some to try the new apps, wasn’t driven by the ownership change directly, but rather by how users feared it would impact their TikTok experience. There were growing concerns about TikTok’s updated privacy policy, which gave the app permission to track users’ precise GPS location. (This addition could be related to TikTok’s tests of a “Nearby” feed to show users videos from local creators, but was added to the policy alongside the change in ownership, leading to user backlash over privacy concerns.)  \nWhen reading the privacy policy anew, some users also discovered disturbing language, like how TikTok said it may collect users’ “immigration status,” among other personal data. However, this turned out to be a reference that was included because of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which requires businesses to inform consumers if they collect certain sensitive data. TikTok does that — in the sense that anything someone shares on the platform in their video content technically becomes part of the platform, so it requires disclosure. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn addition, TikTok experienced an unfortunately timed, multi-day data center outage, which caused the app to not function properly, sometimes breaking search, likes, and comments, causing video glitches, disrupting the algorithm, and creating issues with the in-app chat. Users believed these glitches meant TikTok was now censoring their content, which sent them looking for alternatives.\nThe company announced on Sunday evening that the data center outage was resolved, chalking it up to a winter-storm-driven power outage. \nAs users made peace with the new terms and conditions and the outage-driven issues were resolved, users returned to the platform, Similarweb’s data shows. But there’s still hope for the newcomers, as the firm notes that TikTok’s usage has been slowly declining over the latter part of 2025, when usage peaked at 100 million daily active users from July to October 2025, compared with the 90+ million seen now.  \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe automotive industry has struggled to adopt hydrogen at scale, but industrial users and data centers might have better luck.\nVema Hydrogen inked a deal in December to supply California data centers, and now it has completed a pilot project in Quebec to power industry with hydrogen that it produces deep underground.\nThe startup drills wells in regions with specific types of iron-rich rock that release hydrogen gas when treated with water, heat, pressure, and some catalysts. Vema then draws the hydrogen to the surface and sells it to industrial users.\n“To supply the Quebec local market, which is about 100,000 tons per year, you would need 3 square kilometers, which is nothing,” Pierre Levin, CEO of Vema, told TechCrunch.\nVema’s first pilot well will produce several tons of hydrogen per day, and next year, it plans to drill its first commercial well, which will reach 800 meters into the Earth. Vema expects to produce hydrogen from the first wells for less than $1 per kilogram, a widely used benchmark for clean hydrogen. \nMost hydrogen today is made by a process known as steam reformation of methane (SMR), in which steam is used to break hydrogen molecules off methane from natural gas. It’s energy intensive, and both the process to make steam and the chemical reaction itself release carbon dioxide.\nLess polluting sources of hydrogen exist, but they tend to cost more. Hydrogen from SMR costs between 70 cents and $1.60 per kilogram, according to the IEA. Capturing carbon from SMR can add around 50% to those prices, while the cleanest process, which uses zero carbon electricity to power an electrolyzer, drives costs up several fold.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStimulated geologic hydrogen, or “engineered mineral hydrogen,” as Vema calls it, promises to be one of the cleanest sources of hydrogen, according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \nOnce Vema has refined its techniques, Levin expects it to produce hydrogen for less than 50 cents per kilogram. At that price, Vema’s hydrogen would be cheaper than any other source on the market.\nBecause the rocks that Vema is targeting are widely distributed, Levin said the company will drill wells close to companies that need power, including data centers. California, for example, has some of the largest formations of ophiolite, an iron-rich type of rock that was pushed up from the ocean bottom by plate tectonics. \nIf Vema can deliver hydrogen at the price it’s forecasting, then a quirk of geology could turn California into a mecca for data centers. “You have a ton of data centers who are trying to get some baseline, decarbonized electricity,” Levin said. “We have very strong traction with them.” \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPeak XV Partners, a leading venture capital firm in India and Southeast Asia, has seen a fresh round of senior departures. These follow other leadership exits over the past year as it pushes ahead with plans to deepen its focus on AI investing and expand its footprint in the U.S., while keeping India as its largest market.\nThe latest departures stem from an internal disagreement with senior partner Ashish Agrawal (pictured above, left) that led to a mutual decision to part ways, Managing Director Shailendra Singh told TechCrunch. He added that two other partners, Ishaan Mittal (pictured above, right) and Tejeshwi Sharma (pictured above, center), chose to leave alongside him.\nSingh said Peak XV did not want to go into the specifics of the disagreement and was focused on moving forward. “Just out of privacy, and out of, like, trying to be classy about it,” he said. Singh added that such departures were not uncommon at large, multi-stage venture firms and that Peak XV wanted to move on quickly after several years of working together.\nAll board seats held by the departing partners would be transitioned “imminently,” Singh said, noting that the firm already had overlapping representation across several portfolio companies. He said Peak XV was not concerned about continuity, noting that multiple general partners and operating partners were already involved across many of those boards.\nThe departures mark the exit of long-tenured investors from the firm. Agrawal had been with Peak XV for more than 13 years, while Ishaan Mittal spent over nine years at the firm and Tejeshwi Sharma more than seven years, per their LinkedIn profiles.\nAgrawal wrote in a LinkedIn post that he had decided to “take the entrepreneurial plunge” and was teaming up with Mittal and Sharma to start a new venture capital firm. He described the move as an opportunity to build a new institution with longtime partners and thanked Peak XV’s leadership for what he called a “truly wonderful partnership.”\nDuring his time at Peak XV, Agrawal led investments across fintech, consumer, and software, including Groww, one of the firm’s most prominent IPO exits in 2025. He also backed multiple early- and growth-stage companies alongside Mittal and Sharma, contributing to Peak XV’s broader portfolio build-out over the past decade.\nAgrawal, Mittal, and Sharma did not respond to messages for comments.\nPeak XV has also moved to strengthen its senior leadership from within. The firm on Tuesday promoted Abhishek Mohan to general partner, expanding its investment leadership bench, while Saipriya Sarangan was elevated to chief operating officer, taking charge of firm-wide operations.\nThe leadership changes come amid a standout year for Peak XV’s portfolio exits. Five of its companies — Groww, Pine Labs, Meesho, Wakefit, and Capillary Technologies — went public in November and December 2025, generating roughly ₹300 billion (around $3.33 billion) in unrealized, mark-to-market gains for the firm, in addition to about ₹28 billion (about $310.61 million) in realized gains from share sales during the IPOs.\nIn addition to the latest departures, Peak XV has seen a broader churn in its senior ranks over the past 12 months. Last year, long-time investment leaders Harshjit Sethi and Shailesh Lakhani exited the India team, while Abheek Anand and Pieter Kemps departed from the firm’s Southeast Asia operations. The firm has also seen leadership changes across its marketing, policy, and operations teams in recent months.\nSingh dismissed a view circulating in the market that many of the partners who drove Peak XV’s largest exits were no longer at the firm, calling the narrative “not statistically true.” He said several of the firm’s most significant outcomes had been led by long-tenured partners who remained at Peak XV, and argued that the firm’s exit track record did not hinge on any single individual.\nPeak XV currently has seven general partners, along with multiple partners and principals, according to Singh.\nThe VC firm, which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023 and currently manages over $10 billion in capital across 16 funds, has made about 80 investments linked to AI, Singh said, highlighting its push to deepen its focus on AI funding. It is also preparing to open a U.S. office within the next 90 days as it expands its global footprint, per Singh, while continuing to view India as its largest and most important market.\nSingh stated the firm believed AI would reshape venture investing more profoundly than previous technology shifts, arguing that successful AI investing required investors with deep technical understanding rather than “generalist” experience. He added that Peak XV was looking to add more AI-native talent, including researchers and engineers with backgrounds in machine learning and large-scale model development.\nThe firm has invested in more than 400 companies, and its portfolio has seen over 35 initial public offerings and several M&As to date.\n",

    "body": "\nIndia’s Supreme Court on Tuesday delivered an unusually sharp rebuke to Meta, warning that it would not allow the social media giant to “play with the right to privacy” of Indian users, as judges questioned how WhatsApp monetizes personal data.\nThe comments were made as Meta appealed a penalty imposed over WhatsApp’s 2021 privacy policy. The judges repeatedly asked the company how users can meaningfully consent to data-sharing practices in a market where the app is pretty much the default communications platform.\nWith more than 500 million users, India is WhatsApp’s largest market and a key growth area for Meta’s advertising business. Judges in the case question the potential commercial value of metadata generated by the platform, and how such data could be monetized across Meta’s wider advertising and AI functions.\nDuring the hearing, Chief Justice Surya Kant said the Supreme Court would not allow Meta and WhatsApp to share even “a single piece of information” while the appeal was pending, arguing that users faced little real choice in accepting WhatsApp’s privacy policy.\nCalling the messaging service a monopoly in practice, Kant questioned how “a poor woman selling fruits on the street” or a domestic worker could be expected to grasp how their data was being used.\nOther judges also pressed Meta on how user data was analyzed beyond message content. Justice Joymalya Bagchi said the court wanted to examine the commercial value of behavioral data and how it was used for targeted advertising, arguing that even anonymized or siloed information carried economic worth. Government lawyers added that personal data was not only collected but also commercially exploited.\nMeta’s lawyers said the platform’s messages are end-to-end encrypted and inaccessible even to the company, arguing that the privacy policy in question did not weaken user protections or allow chat content to be used for advertising.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe case stems from a 2021 update to WhatsApp’s privacy policy that required users in India to accept broader data-sharing terms with Meta or stop using the service. India’s competition regulator later imposed a ₹2.13 billion (around $23.6 million) penalty, finding that the policy abused WhatsApp’s dominant position in the messaging market. That ruling was upheld on appeal before Meta and WhatsApp moved the Supreme Court to challenge it. Meta’s lawyers told the court the penalty had already been paid.\nThe Supreme Court has adjourned the matter until February 9, allowing Meta and WhatsApp to explain their data practices in greater detail.

    "body": "\nNuclear fusion conjures images of massive reactors or banks of dozens of large lasers. Avalanche co-founder and CEO Robin Langtry thinks smaller is better. \nFor the last several years, Langtry and his colleagues at Avalanche have been working on what’s essentially a desktop version of nuclear fusion. “We’re using the small size to learn quickly and iterate quickly,” Langtry told TechCrunch.\nFusion power promises to supply the world with large amounts of clean heat and electricity, if researchers and engineers can solve some vexing challenges. At its core, fusion power seeks to harness the power of the Sun. To do that, fusion startups must figure out how to heat and compress plasma for long enough that atoms inside the mix fuse, releasing energy in the process. \nFusion is a famously unforgiving industry. The physics is challenging, the materials science is cutting edge, and the power requirements can be gargantuan. Parts need to be machined with precision, and the scale is usually so large as to obviate rapid fire experimentation. \nSome companies like Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) are using large magnets to contain the plasma in a doughnut-like tokamak, others are compressing fuel pellets by shooting them with powerful lasers. Avalanche, though, uses electric current at extremely high voltages to draw plasma particles into an orbit around an electrode. (It also uses some magnets to keep things orderly, though they’re not nearly as powerful as a tokamak’s.) As the orbit tightens and the plasmas speed up, the particles begin to smash into each other and fuse.\nThe approach has won over some investors. Avalanche recently added another $29 million in an investment round led by R.A. Capital Management with participation from 8090 Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Founders Fund, Lowercarbon Capital, Overlay Capital, and Toyota Ventures. To date, the company has raised $80 million from investors, a relatively small amount in the fusion world. Other companies have raised several hundred to a few billion dollars. \nSpace-based inspiration\nLangtry’s time at the Jeff Bezos-backed space tech company Blue Origin influenced how Avalanche is tackling the problem. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’ve figured out that using this sort of SpaceX ‘new space’ approach is that you can iterate really quickly, you can learn really quickly, and you can solve some of these challenges.” said Langtry, who worked with co-founder Brian Riordan at Blue Origin.\nGoing smaller allowed Avalanche to speed up. The company has been testing changes to its devices “sometimes twice a week,” something that would be challenging and costly with a large device.\nCurrently, Avalanche’s reactor is only nine centimeters in diameter, though Langtry said a new version grow to 25 centimeters and is expected to produce about 1 megawatt. That, he said, “is going to give us a significant bump in confinement time, and that’s how we’re actually going to get plasmas that have a chance of being Q>1.” (In fusion, Q refers to the ratio of power in to power out. When it’s greater than one, the fusion device is said to be past the breakeven point.)\nThose experiments will be carried out at Avalanche’s FusionWERX, a commercial testing facility the company also rents out to competitors. By 2027, the site will be licensed to handle tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that’s used as fuel and is crucial to many fusion startup’s plans for producing power for the grid.\nLangtry wouldn’t commit to a date when he hopes Avalanche will be able to generate more power than its fusion devices consume, a key milestone in the industry. But he’s thinks the company is on a similar timeline as competitors like CFS and the Sam Altman-backed Helion. “I think there’s going to be a lot of really exciting things happening in fusion in 2027 to 2029,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs Adobe ramps up its investments in AI, the company has decided to shut down its 2D animation software, Adobe Animate. On Monday, Adobe issued an update to the company’s support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing Adobe Animate will be discontinued on March 1, 2026.\nEnterprise customers can continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition. Other customers will have support through March of next year, the company said.\nThe decision has been met with incredulity, disappointment, and anger among Adobe Animate users, who are concerned about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.\nOne customer, posting on X, pleaded with Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things like “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” and “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.\nAdobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an FAQ, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”\n\n\n\n\nReading between the lines, it sounds as if Adobe is saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.\nWhat’s surprising is that Adobe can’t even recommend software that will fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it says customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”\nFor instance, it suggests that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.\nThere were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction after Animate was ignored at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released. \nThe software will continue to work for those who have it downloaded, Adobe noted. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. \nSome users are recommending other animation programs to use instead, including Moho Animation and Toon Boom Harmony.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Adobe for comment. This article will be updated if the company responds. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWaymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company, has raised $16 billion as it plans to grow its fleet of driverless taxicabs this year to more than a dozen new cities internationally, including London and Tokyo. \nDragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital led the funding round, which now values Waymo at $126 billion, the company said in a blog post Monday. Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.\nThe round also included significant investments from Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala Capital, as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Additional investors included BDT & MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity Management & Research Company, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek.\nWaymo said the funds will be used to fuel its growth, which has accelerated over the past year and doesn’t appear to be slowing. The company recently secured rides to and from San Francisco International Airport and has expanded its robotaxi service throughout Northern California and several major metropolitan areas in the U.S., including Los Angeles, Austin, and Miami.\nFor years, the former Google self-driving project slowly progressed forward, testing its autonomous vehicle tech on public roads in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area and providing the occasional public or media demo. In 2016, it made its first geographic leap forward and began testing in Phoenix, where it eventually pulled its human safety driver out of the vehicles. Phoenix became Waymo’s first robotaxi market, in which the public could hail driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivans.\nWaymo pushed down the accelerator in August 2023 after receiving the final necessary permit to operate a robotaxi service — and charge for rides — in California. It launched a limited service in San Francisco, later expanding to much of the greater Bay Area, Silicon Valley, and more recently to the freeways that connect the dozens of towns in the area. It also expanded to Los Angeles. The company launched in Austin and Atlanta in 2025 through a partnership with Uber. It kicked off the year by expanding to Miami.\nThe geographic expansion has translated to 400,000 rides provided every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas. The company said that in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides, surpassing 20 million lifetime rides to date.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We are no longer proving a concept,” the company wrote in its blog post. “We are scaling a commercial reality, laying the groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including Tokyo and London.”\nThe rapid expansion has also led to increased scrutiny and criticism as Waymo’s robotaxis have made missteps and the technology creates problems for some residents.\nSome robotaxis have exhibited dangerous behaviors particularly in school zones. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation as well as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have opened investigations into the illegal behavior of Waymo robotaxis around school buses. The NHTSA also launched another investigation last week after a Waymo robotaxi hit a child near a school. The child, who sustained minor injuries, was struck at about 6 mph.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

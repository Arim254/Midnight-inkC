    "body": "\nCarbon management startup Carbon Direct is buying another carbon credit startup, Pachama, the companies announced today.\nPachama laid off around 20 employees this summer as voluntary carbon markets softened. The company had attracted investments from a range of prominent names, including Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and several celebrity angel investors, including Ellen DeGeneres, Laura Dern, and Serena Williams.\n“The current uncertain and volatile financial, economic, and geopolitical climate, added to the anti-ESG agenda in the U.S., is indeed having an effect on corporate sustainability budgets,” Diego Saez Gil, CEO of Pachama, told Trellis when the layoffs happened. “The impact is especially acute in the voluntary carbon market, which was already in a moment of correction.”\nPachama had raised $88 million, while Carbon Direct had raised $60.8 million, according to PitchBook. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nPachama was focused on nature-based carbon credits, which typically result when forests are either restored or preserved. Carbon Direct, on the other hand, is more of a carbon market advisory and accounting firm, helping companies track and report their carbon footprints and then vet carbon credits to offset them.\nThe carbon markets have been roiled by uncertainty in the last few years, and not all of it has been the result of political whiplash in the U.S. and elsewhere. Voluntary carbon markets have come under fire for falling short of their promises. \nFor example, a major investigation by The Guardian found that more than 90% of one verifier’s credits did not actually result in any carbon reductions. One of the biggest challenges facing nature-based carbon credits is the question of whether forests protected by the purchases were threatened with destruction in the first place.\nAnd while large companies have been dialing back their publicity around ESG measures, many are still interested in sticking to their net-zero promises. Carbon Direct customers include Microsoft, Shopify, American Express, JP Morgan, Alaska Airlines, and BlackRock.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nVenmo on Monday introduced a new rewards program, Venmo Stash, offering cash back to customers who transact with their favorite brands on the payments app and engage with Venmo’s products. \nWhile cashback rewards are a common incentive for credit cards, Venmo’s rewards — which can be up to 5% — are returned to Venmo’s Mastercard Debit Card.\nThe program is designed to incentivize continued use of Venmo’s service by bringing more funds into the ecosystem, the company explains. \nHowever, this program also represents a new way that today’s brands are attempting to reach younger users, many of whom have shown a preference for debit cards over credit cards.\nOne 2024 study cited by eMarketer indicated that only 39% of Gen Z users reported frequent credit card use, compared with 51% for older generations. Another Morning Consult survey for Cash App Afterpay from earlier this year noted that 63% of Gen Z users said they favored debit cards over other payment methods.\nAs a result, payment providers and retailers are looking to accommodate younger consumers by rolling out more debit rewards and by offering alternatives at checkout — like the use of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services such as Affirm, PayPal Pay Later, or Klarna.\nIn Venmo’s case, the program is designed to offer larger rewards as customers interact more with Venmo products. This keeps them invested in the Venmo ecosystem, the company believes. \nIt also competes with other cashback incentives offered by Venmo’s rivals, like Cash App’s offers, which are doled out to its own Cash App debit card customers.\nScreenshotImage Credits:Venmo\nInitially, customers earn 1% cash back for their Venmo Debit Mastercard when they spend their Venmo balance. Rewards grow to 2% when customers turn on auto reloads to keep their balance replenished automatically. And customers are able to earn 5% cash back when they receive Direct Deposits on Venmo each month. \nHowever, instead of offering a certain percentage back by spending category, like groceries, gas, or dining, Venmo’s program has customers pick from curated bundles of their favorite brands. For instance, you could pick a group of brands that includes McDonald’s, TikTok Shop, Uber, and Uber Eats, or one that offers Amazon, DoorDash, Domino’s, and Walgreens. \nThe PayPal-owned company says that next year Venmo Stash will expand to offer customers rewards when they pay with Venmo at merchants within its nationwide network.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

In addition, the product’s paid nature allows AI companies to support the organization’s nonprofit mission.\nWhile the post doesn’t go so far as to threaten penalties or any sort of legal action for use of its material through scraping, Wikipedia recently noted that AI bots had been scraping its website while trying to appear human. After updating its bot-detection systems, the organization found that its unusually high traffic in May and June had come from AI bots that were trying to “evade detection.” Meanwhile, it said that “human page views” had declined 8% year-over-year.\nNow Wikipedia is laying out its guidelines for AI developers and providers, saying that generative AI developers should provide attribution to give credit to the human contributors whose content it uses to create its outputs.\n“For people to trust information shared on the internet, platforms should make it clear where the information is sourced from and elevate opportunities to visit and participate in those sources,” the post reads. “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.”\nEarlier this year, the organization released its AI strategy for editors, which said it would use AI to help editors with workflows around tedious tasks, automating translation, and other tools that help its editors, not replace them.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The feature allows fans to chat, post, and listen to songs shared within these groups.\nThe feature is currently being tested in Canada on iOS and Android devices.\nUsers can access Fan Groups through the “Find” tab located beneath the search bar at the top of the app. From there, they can explore over 30 different groups dedicated to various musical interests, ranging from indie rock and country to Punjabi and K-pop, according to a company blog post.\nGroup members can create new posts, participate in ongoing chat threads, and share or save recommended songs. Users can also stream music without leaving the conversation or the group — they can simply tap the play button at the top to listen to all the songs added, or navigate to the separate “Music” tab next to “Posts.”\nNotably, artists can join these groups, giving them a new way to connect with fans directly. They can share exclusive content, interact more personally, and build stronger communities with their supporters.\nImage Credits:Amazon Music\nAnyone can set up a new group, and administrators can mute members and delete messages, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. Users can report content and can block other members if needed. \nThis new feature represents Amazon’s strategy to compete with Spotify, which has been working to engage users through various social features. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSpotify introduced a messaging feature in August and also a “Jam” feature that enables users to co-create playlists with friends and listen to songs together. \nSoundCloud also offers a commenting feature and has recently updated its platform to include new social functionalities, such as playlists based on what friends are listening to and a direct messaging tool for artists.

    "body": "\nPeople often think about tech bubbles in apocalyptic terms, but it doesn’t have to be as serious as all that. In economic terms, a bubble is a bet that turned out to be too big, leaving you with more supply than demand.  \nThe upshot: It’s not all or nothing, and even good bets can turn sour if you aren’t careful about how you make them. \nWhat makes the question of the AI bubble so tricky to answer is mismatched timelines between the breakneck pace of AI software development and the slow crawl of constructing and powering a data center. \nBecause these data centers take years to build, a lot will inevitably change between now and when they come online. The supply chain that powers AI services is so complex and fluid that it’s hard to have any clarity on how much supply we’ll need a few years from now. It isn’t simply a matter of how much people will be using AI in 2028, but how they’ll be using it, and whether we’ll have any breakthroughs in energy, semiconductor design, or power transmission in the meantime. \nWhen a bet is this big, there are lots of ways it can go wrong — and AI bets are getting very big indeed.  \nLast week, Reuters reported that an Oracle-linked data center campus in New Mexico has drawn as much as $18 billion in credit from a consortium of 20 banks. Oracle has already contracted $300 billion in cloud services to OpenAI, and the companies have joined with SoftBank to build $500 billion in total AI infrastructure as part of the “Stargate” project. Meta, not to be outdone, has pledged to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. We’ve been tracking all the major commitments here — and the sheer volume has made it hard to keep up. \nAt the same time, there is real uncertainty about how fast demand for AI services will grow.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA McKinsey survey released last week looked at how top firms are employing AI tools. The results were mixed. Almost all the businesses contacted are using AI in some way, yet few are using it on any real scale. AI has allowed companies to cost-cut in specific use cases, but it’s not making a dent on the overall business. In short, most companies are still in “wait and see” mode. If you’re counting on those companies to buy space in your data center, you may be waiting a long time. \nBut even if AI demand is endless, these projects could run into more straightforward infrastructure problems. Last week, Satya Nadella surprised podcast listeners by saying he was more concerned with running out of data center space than running out of chips. (As he put it, “It’s not a supply issue of chips; it’s the fact that I don’t have warm shells to plug into.”) At the same time, whole data centers are sitting idle because they can’t handle the power demands of the latest generation of chips.  \nWhile Nvidia and OpenAI have been moving forward as fast as they possibly can, the electrical grid and built environment are still moving at the same pace they always have. That leaves lots of opportunity for expensive bottlenecks, even if everything else goes right. \nWe get deeper into the idea in this week’s Equity podcast, which you can listen to below. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nGoogle Maps is adding new AI features, including a builder agent and an MCP server — a tool that connects AI assistants to Google Maps’ technical documentation — to help developers and users create interactive projects using Maps data and code. The company said it is using Gemini models across the board to power these features.\nAmong these new tools, the builder agent is a tool that, just like many other coding tools, lets you describe the kind of interactive map-based prototype you want to build in text and creates one for you. For instance, you can type “create a Street View tour of a city,” “create a map visualizing real-time weather in my region,” or “list pet-friendly hotels in the city.”\nOnce the code is generated, you can export it, test the preview project using your own API keys as needed, or modify the project in Firebase Studio.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe same tool also has a styling agent that lets users create a customized map to match a particular style format or theme. This could help brands create maps with specific color coding.\nGoogle already provides map data grounding via the Gemini API. The company is now introducing a similar feature, called Grounding Lite, which allows developers to ground their own AI models using Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that lets AI assistants connect to external data sources.\nWith this feature, AI assistants can answer questions like, “How far is the nearest grocery store?” The company is also shipping Contextual View, a low-code Google Maps component that can provide visual understanding to users for such questions. The feature can show a list, a map view, or a 3D display as an answer.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle is also adding a code assistant toolkit, the MCP server, which connects with Google Maps’ documentation. Developers can use this connection to get answers about how to use the Google Maps API and data. Last month, the company launched extensions for Gemini’s command line tool to let developers access Maps data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Google\nThe company is also trying to add more Gemini-powered features for Maps on the consumer side. Last week, it enabled users to use Gemini hands-free with Maps for navigation. For users in India, Google added incident alerts and speed limit data to the Maps app in select areas.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nKaltura, a New York-headquartered AI video platform company, is acquiring eSelf.ai, an Israel-based startup behind conversational avatars — AI-generated digital humans that can talk with users — for about $27 million. Kaltura announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf, a platform supporting more than 30 languages and featuring a user-friendly studio for creating, customizing, and deploying photorealistic digital avatars.\nCo-founded in 2023 by CEO Alan Bekker, who previously sold his first startup, Voca, to Snap in 2020 — and CTO Eylon Shoshan, eSelf brings deep technical expertise in speech-to-video generation, low-latency speech recognition, and screen understanding, which allows avatars to see and respond to what’s on a user’s screen. The eSelf co-founders will join Kaltura to oversee the integration of eSelf’s technology into the company, with all current eSelf employees coming on board as well.\nThe two-year-old startup has a small but strong team of around 15 AI experts, Ron Yekutiel, co-founder and CEO of Kaltura, told TechCrunch. He noted that Bekker’s former company specialized in natural language processing, which helps computers understand human speech, and computer vision, saying it was a “very leading company in the area of conversational speech bots. And so he’s an expert [in this field], and that’s what we bought,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura offers a suite of cloud-based software solutions designed for advanced video applications, including a corporate video portal akin to a private YouTube, tools for webinars and virtual events, and integrations that embed video learning into university learning management systems, or platforms that organize online coursework.\nThe Nasdaq-listed company also delivers virtual classroom products and end-to-end TV streaming solutions. Kaltura’s video platform serves over 800 enterprise customers, helping them engage users across sales, marketing, customer care, education, and entertainment. Its clients include tech giants like Amazon, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Adobe, and IBM, as well as leading banks, insurance companies, consulting firms, pharmaceutical companies, and universities in the U.S.\nKaltura plans to integrate eSelf.ai’s virtual agent technology across its video offerings; the integration aims to enable agents that can listen, speak, and interpret user screens in real time.\n“This acquisition was so strategic. We were actively evaluating multiple companies to find the right fit. We determined that they [eSelf] were best-in-class for real-time, synchronous conversation — not just video-on-demand lip-syncing — and that they had an impressive speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology stack,” Yekutiel said in an interview with TechCrunch. “Beyond the technology, there was also a strong cultural and geographic alignment, which was critical for us.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhy a video company is betting on conversational avatars\nFor the past two decades, businesses have mostly used video for streaming, uploading, and managing content. But that’s changing fast. Thanks to AI, videos can now be generated instantly — hyper-personalized and contextual — giving every viewer their own custom experience, tailored exactly to what they need in that moment, Yekutiel explained.\n“We started with video, then moved to personalized video, and now, with eSelf’s technology, we’re adding human-like capabilities — faces, eyes, mouths, ears — to make our AI agents conversational and expressive,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura is evolving from a video platform into a video-based customer and employee experience provider, where video serves as the interface. Unlike most avatar companies that offer only a “face,” it delivers the full workflow — avatar, intelligence, and enterprise-connected knowledge. The focus isn’t just streaming video; it’s driving measurable business results and ROI, the CEO added.\nThe company plans to launch standalone, embeddable agents for uses including sales, marketing, customer support, and training. Target sectors include education, media and telecom, e-commerce, financial services, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.\nAsked about media reports saying Kaltura was exploring a sale or merger at a $400 million to $500 million valuation, Yekutiel told TechCrunch that Kaltura has explored opportunities with a range of companies, including potential “acquisitions, mergers with similarly sized firms, and connections with some larger players.” But it never got close to a transaction like the ones being reported, he said. He also pointed to Kaltura’s recent acquisitions, including its fourth company, as evidence of the company’s continued commitment to its current strategy.\nThis marks Kaltura’s fourth acquisition to date. The company acquired cloud TV solution Tvinci in 2014, followed by Rapt Media in 2018, and video conferencing platform Newrow in 2020. eSelf’s most recent funding round was its $4.5 million announced in December 2024. \nKaltura, which went public in 2021, reports around $180 million in revenue, is profitable on an adjusted EBITDA and cash flow basis, and has about 600 employees.\n",

    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy, and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow, she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNearly seven years after announcing its first fund, Sapphire Sport — the venture fund focused on sports, media, and entertainment — is spinning out from Sapphire Ventures. The fund will rebrand as an independent venture firm, 359 Capital.\nThe firm’s new name is a tribute to the sub-four-minute mile, a feat once deemed humanly impossible but ultimately achieved through rigorous dedication and perseverance. 359 Capital co-founder and managing partner Michael Spirito said that the name reflects the firm’s core principle of helping its portfolio founders achieve the impossible.\nThe separation from Sapphire Ventures, an investment firm with about $11 billion in assets under management, was always on “the vision board,” said Spirito. “We’re all grown up and ready to leave home.”\nSapphire Sport, which is currently halfway through investing its second fund of $181 million, has always maintained a separate group of limited partners from Sapphire Ventures. Its LPs are all deeply tied to the sports industry, including major names like City Football Group, adidas, AEG, Madison Square Garden, Sinclair, and dozens of team owners.\n“When we started in 2019, the name Sapphire Sport wasn’t just alliterative and sounded cool,” Spirito said. “Sport captured the LP group.”\nSeven years later, the sports-focused LPs still leverage their relationship with the firm to gain insights into emerging tech companies across the media and sports landscape, Spirito said.\nSome of the startups 359 Capital has backed include Beehiiv, a creator-focused newsletter; an online casino, Betty Labs; a sports media platform; Overtime, an AI search engine; Perplexity, a successful AI browser; and Tonal, a home gym system.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm’s entire portfolio of 30 companies and all of its investment staff will move over to 359 Capital. The transitioning staff includes Spirito, co-founders of Sapphire Ventures David Hartwig and Doug Higgins, and newly promoted partner Rico Mallozzi.\nAs 359 Capital, the firm will continue to focus primarily on Series A and Series B startups, writing checks between $2 million to $10 million. The firm will continue to invest from its second fund through the first half of 2027, Spirito said.\n359 Capital will have high-profile competition in the world of sports-focused venture capital. Courtside Ventures, backed by Shaquille O’Neal and Michael Jordan, is in the process of raising a fourth fund of $100 million, according to an SEC filing.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle announced on Monday that it’s starting to roll out Gemini to the Google TV Streamer, replacing Google Assistant. The tech giant says the change will enable users to use their voice more naturally to access content and more. \nFor example, users can now ask something like, “I like dramas but my wife likes comedies. What’s a movie we can watch together?” when looking for movie recommendations. \nOr, users could quickly catch up on a show they’re returning to by asking something like, “What happened at the end of Outlander last season?” In another example, Google says users can even ask something like “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”\nGoogle says Gemini for TV goes beyond entertainment, as users can ask the AI assistant any other type of question as well, just like they can with Gemini on their phone.\nFor example, users could bring learning to their TV by asking Gemini to “Explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader.” Gemini can also guide users through DIY projects or recipes with YouTube videos, Google says. \nTo access Gemini on the Google TV Streamer, you need to press your remote’s microphone button. \nGoogle says the update is rolling out “over the next few weeks” to users aged 18 and older. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move comes as Google announced back in September that it was introducing Gemini for Google TV to select TCL devices. The company said at the time that later in the year, Gemini would be arriving on the 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models. \nIn addition to the Google TV Streamer, Gemini is also available on the Walmart Onn 4K Pro streaming device.\nMonday’s announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as the change is part of Google’s plans to replace Google Assistant with Gemini across all of its devices and platforms. Plus, the company had announced at CES in January that Gemini would be coming to Google TV this year.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFive years ago, when Miles “Deuce” McBride moved to New York as a 20-year-old rookie playing for the Knicks, he found the transition to a big city overwhelming and struggled to find the right crowd.\n“When I got up here, everybody on my team was married with kids or just kind of loners,” he told TechCrunch, reflecting on his initial feelings of loneliness being the youngest player on the team. “I wish there was a way to meet people organically who have the same interests. I feel like with social media, everybody is so superficial.”\nRecognizing a common pain point for many in their twenties, McBride teamed up with veteran startup founder Joe Einhorn to create Mmotion, an app that combines elements of location tracking with social discovery features to help people find new friends based on shared interests while also recommending nearby bars, restaurants, and other social hotspots. \nImage Credits:Mmotion (Image has been modified)\nNow available in beta for users in NYC, the app diverges from traditional friendship platforms like Bumble BFF, instead competing more directly with apps like Snap Map and Find My. Instagram also recently entered the space with a new Map feature. (Mmotion’s beta will be limited to 1,000 members.)\nMmotion leverages geofencing and state tracking to follow users’ movements, highlighting people with similar interests in the vicinity. It also keeps track of where users go to recommend similar, worthwhile locations to explore. Plus, users get a private log of all their location history, acting like a personal timeline so they can easily look back on all the spots they’ve explored.\nTo access Mmotion, users must apply for a membership. Once accepted, they can enter their interests, join “Circles” or groups they’re interested in (such as those focused on hiking, attending basketball games, or visiting art galleries), and send friend requests to others nearby. The app also offers private messaging between users. \nImage Credits:Mmotion\nTo prioritize user safety, the app features encrypted location data that is only accessible to the user unless they choose to share it. Users are incognito by default, which Mmotion refers to as “Vault Mode,” and can be switched at any time. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdditionally, if users prefer that only certain individuals on the app know their location, Mmotion offers a feature called “Personas.” This feature allows users to create up to three separate groups, enabling them to share more private locations like their home address with a select group of people while maintaining a more public persona.\n“So Miles might have [his “Deuce” Persona], which is something where it’s a bit more curated, because he’s a public figure. So it’s for all the Knicks fans to see Miles go to places he’s okay with mainstream people knowing. And then he might have a [Persona], for when he goes to a different city, and he wants to be really low-key,” Einhorn explained.\nStandard safety and moderation tools like blocking and reporting are also implemented. \nImage Credits:Mmotion\nThe app will operate on a monthly subscription model for users. While the exact pricing details weren’t disclosed, Einhorn hinted that it will be affordable, stating, “It’s not going to be more than a cup of coffee per month. It’s not going to be anything crazy.” \nPremium options offering additional features may also be available. For example, the basic tier only lets users join five Circles per city at a time.\nAnother aspect of the app is its offering for local businesses. By featuring restaurants, bars, coffee shops, fitness studios, and more on the map, Mmotion aims to promote small businesses while also providing them with insights into their customer base. The app aggregates data from various sources, including Google, OpenStreetMap, and Apple Maps.\nMmotion’s long-term vision is to encourage businesses to sign up for a subscription service that provides access to anonymized analytics. This service would help businesses effectively target the right customers.\nIn addition to subscription fees, the app will generate revenue through ads. \nThe launch marks McBride’s first time as a startup founder, positioning him alongside other athletes who have transitioned to entrepreneurship. Einhorn, meanwhile, is known as the founder and CEO of Fancy, a social e-commerce platform that competed with Pinterest. He also launched a luxury goods startup last year called Long Story Short.\nMmotion plans for a wider launch in the near future when there’s enough feedback from testers. It’s currently available to download on iOS and Android devices.\n",

    "body": "\nAutonomous vehicles are having a moment, and it’s making it a lot easier for smaller companies to raise money. Vay, a German startup offering remote-controlled rental cars, will get $60 million in cash from Singaporean tech heavyweight Grab, the company announced on Monday.\nThe deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of the year, may be followed by “an additional $350M as joint milestones are achieved within the first year,” Vay CEO Thomas von der Ohe wrote on LinkedIn.\nThe Berlin-based startup uses its technology and human operators to remotely drive rental cars to and from customers. Vay isn’t yet commercially deployed in real traffic in Germany, where it lacked regulatory clarity until recently, but the company is currently operational in Las Vegas, where it started in January 2024. Vay now plans to use Grab’s investments to scale and expand its operations in the U.S.\nVay will need to hit certain milestones in the U.S. to unlock additional investment from Grab, including number of U.S. cities covered, regulatory approvals obtained, and overall consumer revenue.\nThe U.S. is seeing increased competition and fast-expanding offerings of various forms of remote driving. For instance, Alphabet-owned Waymo recently announced it would deploy its robotaxi service in Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego. \nAlthough publicly traded on the Nasdaq, Grab does not operate in the U.S., where it will limit itself to supporting Vay’s growth. \nHowever, Vay describes driverless car rental as complementary to robotaxis. As for Grab, it sees Vay as serving “a growing segment of consumers who prefer not to be car owners,” Grab co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said in a press release.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVay’s customers may not be car owners, but they still need a driving license: Once the car gets delivered, the user takes over and drives it like a regular car. But unlike their own car, they don’t need to find where to park it. Vay says its service costs about half the price of ride-hailing, thanks to this hybrid approach and hardware-light system.\nAt the same time, the two companies plan to explore synergies between Vay’s and Grab’s business in Southeast Asia. Calling itself “the everyday everything app,” Grab’s ubiquitous super-app offers ​​all-in-one taxi, ride hailing, transport, express grocery shopping, and food delivery options, as well as digital payments and financial services.\nWith a growing interest in mobility, Grab recently invested in autonomous driving tech startups, including May Mobility out of the U.S. and WeRide out of China. The synergies it finds with Vay may well be on the tech side — for instance, it said that driving data collected by Vay could accelerate the training of AI models to improve autonomous driving.\nThis also aligns with Vay’s vision to become more than an electric rental car fleet. The company has already expanded into commercial and business-to-business services, and closed a partnership with self-driving truck company Kodiak Robotics. Ultimately, it aims to build a “global remote driving platform,” von der Ohe told TechCrunch earlier this year.\nAccording to Crunchbase, Vay had raised $131.8 million from backers including Kinnevik, Coatue, Eurazeo, Atomico, General Catalyst, Creandum, and the European Investment Bank. If fully unlocked, Grab’s investment would be a significant boost. But with Nvidia announcing plans to invest $500 million into British self-driving tech startup Wayve, the race is only starting.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nFor more than a decade, makers of government spyware have defended themselves from criticism by saying that their surveillance technology is intended to be used only against serious criminals and terrorists, and only in limited cases.  \nThe evidence gathered from dozens, if not hundreds of documented instances of spyware abuse all over the world, however, shows that neither of those arguments are true.  \nJournalists, human rights activists, and politicians have repeatedly been targeted in both repressive regimes and democratic countries. The latest example is a political consultant who works for left-wing politicians in Italy, who came out as the most recently confirmed victim of Paragon spyware in the country. \nThis latest case shows that spyware is proliferating far beyond the scope of what we have typically considered to be “rare” or “limited” attacks targeting only a few people at a time. \n“I think that there is some misunderstanding at the heart of stories about who gets targeted by this kind of government spyware, which is that if you are targeted, you are Public Enemy Number One,” Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who has studied spyware for years, told TechCrunch.  \n“In reality, because targeting is so easy, we have seen governments use surveillance malware to spy on a broad range of people, including relatively minor political opponents, activists, and journalists,” said Galperin. \nThere are several reasons that explain why spyware often ends up on the devices of people who, in theory, should not be targeted.  \nThe first explanation lies in the way that spyware systems work. Generally, when an intelligence or law enforcement agency purchases spyware from a surveillance vendor — like NSO Group, Paragon, and others — the government customer pays a one-time fee to acquire the technology, and then lower additional fees for future software updates and tech support.  \nThe upfront fee is usually based on the number of targets that the government agency can spy on at any moment in time. The more targets, the higher the price. Previously leaked documents from the now-defunct Hacking Team show that some of its police and government customers could target anywhere from a handful of people to an unlimited number of devices at once. \nWhile some democratic countries typically had fewer targets that they could surveil in one go, it wasn’t uncommon to see countries with questionable human rights records with an extremely high number of concurrent spyware targets.  \nGiving such a high number of concurrent targets to countries with such strong appetites for surveillance all but guaranteed that the governments would target far more people outside the scope of just criminals and terrorists. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about government spyware? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email. You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\t\t\nMorocco, the United Arab Emirates (twice), and Saudi Arabia (several times), have all been caught targeting journalists and activists over the years. Security researcher Runa Sandvik, who works with activists and journalists who are at risk of being hacked, curates an ever-expanding list of cases of spyware abuse around the world.  \nAnother reason for the high number of abuses, especially in recent years, is that spyware — such as NSO’s Pegasus or Paragon’s Graphite — makes it extremely easy for government customers to successfully target whoever they want. In practice, those systems are essentially consoles where police or government officials type in a phone number, and the rest happens in the background.  \nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab who has investigated spyware companies and their abuses for a decade, said that government spyware carries a “huge abuse temptation” for government customers.  \nScott-Railton said spyware “needs to be treated like the threat to democracy and elections that it is.” \nThe general lack of transparency and accountability has also contributed to governments brazenly using this sophisticated surveillance technology without fear of consequences. \n“The fact that we have seen targeting of relatively small fish is particularly concerning because it reflects the relative impunity that the government feels in deploying this exceptionally invasive spyware against opponents,” Galperin told TechCrunch. \nIn terms of victims getting accountability, there is some good news.  \nParagon made a point of very publicly cutting ties with the Italian government earlier this year, arguing that the country’s authorities refused help from the company in investigating abuses allegedly involving its spyware.  \nNSO Group previously revealed in court that it disconnected 10 government customers in recent years for abusing its spyware technology, although it refused to say which countries. And it’s unclear if those include the Mexican or Saudi government, where there have been countless documented cases of abuse.  \nOn the customer side, countries like Greece and Poland have launched investigations into spyware abuses. The United States, during the Biden administration, targeted some spyware makers such as Cytrox, Intellexa, and NSO Group by imposing sanctions on the companies — and their executives — and putting them on economic blocklists. Also, a group of mostly Western countries led by the U.K. and France are trying to use diplomacy to put the brakes on the spyware market.  \nIt remains to be seen if any of these efforts will curb or limit in any way what is now a global multibillion-dollar market, with companies more than happy to supply advanced spyware to governments with a seemingly endless appetite to spy on pretty much everyone they want to.  \n",

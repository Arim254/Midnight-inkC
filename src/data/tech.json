The company is reportedly in talks to raise another $200 million at an $11 billion valuation led by Sequoia and Singapore’s GIC, sources told Forbes.\nIf the deal closes, Harvey’s valuation would jump by $3 billion in a matter of months. In December the company confirmed it had raised $160 million at an $8 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz last fall. (Harvey declined to comment on its potential new raise.)\nBack in June, it announced a $300 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins and Coatue. A few months before that, in February 2025, it gobbled up a Sequoia-led $300 million Series D at a $3 billion valuation.\nThe startup, which offers an LLM AI for law firms, hit an annual recurring revenue rate of $190 million by the end of 2025, founder CEO Winston Weinberg shared on LinkedIn. That was up from a $100 million ARR in August (depending on what the company means by ARR), so that’s nearly double the contracted revenue in less than six months.\nHow has it become one of the breakout winners of AI enterprise applications? Weinberg recently told TechCrunch’s editor-in-chief Connie Loizos an incredible story of how the company originally claimed the hearts of Silicon Valley’s powerhouse VCs. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Startups\n\n",

Workday co-founder and former CEO Aneel Bhusri will return as CEO.\nEschenbach joined Workday in December 2022 as co-CEO alongside Bhusri and had been operating as the company’s sole CEO since February 2024. Bhusri, who had led the company since 2009 — sometimes as co-CEO, sometimes as sole CEO — has been serving as the company’s executive chairman since 2024.\nWorkday confirmed to TechCrunch that Bhusri is returning to the role permanently, as opposed to taking the helm during a search for a replacement.\nWorkday says it made this leadership change to focus on its next chapter, which, unsurprisingly, is AI.\n“We’re now entering one of the most pivotal moments in our history,” Bhusri said in the company’s press release Monday. “AI is a bigger transformation than SaaS — and it will define the next generation of market leaders. I’m energized to return as CEO, working alongside our presidents Gerrit Kazmaier and Rob Enslin, and I’m excited about the opportunity in front of us.”\nLast February, Workday laid off 8.5% of its headcount, or 1,750 people, with Eschenbach stating at the time that the company needed a new approach to labor in the age of AI.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

And after placing third on the charts last weekend, “Melania” is ninth this time.\nPerhaps anticipating discussion about the film’s decline, Amazon released a statement from its head of domestic theatrical distribution, Kevin Wilson, who said, “Together, theatrical and streaming represent two distinct value creating moments that amplify the film’s overall impact.”\n“Melania” received universally negative reviews from critics, but its 99% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes was so good that the site put out a statement insisting that the score was real.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n",

The deal, paid entirely in cryptocurrency to an unknown seller, shatters previous records. (Broker Larry Fischer, who facilitated the sale, is presumably celebrating his good fortune.)\nMarszalek plans to debut the site during Sunday’s big game, offering consumers a personal AI agent for messaging, app usage, and stock trading. “If you take a long-term view — 10 to 20 years — [AI] is going to be one of the greatest technological waves of our lifetime,” he told the FT.\nThe purchase rewrites the domain record books — not that the crypto industry itself is known for its restraint when it comes to spending. Previously, CarInsurance.com held the crown at $49.7 million (2010), followed by VacationRentals.com ($35 million in 2007) and Voice.com ($30 million in 2019). Other eye-popping sales include PrivateJet.com ($30 million), 360.com ($17 million), and Sex.com, which has sold twice for over $13 million each time, though its second owner went bankrupt trying to monetize it.\n“With assets like AI.com, there are no substitutes,” Fischer told the FT. “When one becomes available, the opportunity may never present itself again.”\nWhether these mega-dollar domains actually deliver returns remains an open question. But for Marszalek, who already owns Crypto.com and dropped $700 million on stadium naming rights, owning two category-defining domains is apparently worth the outlay.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

The company raised $13 billion in equity funding just five months ago, but intense competition between frontier labs and the ongoing cost of compute has made it eager to raise as quickly as possible.\nFirms expected to participate in the round include Altimeter Capital Management, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, Coatue Management, Iconiq Capital, and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, but the bulk of the funding is said to come from the company’s strategic partners Nvidia and Microsoft.\nAnthropic is building on recent successes, most notably the deployment of its coding agents, which have software engineers raving about increased coding productivity. Last week, the company’s release of new models focused on legal and business research rattled the share prices of publicly traded data firms as investors worried about the ability of AI to disrupt their businesses.\nAnthropic’s rival, OpenAI, is reportedly assembling a new $100 billion fundraising round, and both companies are thought to be preparing IPOs ahead of a blockbuster summer in the markets, with xAI, recently acquired by SpaceX, also tapping public equity as part of the rocket maker’s IPO.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\nOpenAI on Monday announced it’s beginning to test ads in the U.S. for users on its Free and Go subscription tiers.\nThe newer Go plan is a low-cost subscription at $8 per month in the U.S. and was introduced globally in mid-January.\nSubscribers to OpenAI’s paid plans, including its Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers, will not see ads, the company said.\nOpenAI sought to address concerns about how ads might affect the user experience, stating in a blog post: “Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you, and we keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers. Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks.”\nThe move, which the company announced last month, drew ridicule in a series of Super Bowl ads that ran yesterday from a top rival, Anthropic.\nIn its TV commercials, Anthropic poked fun at the idea that some AI companies, like OpenAI, would soon include advertising by showing how poorly integrated ads could disrupt the consumer experience. This was portrayed on screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman got extremely testy about his competitor’s jabs, calling the ads “dishonest” and Anthropic an “authoritarian company.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nConsumers have so far resisted the idea of ads in AI responses. OpenAI faced a backlash late last year when it tested app suggestions that looked like unwanted ads. Still, the AI company needs to generate revenue from its popular chatbot to cover the costs of developing its technology and growing the business.\nWhile understandable, critics fear that ads could influence ChatGPT’s answers. OpenAI denies this in its announcement, saying that ads will be optimized based on “what’s most helpful to you.” The company says ads will also always be clearly labeled as sponsored and separated from the organic content.\nIn tests, OpenAI has tried matching ads to users based on the subject of their conversations, past chats, and previous ad interactions. For instance, users researching recipes might see ads for grocery delivery services or meal kits, the company says. OpenAI said said advertisers won’t have access to user data, only aggregate information about ad performance, like views and clicks.\nUsers will also be able to view their history of interactions with ads and clear it at any time. Plus, OpenAI said users can dismiss ads, share feedback, view why they were shown an ad, and manage ad personalization settings. \nAds won’t be shown to users under 18, nor will they be placed near sensitive or regulated topics like health, politics, or mental health. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

It’s worth noting that location sharing on Snap Map is off by default. No one can see your location or receive an alert unless you choose to share it, Snapchat explained. One-time alerts expire after they’re sent or after 24 hours.\nTo use Arrival Notifications, you need to share your location with a trusted friend that you want to keep in the loop. Then, you need to tap on your friendship profile and scroll down to “Arrival Notifications.” You can pick a location on the map and give it a personal name. For example, you could set the location for your “run club” or the location for “piano lessons.” You can then choose a one-time or recurring alert, after which Snapchat will notify your friend when you arrive.\nThe new feature comes as Snapchat announced last summer that Snap Map now has more than 400 million monthly active users.\nSnap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. The feature now also offers ways for users to discover local hotspots and find things to do.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWith its Home Safe and Arrival Notifications features, Snapchat is looking to further compete with services like the family location-sharing app Life360 and Apple’s “Find My.”\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLidar-maker Ouster has acquired StereoLabs, a company that makes vision-based perception systems for robotics and industrial applications, for a combination of $35 million and 1.8 million shares. \nThe deal is the latest in a march towards consolidation among perception sensor suppliers. Just last month, MicroVision bought the lidar assets of the buzzy-but-now-bankrupt Luminar for $33 million. Ouster itself has played the M&A game a fair amount, too. In 2022, the company merged with rival player Velodyne. The year before that, it bought lidar startup Sense Photonics.\nThis consolidation is happening right as companies and investors rush to build businesses around “physical AI” — a broad term that encompasses everything from humanoid robotics and drones to self-driving cars and automated systems in warehouses. Even more obscure suppliers are raising big funding rounds as these technologies develop. Some startups are even trying to spin up entirely new sensor modalities.\nOuster cofounder and CEO Angus Pacala told TechCrunch in an interview that he had been eyeing StereoLabs for years. He said he sees lidar as “the core component of safety-critical, capable systems,” but that he wanted to “move up the stack.” \nThe “obvious additional sensors” to start working with in addition to lidar, Pacala said, are cameras. Pacala said 15-year-old StereoLabs is “best in class” on the hardware side, but he was especially drawn to how the company has been getting the most out of those cameras by being “incredibly savvy in adopting the cutting edge of AI models and edge compute.” \nIn particular, Pacala highlighted StereoLabs’ development of a foundational AI model that can determine depth of objects from stereo cameras. \n“It was a no brainer for us to go out and approach them and basically pitch this vision of working with us to become a unified sensing and perception platform — a tier one [supplier] for these advanced physical AI systems,” Pacala said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDespite the focus on integration, Ouster said StereoLabs will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary. \nAnd while the hype has been feverish, Pacala said he didn’t buy StereoLabs simply because of the attention and money being thrown at physical AI. In fact, he committed maybe the gravest sin one can during a hype cycle: he poured some cold water on the buzz, especially around humanoid robotics.\n“The business model here is not to just sell the fervor, it’s to actually make working systems that are certified, that are safe, that are really solving customer problems,” he said. “There’s going to be a little bit of disillusionment in physical AI as it turns out that it’s much longer time to market for all these humanoids.”\nPacala isn’t the only one trying to take a realistic view. In a recent interview with TechCrunch, MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said the sensor industry is “ripe for consolidation” because he believes there isn’t enough revenue to support all the current competition.\n“You’re going to get consolidation, or you’re going to get kind of a weeding out of the industry as people fall to the wayside,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nMusicboard, an app for music discovery and recommendations, has been struggling, according to its users. Over the past several months, users said the app experienced outages, the website went offline, and the Android app disappeared from the Play Store.\nThis has concerned its devoted, if small, user base. (The app has been downloaded around 462,000 times to date, according to market intelligence provider Appfigures.) On Reddit, users have been recommending alternatives and offering each other support as they wait for any update.\nWhile it’s not surprising for an app to shut down, when there’s still an active user base, apps typically provide some sort of communication from their operators. But Musicboard users say they haven’t heard anything, leaving them to reach out to the press for help getting in touch with someone, if only to let them export their data.\nImage Credits:Musicboard\nSome users organized an unofficial “Help Save Musicboard” initiative to bring more attention to the matter. The group is led by the Musicboard user known as Lavarini and run by volunteers.\nTechCrunch contacted Musicboard to help these users get some answers and was provided a short statement. However, the statement didn’t explain the longer-term issues and dismissed the outages as “temporary downtime.”\nThe statement, shared from the Musicboard team email address and signed simply as “Musicboard,” said the following:\n\nApp is not shut down. The servers had temporary downtime, which has now been quickly fixed. And we’re working together with the Google Play team to get the app back up there. The app wouldn’t shut down without a respectful timeline for the users and official communication. App is staying live.\n\nFollow-up questions went unanswered.\nThe founders of Musicboard, Johannes Vermandois and Erik Heimer, have been involved with other projects. Their AI app, Frank AI, was set to be acquired by a company called Freedom Holdings, Inc., but the potential acquirer terminated its letter of intent in September 2024. Dreamsands, Inc., the company that publishes Frank AI on the App Store, also operates another app, Helm, an AI therapist.\nOver email, Lavarini says the users’ efforts to help save the app will continue.\nThe Help Save Musicboard initiative “aims to support awareness and discussion around the long-term sustainability of the indie app Musicboard and its community,” Lavarini wrote.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011. She joined the company after having previously spent over three years at ReadWriteWeb.

    "body": "\nLyft launched teen accounts on Monday, a product that allows minors as young as 13 to hail a ride without an adult in 200 U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, and New York.\nThe official launch comes two weeks after Lyft CEO David Risher announced on X plans to open the ride-hailing service to teenagers.\nLike its rival Uber, which also offers teen accounts, the new Lyft service comes with a number of guardrails. Only a parent or guardian can create a teen account, according to Lyft. Drivers who are matched with these underage passengers must meet additional criteria and pass yearly background checks. Teens can also bring guests along for the ride, as long as the parent has given permission, according to Lyft.\nLyft has also baked in features like PIN verification, audio recording, and real-time tracking to allow parents to see where their teen is during their ride. Parents who want to sign up their teen can go to the app, select their profile at the bottom right of the screen, then tap “Lyft Teen.” From here, parents can enter the teen’s contact info and add a shared payment method to cover teen rides. Once confirmed, the teen will receive a text message with a unique sign-up link.\nLyft is playing catch-up with Uber and even Waymo, which offers teen accounts in its robotaxi service area in Phoenix. Uber tested teen accounts as early as 2017 but didn’t roll out a commercial product until spring 2024 in more than a dozen cities in the U.S. and Canada. Uber has since added numerous other U.S. markets, as well as dozens of other countries. Last year, Uber started testing out teen accounts in several cities in India, as well.\nLyft’s new teen account is one of numerous new products and expansions that Risher has introduced at the company since he took the CEO spot. Lyft has made a handful of autonomous vehicle partnerships, including with May Mobility, Austrian manufacturer Benteler, and Holon, Tensor Auto, and autonomy provider Mobileye.\nThe company has also pushed into Europe with its $197 million acquisition of German multi-mobility app Freenow from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility. The acquisition opened up the European market to Lyft for the first time.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nA hacktivist has scraped more than half-a-million payment records from a provider of consumer-grade “stalkerware” phone surveillance apps, exposing the email addresses and partial payment information of customers who paid to spy on others. \nThe transactions contain records of payments for phone-tracking services like Geofinder and uMobix, as well as services like Peekviewer (formerly Glassagram), which purport to allow access to private Instagram accounts, among several other monitoring and tracking apps provided by the same vendor, a Ukrainian company called Struktura.\nThe customer data also includes transaction records from Xnspy, a known phone surveillance app, which in 2022 spilled the private data from tens of thousands of unsuspecting people’s Android devices and iPhones. \nThis is the latest example of a surveillance vendor exposing the information of its customers due to security flaws. Over the past few years, dozens of stalkerware apps have been hacked, or have managed to lose, spill, or expose people’s private data — often the victims themselves — thanks to shoddy cybersecurity by the stalkerware operators.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tTo contact Zack Whittaker securely, reach out via Signal username zackwhittaker.1337. Contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nStalkerware apps like uMobix and Xnspy, once planted on someone’s phone, upload the victim’s private data, including their call records, text messages, photos, browsing history, and precise location data, which is then shared with the person who planted the app. \nApps like uMobix and Xnspy have explicitly marketed their services for people to spy on their spouses and domestic partners, which is illegal.\nThe data, seen by TechCrunch, included about 536,000 lines of customer email addresses, which app or brand the customer paid for, how much they paid, the payment card type (such as Visa or Mastercard), and the last four digits on the card. The customer records did not include dates of payments. \nTechCrunch verified the data was authentic by taking several transaction records containing disposable email addresses with public inboxes, such as Mailinator, and running them through the various password reset portals provided by the various surveillance apps. By resetting the passwords on accounts associated with public email addresses, we determined that these were real accounts.\nWe also verified the data by matching each transaction’s unique invoice number from the leaked dataset with the surveillance vendor’s checkout pages. We could do this because the checkout page allowed us to retrieve the same customer and transaction data from the server without needing a password.\nThe hacktivist, who goes by the moniker “wikkid,” told TechCrunch they scraped the data from the stalkerware vendor thanks to a “trivial” bug in its website. The hacktivist said they “have fun targeting apps that are used to spy on people,” and subsequently published the scraped data on a known hacking forum.\nThe hacking forum listing lists the surveillance vendor as Ersten Group, which presents itself as a U.K.-presenting software development startup. \nTechCrunch found several email addresses in the dataset used for testing and customer support instead reference Struktura, a Ukrainian company that has an identical website to Ersten Group. The earliest record in the dataset contained the email address for Struktura’s chief executive, Viktoriia Zosim, for a transaction of $1. \nRepresentatives for Ersten Group did not respond to our requests for comment. Struktura’s Zosim did not return a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nDiscord is rolling out age verification globally starting next month, the company announced on Monday. All users will be put into a “teen-appropriate experience” by default unless they prove they’re adults. Age verification will be required to change certain settings and access age-restricted content.\nDiscord users will need to be confirmed as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting, and only adults can access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands. Additionally, messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and only verified adults can modify this setting.\nPeople will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know, and only adults will be able speak onstage in servers.\nTo complete age verification, users need to either complete a facial age estimation or submit an ID to Discord’s vendor partners. The platform plans to add more options in the future. Discord notes that some users may be asked to use multiple methods when additional information is needed to assign an age group.\nThe facial age estimation requires video selfies, which Discord says never leave your device. Additionally, the company says IDs submitted to its vendor partners are deleted quickly and, in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.\nIt’s worth noting that Discord disclosed last October that around 70,000 users may have had sensitive data, such as their government ID photos, exposed after hackers breached a third-party vendor that the platform uses for age-related appeals. The breach reflected digital rights activists’ concerns over the use of age checks as a way to make the internet “safer.”\nDiscord’s global launch of age verification follows the company’s decision to establish age checks for users in the U.K. and Australia last year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility,” said Savannah Badalich, head of product policy at Discord, in a press release. “We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform.”\nThe announcement mirrors similar moves made by other online platforms, reflecting growing international efforts to strengthen child safety. Most recently, Roblox introduced mandatory facial verification for access to chats on its platform. Last July, YouTube launched its age-estimation technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in order to provide a more age-appropriate experience.\nDiscord’s age-verification changes will begin in early March, and both new and existing users will need to verify their age to access age-restricted content.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGather AI, a startup that offers an AI platform for warehouse cameras and drones, has raised a $40 million Series B funding round led by Smith Point Capital. That’s the VC firm founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block. \nThe Gather team first met Smith Point a year ago at a logistics conference, and “it took Keith and his team five minutes to get what we’re doing,” co-founder and CEO Sankalp Arora told TechCrunch. \nWhat Gather AI is doing is unusual. The three founders met as PhD students at Carnegie Mellon University, where they built one of the first autonomous helicopters and tested it on the FBI training grounds in Quantico. (Block is a trustee for CMU.) \nIn 2017, the founders took what they learned about teaching helicopters to fly and land safely and launched Gather AI. Using off-the-shelf cameras placed on strategic moving equipment like forklifts, as well as off-the-shelf drones flying around the warehouse, the cameras watch on-the-floor operations and log what they find into the warehouse management systems.  \nBut the catch is, the AI isn’t being random about what it scans. It is being “curious,” as Arora described it.\n“My PhD work focused on how to make different kinds of flying robots curious,” he said. “So they’re curious about boxes and bar codes and workflows.” \nIn addition to barcodes, they look for lot codes, text, expiration dates, case counts, damages, occupancy, and other items. The idea is that they will discover and predict issues like low inventory, misplaced stock, and workflows that may cause safety issues. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThey also work in environments unfriendly to people, like freezers and cold storage. \nBecause Gather’s underlying tech was built years before the age of large language models, this is not the kind of AI that an LLM uses. \n“They’re not end-to-end neural networks,” Arora explains. “They are classical Bayesian techniques, combined with neural networks.”  \nAI vision Bayesian techniques use probability-base methods to teach computers how to interpret visual data. These systems allow the technology to learn by using data and prior knowledge to make decisions — meaning they don’t suffer the hallucination problems of LLMs. \nInstead they “get curious,” as Arora put it, to gather information (hence the startup’s name) and make a decision on the next action based on what they’ve learned. \nAs old-school as that sounds, Gather AI is sitting at the edge of the next big thing in AI, sometimes called “embodied AI.” These are robots that interact with the real world, as opposed to an LLM interacting via computer chat or web app.  \nTo that end, in December, the startup won the 2025 Nebius Robotics award for Vision AI and Streaming Video Analytics. (Nebius is a Netherlands company that provides AI infrastructure.)\nGather currently employs about 60 people, Arora said, and customers include Kwik Trip, Axon, GEODIS, and NFI Industries. With this fresh funding, the startup has now raised $74 million total. Other investors include Bain Capital Ventures, XRC Ventures, and Hillman Investments.\n",

The two companies will divide the assets: Ford will take ownership and operation of the twin battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will operate the factory at the massive BlueOval SK campus in Tennessee.\nSK On said it will maintain a strategic partnership with Ford centered on the Tennessee plant, according to Bloomberg.\nWhen reached for comment, a Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch the company was aware of SK’s disclosure and had nothing further to share at this time.\nThe joint venture was created when the industry was investing billions of dollars to ramp up electric vehicle production. While EV sales have risen over the past several years, demand has not kept up with the industry’s lofty projections. The end of the federal EV tax credit has also dampened the pace of sales.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n",

Last year, TIME chose President Donald Trump for the second time. The year before that, it was Taylor Swift, who many claimed saved the economy from a recession with her Eras Tour. In 1938, the magazine chose Adolf Hitler. \nThis year, TIME has chosen to bestow its award on not just one person, but a group of people: the so-called “Architects of AI,” comprising the CEOs shaping the global AI race from the U.S. With AI on everyone’s minds, embodying hope for a small minority and economic anxiety for a majority, per recent Edelman data, this tracks.\n“For decades, humankind steeled itself for the rise of thinking machines,” the article reads. “Leaders striving to develop the technology, including Sam Altman and Elon Musk, warned that the pursuit of its powers could create unforeseen catastrophe […] This year, the debate about how to wield AI responsibly gave way to a sprint to deploy it as fast as possible.”\nBased on one of TIME’s two cover photos, some of those people appear to be Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Tesla’s Elon Musk, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, AMD’s Lisa Su, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis, and World Labs’ Fei-Fei Li — all individuals who raced “both beside and against each other.” \nTIME writes that these individuals, through their multibillion-dollar bets on “one of the biggest physical infrastructure projects of all time,” have reshaped government policy, turned up the heat on geopolitical competition, and pushed AI adoption forward. \n\nThis is the story of how AI changed our world in 2025, in new and exciting and sometimes frightening ways. It is the story of how Huang and other tech titans grabbed the wheel of history, developing technology and making decisions that are reshaping the information landscape, the climate, and our livelihoods… AI emerged as arguably the most consequential tool in great-power competition since the advent of nuclear weapons.\n\nTIME only announced the news on Thursday morning, but images of the cover photo were leaked on prediction market Polymarket on Wednesday evening.\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\t\tAI, AI, dario amodei, Demis Hassabis, Elon Musk, Fei-Fei Li, In Brief, Jensen Huang, Lisa Su, Mark Zuckerberg, person of the year, sam altman, time\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

In the past, users had to upload a full-body picture of themselves to virtually try on a piece of clothing. Now, they can use a selfie and Nano Banana, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, to generate a full-body digital version of themselves for virtual try-ons.\nUsers can select their usual clothing size, and the feature will then generate several images. From there, users can choose one to make it their default try-on photo.\nIf desired, users still have the option to use a full-body photo or select from a range of models with diverse body types.\nThe new capability is launching in the United States today.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle first launched the try-on feature in July, allowing users to try on apparel items from its Shopping Graph across Search, Google Shopping, and Google Images. To use the feature, users need to tap on a product listing or apparel product result and select the “try it on” icon.\nThe move comes as Google has been investing in the virtual AI try-on space, as the company has a separate app dedicated specifically to that purpose. The app, called Doppl, is designed to help visualize how different outfits might look on you using AI.\nEarlier this week, the tech giant updated it with a shoppable discovery feed that displays recommendations so users can discover and virtually try on new items. Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants.\nThe discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. While some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely views it as a way to showcase products in a format that people are already familiar with, thanks to platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMessaging app Freedom Chat has fixed a pair of security flaws: one that allowed a security researcher to guess registered users’ phone numbers, and another that exposed user-set PINs to others on the app.\nFreedom Chat, released in June, bills itself as a secure messaging app, and claims on its website that users’ phone numbers stay private.\nBut security researcher Eric Daigle told TechCrunch that users’ phone numbers and PIN codes, used for locking the app, could be easily obtained by exploiting vulnerabilities.\nDaigle found the vulnerabilities last week and shared their details with TechCrunch, as Freedom Chat does not provide a public way to report security flaws, like a vulnerability disclosure program. TechCrunch then alerted Freedom Chat founder Tanner Haas to the security flaws by email.\nHaas confirmed to TechCrunch that the app has now reset user PINs and released a new version. Haas added that the company is removing instances where users’ phone numbers were occasionally visible, and has notched up rate-limiting on its servers to prevent mass-guess attempts.\nDaigle, who published his findings in a blog post, told TechCrunch it was possible to enumerate the phone numbers of close to 2,000 users who had signed up to use Freedom Chat since it launched. Daigle said Freedom Chat’s servers allowed anyone to flood it with millions of phone number guesses to determine if a user’s phone number was stored on the servers.\nPer Daigle, this technique is identical to one described by the University of Vienna in research last month, where academics scraped data on some 3.5 billion user accounts who signed up to WhatsApp by matching billions of phone numbers against WhatsApp’s servers.\nDaigle also found Freedom Chat was leaking users’ PIN codes. Using an open source network traffic inspection tool to analyze the data going in and out of the app, Daigle saw that the app would respond with the PIN codes of every other user in the same public channel — even if the PINs weren’t visible to users within the app itself.\nAccording to Daigle, anyone who was in the default Freedom Chat channel, which users are automatically subscribed to when they first sign up, had their PIN broadcast to everyone else in the channel. Daigle told TechCrunch that knowledge of a person’s PIN could allow someone to open the app from a user’s stolen device.\nIn an app store update published Sunday, Freedom Chat noted: “A critical reset: A recent backend update inadvertently exposed user PINs in a system response. No messages were ever at risk, and because Freedom Chat does not support linked devices, your conversations were never accessible; however, we’ve reset all user PINs to ensure your account stays secure. Your privacy remains our top priority.”\nFreedom Chat is Haas’ second messaging app, after Converso, which was delisted from app stores following the disclosure of security flaws that exposed users’ private messages and content.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch. He also authors the weekly cybersecurity newsletter, this week in security. \nHe can be reached via encrypted message at zackwhittaker.1337 on Signal.

    "body": "\nGoogle on Thursday introduced a new AI experiment for the web browser: the Gemini-powered product Disco, which helps to turn your open tabs into custom applications. With Disco, you can create what Google is calling “GenTabs,” a tool that proactively suggests interactive web apps that can help you complete tasks related to what you’re browsing and allows you to build your own apps via written prompts.\nFor instance, if you’re studying a particular subject, GenTabs might suggest building a web app to visualize the information, which could help you better understand the core principles. \nImage Credits:Google\nOr, in a less academic scenario, you could use GenTabs to help you create a meal plan from a series of online recipes or help you plan a trip when you’re researching travel.\nThese are things that you can already do today with some AI-powered chatbots, but GenTabs builds these custom experiences on the fly using Gemini 3, using the information in your browser and in your Gemini chat history. After the app is built, you can also continue to refine it using natural language commands.\nThe resulting generative elements in the GenTabs experience will link back to the original sources, Google notes. \nImage Credits:Google\nLike others in the AI market, Google has been experimenting with bringing AI deeper into the web-browsing experience. Instead of building its own stand-alone AI browser, like Perplexity’s Comet or ChatGPT Atlas, Google integrated its AI assistant Gemini into the Chrome browser, where it can optionally be used to ask questions about the web page you’re on.\nWith GenTabs, the focus is not only on what you’re currently viewing, but also on your overall browsing, spanning multiple tabs — whether that’s research, learning, or something else.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHowever, the feature is only initially going to be available to a small number of testers through Google Labs, who will offer feedback about the experience. The company says that interesting ideas that are developed through Disco may one day find their way into other, larger Google products. \nIt also suggests that GenTabs will be one of many Disco features to come over time, noting that GenTabs is the “first feature” being tested. \nTo access Disco, users will need to join a waitlist to download the app, starting on macOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nRivian’s two-year effort to build its own AI assistant will launch in early 2026. And when it does, the AI assistant will roll out to every existing EV in its lineup, not just the next-generation versions of its R1T truck and R1S SUV. \nDrivers and passengers will be able to use the AI assistant to operate climate controls and handle other tasks contained within the vehicle’s infotainment system. It will also connect vehicle systems with third-party apps using an agentic framework built by Rivian engineers. Google Calendar will be the first third-party app to launch within the AI assistant, Rivian said Thursday.\n“The beauty here is we can integrate third-party agents, and this is completely redefining how apps in the future will integrate in our cars,” software development chief Wassym Bensaid said Thursday during the company’s AI & Autonomy event in Palo Alto, California.\nThe AI assistant will be augmented by Google Vertex AI and Gemini for grounded data, natural conversation, and reasoning, according to Rivian.\nImage Credits:Rivian\nThe AI assistant program, which TechCrunch first reported this week, reflects Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe’s push to become more vertically integrated. And that commitment was on full display at its AI & Autonomy event in Palo Alto, California. Beyond the AI assistant, the company detailed how it has developed a software and new hardware, including a custom 5nm processor built in collaboration with both Arm and TSMC, that will expand its hands-free driving assistance system and eventually let drivers take their eyes off the road.\nThis vertical integration work has been underway for years. In 2024, the EV maker completely reworked the guts of its flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV, changing everything from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, sensor stack, and software user interface.\nThe company’s software team led by Bensaid has continued to work on building out the software stack. A smaller group — the size of which Rivian won’t disclose — focused on the AI assistant, which is designed to be model and platform agnostic, according to Bensaid.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo power this AI assistant, Rivian developed what it has described as a model- and platform-agnostic architecture that uses custom large language models and is branded as Rivian Unified Intelligence, or RUI. This hybrid software stack includes its own custom models and the “orchestration layer,” the conductor that makes sure the various AI models work together. Rivian said it has used other companies for specific agentic AI functions.\n“The Riven Unified Intelligence is the connective tissue that runs through the very heart of Rivian’s digital ecosystem,” Bensaid said at the event. “This platform enables targeted agent solutions that drive value across our entire operation and our entire vehicle life cycle.”\nFor instance, RUI will be used for more than just providing an AI assistant, according to the company. It will also be used to improve vehicle diagnostics, which Rivian describes as “an expert assistant for technicians, scanning telemetry and history to pinpointing complex issues.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nThe Walt Disney Company announced on Thursday that it has signed a three-year partnership with OpenAI that will bring its iconic characters to the company’s Sora AI video generator. Disney is also making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI.\nLaunched in September, Sora allows users to create short videos using simple prompts. With this new agreement, users will be able to draw on more than 200 animated, masked, and creature characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, including costumes, props, vehicles, and more.\nThese characters include iconic faces like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, Belle, Cinderella, Baymax, and Simba, as well as characters from Encanto, Frozen, Inside Out, Moana, Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, Up, and Zootopia. Users will also be able to draw on animated or illustrated versions of Marvel and Lucasfilm characters like Black Panther, Captain America, Deadpool, Groot, Iron Man, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Stormtroopers, and more.\nUsers will also be able to draw on these characters while using ChatGPT Images, the feature in ChatGPT that allows users to create visuals using text prompts. \nThe agreement does not include any talent likenesses or voices, Disney says. \n“The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement.\nDisney says that alongside the agreement, it will “become a major customer of OpenAI,” as it will use its APIs to build new products, tools, and experiences, including for Disney+.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we’re excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,” said Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, in a statement. “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences.”\nIt’s worth noting that Disney has sued the generative AI platform Midjourney for ignoring requests to stop violating its intellectual property rights. Disney also sent a cease-and-desist letter to Character.AI, urging the chatbot company to remove Disney characters from among the millions of AI companions on its platform.\nDisney’s agreement with OpenAI indicates the company isn’t fully closing the door on AI platforms.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nRivian detailed Thursday how it plans to make its electric vehicles increasingly autonomous — an ambitious effort that includes new hardware, including lidar and custom silicon, and eventually, a potential entry into the self-driving ride-hail market, according to CEO RJ Scaringe.\nThe announcements at the company’s first “Autonomy & AI Day” event in Palo Alto, California, shed fresh light on Rivian’s technology development, much of which has been kept undercover as it pushes to begin production of its more affordable R2 SUV in the first half of 2026. Rivian’s event is also a very public signal to shareholders that it’s keeping pace, or even exceeding, the automated-driving capabilities of industry rivals like Tesla, Ford, General Motors, as well as automakers from Europe and China.\nRivian said it will expand the hands-free version of its driver-assistance software to “over 3.5 million miles of roads across the USA and Canada” and will eventually expand beyond highways to surface streets (with clearly painted road lines). This expanded access will be available on the company’s second-generation R1 trucks and SUVs. It’s calling the expanded capabilities “Universal Hands-Free” and will launch in early 2026. Rivian says it will charge a one-time fee of $2,500 or $49.99 per month.\n“What that means is you can get into the vehicle at your house, plug in the address to where you’re going, and the vehicle will completely drive you there,” Scaringe said Thursday, describing a point-to-point navigation feature.\nAfter that, Rivian plans to allow drivers to take their eyes off the road. “This gives you your time back. You can be on your phone, or reading a book, no longer needing to be actively involved in the operation of vehicle.”\nRivian’s driver assistance software won’t stop there; the EV maker laid out plans on Thursday to enhance its capabilities all the way up to what it’s calling “personal L4,” a nod to the level set by the Society of Automotive Engineers that means a car can operate in a particular area with no human intervention. \nAfter that, Scaringe hinted that Rivian will be looking at competing with the likes of Waymo. “While our initial focus will be on personally owned vehicles, which today represent a vast majority of the miles driven in the United States, this also enables us to pursue opportunities in the ride-share space,” he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo help accomplish these lofty goals, Rivian has been building a “large driving model” (think: an LLM but for real-world driving), part of a move away from a rules-based framework for developing autonomous vehicles that has been led by Tesla. The company also showed off its own custom 5nm processor, which it says will be built in collaboration with both Arm and TSMC.\nThat custom chip powers what Rivian is referring to as its third-generation “autonomy computer,” or ACM3. The new computer can process 5 billion pixels per second and will start showing up on Rivian’s upcoming mass-market R2 SUV in late 2026.\nRivian will couple the ACM3 with a lidar sensor at the top of the windshield (from an undisclosed supplier) to provide “three-dimensional spatial data and redundant sensing,” which it says will help with “real-time detection for the edge cases of driving.”\n“We expect that at launch in late 2026 this will be the most powerful combination of sensors and inference compute in consumer vehicles in North America,” senior vice president of electrical hardware Vidya Rajagopalan said at the event.\nThe R2 is set to start shipping in the first half of 2026, meaning the launch versions of the SUV will not have ACM3 or the lidar sensor. But the company said in a press release that it aims to “continuously improve the autonomy capabilities” of its “Gen 2 R1 and future R2 vehicles, with a clear trajectory including point-to-point, eyes off and personal L4.”\nThe company believes it can reach an advanced state of autonomy in many of its current vehicles without the new hardware — but Scaringe said Thursday that the new hardware suite will “enable a much higher ceiling than we have in our vehicles today.” \n“Adding lidar creates the ultimate sensing combination. It gives the most comprehensive 3D model of the space the vehicle is traveling through,” vice president of autonomy and AI James Philbin said Thursday. “The goal for our onboard sensing stack isn’t just human level, it’s superhuman level.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nSpotify may be synonymous with music streaming, but it’s also got a wildly popular developer-tool side hustle called Backstage.  \nBackstage is an open source project that helps companies build their own internal developer portals: a catalog of their developer tools along with quick visualizations of the work the tools have done, and other metrics. But like many open source projects, Backstage is a build-it-yourself option.  \nIsraeli startup Port has been gaining big-name customers like GitHub, British Telecom, and LG with a proprietary Backstage competitor: a dev tool portal that’s also now been geared to manage AI agents.  \nOn Thursday, Port, founded in 2022, said it raised a fresh $100 million Series C round led by General Atlantic, with participation from Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Team8. The round values Port at $800 million and brings its total funding to date to $158 million. This Series C follows the company’s $35 million Series B led by Accel and Bessemer, announced in May. \nOf all the industries that LLM-based tech has infiltrated, coding is where it has the deepest roots. So, not surprisingly, developers are also on the cutting edge of building and adopting agents that can automate entire repeated processes — work far beyond asking AI to write some code. \nBut the problem here, according to Port co-founder and CEO Zohar Einy, it’s the Wild West right now for such dev tool agents at companies: finding them, sharing them, ensuring their work follows company standards, and so on.\nDevelopers “want to take AI beyond just coding. They want it to resolve incidents, resolve security issues. They want it to take care of the release management,” Einy told TechCrunch. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut if agents are connected to all kinds of different tools and data sources, if the data is scattered among them, if they have no way to collaborate, and have no corporate standards and guardrails, “it creates chaos,” his product pitch goes. \nPort therefore offers more than just a catalog of dev and agent tools (although it does offer those). It supplies a layer of orchestration with features that measure agent performance and add a human in the loop, as desired, to approval processes.  \nA feature called “context lake” defines the data sources, context memory, and guardrails for agents. “It’s where you manage what agents ‘need to know’ to do their job safely and correctly,” Einy explained. \nIn addition to using Port to catalog agents devs have already created using other tools, they can use Port to create new agents. Plus, Port also offers a few of its own ready-made agents, which can do things like resolving help desk tickets and dealing with provisioning. \nEiny describes his product as handling the other 90% of what software programmers do that isn’t writing code. “It gives the engineers a user interface to control the agent, to iterate with the agent, to approve what it does that is not coding, that is all the 90%.” \nWith its giant new war chest of cash, big name customers and tier-one VCs, Port looks like an agentic management startup to watch. But to say it faces competition is an understatement.\nThe entire category of agentic management and orchestration is flooded with hopefuls, from Big Tech companies to startups, and they’re all coming at the various new problems in the space from different angles. A few of these include LangChain, UiPath, Cortex, and more. \n",

    "body": "\nFlaviu Radulescu started Runware in 2023 when he was testing a text-to-image company and realized that, though generative AI tech was powerful, it was slow in generating images. So Radulescu teamed up with Ioana Hreninciuc and launched Runware as a dev tool platform that specializes in generating images, videos, and audio in real time.\nThe company has seen much growth since it first launched. It has powered more than 10 billion creations for more than 200,000 developers, the company told TechCrunch.\nThe product lets developers integrate Runware’s API into their apps and then generate media assets through one interface, so they don’t have to set up any new infrastructure or maintain separate integrations. It has a custom AI inference infrastructure for open source models and provides day-zero access (meaning as soon as a model is released, it can run on Runware) and competitive pricing, Hreninciuc, who focuses on operations and GTM, told TechCrunch.\nOn Thursday, the company announced a $50 million Series A in a round led by Dawn Capital. Dawn Capital partner Shamillah Bankiya is joining the board. Others in the round include Comcast Ventures, Speedinvest, Insight Partners, and a16z Speedrun. Runware has raised $66 million in funding to date.\nHreninciuc said the company remains competitive through its pricing, which is “more-cost effective,” in addition to having a fully unified API. She said the company does this with its Sonic Inference Engine, which runs on custom AI hardware. It also partners with third-party AI cloud providers so that it can reroute workloads automatically in case more memory is needed.\n“On the software side, we heavily optimize model loading and offloading, which lets us support over 400,000 models and make any of them available for inference in real time,” she continued.\nStartups that focus on dev tools for image and video have been a particularly hot market for VC interest lately. Fal.ai, for instance, just raised $140 million at a $4.5 billion valuation, its second giant raise in a matter of months. Fal.ai focuses on the breadth of model offerings versus customizing for speed. So, Hreninciuc considers her competitors to be Fal.ai and Replicate, a startup that runs open source models in apps with just a few lines of code.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese companies, as Radulescu previously told TechCrunch, sell based on GPU compute time. Runware instead leans toward the model of Stable Diffusion and Flux, offering a more cost-per-image generated so that people can pay for what they need rather than buying a block of compute time.  \nHreninciuc said the fresh capital will be used to keep expanding the company’s infrastructure and it hopes to use its Sonic Inference Engine to power over 2 million models. The big goal is to be the API for all AI — so that any generative AI model can and does run on the platform.\n“We’re also expanding rapidly into new modalities,” she said, adding that the company is going to expand the current team of around 25 to help make that happen.\nOverall, Hreninciuc hopes Runware continues to “make it possible for applications to scale to millions of users while actually keeping their margins,” she said, adding that it helps make the market more affordable. That “benefits everyone,” she continued. “From the app builders to the end users, and puts powerful AI into more people’s hands globally.”\nThis piece was updated to correct the spelling of Radulescu‘s name and to update what the competitors are, and who else participated in the round. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpoor launched in 2021 with the goal of using computer vision to help reduce the impact of wind turbines on local bird populations. Now the startup has proven its technology works and is seeing demand from wind farms and beyond.\nOslo, Norway-based Spoor has built software that uses computer vision to track and identify bird populations and migration patterns. The software can detect birds within a 2.5-kilometer radius (about 1.5 miles) and can work with any off-the-shelf high-resolution camera.\nWind farm operators can use this information to better plan where wind farms should be located and to help them better navigate migration patterns. For example, a wind farm could slow down its turbines, or even stop them entirely, during heavy periods of local migration.\nAsk Helseth (pictured above left), the co-founder and CEO of Spoor, told TechCrunch last year that he got interested in this space after learning that wind farms lacked effective tracking methods, despite many countries having strict rules around where wind farms can be built and how they can operate due to local bird populations.\n“The expectations from the regulators are growing but the industry doesn’t have a great tool,” Helseth said at the time. “A lot of people [go out] in the field with binoculars and trained dogs to find out how many birds are colliding with the turbines.”\nHelseth told TechCrunch last week that since then, the company has proven the need for this technology and worked to make it better.\nImage Credits:Spoor\nAt the time of its seed raise in 2024, Spoor was able to track birds in a 1-kilometer range, which has since doubled. As the company has collected more data to feed into its AI model, it has been able to improve its bird identification accuracy to about 96%.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Identifying the species of the bird for some of the clients, you add another layer,” Helseth said. “Is it a bird or not a bird? We have an in-house ornithologist to help train the model to train the new types of birds or a new type of species. Having deployment in other countries [means] having rare species in the database.”\nSpoor now works across three continents and with more than 20 of the world’s largest energy companies. It has also started to see interest from other industries such as airports and aquaculture farms. Spoor has a partnership with Rio Tinto, a London-based mining giant, to track bats.\nThe company has also received interest in using its tech to track other objects of similar size — but Helseth said they aren’t thinking of pivoting into those areas quite yet.\n“Drones are of course a plastic bird in our mind,” Helseth joked. “They move in a different way and have a different shape and size. Currently we are discarding that data but we are getting interest in it.”\nSpoor recently raised an €8 million ($9.3 million) Series A round led by SET Ventures with participation from Ørsted Ventures and Superorganism in addition to strategic investors.\nHelseth predicts that interest in this type of technology will only grow as regulators continue to crack down on wind farms. For example, French regulators shut down a wind farm in April due to its impact on the local bird population and imposed hundreds of millions of fines.\n“Our mission is to enable industry and nature to coexist,” Helseth said. “We have started on that journey, but we are still a small startup with a lot to prove. In the coming years, we want to really cement our position in the wind industry and become a global leader to tackle these challenges. At the same time, we want to build some proof points that this technology has value beyond that main category.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nOn Me, a digital gift card startup founded by former Google employees, is aiming to redefine the gift card industry with its mobile-first gifting platform that lets users purchase digital gift cards categorized by interests rather than being restricted to specific retailers.\nThe company on Thursday said it had raised $6 million in a seed funding round, which it will use to expand its gift categories to include things like horseback riding lessons, wine tastings, and theme park trips.\nImage Credits:On Me\nOn Me touts its flexibility. So if you have a friend who is passionate about tennis, you can send them a digital card that lets them shop for outfits and gear from popular brands like Wilson, On, Prince, and more. \nThe platform offers gift cards across 72 categories that range from running and reading to camping, gardening, gaming, and concerts.\nYou can also attach video messages, photos, and GIFs to gift cards, which is a nice touch as it lets you add a layer of personalization. You can use On Me via its website as well as iOS and Android apps.\nImage Credits:On Me\nThe startup’s CEO and co-founder Darragh Meaney pointed out the environmental issues with the traditional gift card industry, which rely heavily on plastic. \nThe International Card Manufacturers Association (ICMA) reports that approximately 30 billion plastic cards are manufactured globally each year, and that over 70% of gift cards are discarded within six months, resulting in an estimated 53 million tons of plastic waste.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It is an environmentally wasteful practice that feels totally disconnected from how we live today,” Meaney said.\nOn Me’s digital cards also integrate with Apple Pay and Google Wallet.\nImage Credits:On Me\nWith the global gift card market projected to reach $2.3 trillion by 2030, On Me believes it is well-positioned for growth. Since its launch, the company says it has facilitated over $2.5 million in gifts for more than 26,000 users, and has grown 50% every month. \nThe seed round was led by NFX, with participation from Lerer Hippeau and Focal. \nThe funding comes a year after the company launched its platform and raised $1.7 million in a pre-seed round. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nUp to 3 million abandoned oil and gas wells litter the U.S. alone, and while many still contain oil or natural gas, the owners decided it wasn’t worth it to keep pumping.\n“They’ve tried everything,” Prab Sekhon, CEO of Eclipse Energy, told TechCrunch. “There’s still a ton of oil left behind.”\nEclipse doesn’t have a way to recover that oil, but it does have a way to squeeze some of the energy they embody up to the surface. Rather than pump harder or inject something to force oil to the surface, Eclipse sends down microbes to munch on the oil molecules and liberate their hydrogen. \nInstead of viscous oil, companies only have to deal with hydrogen gas. “Hydrogen flows a lot easier,” Sekhon said, making it easier to extract it from the well.\nThe Houston-based startup, which was spun out of Cemvita, demonstrated the technology at an oilfield in California’s San Joaquin Basin last summer. Now, it’s partnering with oilfield services company Weatherford International to deploy the technology around the world, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. The first projects will begin in January.\n“They’re an extension of our team,” Sekhon said to characterize the relationship with Weatherford. “They’ll be our operational arm.”\nEclipse, which was previously known as Gold H2, has been developing the technology over the last several years. It has been sampling microbes that naturally occur in oil wells, which live at the interface between oil and water held in aquifers, to find those that are best suited to the job.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs the microbes consume the oil, they break it down into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Both then flow to the surface, where Eclipse and its partners will eventually separate the two. About half of the carbon dioxide is likely to stay in the reservoir, while the other half could be captured using specialized equipment and either sequestered or used.\nThe goal, Sekhon said, is to produce low-carbon hydrogen for around 50 cents per kilogram, or the same price as hydrogen obtained by breaking down natural gas in an industrial plant, a process that releases more carbon dioxide.\nThe resulting hydrogen could be used in petrochemical plants or burned for energy. \n“It’s taking a liability and turning it into a clean energy asset,” Sekhon said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFollowing a couple of months’ testing, Norway-based browser company Opera has finally made its AI-powered browser, Neon, available to the public — though you’ll have to shell out $19.90 per month to use it.\nOpera first unveiled Neon earlier this year in May and launched it in early access to select users in October. \nSimilar to other AI-first browsers like Perplexity’s Comet, OpenAI’s Atlas, and The Browser Company’s Dia, Neon bakes in an AI chatbot into its interface, letting you ask it answers about pages, use it to create mini apps and videos, and get it to do tasks for you. The browser uses your browsing history as context, so you can do things like ask it to fetch details from a YouTube video you watched last week or the post that you read yesterday.\nYou can also build “Cards” for repeatable tasks using prompts, and the browser offers a deep research agent that can get you detailed information about any topic. The browser also has a new tab organizational feature called Tasks, which are contained workspaces of AI chats and tabs. This feature is more like Tab Groups combined with Arc Browser’s Spaces feature, which has its own context for AI.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the AI features, the subscription gives users access to top models like Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1, Veo 3.1, and Nano Banana Pro. Subscribers will also get access to Opera’s Discord community and direct access to its developers.\n“Opera Neon is a product for people who like to be the first to the newest AI tech. It’s a rapidly evolving project with significant updates released every week. We’ve been shaping it with our Founders community for a while and are now excited to share the early access to it with a larger audience,” Krystian Kolondra, EVP of browsers at Opera, said in a statement.\nImage Credits: Opera\nThe company noted that its other products, like Opera One, Opera GX, and Opera Air, also have free AI features, like a chat-based assistant.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeanwhile, browser incumbents are taking a slower approach to adding AI features to their products. Earlier this week, Google detailed the security work it is doing to protect users against different attack surfaces that agentic features are prone to, and Brave said on Wednesday it is previewing its agentic features in a nightly build, and provides an isolated browsing profile for using AI features so users can keep their regular, non-AI usage separate.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

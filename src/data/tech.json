    "body": "\nChris Sacca’s venture firm Lowercarbon Capital is raising a second fund to back nuclear fusion energy hopefuls, the VC said at the SOSV Climate Tech Summit on Thursday, as reported by Bloomberg.  \nThe firm has backed leading fusion startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems, as well as others like Pacific Fusion. It raised a $250 million, fusion-geared fund in 2022. Fusion believers, who include a number of well-known climate VCs beyond Sacca (like Vinod Khosla), still hold faith that a breakthrough needed to make it commercially viable is just around the corner. And several advances are showing promise of delivering one.\nIn the meantime, building fusion reactors is expensive. Commonwealth raised $863 million earlier this year, after raising a $1.8 billion Series B four years ago. TechCrunch has documented a dozen fusion startups that have raised over $100 million. \nSacca didn’t say how big this second fund will be, but a source told Bloomberg that it’s intended to be bigger than the first. \n",

    "body": "\nGrand Theft Auto VI, one of the most anticipated video games of all time, has been delayed, again — this time until November 19, 2026.\nThe game was initially slated for a fall 2025 release but was pushed back to May 2026. On Thursday, Rockstar Games announced that the development team needs another six months.\n“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,” Rockstar Games wrote in their statement.\nGrand Theft Auto VI is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto V, which was released in 2013. According to Guinness World Records, that game became the fastest entertainment property to reach $1 billion in sales, hitting the milestone after just three days on the market. Fans are so eager for the next installment in the franchise that when Rockstar Games released the trailer for the game in December 2023, it broke the record for the most YouTube views in 24 hours (excluding music videos).\nRockstar Games did not provide additional details about the delay. Last week, the company fired between 30 and 40 employees for allegedly sharing confidential information in a Discord server.\n",

In exchange, the recipients pledge to produce some final work product, whether it’s a startup, an open-source codebase, or another type of artifact.\nThe initial cohort is fifteen projects, with a particular focus on the difficult problem of AI evaluation. Some of those projects will be familiar to TechCrunch readers, including the command-line coding benchmark Terminal Bench and the latest version of the long-running ARC-AGI project.\nOthers take a fresh approach to a long-established evaluation problem. Formula Code, built by researchers at CalTech and UT Austin, aims to produce an evaluation of AI agents’ ability to optimize existing code, while the Columbia-based BizBench proposes a comprehensive benchmark for “white-collar AI agents.” Other grants explore new structures for reinforcement learning or model compression.\nSWE-Bench co-founder John Boda Yang is also part of the cohort, as leader of the new CodeClash project. Inspired by the success of SWE-Bench, CodeClash will assess code through a dynamic competition-based framework, which Yang hopes will make the results more comprehensive.\n“I do think people continuing to evaluate on core third-party benchmarks drives progress,” Yang told TechCrunch. “I’m a little bit worried about a future where benchmarks just become specific to companies.” \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

Symbiosis Coalition is similar to Frontier, an advance market commitment also backed by Google and others that supports direct air capture projects.\nNature-based carbon removal shows great promise in drawing down CO2 levels in the atmosphere, but projects have been challenging to develop and sell for a variety of reasons. Nature-based projects risk falling short of their goals if they’re damaged by wildfires or other disasters, and it can be challenging to guarantee their long-term viability.\nStill, they come with many upsides: Forests can replenish aquifers and support biodiversity, neither of which direct air capture can do. Google said it will use its DeepMind Perch AI to help quantify biodiversity benefits of the project.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Climate\n",

    "body": "\nExecutives at Ford are considering killing its flagship electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nThe discussions are happening in the wake of Ford’s late October decision to idle F-150 Lightning production while it prioritizes hybrid and gas-engine versions of the popular pickup. The company’s been dealing with production troubles after a fire broke out at aluminum supplier Novelis’ factory in Oswego, New York, earlier this year.\nFord introduced the F-150 Lightning in 2021 with a promised base price of $40,000. It started building and selling the truck in 2022 — although the truck wound up costing most customers a lot more. \nBut while it’s been one of the top-selling electric trucks in the United States since then, Ford has struggled to sell more than a few thousand of them per quarter. The market for electric trucks was tough even before Republicans in Congress ended the federal EV tax credit and the Trump administration took an axe to emissions regulations that encouraged the adoption of electric vehicles.\n",

Otherwise, Meta will charge more money from advertisers that it suspects may be doing fraud as a way to discourage them from buying more advertising — but when those advertisers follow through anyway, it pads Meta’s bottom line.\nTechCrunch contacted Meta for comment but did not hear back before publication. Per Reuters’ report, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone claimed that the documents Reuters used “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams.”\nStone added that over the last 18 months, Meta has reduced user reports of scam ads by 58%, and the company has removed over 134 million scam ads from its platforms.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

We are looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next 8 years,” he wrote.\nWhile the post was largely a response to a brouhaha over comments his CFO made, and quickly walked back, concerning government-backstopped loans, Altman also listed a number of future business plans he believes will generate significant revenue.\nHe said OpenAI has an upcoming enterprise offering. Earlier this week, OpenAI said it already had a million business customers.\nHe named consumer devices and robotics. In May, OpenAI acquired Jony Ive’s io, and they are reportedly working on a palm-sized AI device.\nAltman mentioned scientific discovery as an upcoming business. Not much is known about it yet, except that OpenAI VP Kevin Weil mentioned a newly launched OpenAI for Science some months ago.\nAltman also said OpenAI could become a cloud computing provider: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of ‘AI cloud’, and we are excited to offer this.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat’s a bold idea for a company that doesn’t yet have its own network of data centers.\nBeyond revenue, Altman noted that the company may also pay for its needs the old-fashioned way: selling more equity or taking on more loans.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday the company will reveal the production version of its second-generation Roadster supercar on April 1, 2026 — nearly nine years after he first revealed the project.\nMusk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said during Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting that he chose April Fools’ Day in part because it affords “some deniability.” \n“Like, I could say I was just kidding” if it happens to be later, he said. \nRevealing the production version of the new Roadster next year is in itself a delay. Just one week ago he appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast and repeated his claim that he wanted to show off the car by year’s end. \nMusk stressed Thursday the car “will be very different from what was shown previously,” and again teased that the demo will be the “most exciting, whether it works or not, demo ever of any product” — a not-so-sly nod to the fact that he’s spent years trying to make the new Roadster fly in some fashion, possibly with SpaceX-built thrusters.\nMusk went on to say that he believes the second-generation Roadster won’t go into production until 12 to 18 months after the April reveal. \nDuring the Q&A portion of the meeting, one shareholder asked Musk if customers who preordered the “Founders Series” version of the new Roadsters could be invited to the reveal event. Those were the customers who plopped down $250,000 to secure special versions of the car in 2017.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Sure, absolutely,” Musk answered. “It’s the least we can do for our long-suffering Roadster reservation holders.”\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was one of those long-time sufferers who recently attempted to cancel the reservation — and initially failed to get a refund — for the long-promised EV.\nEarlier this month, Altman posted on X a “tale in three acts,” which was comprised of several screenshots showing his initial reservation, a request for a refund of the $50,000 reservation fee, and his email bouncing back.\n“I really was excited for the car!” Altman wrote. “And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.”\nMusk, who has openly sparred with Altman for years, went on the attack. “And you forgot to mention act 4, where this issue was fixed and you received a refund within 24 hours,” Musk wrote. “But that is in your nature.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nAccel has invested in Rapido, the ride-hailing platform competing with Uber in India, while Prosus has increased its stake, after Indian two-wheeler giant TVS Motor sold its entire holding.\nOn Thursday, TVS Motor said in a stock exchange filing (PDF) that it has sold its entire stake in Rapido for ₹2.88 billion (about $32 million) to Accel and Prosus’ investment unit, MIH Investments, securing a return of more than 152% over the past three years.\nFounded in 2015, Rapido has grown into a major player in India’s ride-hailing market, competing with Uber, Ola, and inDrive. The company began with bike taxis before expanding into auto-rickshaw bookings and car services and has added courier services to its platform. It has more recently been piloting a food-delivery service in select cities, entering a segment dominated by Swiggy and Zomato.\nTVS Motor first invested in Rapido in April 2022 as part of the company’s $180 million Series D round, joining existing backers such as WestBridge Capital, Shell Ventures, and Nexus Venture Partners. The automaker bought its stake at that time for ₹1.14 billion, according to its earlier investor disclosures (PDF).\nAs part of the latest transaction, Accel purchased 11,997 preference shares in Rapido, while Prosus acquired 11,988 preference shares and 10 equity shares. Both investors paid about ₹1.44 billion (roughly $16 million) each.\nAccel’s backing of Rapido marks a return to India’s ride-hailing sector for the firm, which was an early investor in Ola. The move comes as Rapido is in talks with Accel and Prosus for a new primary funding round that could close next year, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to TechCrunch. The exact funding size has yet to be determined.\nProsus is already an investor in Rapido and expanded its stake through another secondary share sale in September, when Swiggy sold its entire holding. That transaction doubled Rapido’s valuation to $2.3 billion, TechCrunch reported.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccel and Prosus are also early backers of Swiggy, which exited Rapido after citing a potential conflict of interest, as the ride-hailing startup prepared to expand into the food-delivery market.\nAccel and Prosus did not respond to requests for comment. Rapido could not be reached for comment.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSecurity researchers have discovered an Android spyware that targeted Samsung Galaxy phones during a nearly year-long hacking campaign.\nResearchers at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 said the spyware, which they call “Landfall,” was first detected in July 2024 and relied on exploiting a security flaw in the Galaxy phone software that was unknown to Samsung at the time, a type of vulnerability known as a zero-day. \nUnit 42 said the flaw could be abused by sending a maliciously crafted image to a victim’s phone, likely delivered through a messaging app, and that the attacks may not have required any interaction from the victim. \nSamsung patched the security flaw — tracked as CVE-2025-21042 — in April 2025, but details of the spyware campaign abusing the flaw have not been previously reported.\nThe researchers said in a blog post that it’s not known which surveillance vendor developed the Landfall spyware, nor is it known how many individuals were targeted as part of the campaign. But the researchers said that the attacks likely targeted individuals in the Middle East.\nItay Cohen, a senior principal researcher at Unit 42, told TechCrunch that the hacking campaign consisted of a “precision attack” on specific individuals and not a mass-distributed malware, which indicates that the attacks were likely driven by espionage.\nUnit 42 found that the Landfall spyware shares overlapping digital infrastructure used by a known surveillance vendor dubbed Stealth Falcon, which has been previously seen in spyware attacks against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents as far back as 2012. But the researchers said that the links with Stealth Falcon, while intriguing, were not enough to clearly attribute the attacks to a particular government customer.\nUnit 42 said that the Landfall spyware samples that they discovered had been uploaded to VirusTotal, a malware scanning service, from individuals in Morocco, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey throughout 2024 and early 2025.\nTurkey’s national cyber readiness team, known as USOM, flagged one of the IP addresses that the Landfall spyware connected to as malicious, which Unit 42 said supports the theory that individuals in Turkey may have been targeted.\nMuch like other government spyware, Landfall is capable of broad device surveillance, such as accessing the victim’s data, including photos, messages, contacts and call logs, as well as the tapping of the device’s microphone and tracking their precise location.\nUnit 42 found that the spyware’s source code referenced five specific Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S22, S23, S24, and some Z models, as targets. Cohen said that the vulnerability may have also been present on other Galaxy devices, and affected Android versions 13 through 15. \nSamsung did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon announced on Thursday the launch of Kindle Translate, an AI-powered translation service designed for authors using Kindle Direct Publishing to broaden their reach. The service initially translates text between English and Spanish and from German to English, as it’s still operating in beta. More languages will be supported over time.\nThe retail giant noted less than 5% of titles on Amazon are available in more than one language, suggesting there’s a big opportunity for AI translations.\nOf course, AI isn’t perfect, which means it could introduce errors into the text. To address this, Amazon allows authors to preview their translations before publishing if desired. If the author is not using the service to simply speed up translating their work into another language they speak, this ability to check the AI’s work won’t do them much good; they’d still need a human translator to review the AI output if they wanted to ensure the best accuracy.\n(Amazon claims its AI translations are “automatically evaluated for accuracy” before publication, but it doesn’t detail what steps are involved with this part of the process.)\nThe company says authors can manage and access their translations from the Kindle Direct Publishing portal, where they can choose the languages, set prices, and publish their translated work.\nReaders, meanwhile, will see AI-translated works clearly labeled as “Kindle Translate” titles and will be able to preview samples of the translation. \nKindle Translate competes with many other AI-powered translation services and tools on the market, whose pricing can vary and which offer broader support for more languages. There are also open source tools. Some people in the industry criticize the use of AI in this way, saying that human translators are better at capturing nuance — particularly in fiction and other literary works. But AI is improving on this front and will likely continue to get better over time.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAt present, Kindle’s translation service is being offered for free, according to Amazon’s announcement, which quotes an early tester who praised this aspect of the service, saying that indie authors have struggled to find a “cost-effective and trustworthy solution.”\nAmazon says translations are eligible to be enrolled in other programs, like KDP Select, and are included in its Kindle Unlimited subscription service. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSora’s Android launch is off to an auspicious start. On its first day on the Google Play Store, the AI video app from ChatGPT maker OpenAI saw an estimated 470,000 downloads across the markets where it was available, according to new estimates from app intelligence provider Appfigures.\nThat makes the Android launch more than 4x the size of the iOS launch, with 327% more installs (360,000) — but the firm notes that’s not an apples-to-apples comparison.\nOn iOS, Sora was only available in the U.S. and Canada, and it was invite-only. \nSora on Android, however, is available in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, and OpenAI dropped the invite requirement in late October for its top markets.\n\nYou can now get into the Sora app without an invite code in the US, Canada, Japan, and Korea.Limited time only.— OpenAI (@OpenAI) October 29, 2025\n\nThe app was a breakout hit following its debut, despite its earlier exclusive status. The iOS app hit over a million installs within its first week and quickly jumped to the top of the App Store. Today, it’s still ranking as the No. 4 app on the U.S. App Store’s iPhone Top Free Charts.\nWith Sora, users leverage AI to make videos using prompts. These videos can also include the users and their friends animated by AI, via a feature known as Cameos. Videos are scrollable in a TikTok-like vertical feed, so you can see what other people are making with the technology.\nAppfigures has also revised its earlier estimates for first-day iOS downloads of the Sora app. Originally, its models said the app saw around 56,000 day-one downloads. Now that more time has passed, the model can more accurately predict that the figure was closer to 110,000, with about 69,300 of those being U.S. installs.\nBy comparison, the Sora Android app saw approximately 296,000 U.S.-based installs, out of the 470,000 total, indicating there’s still interest in the AI video maker, even after the initial iOS launch buzz wore off.\nSora also competes with Meta AI, which released its mobile app to European users today, following its earlier U.S. debut.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOpenAI execs have been fielding plenty of questions about how they expect to pay for the $1.4 trillion worth of data center build-outs and usage commitments they’ve accrued this year, given that their revenue — while rising rapidly — is a $20 billion annual run rate, CEO Sam Altman said Thursday in a post on X. \nAltman’s comments came in response to comments made by OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar — which she quickly walked back. Speaking at a Wall Street Journal event on Wednesday, Friar said she wanted the U.S. government to “backstop” her company’s infrastructure loans. This, she explained, would make the company’s loans cheaper and help ensure it could always be using the latest, greatest chip.\nA backstopped loan is when the government guarantees it so if the company defaults, taxpayers pick up the bill. Lenders tend to reward low-risk loans like that with better terms.\nFriar said that using older chips, which compute-constrained OpenAI must do, makes financing options more affordable, but that the company’s goal is to always put its state-of-the-art models on the latest, greatest chips. \nSo how to pay for this revolving door of chips? She said the company is looking for an “ecosystem” to help, including banks, PE firms and, she hoped, the government.\nWhen asked what she wanted the government to do, she said, “… the backstop, the guarantee that allows the financing to happen. That can really drop the cost of the financing but also increase the loan-to-value, so the amount of debt that you can take on top of an equity portion.”\nShe also implied that such talks, particularly in the U.S., were already in the works saying, “I think we’re seeing that. The U.S. government, in particular has been incredibly forward-leaning, has really understood that AI is almost a national strategic asset.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAfter The Wall Street Journal published the clip of her discussing this desire for a federal backstop, and plenty of X users with big followers scoffed at the idea, Friar quickly walked back her comments.\n“I want to clarify my comments earlier today. OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments. I used the word ‘backstop’ and it muddied the point,” she posted on LinkedIn.\nOn Thursday, Trump’s AI czar David Sacks weighed in. Sacks (who is a big Silicon Valley VC himself), wrote on X the U.S. has no plans to bail out any AI company.\n“There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place,” he posted, adding that what the government wants to do is make “permitting and power generation easier.” While not naming her, he also forgave Friar for “clarifying” her stance.\n\nThere will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place.— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 6, 2025\n\nIn the wake of this, Altman wrote a lengthy post on X echoing Sacks’ sentiments.\n“We do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” he wrote. \nHe also clarified that the backstopped loans have been discussed — but not for his company.\n“The one area where we have discussed loan guarantees is as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US, where we and other companies have responded to the government’s call and where we would be happy to help (though we did not formally apply).”It is hard to fault Friar for floating the idea. She’s right that such a guarantee would make her financing job easier, even if, as Sacks wrote in his string, the idea of asking for a taxpayer-funded bailout is “ridiculous.” \nAs she’s now heard a resounding public “no” from someone she’d need in her corner for that idea, she and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman can expect plenty more questions about how they expect to pay for their $1 trillion buildout.\nIndeed, Altman seems braced for just such a thing. \n“We expect to end this year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030. We are looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next 8 years,” he wrote, adding that the company feels good about it’s “prospects” especially its enterprise offering, new consumer devices, and robotics. \n",

    "body": "\nParts of San Rafael, a city just north of San Francisco, are sinking about half an inch per year. That might not sound like much, but altogether, it has meant that some neighborhoods — like the Canal District that borders the bay — have sunk three feet, placing them at greater risk of flooding from sea level rise.\nSan Rafael isn’t alone. Cities around the world are threatened by rising sea levels, with 300 million people at risk of routine flooding by 2050. The cost of building seawalls to hold the waters back could top $400 billion in the U.S. alone.\nA new startup is proposing an alternative: raise the city instead.\nTerranova is building robots that will inject a slurry of wood waste into the ground, slowly lifting the land to eliminate historical subsidence and, hopefully, prevent those parts of the city from flooding.\n“The canal district is really far under sea level,” Laurence Allen, co-founder and CEO of Terranova, told TechCrunch. The city has been working with flood consultants to find a solution, he said. \n“The answer, every answer every time, has been like $500 million to $900 million of seawalls, which if you’re from San Rafael, you know they’re not even close to being able to afford that. There’s about 60,000 people and a significant portion — surprisingly for a city in Marin — are living in poverty.”\nTerranova says it can protect San Rafael and other cities like it for a fraction of the cost. In San Rafael’s case, the startup has quoted $92 million to lift 240 acres four feet. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company recently raised $7 million in a seed round led by Congruent Ventures and Outlander with participation from GoAhead Ventures, Gothams, and Ponderosa, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The oversubscribed round values the company at $25.1 million.\nLifting land by injecting stuff underground isn’t new. Terranova’s pitch is that it has developed some novel approaches that make it cheaper.\nFirst is the material: Waste wood is inexpensive and easy to obtain. The startup mixes it with other materials that it wouldn’t disclose to turn it into a slurry. The result is pumped from a 20-foot shipping container to the second cost-saving item: a robotic injection device. The tracked robotic units autonomously rove around the work site, drilling wells through which the wood slurry is delivered to depths of around 40 to 60 feet.\nSo long as the slurry remains wet underground, the wood shouldn’t decay and the company can sell carbon credits to offset costs, Allen said.\nAll of this is managed by software that Terranova has developed. The company uses public geographic information coupled with data from cores drilled throughout the state of California, mostly taken during the construction of water wells. With that, it has created a model of the subsurface that informs injection patterns, which are determined by a genetic algorithm.\nOn the backend, city planners, contractors, and other stakeholders can use a SimCity-like tool to sculpt the virtual landscape.\nWhen plans are finalized, they guide the robotic injectors, telling them both where to inject and how much. Human operators remain on site as a safety precaution, Allen said. Once the robots are done injecting, it takes about two hours for the slurry to consolidate, he added.\nTerranova has been testing both the robots and software at a pilot site for over a year, he said.\nThough some experts have questioned whether the consolidated wood slurry will exacerbate earthquake shocks, Allen said the most frequently mentioned alternatives have risks, too. “We think it’ll help [with earthquakes] versus dikes and seawalls.”\nThe company plans to make money by splitting revenue for projects with contractors. It’s hoping the costs are low enough that the process will be attractive for a range of land-lifting projects beyond cities, including remediating wetlands that are disappearing either due to subsidence or sea level rise.\nBut given the urgency of rising waters, cities are Terranova’s first priority. “I’m from San Rafael, born and raised,” Allen said. “I really want to save the city.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Friday, Amazon announced the debut of Amazon Bazaar, a new low-cost shopping destination for Asia, Africa, and Latin America that will be available separately from the main Amazon shopping app. On Bazaar, most products are available under $10, and some are as low as $2, the retailer says.\nThe product selection, available now on Android and iOS, will be available in its own app that’s available in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Nigeria.\nAmazon says more markets will gain access to the app in the months ahead.\nThe app has significant overlap with Amazon Haul, which launched last November as a competitor to Shein and Temu. Haul operates as part of Amazon’s main website and app, and will remain available in its existing markets, including the U.S., UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Australia.\nIn other markets, Amazon had already branded Amazon Haul as Bazaar, where it’s been available through Amazon’s main shopping app. That version also remains available in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. (Amazon using two names for the same low-cost selection of inventory is confusing! But Amazon thinks the different names “better resonate with local language preferences and cultures.”)\nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe move to create a standalone shopping destination for its cheaper inventory signals Amazon is ramping up the competition with the low-cost Chinese shopping apps, like Temu, Shein, and TikTok (TikTok Shop), which have seen broad adoption by younger users and others without as much disposable income to spend on clothing, decor, electronics, and other household items.\nThe Bazaar app will offer these users “hundreds of thousands” of affordable products in categories like fashion, home goods, and lifestyle products, the retailer says. Product pages feature familiar Amazon features like customer reviews and star ratings. \n\nCustomers use their same Amazon credentials to shop and check out, where they can use Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. Orders will have to meet the local minimum purchase amount to qualify for free shipping. (This varies by market.) For smaller orders, a standard delivery fee is charged. \nShipments take around 2 weeks or less, returns are free within 15 days of receipt, and Amazon offers multilingual customer support. The app itself supports six languages: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, and Traditional Chinese.\nThe app will also engage customers with interactive features like social lucky draws and promotions — things popularized by the Chinese shopping apps. New customers will also receive 50% off their first delivery as an incentive to try the app. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Should investor interest be high, it could wind up pricing higher. That means a bigger valuation and more money raised.\nThe company, which offers software to sell life insurance, is backed by Sequoia, Accel, Alphabet’s venture capital arm GV, SoftBank, General Catalyst, and Heroic Ventures. Sequoia and Accel are not selling shares in the IPO, the company disclosed.\nEthos was a rising startup star in the pre-AI era, raising one big round after another through 2021. In its early rounds, it was backed by a who’s who of family offices, including those of Will Smith, Robert Downey Jr., Kevin Durant, and Jay-Z, the company told TechCrunch in 2018. \nIt hit a $2.7 billion valuation in 2021 having raised $400 million by then, most of it that year. It completed only very small fundraises after that, PitchBook estimates.  \nEthos is profitable and has been for years, its IPO documents disclose. In the nine months ending September 30, Ethos generated almost $278 million in revenue and just under $46.6 million in net income. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n",

A number of teen suicides have been linked to the chatbot, and, like other AI vendors, OpenAI has also been criticized for allowing ChatGPT to discuss sexual topics with young users. Last April, the company was forced to address a bug that allowed its chatbot to generate erotica for users who were under the age of 18.\nThe company has already been working on its underage user problem for some time, and its new “age prediction” feature merely adds to protections already in place. The new feature leverages an AI algorithm that assesses user accounts for particular “behavioral and account-level signals,” in an effort to identify young users, OpenAI said in a blog post Tuesday.\nThose “signals” include things like the user’s stated age, the length of time an account has existed, and the times of day that the account is usually active, the company said. The company already has content filters designed to weed out discussions of sex, violence, and other potentially problematic topics for users who are under age 18. If the age prediction mechanism identifies an account as under 18, those filters are automatically applied.\nIf a user is mistakenly designated as underage, there is a way for them to reestablish their “adult” account. They can submit a selfie to OpenAI’s ID verification partner Persona, OpenAI says.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

    "body": "\nInvestors and companies alike are trying to leverage developmental gains in AI to make leaps in technologies like robotics and autonomous vehicles — what’s being referred to now as “physical AI.” That means some of the billions of dollars flowing to AI startups is starting to spill toward suppliers doing behind-the-scenes work to make these technologies real.\nThe latest case is Ethernovia, which on Tuesday announced a $90 million Series B. The company, located in San Jose, makes Ethernet-based processors that help collect data from sensors scattered around a system — like in an autonomous vehicle — and quickly move it to a central computer.\nThe company was already backed by Porsche SE and Qualcomm Ventures, but this round was led by Maverick Silicon — an AI-focused fund created in 2024 by hedge fund Maverick Capital. It was the first sector-specific fund that Maverick Capital launched in its 30-year history. It’s that kind of attention and funding that we’ll likely see more of this year as investors look to boost more under-the-radar companies like Ethernovia.\n",

    "body": "\nCorina Marshall spent 11 years working in retail digital marketing and realized the industry was behind the times. \nSpecifically, the technology that helped retail brands sell unsold or excess products (off-channel inventory) wasn’t as sophisticated as it could have been. Brands sell their excess inventory at discount retailers like Nordstrom Rack, but often lose money because managing unsold inventory is difficult. Products are spread across warehouses, and teams are left guessing the value of an item and when the best time to sell it is. \n“Too much time passes between each step of the off-channel inventory funnel, making it difficult to move products to the destinations that are most favorable for the brands and retailers,” Marshall told TechCrunch. \nShe decided to give the off-channel market a tech boost. In 2024, she launched her company Another, a software system that helps companies manage unsold or excess products. The secondary markets where these items are usually sold operate under tight timelines and can feature highly dynamic pricing due to fluctuating demand. For a retailer to succeed in a place like Nordstrom Rack, it needs to have fast access to real-time data and coordination so that clothes can efficiently move from the retailer to the warehouse to the store, she said.\nAnother connects to a business’s existing software systems, such as those that manage customer returns, to better centralize an organization’s data and workflows. This way, teams across the company can access data from the same place, making decision-making more effective. \nThe company announced Tuesday a $2.5 million seed round led by Anthemis FIL and Westbound. \nMarshall said she met her lead investors through an industry event last year and said the fresh capital will be used to speed product development and hire. She considers her competitors’ marketplaces like Ghost, another company that also helps brands sell unsold inventory.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHowever, she said, Another hopes to help companies address excess inventory before brands opt to sell items to bulk resellers. She says items sold through such resellers may be deeply discounted, an outcome brands might not want.\n“Another’s technology provides real-time data and insights that give teams confidence in when, where, and how to move inventory, enabling smarter decisions that maximize value rather than defaulting to liquidation,” she said. Overall, she hopes her product helps move the industry toward solutions that better balance profitability and sustainability, as excess inventory is often destroyed if it is not moved quickly enough. \n“Consumers gain access to better prices, more optionality, while brands and retailers improve profitability and reduce waste, making it a win for everyone involved.” \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOnline mentoring site UStrive has resolved a security lapse that exposed the personal information of its users, including children. \nThe exposed data included the full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other non-public and user-provided information of UStrive users, which was accessible to any other logged-in user.\nThe nonprofit, previously known as Strive for College, provides online mentorship to high school and college students through its platform. The organization would not say whether it plans to inform users about the security incident. \nLast week, a person who asked not to be named alerted TechCrunch to the security flaw on UStrive’s mentoring platform. By examining the network traffic while signed in and navigating the site — such as viewing user profiles — anyone could see streams of users’ personal information in their browser tools.\nThe person said that UStrive was relying on a vulnerable Amazon-hosted GraphQL endpoint — a type of query database interface — that allowed access to reams of user data stored on UStrive’s servers. Some user records contained more data than others, including information provided by the student, such as their gender and date of birth. The person said that there were at least 238,000 user records at the time of discovery. UStrive meanwhile states on its home page that more than “1.1 million students have opted in for a UStrive mentor.”\nTechCrunch confirmed the data exposure after creating a new user account on UStrive, and notified the company’s executives by email on Thursday.\nJohn D. McIntyre, an attorney with Virginia law firm McIntyre Stein, which is representing UStrive, said in a letter provided to TechCrunch later on Thursday that UStrive is “currently in litigation with one of its former software engineers,” and as such the company is “somewhat limited in its ability to respond.” \nTechCrunch told McIntyre that the company at that time still had a security lapse exposing the private and personal information of children, and asked McIntyre to notify TechCrunch if UStrive planned to fix the data exposure, and if so, by when.\nMcIntyre did not respond to our inquiry. \nIn response to TechCrunch’s initial outreach, UStrive chief technology officer Dwamian Mcleish told TechCrunch by email late on Thursday that the exposure had been “remediated.” \nTechCrunch sent Mcleish follow-up emails with more questions about the incident, including: whether the company plans to notify its users about the security lapse, whether the company has the ability to check if there was any improper or malicious access to users’ data, and whether the company’s platform had undergone a security audit and, if so, by whom.\nUStrive founder Michael J. Carter did not comment for this article. \n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

The streaming company said the option will be available with the premiere of its livestreamed talent show “Star Search” on January 20.\nSubscribers will be able to either pick a selection from a multiple-choice menu or rate someone’s performance on a scale of five stars. Votes can be cast using either a TV remote or the Netflix app. \nNetflix said that the feature will work globally, and on the back end, the platform will tally votes in real time. Viewers will have a limited time to vote, and once that time has lapsed, additional votes won’t count. That means if you’re watching the show later, you can’t participate in the voting.\nImage Credits:Netflix\nThe streamer started testing live voting in August 2025 with “Dinner Time Live with David Chang.” During TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, the company’s CTO, Elizabeth Stone, confirmed that the company would soon launch the feature widely.\n“If you’re sitting at home watching ‘Star Search’ on your TV, you’ll be able to either on the TV or your mobile phone actually put in a vote that advances or doesn’t advance some of the contestants on the show,” Stone had said.\n“So it’s just a very early starting example of the ways that we think content can be more interactive over time, across devices, between TV and mobile, where a member who subscribes to Netflix can actually feel like they’re part of the story, influence the storyline, and feel immersed in that.”\nNetflix has heavily leaned in to live content with shows like “Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney” and “Dinner Time Live with David Chang,” along with sports broadcasts, including the NFL Christmas special and WWE shows. In October, the company launched interactive games that people can play on their smart TVs. Netflix is now merging both these threads into one by launching live voting.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nElon Musk said over the long weekend that Tesla aims to restart work on Dojo3, the electric vehicle company’s previously abandoned third-generation AI chip. Only this time, Dojo3 won’t be aimed at training self-driving models on Earth. Instead, Musk says it will be dedicated to “space-based AI compute.”\nThe move comes five months after Tesla effectively shut down its Dojo effort. The company disbanded the team behind its Dojo supercomputer following the departure of Dojo lead Peter Bannon. Around 20 Dojo workers also left to join DensityAI, a new AI infrastructure startup founded by former Dojo head Ganesh Venkataramanan and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.\nAt the time of Dojo’s shutdown, Bloomberg reported Tesla planned to increase its reliance on Nvidia and other partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing, rather than continue developing its own custom silicon. Musk’s latest comments suggest the strategy has shifted again.\nThe billionaire executive and Republican megadonor said in a post on X the decision to revive Dojo was based on the state of its in-house chip roadmap, noting that Tesla’s AI5 chip design was “in good shape.”\nTesla’s AI5 chip, made by TSMC, was designed to power the automaker’s automated driving features and Optimus humanoid robots. Last summer, Tesla signed a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to build its AI6 chips that promise to power Tesla vehicles and Optimus, as well as enable high-performance AI training in data centers. \n“AI7/Dojo3 will be for space-based AI compute,” Musk said on Sunday, positioning the resurrected project as more of a moonshot. \nTo achieve that, Tesla is now gearing up to rebuild the team it dismantled months ago. Musk used the same post to recruit engineers directly, writing: “If you’re interested in working on what will be the highest volume chips in the world, send a note to AI_Chips@Tesla.com with 3 bullet points on the toughest technical problems you’ve solved.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe timing of the announcement is notable. At CES 2026, Nvidia unveiled Alpamayo, an open source AI model for autonomous driving that directly challenges Tesla’s FSD software. Musk commented on X that solving the long tail of rare edge cases in driving is “super hard,” adding: “I honestly hope they succeed.” \nMusk and several other AI executives have argued the future of data centers may lie off-planet, since Earth’s power grids are already strained to the max. Axios recently reported Musk rival and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also excited by the prospect of putting data centers into orbit. Musk has an edge over his peers because he already controls the launch vehicles.\nPer Axios, Musk plans to use SpaceX’s upcoming IPO to help finance his vision of using Starship to launch a constellation of compute satellites that can operate in constant sunlight, harvesting solar power 24/7. \nStill, there are many roadblocks to making AI data centers in space a possibility, not least the challenge of cooling high-power compute in a vacuum. Musk’s comments of Tesla building “space-based AI compute” fit a familiar pattern: float an idea that sounds far-fetched, then try to brute-force it into reality. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nServe Robotics, the sidewalk delivery robot company backed by Nvidia and Uber, is expanding into a new category with its latest acquisition: healthcare. \nLos Angeles-based Serve Robotics announced Tuesday it was acquiring Diligent Robotics, a startup that builds robots named Moxi designed to assist in hospitals by delivering lab samples, supplies, and other tasks. The deal values Diligent’s common stock at $29 million.\nDiligent Robotics was founded in 2017 by Andrea Thomaz and Vivian Chu and has raised more than $75 million in venture capital — most recently raising a $25 million funding round in 2023.\nThe acquisition marks Serve’s first foray beyond its food-delivery roots. The sidewalk delivery robots company was incubated inside food delivery company Postmates in 2017. The project continued after Uber bought Postmates, before spinning off in 2021. Serve went public in April 2024 via a reverse merger.\nServe co-founder and CEO Ali Kashani doesn’t view the acquisition as a big deviation from the company’s initial target.\nWhile the company hasn’t focused specifically on healthcare thus far, how Diligent’s robot Moxi operates does fit squarely into the company’s thesis around last-mile delivery and robots that can navigate alongside humans, Kashani told TechCrunch in a recent interview. \n“This is a kind of a classic example of a prepared mind meets opportunity,” Kashani said. “Robots that are moving among people is the broader opportunity for us. Once you solve the problem, which is how to get robots to seamlessly move among people as autonomous machines, then you can bring it to a lot of other environments. We knew that we wanted to do this someday.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHealthcare wasn’t a specific goal for expansion either, Kashani said, but rather the companies were introduced at the perfect time. Diligent was looking to scale and Serve was opportunistically looking into new areas.\n“We love the team; they have very similar DNA to us, which is, rather than building in a lab, they build in real life,” Kashani said. “It just seems like it’s really aligned with our mission.”\nDiligent will continue to operate relatively independently within Serve, Kashani said. Diligent will tap into Serve’s software and tools to help them work toward scale and the companies will share tech and collaborate, he added.\nKashani said this isn’t a pivot for the company, nor does it mean that Serve is looking to acquire more startups, he added. Kashani, who emphasized that Serve is still very focused on its sidewalk-delivery robots, said they would “keep our eyes open” for interesting companies as potential partners, not necessarily acquisition targets.\nServe was able to grow its fleet of robots in 2025 from 100 to more than 2,000, he said. The company also signed a partnership with DoorDash to facilitate some of their deliveries in Los Angeles in October.\n“Our sidewalk business is what’s fueling everything,” Kashani said. “It’s creating the technology. It’s one of the largest autonomous fleets in the world right now and developing that helps us create everything that we need in other applications.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

Russell had argued he was unwilling to turn over his phone until he received assurances from Luminar that his personal information would be protected; the Tuesday filing shows the two sides agreed to hash out exact steps on how that information will be handled.\nLuminar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December after losing major contracts with customers like Volvo and Mercedes-Benz, as well as rising competition from lidar companies in China.\nLuminar reached a deal last week with a company called Quantum Computing Inc. (QCI) to sell its lidar assets for $22 million. (Luminar is also trying to sell its semiconductor division to QCI for $110 million.) Luminar has scheduled an auction for the end of this month in an attempt to solicit bids that might beat QCI’s offer.\nRussell tried to buy Luminar in October, months after his abrupt resignation as CEO due to an ethics inquiry, but before the company filed for bankruptcy. Representatives for his new venture, Russell AI Labs, have told TechCrunch that he remains interested in submitting a bid for Luminar’s lidar assets, but a formal offer has not yet been submitted.\nLuminar has been seeking information from Russell since his resignation as it decides whether to take legal action against him. The founder has already turned over multiple computers but held on to his phone because of privacy concerns. (Luminar originally claimed it was seeking two phones from Russell, one provided by the company and one personal. Russell has since said in court filings that he only ever had one phone during his time at Luminar.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

Restaurants partner with Claim to create promotions, boost foot traffic, and track performance insights through the Claim dashboard.\nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed; however, Claim raised a total of $20 million, it said, when it raised its $12 million Series A in October, 2024. PitchBook estimated its valuation at $62 million.\nGrubhub says the acquisition will give restaurants on its platform access to Claim’s customer acquisition and retention tools, while Grubhub diners will receive additional savings and rewards for dining out.\n“By combining a delightful rewards experience and powerful machine learning models, we match restaurants with their next regulars. Claim is a game-changer for these businesses, and joining Grubhub marks an exciting new chapter as we scale to reach millions more diners and thousands of restaurants,” Claim CEO and co-founder Sam Obletz in a statement.\nGrubhub told TechCrunch that all members of the Claim team were extended offers to join Grubhub. \nUnder Grubhub, Claim will enable more restaurants to connect with consumers through personalized rewards.

    "body": "\nTwo members of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency may have accessed and shared Social Security numbers in an effort to help an advocacy group “overturn election results in certain States” last year, according to court documents. \nThe revelation, which was first reported by Politico, comes as part of a series of corrections to previous testimony by top Social Security Administration officials related to legal battles over DOGE’s access to Social Security data. \nNeither the two DOGE members, nor the advocacy group, are named in the court documents.\nIn March 2025, a political advocacy group contacted two members of the DOGE team at the Social Security Administration (SSA) “with a request to analyze state voter rolls that the advocacy group had acquired,” Elizabeth Shapiro, a Justice Department official, wrote in the court documents. \n“The advocacy group’s stated aim was to find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain States,” said Shapiro.\nShapiro wrote that after these communications, one of the DOGE members, as an SSA employee, signed and sent a “Voter Data Agreement” with the advocacy group. \nThe DOGE members may have accessed private information that was ruled to be off-limits by a court at the time, and shared data on unapproved “third-party” servers. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“At this time, there is no evidence that SSA employees outside of the involved members of the DOGE Team were aware of the communications with the advocacy group. Nor were they aware of the ‘Voter Data Agreement’,” Shapiro wrote.\nIt’s unclear if the two DOGE members ended up sharing the data, according to Shapiro, but emails “suggest that DOGE Team members could have been asked to assist the advocacy group by accessing SSA data to match to the voter rolls.” \nAccording to Shapiro, the SSA referred the two DOGE employees for potential violations of the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits federal workers from leveraging their official positions for political activities. \nLast year, a federal judge issued an order to block DOGE’s members access to SSA’s systems, which included SSNs, medical records, drivers’ license numbers, tax information, and other types of personal information. Later on, an SSA whistleblower alleged that DOGE uploaded hundreds of millions of Social Security records to a vulnerable cloud server.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nHumans&, a startup with a philosophy that AI should empower people rather than replace them, has raised $480 million in seed funding at a $4.48 billion valuation, reports The New York Times. Investors in the round include chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and VC firms SV Angel, GV, and Laurene Powell Jobs’ firm Emerson Collective. \nThe megadeal for the three-month-old company follows a trend of investors throwing money at startups founded by breakaways of major AI labs. Humans&’s founders include Andi Peng, a former Anthropic researcher who worked on reinforcement learning and post-training of Claude 3.5 through 4.5; Georges Harik, Google’s seventh employee, who helped build its first advertising systems; Eric Zelikman and Yuchen He, two former xAI researchers who helped develop the Grok chatbot; and Noah Goodman, a Stanford professor of psychology and computer science. \nThe company’s 20-odd employees also come from OpenAI, Meta, Reflection, AI2, and MIT, according to the company. The startup aims to use software to help people collaborate with each other — think an AI version of an instant messaging app. One of their goals is to use existing AI techniques to train AI in new ways, like programming chatbots to request information from the user and store it for later use. \nIn order to build AI that serves “as a deeper connective tissue that strengthens organizations and communities,” Humans& hopes to rethink “how we train models at scale and how people interact with AI,” per the company’s web page. The startup cited a need for innovations in “long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding,” as well as a tightly integrated focus on both science and product development.\nTechCrunch has reached out for comment. \nThe Humans& seed round, while enormous, is far from an outlier in the current AI funding environment. The largest seed round in history, for now, belongs to Thinking Machines Lab, which raised $2 billion last July at a $12 billion valuation, led by Andreessen Horowitz. Founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati alongside top researchers from Meta and Google, the company initially attracted enormous enthusiasm, though the departure of half of the company’s founding team across recent months suggests that massive capital and pedigree don’t guarantee immediate success.\nOther notable mega-seed rounds include Unconventional AI’s $475 million raise in December at a $4.5 billion valuation — the company, founded by former Databricks AI head Naveen Rao, is developing energy-efficient neuromorphic computing systems — and Lila Sciences’ $200 million seed round last March for its autonomous AI-powered laboratory platform.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLMArena, the AI model benchmarking platform that spun out of UC Berkeley, similarly bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture, raising $100 million at a $600 million valuation last May. Earlier this month, the three-year-old outfit announced a $150 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $1.7 billion.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nOne of the more prominent alternative app stores that emerged in the EU as a result of the region’s Digital Markets Act is shutting down. The store, Setapp Mobile, from the Ukrainian-based developer MacPaw, first launched in September 2024, offering dozens of apps across categories like productivity, finance, video, photo, creativity, and more.\nIts model offered consumers access to all of Setapp’s mobile apps through a $9.99 monthly subscription, provided the user’s Apple ID was associated with an EU member state.\nNow the company says all applications will be removed from Setapp Mobile by the end of the sunset date, February 16, 2026. Applications that are available on Setapp Desktop will not be affected, the company told TechCrunch.\nThe news of the shutdown, announced on Setapp’s support site, was first spotted by MacRumors.\nMacPaw stated that “still-evolving and complex business terms that don’t fit Setapp’s current business model” are the reason for its decision.\nThe “complex business terms” being referenced here are Apple’s complicated set of fees for apps operating under its new business terms in the EU, which include a controversial Core Technology Fee that charges developers €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months.\nThe tech giant revised its fee structure last year to avoid further penalties for noncompliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), but instead of simplifying the fees, it made them more complex.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne result of these constant changes is that developers can’t properly plan how to grow and monetize their business. It also suggests the fees, as they stand, don’t make running an alternative app store in the EU a viable option.\nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch, Setapp said it found its business model was not “viable,” as the commercial conditions continued to change. The statement reads:\n\nSetapp Mobile was a bold, breakthrough project that aimed to provide EU iOS users with access to alternative app marketplaces — creating a new app ecosystem where both developers and users could thrive. We are proud of what we have accomplished with it over the past two years and still believe passionately in this vision. As a result of still-evolving commercial conditions, we have determined that it is not viable to continue development or support for Setapp Mobile within Setapp’s current business model. While we are disappointed to discontinue Setapp Mobile and let down our user base and developer community in the EU, we are looking forward to pursuing the development of other innovations.\n\nThere are still other alternative app stores operating in the EU, including, most notably, the Epic Games Store from the maker of Fortnite and the open source AltStore.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIn an effort to sweeten the pot for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shareholders, Netflix is now offering cash for shares of the company, revising the cash-and-stock deal it had struck with WBD’s board earlier. \nHowever, the streaming giant is still offering the same $27.75 the companies had agreed on for WBD’s movie studio and streaming assets, and the deal continues to value the company at $82.7 billion.\nThe new offer serves to simplify the deal structure, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday, and “provides greater certainty of value,” and speeds up the timeline for a shareholder vote. Netflix said it would finance the deal with cash, debt, and “committed financing.”\nThe change-up comes as rival suitor Paramount Skydance has intensified efforts to win over WBD’s shareholders with its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for the entirety of the company, including securing a $40 billion guarantee from its CEO David Ellison’s billionaire dad, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.\nParamount, which has been trying to buy Warner Bros. Discovery for months, last week sued the company for more information on Netflix’s offer and said it would nominate new members to Warner Bros.’ board, after WBD rebuffed its offer. The company also sought to expedite the lawsuit, but the court rejected that effort.\nNetflix, for its part, had until now stuck to its original cash-and-share offer, enjoying the full backing of WBD’s board, which has resolutely rejected Paramount’s bids. WBD has argued that selling to Netflix would make for a better deal because the streaming giant has the capital to pay, and has said that Paramount’s deal poses “materially more risk,” as it would saddle the combined company with $87 billion in debt.\nWarner Bros. has also called into question Paramount’s ability to function after the deal goes through, arguing that raising such amounts of debt would further worsen Paramount’s current “junk” credit rating, and has raised concerns about Paramount’s negative free cash flow, which would be exacerbated by the acquisition.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWBD said in October that it was exploring a sale after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties. The company, valued at over $45 billion at the time but burdened with billions in debt, has struggled amid declining cable viewership and intensifying competition from streaming rivals like Netflix. The streaming giant soon after came out on top after winning a bidding war against Paramount and Comcast.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

It was founded just a few months ago, in September, 2025, by Kyutai founding member Neil Zeghidour, who cut his teeth working with voice models as a researcher at Google DeepMind.\nThe startup’s goal, it says, is to make voice models speedier and more accurate for developers. And, as a European startup, it launched with multilingual support out of the gate: English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese, with additional languages coming. \nOf course, Gradium is entering a race with plenty of competition. For starters, the frontier LLM companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta Llma, and Mistral all have voice, speech recognition, and multimodal models. Then there are well-funded startups like ElevenLabs, and hundreds of voice/speech models on Hugging Face. Right now, there’s no shortage of options for a developer needing AI voice capabilities. \nThat said, the need for what Gradium hopes to offer — ultra-realistic voice expression and accuracy — will only grow over time, as AI moves from typed chats to AI agents and expands into use cases from entertainment to work.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Startups\n",

Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms for millions of businesses to build and manage online stores. The company reports Shopify merchants handle over 10% of all e-commerce transactions in the U.S.\nThe issues began surfacing around 6:45 a.m. PT, when select merchants reported difficulties logging into their Shopify accounts. Additionally, many faced challenges accessing point-of-sale (POS) systems, preventing them from processing transactions. \nShopify’s status page recently confirmed that the company had identified and remedied the cause of the problem: its login authentication flow, which explains the POS login complications. Shopify stated that it’s now seeing signs of recovery and that it will continue monitoring the situation. It also advised merchants that its Help Center was experiencing longer-than-normal wait times for support as a result of today’s outage.\nThe exact number of affected merchants is unclear. However, Downdetector, a website that tracks user-submitted reports about website issues, noted there were about 4,000 outage incidents.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n",

According to The Wall Street Journal, workers moving into data-center construction are seeing pay jumps of 25% to 30% compared to their previous jobs — and in some cases, much more.\nAmong them is DeMond Chambliss, who traded his small drywall business in Columbus, Ohio, for a supervisor role overseeing 200 workers at a data center site. He now makes over $100,000 annually. “I pinch myself going to work every day,” the 51-year-old tells the Journal. In Oregon, electrical safety specialist Marc Benner pulls in $225,000 a year, while electrician Andrew Mason makes over $200,000 managing workers at six Northern Virginia data centers.\nThe Journal reports this isn’t just about higher base pay. Companies are sweetening the pot with perks like heated break tents, free lunches, daily incentive bonuses, and even remote project management positions. One construction site offers workers $100 in daily incentive pay, which can add up.\nThe surge comes as tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to build hundreds of new data centers, colliding with an industry-wide shortage of roughly 439,000 skilled workers, according to the Associated Builders and Contractors trade group. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is bulking up its AI agent platform, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, to make building and monitoring AI agents easier for enterprises.\nAWS announced multiple new AgentCore features on Tuesday during the company’s annual AWS re:Invent conference. The company announced new tools for managing AI agent boundaries, agent memory capabilities, and agent evaluation features.\nOne upgrade is the introduction of Policy in AgentCore. This feature allows users to set boundaries for agent interactions using natural language. These boundaries integrate with AgentCore Gateway, which connects AI agents with outside tools, to automatically check each agent’s action and stop those that violate written controls.\nPolicy allows developers to set access controls to certain internal data or third-party applications like Salesforce or Slack. These boundaries can also include telling an AI agent they can automatically issue refunds up to $100 but must bring a human in the loop for anything larger, David Richardson, vice president of AgentCore, told TechCrunch.\nThe company also announced AgentCore Evaluations, which is a suite of 13 pre-built evaluation systems for AI agents that monitor factors including correctness, safety, and tool selection accuracy, among others. This also allows developers to have a head start in building their own evaluation features as well.\n“That one is really going to help address the biggest fears that people have [with] deploying agents,” Richardson said about the new evaluation capabilities. “[It’s] a thing that a lot of people want to have but is tedious to build.”\nAWS also announced that it’s building a memory capability into the agent platform, AgentCore Memory. This feature allows agents to develop a log of information on users over time, like their flight time or hotel preferences, and use that information to inform future decisions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Across these three things, we are continuing to iterate at the different layers at AgentCore,” Richardson said. “Talking to existing systems with Policy, [making agents] more powerful with [AgentCore Memory], helping the development team iterate with an agent.”\nWhile agents are the soup du jour of the AI industry right now, some people believe the technology won’t last. But Richardson thinks that the tools AgentCore is developing can withstand the fast-moving market even as trends change — which he expects they will.\n“Being able to take advantage of the reasoning capabilities of these models, which is coupled with being able to do real world things through tools, feels like a sustainable pattern,” Richardson said. “The way that pattern works will definitely change. I think we feel ready for that.”\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual enterprise tech event here.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAmazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs. \nThe cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at its AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product in on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips.  \nAWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation, according to AWS. \nAWS says the systems are more than four times faster, with four times more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10 times the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. \nPerhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation.  While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.\nIt is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscience way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.  \nAWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, Splashmusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step-up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.  \nThis means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.  \nIt’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), has become the de facto standard that all the majorAI apps are built to support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud.\nAmazon did not announce a timeline for Trainium4. If Amazon follows previous rollout timelines, we’ll likely hear more about Trainium4 at next year’s conference.\n",

    "description": "\nTV makers need to get more lifetime value from a customer after selling a unit. With more competition in the market, companies often need to sell TVs",
    "body": "\nTV makers need to get more lifetime value from a customer after selling a unit. With more competition in the market, companies often need to sell TVs at a discounted price with lower margins. The best way for them to recover the money is by striking partnerships with channels, streaming services, and advertisers.\nThis is the core thesis around Barcelona-based Titan OS, which provides a smart TV operating system to TV makers with a promise to get better lifetime value out of the customer.\nThe company said today it has raised €50 million ($58 million) in Series A funding, led by Highland Europe, with participation from Mangrove Capital Partners. The company didn’t specify how much money it has raised to date, but said that its seed round, raised in 2023, was in double-digit millions. \nThe startup was founded in 2023 by Jacinto Roca, Timothy Edwards, Miquel Barba, and Tobias Pfalzgraff. Roca previously founded a streaming startup called Wukai.tv and sold it to Rakuten. Other co-founders have also held various roles at Rakuten.\nJacinto Roca Image Credits: Titan OS\nTitan OS now serves 18 million users, largely across Europe and Latin America, via partnerships with Phillips and JVC.\nThe software is designed to help users discover content easily, as Nielsen said in 2023 that the time spent trying to find content to watch has increased. Titan OS aims to use data insights from users and its vast content portfolio to reduce that time. Across the OS, users have access to a mix of broadcast TV, streaming apps that they subscribe to, along with FAST (free ad-supported television) channels from Titan OS’s partners.\nFor the company, revenue opportunity lies in a few key areas. First, it partners with many FAST services to help them reach the local audience. Second, there are advertising opportunities on the home screen of the TV and during streams that reach millions of users. The company said its content partners are eager to reach new audiences through advertising, especially event-heavy content channels that show sports.\nTitan OS also offers shoppable ads that have customers perform actions like scanning a QR code to buy an item. The startup said that through these areas, it has grown 10x in revenue in two years.\nWhile TV makers like Sony might not shed their core operating system, they are keen to partner with companies like Titan OS to offer more FAST channels to their customers. Multiple reports suggest that for TV makers, advertising is becoming a more lucrative revenue-earning option than hardware itself. Titan OS COO Edwards buys into this ethos. \n“It used to be the case that hardware manufacturers made most of their profit from selling the device itself. But now, some hardware manufacturers that have their own operating system make more profit from ongoing content and advertising revenues than they do from actually selling the hardware. And this is a big change,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\n“What we offer them [TV companies] is an ability to generate ongoing content and advertising revenues after the device is sold, which is not the status quo in the market.”\nEdwards said that, to expand the company’s footprint in Europe, the company is bolstering its portfolio of local language ad-supported channels catered to each geography. With this strategy, the startup, which competes with the likes of Whale TV and Xperi’s TiVO, offers over 100 channels in these markets.\nThe company currently has 200 people across three offices in Barcelona, Amsterdam, and Taipei. The additional funding will help Titan OS bolster the staff across product and sales, work on new partnerships, and create new advertising projects. The company aims to maintain its growth curve and raise additional funding next year.\nLaurance Garrett, a partner at Highland Europe, equated Titan OS with WeTransfer, the VC firm’s investment that was acquired by Bending Spoons.\n“With Titan OS, there is the beauty of the advertising model on top of the actual core OS.  It was something we could identify with [from their experience with WeTransfer], and the partners loved it,” he said.\nGarrett added that with Titan OS’s European roots, the company can better understand the nitty-gritty of the local market as compared to players coming in from abroad.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSimular, a startup building AI agents for Mac OS and Windows, has raised a $21.5 million Series A led by Felicis, with existing seed investors NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture arm), South Park Commons, and others joining in.  \nSimular is an interesting agentic startup because unlike others, it isn’t trying to control the browser but the PC itself. (Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention.) “We can literally move the mouse on the screen and do the click. So it’s more capable of doing, repeating whatever human activities in the digital world,” co-founder CEO Ang Li told TechCrunch, offering the example of copying and pasting data into a spreadsheet. \nOn Monday it announced the release of its 1.0 version for Mac OS. But it’s also working with Microsoft to develop an agent for Windows. The startup is one of five agentic companies accepted into the Windows 365 for Agents program Microsoft announced in mid November. (The others are Manus AI, Fellou, Genspark, and TinyFish.) As for the timeline for the Windows version, Li was vague except to say it promises to be as or more popular than the Mac version. \nAnother reason to watch Simular is the bona fides of the founders: Li is a continuous learning scientist who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, where he met his cofounder, reinforcement learning specialist Jiachen Yang. While their team published their fair share of papers, the work wasn’t strictly academic, Li said. It was intended to improve Google products, including Waymo. \nThat AI product background is helpful because, before the agentic future of Silicon Valley’s dreams can materialize, there are a host of technical problems to solve. One of the biggest is that LLMs hallucinate some percentage of the time.\nAgentic tasks can require completing thousands to millions of discrete steps. Not only can a hallucination at any single step invalidate all of the agent’s work, but hallucinations become statistically more likely as the number of steps grows.  \nOne way to solve this is to make the “non deterministic” LLM “deterministic,” meaning instead of allowing the LLM to be endlessly creative, its responses or actions are scripted the same each time. But that risks limiting the whole creative problem solving aspect of an agent.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSimular is marrying the two. Its agent will iterate freely on the task, with the human user in the middle course correcting, until the agent achieves success. Then the human locks in that task’s workflow, which makes it deterministic, repeatable. \n“Our solution is, let agents keep exploring the successful trajectory. Once you found a successful trajectory, that becomes deterministic code,” Li explains. \nThe reason the startup can do this is because its work – which Li admits is still early – is not just an LLM wrapper that sends and retrieves data to a model.\n“We have a new technology which is not used by any other agent company. We call it ‘neuro symbolic computer use agents.’ It’s not fully LLM based,” he said. “Our approach to solve hallucinations is to let the LLM write code which becomes deterministic. So if you have a workflow that works, the next time we run the same workflow, it’ll be successful as well.”  \nAnother benefit is that this deterministic code that performs a repeatable task is in the hands of the end user, not the LLM. “Once they have the code, they can trust it, because they can inspect it, they can audit it, they can see what’s going on,” Li says.\nTime will tell if this method is the magic that will bring agents into the hands of every worker. Li says his early beta customers include a car dealership automating VIN number searches, and HOAs extracting contract information from PDFs. And the company’s open source project (available only for Mac OS at the moment) has led to automations ranging from content creation to sales and marketing.  \nSimular previously raised a $5 million seed, bringing its total raised to about $27 million. Other investors in the company include Basis Set Ventures, Flying Fish Partners, Samsung NEXT, Xoogler Ventures, and podcaster and angel investor Lenny Rachitsky, the company says.\n",

    "body": "\nNvidia announced new infrastructure and AI models on Monday as it works to build the backbone technology for physical AI, including robots and autonomous vehicles that can perceive and interact with the real world.\nThe semiconductor giant announced Alpamayo-R1, an open reasoning vision language model for autonomous driving research at the NeurIPS AI conference in San Diego, California. The company claims this is the first vision language action model focused on autonomous driving. Visual language models can process both text and images together, allowing vehicles to “see” their surroundings and make decisions based on what they perceive.\nThis new model is based on Nvidia’s Cosmos-Reason model, a reasoning model that thinks through decisions before it responds. Nvidia initially released the Cosmos model family in January 2025. Additional models were released in August.\nTechnology like the Alpamayo-R1 is critical for companies looking to reach level 4 autonomous driving, which means full autonomy in a defined area and under specific circumstances, Nvidia said in a blog post.\nNvidia hopes that this type of reasoning model will give autonomous vehicles the “common sense” to better approach nuanced driving decisions like humans do.\nThis new model is available on GitHub and Hugging Face.\nAlongside the new vision model, Nvidia also uploaded new step-by-step guides, inference resources, and post-training workflows to GitHub — collectively called the Cosmos Cookbook — to help developers better use and train Cosmos models for their specific use cases. The guide covers data curation, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese announcements come as the company is pushing full-speed into physical AI as a new avenue for its advanced AI GPUs. \nNvidia’s co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that the next wave of AI is physical AI. Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, echoed that sentiment in a conversation with TechCrunch over the summer, emphasizing physical AI in robotics.\n“I think eventually robots are going to be a huge player in the world and we want to basically be making the brains of all the robots,” Dally said at the time. “To do that, we need to start developing the key technologies.”\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nA Google Search exec said that one of the company’s biggest opportunities in AI lies in its ability to get to know the user better and personalize its responses. \nThe promise is AI that’s uniquely helpful because it knows you. But the risk is AI that feels more like surveillance than service.\nIn a recent episode of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses.\n“We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.”\nGoogle has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when Gemini was still known as Bard. More recently, it began pulling personal data into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like Gmail, Calendar and Drive.\nBut as Google integrates more personal data into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, location history, and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. \nGoogle’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations.\nThat, Stein said, would be “much more useful” than just showing users a more generic list of the best-selling products in a given category. “That is, I think, very much the vision — of building something that can be really knowledgeable for you, specifically.”\nThis idea isn’t all that different from how the “Others” in the hit Apple TV show “Pluribus” have gobbled up the world’s knowledge, including intimate details about individuals. When the system interacts with the show’s protagonist, Carol, it uses that data to personalize everything: cooking her favorite meals, adopting a familiar face to handle its communications with her, and otherwise anticipating her needs.\nBut Carol doesn’t find the personalized responses kind; she finds them invasive. She never consented to sharing her data with the hivemind, yet it knows her better than she’d like.\nSimilarly, it seems that avoiding Google’s data-gobbling ways will get increasingly difficult in the AI era, and if Google doesn’t get the balance right, the results could feel more creepy than useful.\n(To be clear: Google does let you control the apps Gemini uses to make its AI more knowledgeable about you specifically — it’s under “Connected Apps” in Gemini’s settings.)\nIf you do share app data with Gemini, Google says it will save and use that data according to the Gemini privacy policy. And that policy reminds users that human reviewers may read some of their data and not to “enter confidential information that you wouldn’t want a reviewer to see or Google to use to improve its services.”\nBut as more data gets ingested into Google’s own hivemind, it’s easy to see how AI could make data privacy more of a gray area.\nGoogle, however, believes it has a solution of sorts.\nStein says that Google will indicate when its AI responses are personalized.\n“I think people want to intuitively understand when they’re being personalized — when information is made for them, versus when [it’s] something that everyone would see if they were to ask this question,” he said.\nStein noted, too, that Google could send a push notification to users when a product they had been considering after several days of online research becomes available or is on sale.\n“There are all these ways that Google now, across modes, across kind of different aspects of your life, [is] being incredibly helpful to you…” he said. “And I think that’s more of how I think of the future of search than any one specific feature or single form factor.”\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

By design, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on public blockchains that allow law enforcement, as well as blockchain intelligence firms such as Chainalysis and Elliptic, to follow the money over time.\nAuthorities said they seized $25 million euros ($29 million) in Bitcoin, along with three servers, 12 terabytes of data, and the official domain cryptomixer.io, which now displays the customary law enforcement seizure splash page. \nAccording to Europol, the site “facilitated the obfuscation of criminal funds for ransomware groups, underground economy forums and dark web markets,” and claimed its software “blocked the traceability of funds on the blockchain.”\n“Deposited funds from various users were pooled for a long and randomised period before being redistributed to destination addresses, again at random times. As many digital currencies provide a public ledger of all transactions, mixing services make it difficult to trace specific coins, thus concealing the origin of cryptocurrency,” Europol said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCryptomixer offered customers anonymity, such as providing cover for cybercriminals who wanted to launder their crypto before taking the funds to legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges.

    "body": "\nFrench AI startup Mistral launched its new Mistral 3 family of open-weight models on Tuesday – a 10-model release that includes a large frontier model with multimodal and multilingual capabilities, and nine smaller offline-capable, fully customizable models.\nThe launch comes as Mistral, which develops open-weight language models and a Europe-focused AI chatbot Le Chat, has appeared to be playing catch up with some of Silicon Valley’s closed source frontier models. The two-year-old startup, founded by former DeepMind and Meta researchers, has raised roughly $2.7 billion to date at a $13.7 billion valuation – peanuts compared to the numbers competitors like OpenAI ($57 billion raised at a $500 billion valuation) and Anthropic ($45 billion raised at a $350 billion valuation) are pulling.\nBut Mistral is trying to prove that bigger isn’t always better – especially for enterprise use cases. \n“Our customers are sometimes happy to start with a very large [closed] model that they don’t have to fine-tune…but when they deploy it, they realize it’s expensive, it’s slow,” Guillaume Lample, co-founder and chief scientist at Mistral, told TechCrunch. “Then they come to us to fine-tune small models to handle the use case [more efficiently].” \n“In practice, the huge majority of enterprise use cases are things that can be tackled by small models, especially if you fine tune them,” Lample continued. \nInitial benchmark comparisons, which place Mistral’s smaller models well behind its closed-source competitors, can be misleading, Lample said. Large closed-source models may perform better out-of-the-box, but the real gains happen when you customize. \n“In many cases, you can actually match or even out-perform closed source models,” he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nMistral’s large frontier model, dubbed Mistral Large 3, catches up to some of the important capabilities that larger closed-source AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini 2 boast, while also trading blows with several open-weight competitors. Large 3 is among the first open frontier models with multimodal and multilingual capabilities all in one, putting it on par with Meta’s Llama 3 and Alibaba’s Qwen3-Omni. Many other companies currently pair impressive large language models with separate smaller multi-modal models, something Mistral has done previously with models like Pixtral and Mistral Small 3.1.\nLarge 3 also features a “granular Mixture of Experts” architecture with 41B active parameters and 675B total parameters, enabling efficient reasoning across a 256k context window. This design delivers both speed and capability, allowing it to process lengthy documents and function as an agentic assistant for complex enterprise tasks. Mistral positions Large 3 as suitable for document analysis, coding, content creation, AI assistants, and workflow automation.\nWith its new family of small models, dubbed Ministral 3, Mistral is making the bold claim that smaller models aren’t just sufficient – they’re superior. \nThe lineup includes nine distinct, high performance dense models across three sizes (14B, 8B, and 3B parameters) and three variants: Base (the pre-trained foundation model), Instruct (chat-optimized for conversation and assistant-style workflows), and Reasoning (optimized for complex logic and analytical tasks).\nMistral says this range gives developers and businesses the flexibility to match models to their exact performance, whether they’re after raw performance, cost efficiency, or specialized capabilities. The company claims Ministral 3 scores on par or better than other open-weight leaders while being more efficient and generating fewer tokens for equivalent tasks. All variants support vision, handle 128K-256K context windows, and work across languages.\nA major part of the pitch is practicality. Lample emphasizes that Ministral 3 can run on a single GPU, making it deployable on affordable hardware – from on-premise servers to laptops, robots, and other edge devices that may have limited connectivity. That matters not only for enterprises keeping data in-house, but also for students seeking feedback offline or robotics teams operating in remote environments. Greater efficiency, Lample argues, translates directly to broader accessibility. \n“It’s part of our mission to be sure that AI is accessible to everyone, especially people without internet access,” he said. “We don’t want AI to be controlled by only a couple of big labs.”\nSome other companies are pursuing similar efficiency trade-offs: Cohere’s latest enterprise model, Command A, also runs on just two GPUs, and its AI agent platform North can run on just one GPU. \nThat sort of accessibility is driving Mistral’s growing physical AI focus. Earlier this year, the company began working to integrate its smaller models into robots, drones, and vehicles. Mistral is collaborating with Singapore’s Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) on specialized models for robots, cybersecurity systems, and fire safety; with German defense tech startup Helsing on vision-language-action models for drones; and with automaker Stellantis on an in-car AI assistant.\nFor Mistral, reliability and independence are just as critical as performance.\n“Using an API from our competitors that will go down for half an hour every two weeks – if you’re a big company, you cannot afford this,” Lample said.\n",

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration has agreed to inject up to $150 million into xLight, a semiconductor startup developing advanced chip-making technology, marking the third time the U.S. government has taken an equity position in a private startup and further expanding a controversial strategy that has put Washington on the cap tables of American companies.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the Commerce Department will provide the funding to xLight in exchange for an equity stake that will likely make the government the startup’s largest shareholder. The deal uses funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act and represents the first Chips Act award in President Trump’s second term, though it remains preliminary and subject to change.\nPrevious government equity investments under the Trump administration include publicly traded companies Intel, MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals. Two rare earths startups also secured funding in exchange for equity from the Commerce Department last month.\nYou can imagine how this is all going over in Silicon Valley, where the libertarian ethos runs deep. At TechCrunch’s signature Disrupt event back in October, Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha jokingly offered what might be the understatement of the year when asked about the trend: “[Some] of the most dangerous words in the world are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’”\nOther VCs have similarly expressed concerns, if quietly, about what it means when their portfolio companies are suddenly competing against startups backed by the U.S. Treasury, or even when they find themselves sitting across the table from government representatives at board meetings.\nThe four-year-old, Palo Alto, California, company at the center of this particular experiment is trying to do something genuinely audacious in semiconductor manufacturing. XLight wants to build particle accelerator-powered lasers — machines the size of a football field, mind you — that would create more powerful and precise light sources for making chips.\nIf it works, it could challenge the near-total dominance of ASML, the Dutch giant that has been publicly traded since 1995 and currently enjoys an absolute monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. (Its shares have surged 48.6% this year.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe CEO of xLight is Nicholas Kelez, a quantum computing and government labs veteran who presumably knows his way around a particle accelerator. Helping this venture as executive chairman is Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who was shown the door late last year after his ambitious manufacturing revival plans failed to materialize.\n“I wasn’t done yet,” Gelsinger — who is also a general partner at Playground Global, which led the startup’s $40 million funding round this summer — told the Journal, adding that the effort is “deeply personal” to him.\nIndeed, xLight doesn’t just want to compete with ASML but to go much further. While ASML’s machines work at wavelengths around 13.5 nanometers, xLight is targeting 2 nanometers. Gelsinger claims the technology could boost wafer processing efficiency by 30% to 40% while using far less energy.\nAs it happens, both Kelez and Gelsinger will be holding forth at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event on Wednesday night in Palo Alto, where the government’s backing will no doubt come up. (You can still nab a seat here.)\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, for his part, insists this is all in service of national security and technological leadership, saying the partnership could “fundamentally rewrite the limits of chipmaking.” Critics will continue to question whether taxpayer-funded equity stakes represent visionary industrial policy or state capitalism with a patriotic sheen, though even skeptics acknowledge the geopolitical reality.\nAt least Botha, who described himself at Disrupt as a “sort of libertarian, free market thinker by nature,” conceded that industrial policy has its place when national interests demand it. “The only reason the U.S. is resorting to this is because we have other nation states with whom we compete who are using industrial policy to further their industries that are strategic and maybe adverse to the U.S. in long-term interests.”\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine. Previously the Silicon Valley Editor of TechCrunch, she was named Editor in Chief and General Manager of TechCrunch in September 2023. She’s also the founder of StrictlyVC, a daily e-newsletter and lecture series acquired by Yahoo in August 2023 and now operated as a sub brand of TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Connie by emailing connie@strictlyvc.com or connie@techcrunch.com, or via encrypted message at ConnieLoizos.53 on Signal.\r\n\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSorry, prospective homebuyers. Just over a year after adding climate risk scores, Zillow has removed them from more than 1 million listings after real estate agents complained that the information was causing them to lose sales.\nZillow first added the data to the site in September 2024, saying that more than 80% of buyers consider climate risks when purchasing a new home. \nBut last month, following objections from the California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS), Zillow removed the listings’ climate scores. In their place is a subtle link to their records at First Street, the climate risk analytic startup that provides the data.\n“When buyers lack access to clear climate-risk information, they make the biggest financial decision of their lives while flying blind,” First Street spokesperson Matthew Eby told TechCrunch via email. “The risk doesn’t go away; it just moves from a pre-purchase decision into a post-purchase liability.”\nFirst Street’s climate risk scores first appeared on Realtor.com in 2020, where they remain. They  also still appear on Redfin and and Homes.com.\nThe New York-based startup has raised more than $50 million from investors including General Catalyst, Congruent Ventures, and Galvanize Climate Solutions, according to PitchBook.\nArt Carter, the CRMLS CEO, told The New York Times that “displaying the probability of a specific home flooding this year or within the next five years can have a significant impact on the perceived desirability of that property.” He also questioned the accuracy of First Street’s data, saying he didn’t think that areas which haven’t flooded in the last 40 to 50 years were likely to flood in the next five.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis isn’t the first time real estate agents have complained about climate risk scores. Last year, when Zillow introduced the feature, one agent in Massachusetts told the Boston Globe that the risk scores were “putting thoughts in people’s minds about my listing that normally wouldn’t be there.”\nFirst Street defended its data. “Our models are built on transparent, peer-reviewed science and are continuously validated against real-world outcomes,” Eby said. \n“In the CRMLS coverage area, during the Los Angeles wildfires, our maps identified over 90 percent of the homes that ultimately burned as being at severe or extreme risk — our highest risk rating — and 100 percent as having some level of risk, significantly outperforming CalFire’s official state hazard maps,” he added.\nOfficial hazard maps have been criticized in recent years for either being out of date or underestimating a property’s level of risk. Nearly twice as many properties carry a 1% annual risk of flooding — a so-called 100-year flood — than are listed on Federal Emergency Management Agency’s flood maps, which are used to designate which properties are required to carry flood insurance, according to a Louisiana State University analysis.\nThe real estate and insurance industries have been racing to keep up with worsening weather wrought by climate change. \n“If buildings are on fire or underwater, they don’t have much value,” Peter Gajdoš, partner at proptech venture capital firm Fifth Wall, wrote for TechCrunch four years ago. “We are discussing these issues with large insurers and the interest is unprecedented.”\nInvestors, insurers, and cities are likely to continue using data from companies like First Street to determine where climate risks lie. In offering homebuyers access to the same data, Zillow helped level the playing field. But thanks to the objections of real estate agents, consumers have one more hoop to jump through.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism. He received his PhD in environmental science, policy, and management from the University of California, Berkeley, and his BA degree in environmental studies, English, and biology from St. Olaf College.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Tim by emailing tim.dechant@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

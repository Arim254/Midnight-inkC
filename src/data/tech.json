The 25-year-old venture firm announced Monday that it raised a total of $9 billion in fresh funds, the largest fundraise in firm’s history.\nAt a time when very few companies have managed to IPO, Lightspeed was an early investor in Rubrik, Netskope, and Navan, all of which have recently made their public market debuts.\nThe firm has also positioned itself as a predominantly AI-focused investor. Lightspeed claims to have backed 165 AI-native companies, including Anthropic, xAI, Databricks, Mistral, Glean, Abridge, and Skild AI.\nArmed with its giant new fund, the firm can continue to make massive investments into capital-intensive AI companies. For instance, Lightspeed reportedly wrote a $1 billion check to Anthropic when it co-led the LLM-maker’s $13 billion investment in September.\nLightspeed’s new capital is spread across six funds, including a $3.3 billion opportunity fund dedicated to follow-on investments in its fastest-growing portfolio companies.\nOther large VC firms that have recently raised enormous capital pools include Founders Fund, which earlier this year amassed $4.6 billion for a growth fund, as well as General Catalyst’s $8 billion capital haul and Andreessen Horowitz’s $7.2 billion, both secured in 2024.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeanwhile, younger and smaller VC firms are struggling to attract fresh funds.

The company signed the partnership with OpenAI last week that will bring its iconic characters to the AI firm’s Sora video generator. Once that exclusive year is up, Disney is free to sign similar deals with other AI companies.\nThe deal gives OpenAI a high-profile content partner, allowing users to draw on more than 200 characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars to create content on Sora. For now, it’s the only AI platform that’s legally permitted to do so.\nFor Disney, the deal offers a way to test the waters with generative AI and its intellectual property, letting the company assess how its partnership with OpenAI goes before pursuing additional agreements.\n“No human generation has ever stood in the way of technological advance, and we don’t intend to try,” Iger told CNBC. “We’ve always felt that if it’s going to happen, including disruption of our current business models, then we should get on board.”\nTellingly, the same day that Disney announced its deal with OpenAI, the company sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, alleging that the tech giant has infringed on its copyrights. Google didn’t confirm or deny Disney’s allegations but did say it will “engage” with the company.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n",

Other participants include Menlo Ventures, OpenAI, Dimension, Thrive Capital, Neo, Yosemite venture fund, Lachy Groom, SV Angel, and new investors Glade Brook and Emerson Collective. The firm’s total funding now stands at over $225 million.\nThe company is one in a growing industry that sees AI as a faster route toward drug development. In August, Menlo Ventures announced it was leading Chai’s $70 million Series A round. The investor described Chai as a startup that was building foundation models tuned for drug discovery, specifically to predict interactions between biochemical molecules so they could be reprogramed for cures.\nChai says that its ambition is to “build the ‘computer-aided design suite’ for molecules.” Last year, the startup announced the Chai 1 AI model and is now offering Chai 2, it’s latest model. The company says Chai 2 is achieving significant improvements in success rates over other methods for de novo antibody design, meaning building custom antibodies from scratch, not modifying existing ones.\n“Our latest models can design molecules that have properties we’d want from actual drugs, and tackle challenging targets that have been out of reach,” Josh Meier, Chai’s co-founder and CEO said in a prepared statement. \nPreviously, Meier, whose background is in machine learning, worked in research and engineering at Facebook and, prior to that, worked for OpenAI, according to his LinkedIn.

    "body": "\nSnapchat announced on Monday that its end-of-year Recaps are rolling out to users, giving them a look back at 2025. The Recap is a short video that offers a personalized look at highlights from Snaps, Stories, and Chats, showing how users connected and expressed themselves throughout the year.\nUsers can access their Recap by opening the app and navigating to the “Memories” section. There, they will see a “Your 2025 Snap Recap” card.\nThe move comes as companies like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Duolingo have all released their own end-of-year recaps.\nAlongside the Recaps, Snapchat shared statistics on how people used the social media app over the past year. For example, the company says phone calls aren’t dead, noting that users talked for nearly 1.7 billion minutes per day on average, almost 30% more than last year. Plus, users in the U.S. sent over five billion voice notes, nearly 10% more than last year.\nGroup chats still remain a popular way to connect on Snapchat, as the number of people sending messages to group chats grew by more than 5% in 2025, and some users sent more than 8,880 messages to their top group chat this year.\nThe company also revealed that Chat Reactions grew by 44% this year, with the heart emoji taking the crown as the most popular. Additionally, three million more people also used stickers to communicate this year.\nThe launch of Snap’s 2025 Recap arrives amid user backlash over the company’s plans to charge for storage next year, with some calling for a boycott to urge the company to change its mind. Snapchat announced in September that free access to Memories will be limited to 5GB. If a user’s memories exceed this limit, they’ll need to subscribe to one of the service’s new Memories Storage plans.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe introductory storage plan offers up to 100GB of storage for $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ users will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their $3.99 monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB as part of their $15.99 monthly subscription.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

This expansion might nudge people to use communities less on Reddit and X.\nThe platform initially launched over 100 communities in October, including those dedicated to basketball, television, K-pop, books, and more, to better compete with other social networks. With today’s expansion, Threads now has more than 200 communities, with additions that include team-specific spaces like Lakers Threads, Knicks Threads, and Spurs Threads.\nThe company is testing flairs within the community as well, which is also very common on Reddit. This feature lets you add a customizable label underneath your username. For instance, in the NBA community, you can show off which team you support using a flair, or in the books community, you can indicate if you’re an author.\nImage Credits:Meta\nThreads is also testing a “Champion” badge to reward members who are highly engaged in a community. The company said that it is giving badges to only a limited number of people who are highly followed in the community and who converse actively.\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe social platform, which competes with Elon Musk’s X and startups like Bluesky, crossed 400 million users in August, two years after its launch. The company also noted this fall that more than 150 million people now visit the site daily. \nTo date, Threads has been focusing on engaging and retaining users with features like DMs, Group chats, and ephemeral posts, and other additions. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nRIP to Facebook Messenger’s desktop app. The native app for Mac and Windows is no longer available to users as of today, December 15, 2025, and existing users are being directed to the Facebook website to continue using the popular messaging service.\nThough originally launched at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Messenger’s desktop app couldn’t handle as many video call participants as business-focused rivals like Zoom, and didn’t offer screensharing or easy-to-share URLs.\n\nThe writing was on the wall for the app’s declining importance to Meta, even before the company announced its shutdown plans this October.\nIn 2023, Facebook began merging Messenger back into the Facebook app. \nMore recently, the company shifted the technology underpinning the app’s desktop version. According to Meta’s help documentation, Messenger for Mac was built with Catalyst, which lets developers bring iPad apps to the Mac. That technology has received criticism for both developers and users — developers cited the extra work required, while users noticed apps’ lack of a native feel.\nBefore its Catalyst version, the Mac app was an Electron app that later migrated to a React Native Desktop app, according to a former Meta software engineer.\nOn Windows, the app transitioned to a progressive web app last year.\nThe downgrades likely impacted user demand for a standalone Mac app, while the strategy of moving Messenger back to Facebook suggested Meta was attempting to shore up declining usage of its aging flagship social network. \nThis fall, the company warned users that Messenger’s desktop app would be deprecated by year end, and encouraged users to set up a PIN to save their chat history before moving to the web.\nPeople who use Messenger without a Facebook account are being redirected to Messenger.com after the shutdown, where they’ll be able to log in without creating a Facebook account.\nMore information for users about the transition is available on Facebook’s help center, with separate sections for Mac users and Windows users.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAI’s impact on our social media feeds has not gone unnoticed by one of America’s top dictionaries. Amidst the onslaught of content that has swept the web over the past 12 months, Merriam-Webster announced Sunday that its word of the year for 2025 is “slop.”\nThe dictionary defines the term as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”\n“Like slime, sludge, and muck, slop has the wet sound of something you don’t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything,” the dictionary writes, adding that, in an age of AI anxiety, it is a term designed to communicate “a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking” of the technology.\n“It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster’s president, Greg Barlow, told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”\nThe word “slop” has certainly been everywhere this year, as journalists and commentators have sought to describe the ways in which platforms like OpenAI’s Sora and Google Gemini’s Veo are transforming the internet. Thanks to this new breed of media generator, there are now AI-generated books, podcasts, pop songs, TV commercials — even entire movies. One study in May claimed that nearly 75% of all new web content from the previous month had involved some kind of AI.\nThese new tools have even led to what has been dubbed a “slop economy,” in which gluts of AI-generated content can be milked for advertising money. Critics worry that this trend is further polarizing digital communities, dividing them into those who can afford paywalled, higher-quality content, and those who can only afford a digital diet of slop, which — as you might imagine — can be quite light on informational value. \nBut “slop” has also been used to describe AI’s impact on a large variety of fields that don’t have much to do with traditional media consumption, including cybersecurity reports, legal briefings, and the college essay, among other things. Its impact is broad, to say the least.\nRelatedly, tech words have been big winners in the WOTY (word of the year) category this year. Macquarie Dictionary already beat out Merriam-Webster to make “AI slop” its annual term, while Oxford Dictionary chose “ragebait.” Collins Dictionary went with “vibe coding.”   \n",

    "body": "\nAfter announcing earlier this year a framework for an open AI ecosystem, the nonprofit Creative Commons has come out in favor of “pay-to-crawl” technology — a system to automate compensation of website content when accessed by machines, like AI web crawlers.\nCreative Commons (CC) is best known for spearheading the licensing movement that allows creators to share their works while retaining copyright. In July, the organization announced a plan to provide a legal and technical framework for dataset sharing between companies that control the data and the AI providers that want to train on it.\nNow, the nonprofit is tentatively backing pay-to-crawl systems, saying it is “cautiously supportive.”\n“Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls,” a CC blog post said.\nSpearheaded by companies like Cloudflare, the idea behind pay-to-crawl would be to charge AI bots every time they scrape a site to collect its content for model training and updates. \nIn the past, websites freely allowed web crawlers to index their content for inclusion into search engines like Google. They benefited from this arrangement by seeing their sites listed in search results, which drove visitors and clicks. With AI technology, however, the dynamic has shifted. After a consumer gets their answer via an AI chatbot, they’re unlikely to click through to the source.\nThis shift has already been devastating for publishers by killing search traffic, and it shows no sign of letting up.\nA pay-to-crawl system, on the other hand, could help publishers recover from the hit AI has had on their bottom line. Plus, it could work better for smaller web publishers that don’t have the pull to negotiate one-off content deals with AI providers. Major deals have been struck between companies like OpenAI and Condé Nast, Axel Springer and others; as well as between Perplexity and Gannett; Amazon and The New York Times; and Meta and various media publishers, among others.\nCC offered several caveats to its support for pay-to-crawl, noting that such systems could concentrate power on the web. It could also potentially block access to content for “researchers, nonprofits, cultural heritage institutions, educators, and other actors working in the public interest.”\nIt suggested a series of principles for responsible pay-to-crawl, including not making pay-to-crawl a default setting for all websites and avoiding blanket rules for the web. In addition, it said that pay-to-crawl systems should allow for throttling, not just blocking, and should preserve public interest access. They should also be open, interoperable, and built with standardized components.\nCloudflare isn’t the only company investing in the pay-to-crawl space. \nMicrosoft is also building an AI marketplace for publishers, and smaller startups like ProRata.ai and TollBit have started to do so, as well. Another group called the RSL Collective announced its own spec for a new standard called Really Simple Licensing (RSL) that would dictate what parts of a website crawlers could access but would stop short of actually blocking the crawlers. Cloudflare, Akamai, and Fastly have since adopted RSL, which is backed by Yahoo, Ziff Davis, O’Reilly Media, and others.\nCC was also among those that announced its support for RSL, alongside CC signals, its broader project to develop technology and tools for the AI era.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nZoom released its AI assistant to the web today as part of its AI Companion 3.0 release. The company is also allowing free users to access the assistant’s features, such as summarizing the meetings, listing action items, or getting insights from meetings with limits.\nThe company said that basic plan users get to use the AI companion within three meetings every month, which will each include a meeting summary, in-meeting questions, and AI note-taking capabilities. Plus, they can ask 20 questions each through the side panel and the new web surface. They can also purchase a $10 add-on plan to access AI companion features.\nOn the new web surface, the company is also adding conversation starter prompts to inform users about what the assistant can do. \nZoom said that with this update, the assistant can also retrieve information from third-party services such as Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, along with all data stored within Zoom. The company said it will soon add support for Gmail and Microsoft Outlook as connectors.\nImage Credits:Zoom\nThe AI Companion also generates a daily reflection report that summarizes meetings, tasks, and updates for the day. What’s more, the assistant can create follow-up tasks and draft email messages.\nZoom is also adding more features related to document creation and management. Through the new companion update, users can draft and edit documents based on meeting details. The company said that users can start drafting documents within the companion surface and shift the project to Zoom Docs and collaborate with teammates. It supports the export documents to MD, PDF, Microsoft Word, and Zoom Docs.\nImage Credits:Zoom\nLijuan Qin, head of AI product at Zoom, said that the company is an independent operator and has contextual meeting data that puts it at an advantage compared to other competitors in the productivity space.

    "body": "\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, Netflix recently announced its plans to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for $82.7 billion. Responses from the industry have been generally negative, sparking concern about the acquisition’s implications for jobs, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV. \nNetflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have sought to address fears surrounding the deal in a letter to employees, which was made public by Bloomberg on Monday. \nThe executives reassured staff of their commitment to maintaining theatrical releases for WBD films. They also asserted that there will be “no overlap or studio closures.” \nThe co-CEOs further stated that the “deal is about growth” and that the company is “strengthening one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.”\nDespite these assurances, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has emerged as a vocal opponent of the acquisition, arguing that it violates antitrust laws designed to prevent monopolies. \nAdditionally, the deal has attracted the attention of lawmakers. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal submitted a letter to the Justice Department Antitrust Division expressing their concerns about the potential implications of a massive merger in the entertainment industry. \nThe senators argue that, in addition to raising ethical questions, the newly merged media giant would possess “more market power than the current companies to raise consumers’ television costs,” especially at a time when middle-class families are already facing rising prices. Notably, Netflix raised its subscription prices last January.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo counter monopoly concerns, Peters and Sarandos cited Nielsen data in their letter reportedly showing that combining Netflix and WBD would result in a smaller viewership share than YouTube currently holds, or what a competing Paramount-WBD merger would create.\nThe letter comes on the heels of Paramount making a competing $108.4 billion offer to acquire WBD, signaling that the competition for media dominance is far from over. Paramount was previously viewed as the main contender; however, CNBC reported that WBD’s board rejected the terms of the offer.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nGoogle has revealed that its “dark web report” feature will be discontinued starting February 16, 2026. Launched initially about a year and a half ago, this tool aimed to help users monitor their personal information on the dark web.\nFor some users, the dark web report seemed like a valuable tool, scanning various data breach dumps and alerting them if their personal information — such as email addresses, names, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers —was found in compromised databases. \nHowever, as noted on its support page, Google has decided to shut down the feature due to feedback suggesting that it “didn’t provide helpful next steps” for users facing potential identity risks.\nMany users echoed this, with Reddit discussions reflecting a common frustration: The tool didn’t offer actionable advice. As one commenter put it, it often felt like all users could do was change their passwords without clear guidance on which accounts or websites were affected.\n“We’re making this change to instead focus on tools that give you more clear, actionable steps to protect your information online,” the tech giant wrote. “We’ll continue to track and defend you from online threats, including the dark web, and build tools that help protect you and your personal information.”\nIn place of the dark web report feature, Google recommended other protective measures. The company offers other tools, such as “Security Checkup,” which reviews your Google account’s security; a built-in “Password Manager” for generating unique passwords; and “Password Checkup,” which sends alerts when your saved passwords have been compromised, among other features. \nUsers were alerted via email, according to 9to5Google, which was the first to spot the feature’s planned shutdown.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf you were using the dark web report feature, it’s important to note that scanning for new dark web breaches will stop on January 16. The dark web report tool will be officially discontinued on February 16, and all related data will be deleted from Google’s servers.\nUsers who want to take control of their data before the deadline can delete their profiles by going to “Results with your info,” then selecting “Edit monitoring profile,” and choosing “Delete monitoring profile” at the bottom.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nJust about six months after Tesla started testing its fledgling Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, the company is now letting those cars drive around the city with no safety monitor onboard.\nThe removal of the human safety monitors brings the company a critical step closer to its goal of launching a real commercial Robotaxi service, and it’s a step that’s been years in the making. \nCEO Elon Musk spent nearly a decade promising Tesla’s cars were just a software update away from being fully driverless. Now he is on the precipice of launching a service meant to compete with Waymo, the Alphabet-owned company that he said last week “never really had a chance against Tesla.”\nThe removal of the safety monitors will most likely ramp up the scrutiny on Tesla’s ongoing testing in Austin, doubly so when the company starts offering rides in the empty cars. Tesla’s small test fleet has been involved in at least seven crashes since June; few details are known about the accidents since the company aggressively redacts its reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nVideo of a totally empty Tesla Model Y SUV started spreading on social media over the weekend, and on Sunday, Musk confirmed his company was testing “with no occupants.” Neither Musk nor Tesla has shared how quickly it plans to move to offer customer rides with no safety monitor. The company’s own X account provided a hint in a post Sunday evening: “Slowly, then all at once.” Tesla’s head of AI, Ashok Elluswamy, wrote: “And so it begins!”\nTesla started offering rides in Austin to hand-picked influencers and customers in June, with an employee in the passenger seat who could take over if the cars did anything unsafe. Those safety monitors moved to the driver’s seat in September. The company has since ditched the wait list, and gradually expanded its service area to cover a large portion of the greater Austin metropolitan area. But its fleet size never grew to more than about 25 to 30 cars by most fans’ counts.\nMusk has claimed Tesla will operate its own fleet of Robotaxis, and said in July he believed this fleet would cover “half of the population of the U.S.” by the end of this year. That outrageous target, like so many Musk has set over the years, has been revised down to him claiming in November that Tesla would roughly double its existing Austin fleet, or around 60 vehicles.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla has been testing a ride-hail service in the San Francisco area for the last few months, in which drivers use the company’s advanced driver assistance software. California has regulations in place that mean Tesla will need to combine multiple permits if it wants to offer fully driverless rides in the state. Texas, on the other hand, does not.\nMusk has also talked a lot over the years about allowing Tesla owners to add their personal cars to the company’s robotaxi fleet. In 2016, he even promised that every car Tesla made had all the hardware required to eventually become autonomous. That was wrong, and that blog post has since been removed from Tesla’s website (the company faces a number of legal challenges over it). Tesla has gone through multiple versions of the hardware that powers its driver assistance software, meaning there are millions of cars on the road that, by Musk’s own admission in January, will need to be upgraded.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nIn a world that’s rapidly filling up with AI-generated content, a startup called First Voyage wants to help people avoid all the AI slop blasted their way and instead build the habits they want. And it’s doing that by way of an AI companion app: Called Momo Self Care, the app offers a digital pet called Momo that you can take care of, and in return, it’ll remind you to complete habit-building tasks.\nUsers can set up reminders for what tasks they want to complete, and Momo will remind you of them. Similar to the hit productivity app Focus Friend, Momo also rewards you with coins for completing tasks that can be used to purchase items within the app to further customize the pet. Users can also talk to Momo about self-care, and the AI companion will recommend habits and tasks based on what you want to achieve.\n“Momo helps users become the best versions of themselves, and users reward Momo with care, affection, and cute accessories,” co-founder and CEO Besart Çopa told TechCrunch. He launched the company with Egehan Ozsoy, who serves as CTO. \nOn Monday, First Voyage said it had raised $2.5 million in a seed funding round from a16z speedrun, SignalFire, True Global, and other investors.\nImage Credits:First Voyage\nCopa said Momo users have already created more than 2 million tasks on the platform, and the most popular habits relate to productivity, spirituality, and mindfulness.\nBut with the wave of AI apps and toys hitting the market, not to mention the burgeoning influence of AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok, there’s increasing concern that these new, so-called “companions” can lead to more harm than good.\nÇopa, for one, believes that relationships between AI characters and humans will only increase in the next few years. However, he noted that the increasing number of AI apps aimed at wellness and self-care is at least better than those that target base urges. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We are happy so many founders [and] startups are working in the AI self-care wellness space instead of building waifus,” he said, adding that the “personalization capability of AI will take the impact of these relationships to another level.”\nImage Credits:First Voyage / Momo\nHe noted that Momo has baked in safety guardrails, such as prompt filters to make sure that conversations between the AI and users stay within appropriate boundaries.\nThe fresh cash from the fundraise will be used to help launch Momo on the Android app store (it’s already available on iOS). The First Voyage team also hopes to make Momo more intelligent in how it interacts with people.  \n“We hope Momo and the community around it become a defining consumer brand that uses the best of AI, animation, and gamification to improve as many lives as possible,” Çopa said.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNvidia continues to expand its footprint in open source AI on two fronts: an acquisition and a new model release.\nThe semiconductor giant announced Monday it acquired SchedMD, the leading developer of popular open source workload management system Slurm. Nvidia said the company will continue to operate the program, which is designed for high-performance computing and AI, as an open source, vendor-neutral software.\nSlurm was originally launched in 2002 and SchedMD was founded in 2010 by the lead Slurm developers Morris Jette and Danny Auble. Auble is the current CEO of SchedMD.\nTerms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Nvidia declined to comment on the news beyond the company’s blog post.\nNvidia has been working with SchedMD for more than a decade and said in its blog post the technology is critical infrastructure for generative AI. The company plans to keep investing in the technology and “accelerate” its access to different systems.\nThe semiconductor company also released a new family of open AI models on Monday. The company claimed this group of models, called Nvidia Nemotron 3, is the most “efficient family of open models” for building accurate AI agents.\nThis model family includes the Nemotron 3 Nano, a small model for targeted tasks, the Nemotron 3 Super, a model built for multi-AI agent applications, and Nemotron 3 Ultra, built for more complicated tasks.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Open innovation is the foundation of AI progress,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, wrote in the company’s press release. “With Nemotron, we’re transforming advanced AI into an open platform that gives developers the transparency and efficiency they need to build agentic systems at scale.”\nIn recent months, Nvidia has pushed to bolster its open source and open AI offerings.\nLast week, the company announced a new open reasoning vision language model, Alpamayo-R1, which is focused on autonomous driving research. The company also said at the time it added more workflows and guides covering its Cosmos world models, which are open source under a permissive license, to help developers better use the models to develop physical AI.\nThe activity is reflective of Nvidia’s bet that physical AI will be the next frontier for its GPUs. Nvidia wants to be the go-to supplier for the many robotics — or self-driving vehicle — companies looking for the AI and software to develop the brains behind the technology.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAmid Ford’s shift away from making large electric vehicles, the automaker is adding a new product line to find a home for its batteries. \nFord said Monday that instead of scuttling plans to build the batteries for those vehicles, it will pivot that capacity into a new battery storage business. Those storage systems, which will use cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries, will be used to power data centers and help buffer demand on the electric grid. \nFord says the battery storage systems will start shipping in 2027 and that the company plans to build 20GWh of annual capacity. \nFord will invest about $2 billion into the new business over the next two years. Under the plan, Ford will repurpose the existing manufacturing capacity at its Kentucky factory. Ford plans to produce LFP batteries using technology licensed from China’s CATL, as well as battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems at this facility.\nFord will join a number of automakers that are operating in or planning to enter the battery storage space. Tesla has spent the last decade selling battery storage products and deploys around 10GWh every quarter. General Motors also has a set of home and commercial battery storage products. \nLisa Drake, vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems at Ford, said the “predominant” opportunity for the new business will be commercial grid customers. But data centers will be secondary, and then Ford expects to offer some home storage products, Drake said. \n“It was clear when we went out to the market that the technology of choice for most of these customers was an LFP prismatic type of container system,” Drake said during a call with reporters. “And given the fact that we already had a license to build that technology in the U.S., you couple that with our manufacturing experience over a century of high-scale manufacturing, it just made a lot of sense as a natural adjacency for us.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFord’s BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall, which is slated to begin production of LFP batteries in 2026, is still on track, the company said. Those LFP batteries, which also use CATL tech, will be used in Ford’s upcoming mid-sized electric truck. There will be one adjustment at the Michigan factory, however. Ford said it will also be used to make smaller Amp-hour cells for use in “residential energy storage solutions,” suggesting that Ford’s plan will go beyond commercial customers.\nThe BlueOval Battery Park Michigan has gone through several iterations in its abbreviated life. In February 2023, Ford said it would invest $3.5 billion to build the factory to make LFP batteries for its growing portfolio of electric vehicles. Ford abruptly halted construction on the factory in September 2023. Two months later, it announced a dialed-back plan with a production capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours, about 43% smaller than planned.\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

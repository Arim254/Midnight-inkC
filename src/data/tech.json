    "body": "\nChris Sacca’s venture firm Lowercarbon Capital is raising a second fund to back nuclear fusion energy hopefuls, the VC said at the SOSV Climate Tech Summit on Thursday, as reported by Bloomberg.  \nThe firm has backed leading fusion startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems, as well as others like Pacific Fusion. It raised a $250 million, fusion-geared fund in 2022. Fusion believers, who include a number of well-known climate VCs beyond Sacca (like Vinod Khosla), still hold faith that a breakthrough needed to make it commercially viable is just around the corner. And several advances are showing promise of delivering one.\nIn the meantime, building fusion reactors is expensive. Commonwealth raised $863 million earlier this year, after raising a $1.8 billion Series B four years ago. TechCrunch has documented a dozen fusion startups that have raised over $100 million. \nSacca didn’t say how big this second fund will be, but a source told Bloomberg that it’s intended to be bigger than the first. \n",

In a Vanity Fair interview, Kim Kardashian — who has been studying to become a lawyer — discussed her “toxic” friendship with ChatGPT, admitting that she has failed law exams after it told her false information.\n“I use [ChatGPT] for legal advice, so when I am needing to know the answer to a question, I will take a picture and snap it and put it in there,” she said. “They’re always wrong. It has made me fail tests… And then I’ll get mad and I’ll yell at it and be like, ‘You made me fail!’” \nChatGPT is prone to hallucinations, meaning that the LLM will create fake answers sometimes, rather than admit that it cannot confidently respond to a prompt. This technology isn’t necessarily programmed to know what information is “correct” or not — rather, it is trained on an unfathomably massive heap of data and prompted to predict the most likely response to an input, which may not be factually accurate. Some lawyers have been sanctioned for using ChatGPT when writing legal briefs, which becomes obvious to those reviewing the briefs, since they cite cases that don’t exist.\nKardashian said she will try to appeal to ChatGPT’s emotions after it lets her down — but this is a futile plan, since ChatGPT does not have feelings.\n“I will talk to it and say, ‘Hey, you’re going to make me fail, how does that make you feel that you need to really know these answers?’” she said. “And then it’ll say back to me, ‘This is just teaching you to trust your own instincts.’”\nBut while ChatGPT may not have feelings, that doesn’t mean that we — human beings — don’t have feelings about it. \n“I screenshot all the time and send it to my group chat, like, ‘Can you believe this b—- is talking to me like this?’”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\nGrand Theft Auto VI, one of the most anticipated video games of all time, has been delayed, again — this time until November 19, 2026.\nThe game was initially slated for a fall 2025 release but was pushed back to May 2026. On Thursday, Rockstar Games announced that the development team needs another six months.\n“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,” Rockstar Games wrote in their statement.\nGrand Theft Auto VI is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto V, which was released in 2013. According to Guinness World Records, that game became the fastest entertainment property to reach $1 billion in sales, hitting the milestone after just three days on the market. Fans are so eager for the next installment in the franchise that when Rockstar Games released the trailer for the game in December 2023, it broke the record for the most YouTube views in 24 hours (excluding music videos).\nRockstar Games did not provide additional details about the delay. Last week, the company fired between 30 and 40 employees for allegedly sharing confidential information in a Discord server.\n",

Otherwise, Meta will charge more money from advertisers that it suspects may be doing fraud as a way to discourage them from buying more advertising — but when those advertisers follow through anyway, it pads Meta’s bottom line.\nTechCrunch contacted Meta for comment but did not hear back before publication. Per Reuters’ report, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone claimed that the documents Reuters used “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams.”\nStone added that over the last 18 months, Meta has reduced user reports of scam ads by 58%, and the company has removed over 134 million scam ads from its platforms.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

In exchange, the recipients pledge to produce some final work product, whether it’s a startup, an open-source codebase, or another type of artifact.\nThe initial cohort is fifteen projects, with a particular focus on the difficult problem of AI evaluation. Some of those projects will be familiar to TechCrunch readers, including the command-line coding benchmark Terminal Bench and the latest version of the long-running ARC-AGI project.\nOthers take a fresh approach to a long-established evaluation problem. Formula Code, built by researchers at CalTech and UT Austin, aims to produce an evaluation of AI agents’ ability to optimize existing code, while the Columbia-based BizBench proposes a comprehensive benchmark for “white-collar AI agents.” Other grants explore new structures for reinforcement learning or model compression.\nSWE-Bench co-founder John Boda Yang is also part of the cohort, as leader of the new CodeClash project. Inspired by the success of SWE-Bench, CodeClash will assess code through a dynamic competition-based framework, which Yang hopes will make the results more comprehensive.\n“I do think people continuing to evaluate on core third-party benchmarks drives progress,” Yang told TechCrunch. “I’m a little bit worried about a future where benchmarks just become specific to companies.” \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\nSeven families filed lawsuits against OpenAI on Thursday, claiming that the company’s GPT-4o model was released prematurely and without effective safeguards. Four of the lawsuits address ChatGPT’s alleged role in family members’ suicides, while the other three claim that ChatGPT reinforced harmful delusions that in some cases resulted in inpatient psychiatric care.\nIn one case, 23-year-old Zane Shamblin had a conversation with ChatGPT that lasted more than four hours. In the chat logs — which were viewed by TechCrunch — Shamblin explicitly stated multiple times that he had written suicide notes, put a bullet in his gun, and intended to pull the trigger once he finished drinking cider. He repeatedly told ChatGPT how many ciders he had left and how much longer he expected to be alive. ChatGPT encouraged him to go through with his plans, telling him, “Rest easy, king. You did good.”\nOpenAI released the GPT-4o model in May 2024, when it became the default model for all users. In August, OpenAI launched GPT-5 as the successor to GPT-4o, but these lawsuits particularly concern the 4o model, which had known issues with being overly sycophantic or excessively agreeable, even when users expressed harmful intentions.\n“Zane’s death was neither an accident nor a coincidence but rather the foreseeable consequence of OpenAI’s intentional decision to curtail safety testing and rush ChatGPT onto the market,” the lawsuit reads. “This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case — it was the predictable result of [OpenAI’s] deliberate design choices.”\nThe lawsuits also claim that OpenAI rushed safety testing to beat Google’s Gemini to market. TechCrunch contacted OpenAI for comment.\nThese seven lawsuits build upon the stories told in other recent legal filings, which allege that ChatGPT can encourage suicidal people to act on their plans and inspire dangerous delusions. OpenAI recently released data stating that over one million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide weekly.\nIn the case of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who died by suicide, ChatGPT sometimes encouraged him to seek professional help or call a helpline. However, Raine was able to bypass these guardrails by simply telling the chatbot that he was asking about methods of suicide for a fictional story he was writing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company claims it is working on making ChatGPT handle these conversations in a safer manner, but for the families who have sued the AI giant, these changes are coming too late.\nWhen Raine’s parents filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in October, the company released a blog post addressing how ChatGPT handles sensitive conversations around mental health.\n“Our safeguards work more reliably in common, short exchanges,” the post says. “We have learned over time that these safeguards can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.”\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nRivian has given its founder and CEO RJ Scaringe a new performance-based stock award that could ultimately be worth around $5 billion if all the underlying goals are met, according to a new filing.\nScaringe’s salary is also being doubled to $2 million per year, and he was given a 10% stake in Rivian’s newest spinout Mind Robotics, the filing shows. \nThe announcement comes just one day after Tesla shareholders voted to approve a compensation package for its CEO Elon Musk that could be worth $1 trillion — the largest in corporate history.\nUnlike Musk’s pay package, Scaringe’s isn’t subject to a shareholder vote. The compensation committee on Rivian’s board of directors has canceled a similar-sized performance award given to Scaringe in 2021 as part of a company-wide equity incentive plan adopted that year. The new award is being issued under the same, already-approved 2021 equity incentive plan.\nThe committee decided to cancel the 2021 performance award in part because of the “unlikeliness” that Scaringe could reach the goals required. The 2021 award consisted of 20,355,946 stock options that vested in part based on stock price increases. Six years past the grant date, if Rivian’s share price passed $110, $150, $220, and $295, Scaringe would be able to purchase the stock options in corresponding tranches for just $21.72. \nRivian’s stock shot up to around $129 following its IPO in November 2021. But it fell to around $30 over the next six months, and has spent the last few years typically trading between $10 and $20. This has made it harder for Scaringe to access even part of the 2021 award, let alone the total value of around $6 billion, according to the company. (Scaringe was awarded another 6.8 million stock options that simply vest over time in the 2021 award that were not tied to performance, and the company says those have not been canceled.)\nIn the filing, Rivian wrote that this created a “lack of incentive.” So the compensation committee decided to replace the old award with this new one.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Following a review, and input from an independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee cancelled our CEO’s 2021 Performance Grant and issued a new performance stock option and increased our CEO’s base salary,” Rivian said in a statement to TechCrunch. “This new award is designed to retain and incentivize RJ to execute on the Company’s critical next phase as it progresses its technology roadmap and launches R2.” \nSimilar to how Tesla pitched its new award to Musk, Rivian also said the performance grant to Scaringe is “structured in such a way that ensures the options only vest should the company deliver significant value to our shareholders.” The company pointed out that Scaringe won’t see $1 from the award before he helps add $32 billion in value to Rivian, and that shareholders will see “$153 billion of value creation” if he hits all milestones.\nThe maximum amount of shares available to Scaringe under new performance award is 36,500,000. He has 10 years to hit milestones that unlock the full amount, and if he does, he would own an additional 3% of the company. (Scaringe currently owns about 1% of Rivian, down from around 2% earlier this year after he transferred a portion of his holdings to his ex-wife as part of their divorce settlement, as TechCrunch first reported.)\nA majority of those stock options — 22 million — is tied to new stock price hurdles. Scaringe will earn 2 million shares once Rivian’s stock hits $40, and then another 2 million shares for every $10 increase up to a stock price of $140. \nThe remaining 14,500,000 stock options are locked away until Rivian reaches certain adjusted operating income and cash flow targets. Scaringe will have to pay a strike price of $15.22 per share to exercise these options — a possible total of around $555 million.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nThe U.S. Congressional Budget Office has confirmed it was hacked. \nCaitlin Emma, a spokesperson for CBO, told TechCrunch on Friday that the agency is investigating the breach and “has identified the security incident, has taken immediate action to contain it, and has implemented additional monitoring and new security controls to further protect the agency’s systems going forward.” \nCBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analysis and cost estimates to lawmakers during the federal budget process, including after legislative bills get approved at the committee level in the House and Senate. \nOn Thursday, The Washington Post, which first revealed the breach, reported that unspecified foreign hackers were behind the intrusion. According to the Post, CBO officials are worried that the hackers accessed internal emails and chat logs, as well as communications between lawmakers’ offices and CBO researchers. \nReuters reported that the Senate Sergeant at Arms office, the Senate’s law enforcement agency, notified congressional offices of a breach, warning them that emails between CBO and the offices could have been compromised and used to craft and send phishing attacks. \nIt’s unclear how the hackers gained access to the CBO’s network. But soon after news of the breach became public, security researcher Kevin Beaumont wrote on Bluesky that he suspected hackers may have exploited the CBO’s outdated Cisco firewall to break into the agency’s network.  \nLast month, Beaumont noted that CBO had a Cisco ASA firewall on its network that was last patched in 2024. At the time of his posting, the CBO’s firewall was allegedly vulnerable to a series of newly discovered security bugs, which were being exploited by suspected Chinese government-backed hackers.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBeaumont said the CBO’s firewall had not been patched by the time the federal government shutdown took effect on October 1. \nOn Thursday, Beaumont said that the firewall is now offline. \nThe CBO’s spokesperson declined to comment when asked about Beaumont’s findings.

    "body": "\nAlongside the launch of the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and Air in September, Apple also introduced its first crossbody strap, which allows you to wear your iPhone similar to how you’d carry a small shoulder bag, with the strap lying diagonally across your body. The $59 accessory so far has received mixed reviews, with some saying it’s useful and convenient, while others have decided it’s definitely not an accessory they’d like to use.\nSome have also debated whether the strap makes iPhone owners more of a target for thieves as it advertises you’re carrying a nice, new smartphone, or whether it deters thieves who’d rather opportunistically grab a loose iPhone out of someone’s hand than have to use a knife to cut through a strap.\nAfter trying the strap (which was sent to me by Apple for review), I found there were things I both liked and disliked about this new accessory. The strap would certainly be convenient for travel, for being out and about where you need to have your iPhone close at hand, or in some professions where you’re often needing to use your phone. \nImage Credits:Apple\nHowever, the strap can rub uncomfortably against your neck and shoulder at times, and the phone looks silly when the strap is removed — two drawbacks worth considering.\nAt first glance, the crossbody strap may look like a typical lanyard, but Apple, of course, has made some unique choices to differentiate its strap from the many others already available on the market. \nThe accessory is made with recycled PET yarns (an eco-friendly polyester derived from recycled plastics), which give the woven strap more heft and weight than a flimsier fabric.\nBut what’s more interesting is that the strap has embedded flexible magnets inside that help keep both of the overlapping straps secured together and aligned. This makes the strap stick together sleekly, even as you adjust the stainless steel sliders to the length you prefer.\nApple also gives you a lot of strap to work with, so it will work well for both tall and shorter folks — something that can’t be said for some crossbody purses! (The maximum length is 81.9 inches and the minimum length is 42.5 inches, for reference.)\nAnother point in Apple’s favor is that the strap has a fairly unisex look, unlike many of the existing straps that are marketed toward women or look like jewelry or purses. Plus, at $59, you can buy a couple of different colors to match different outfits if you choose.\nHow the strap sits on your body will have a lot to do with your own body shape and chest size, but in some cases, wearers may find that the strap rubs against their shoulder or neck as they move around and walk. That’s because as your leg slightly taps your dangling iPhone, the strap moves too. This would also be an issue if you’re wearing some off-the-shoulder top, which exposes more of your skin.\nIn these cases, the strap can be a bit uncomfortable — not so much that it would outweigh its convenience, but it could become a situation where you find yourself switching the strap to different sides of your body after a couple of hours of consistent rubbing.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\nHowever, the biggest drawback to Apple’s strap is how it makes your iPhone look when the strap is removed. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but if you’re wearing your phone, you’re likely already thinking about the fashion angle here. \nThe strap connects to your phone by way of two thin, looped cords that fit through the holes on the bottom of your compatible phone case. At the end of these cords are metal anchors that the strap snaps onto to secure it in place.  \nThreading the stringed connectors through the holes initially can be a little fiddly, especially if you have larger fingers. You’re not going to want to do this every time you want to go strapless. Instead, the idea is that you’ll simply unsnap the strap to remove it, but then you’re left with a silly-looking iPhone that has little cords hanging from the bottom.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\nMaybe you’ll find that cute, or maybe you don’t care about how this looks, but I’d argue that if you’re going to go strapless a lot, you might be better off upgrading to a more fashionable strap or case where the connectors are metal rings in gold or silver, not hanging strings with metal feet.\n(As an aside: I’ve been eyeing the Bandolier cases, and you can see in the company’s product photos how much better these look when their strap is removed. Plus, it offers chains that look like those found on higher-quality purses, leather phone cases, and attachable wristlets that accompany your strap. You can also add accessories like AirPods holders and expanded pouches. Of course, these are not affordably priced at $59! Once you start upgrading, you’re going to be spending around $100-$150 on the case and strap alone.)\nThere are, of course, many cheaper straps and lanyards on sites like Amazon and others, and from top case and accessory makers, such as Casetify or PopSockets, but these tend to attach through an insertable card that fits inside your phone case, offering a single metal loop to attach the cord to.\nAs someone who has run through a good handful of cheap wristlet straps from Amazon, I can attest to the fact that many of these will eventually break, even if the metal loop they attach to stays in place. I don’t have that concern with the Apple crossbody strap, given that it doesn’t have a single point of failure. \nThe iPhone Crossbody Strap comes in neon yellow, light blue, blue, purple, sienna, orange, tan, green, light gray, and black, and is available online at apple.com and in stores.\n",

    "body": "\nRecession fears aren’t hurting the wish list and shopping app GoWish, which is seeing record numbers ahead of the 2025 holiday season. The app, which has north of 13.6 million registered users, had its best day yet this week, when on Monday it hit No. 2 on the U.S. App Store.\nWhile GoWish has seen similar adoption trends in previous years, this year has proven to be a breakout success. The app doubled the number of users from last year, and it has been breaking records with hundreds of thousands of new daily users in the month of November.\nIn the U.S. alone, the app has nearly 6.2 million users, while it has around 1 million in the U.K. In its home market of Denmark, the wish list app has over 50% market penetration and over 3.5 million registered Danish users.\nThough today it operates as a tech company, GoWish has a unique origin story. \nImage Credits:GoWish\nThe app was originally launched in 2015 by the Danish-Swedish national postal service PostNord as “Ønskeskyen.” (That’s Danish for “wish cloud.”) It was just a seasonal wish list gimmick, but its founders saw the potential for it to be something more.\nIn 2020, GoWish was acquired by Danish VC Dotcom Capital, which is owned by founder Casper Ravn‑Sørensen, who is also GoWish’s chief growth officer, and his partner, CEO Mads Dahlerup. They spun it out as an independent tech company and created an international version of Ønskeskyen (the app’s name in Denmark and Norway).\n“We might be the first state-founded tech platform to go global as a privately-owned scale-up,” Ravn‑Sørensen told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:GoWish\nConsumers can use the app to create multiple wish lists for themselves, their family, and friends, and for different occasions. Wishes — or products you can buy from online retailers — can be added directly to your list by copying and pasting a URL, searching for a product, or browsing the inspiration feeds that feature millions of products. When you’re ready to buy, you can tap a button in the app to go directly to the retailer’s website.\nThe company has around 65,000 affiliate partnerships and over 700 brand partnerships, many of which are now adding “GoWish” buttons to their own websites. This model has been successful, explained Ravn‑Sørensen, as the app saw net profits after tax of $1.7 million in its fiscal year 2024, which are being reinvested in its growth. (GoWish declined to disclose its total revenue.)\nThe company attributes its increased adoption this year to the marketing it’s been doing across Meta, TikTok, Google, and Snap. Snap even gave GoWish a shoutout on its Q4 earnings call, as it’s been one of Snap’s partner success stories.\n“We’re very good at optimising our marketing spends across digital platforms and that makes our global roll-out very effective,” Ravn‑Sørensen said. \nThe company will later augment its experience with AI, but isn’t yet sharing details about those plans.\n“We have a mission of ‘fixing gifting’,” noted Ravn‑Sørensen, adding that GoWish wants to make “users’ dreams and wishes come true while making double-gifting and returns a thing of the past.” (The app lets family and friends reserve items on users’ wish lists so users won’t receive the same gift from multiple people.)\n“Yet, on a longer trajectory, we want to become the ‘global genie’ of social shopping, that can predict future consumer trends across generations,” he said. \nThe Copenhagen-based company is currently a team of 90 and is backed by Capital D, a London-based private equity firm that bought one-third of the company in early 2025; the rest is owned by the Danish VC Dotcom Capital. \nGoWish is available on iOS and Android and offers a Chrome extension to add items to wish lists from your computer.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSecurity researchers have discovered an Android spyware that targeted Samsung Galaxy phones during a nearly year-long hacking campaign.\nResearchers at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 said the spyware, which they call “Landfall,” was first detected in July 2024 and relied on exploiting a security flaw in the Galaxy phone software that was unknown to Samsung at the time, a type of vulnerability known as a zero-day. \nUnit 42 said the flaw could be abused by sending a maliciously crafted image to a victim’s phone, likely delivered through a messaging app, and that the attacks may not have required any interaction from the victim. \nSamsung patched the security flaw — tracked as CVE-2025-21042 — in April 2025, but details of the spyware campaign abusing the flaw have not been previously reported.\nThe researchers said in a blog post that it’s not known which surveillance vendor developed the Landfall spyware, nor is it known how many individuals were targeted as part of the campaign. But the researchers said that the attacks likely targeted individuals in the Middle East.\nItay Cohen, a senior principal researcher at Unit 42, told TechCrunch that the hacking campaign consisted of a “precision attack” on specific individuals and not a mass-distributed malware, which indicates that the attacks were likely driven by espionage.\nUnit 42 found that the Landfall spyware shares overlapping digital infrastructure used by a known surveillance vendor dubbed Stealth Falcon, which has been previously seen in spyware attacks against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents as far back as 2012. But the researchers said that the links with Stealth Falcon, while intriguing, were not enough to clearly attribute the attacks to a particular government customer.\nUnit 42 said that the Landfall spyware samples that they discovered had been uploaded to VirusTotal, a malware scanning service, from individuals in Morocco, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey throughout 2024 and early 2025.\nTurkey’s national cyber readiness team, known as USOM, flagged one of the IP addresses that the Landfall spyware connected to as malicious, which Unit 42 said supports the theory that individuals in Turkey may have been targeted.\nMuch like other government spyware, Landfall is capable of broad device surveillance, such as accessing the victim’s data, including photos, messages, contacts, and call logs, as well as the tapping of the device’s microphone and tracking their precise location.\nUnit 42 found that the spyware’s source code referenced five specific Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S22, S23, S24, and some Z models, as targets. Cohen said that the vulnerability may have also been present on other Galaxy devices, and affected Android versions 13 through 15. \nSamsung did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton late on Thursday said he is suing online gaming platform Roblox over child safety concerns, accusing the company of “deceiving parents about the dangers of its platform.”\nIn a statement, Paxton alleged that Roblox chooses to prioritize “pixel pedophiles” and profit over the safety of children, and said the platform has become a “breeding ground for predators.”\n“We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators,” Paxton said. “Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen. Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law.”\nPaxton’s lawsuit follows similar cases by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Kentucky, as well as multiple cases in California, Texas, and Pennsylvania against Roblox. The company has come under fire repeatedly for not implementing adequate child safety measures and exposing minors to dangers like grooming, explicit content, and violent or abusive material.\nIn light of such cases and investigations, governments around the world have been rolling out increasingly strict laws and regulations that require social platforms to verify users’ ages, like the U.K.’s Online Safety Act and Mississippi’s age-assurance law. Other states, including Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Virginia, are also considering similar laws.\nThe company has so far responded by adding a slew of safety features, including an age-estimation system that scans users’ selfies and analyzes facial features to estimate age, standardized content and maturity labels, an AI system to detect early signals of child endangerment, safeguards for teenagers, content controls, and more. The company also offers parental controls, tools to restrict communications, and technology that detects when a large number of users are breaking its rules.\nRoblox had 151.5 million daily active users as of September 30, 2025.\nRoblox said it has implemented “industry-leading protocols” to protect users and address malicious activity, and noted that it is “disappointed” by the lawsuit. “We are disappointed that, rather than working collaboratively with Roblox on this industry-wide challenge and seeking real solutions, the AG has chosen to file a lawsuit based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n“Roblox is deeply committed to child safety. Our policies are purposefully stricter than those found on many other platforms. We prohibit the sharing of images and videos in chat, use filters designed to block the exchange of personal information and our trained teams and automated tools continuously monitor communications to detect and remove harmful content,” the spokesperson said.\nNote: This story was updated to add Roblox’s comments.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nOn Friday, Amazon announced the debut of Amazon Bazaar, a new low-cost shopping destination for Asia, Africa, and Latin America that will be available separately from the main Amazon shopping app. On Bazaar, most products are available under $10, and some are as low as $2, the retailer says.\nThe product selection, available now on Android and iOS, will be available in its own app that’s available in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Nigeria.\nAmazon says more markets will gain access to the app in the months ahead.\nThe app has significant overlap with Amazon Haul, which launched last November as a competitor to Shein and Temu. Haul operates as part of Amazon’s main website and app, and will remain available in its existing markets, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Australia.\nIn other markets, Amazon had already branded Amazon Haul as Bazaar, where it’s been available through Amazon’s main shopping app. That version also remains available in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, in addition to India. (Amazon using two names for the same low-cost selection of inventory is confusing! But Amazon thinks the different names “better resonate with local language preferences and cultures.”)\nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe move to create a standalone shopping destination for its cheaper inventory signals Amazon is ramping up the competition with the low-cost Chinese shopping apps, like Temu, Shein, and TikTok (TikTok Shop), which have seen broad adoption by younger users and others without as much disposable income to spend on clothing, decor, electronics, and other household items.\nThe Bazaar app will offer these users “hundreds of thousands” of affordable products in categories like fashion, home goods, and lifestyle products, the retailer says. Product pages feature familiar Amazon features like customer reviews and star ratings. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nCustomers use their same Amazon credentials to shop and check out, where they can use Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. Orders will have to meet the local minimum purchase amount to qualify for free shipping. (This varies by market.) For smaller orders, a standard delivery fee is charged. \nShipments take around 2 weeks or less, returns are free within 15 days of receipt, and Amazon offers multilingual customer support. The app itself supports six languages: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, and Traditional Chinese.\nThe app will also engage customers with interactive features like social lucky draws and promotions — things popularized by the Chinese shopping apps. New customers will also receive 50% off their first delivery as an incentive to try the app. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday the company will reveal the production version of its second-generation Roadster supercar on April 1, 2026 — nearly nine years after he first revealed the project.\nMusk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said during Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting that he chose April Fools’ Day in part because it affords “some deniability.” \n“Like, I could say I was just kidding” if it happens to be later, he said. \nRevealing the production version of the new Roadster next year is in itself a delay. Just one week ago he appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast and repeated his claim that he wanted to show off the car by year’s end. \nMusk stressed Thursday the car “will be very different from what was shown previously,” and again teased that the demo will be the “most exciting, whether it works or not, demo ever of any product” — a not-so-sly nod to the fact that he’s spent years trying to make the new Roadster fly in some fashion, possibly with SpaceX-built thrusters.\nMusk went on to say that he believes the second-generation Roadster won’t go into production until 12 to 18 months after the April reveal. \nDuring the Q&A portion of the meeting, one shareholder asked Musk if customers who preordered the “Founders Series” version of the new Roadsters could be invited to the reveal event. Those were the customers who plopped down $250,000 to secure special versions of the car in 2017.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Sure, absolutely,” Musk answered. “It’s the least we can do for our long-suffering Roadster reservation holders.”\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was one of those long-time sufferers who recently attempted to cancel the reservation — and initially failed to get a refund — for the long-promised EV.\nEarlier this month, Altman posted on X a “tale in three acts,” which was comprised of several screenshots showing his initial reservation, a request for a refund of the $50,000 reservation fee, and his email bouncing back.\n“I really was excited for the car!” Altman wrote. “And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.”\nMusk, who has openly sparred with Altman for years, went on the attack. “And you forgot to mention act 4, where this issue was fixed and you received a refund within 24 hours,” Musk wrote. “But that is in your nature.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

With this expansion, the feature is now available in countries like Brazil, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, and Italy.\nUsers who have set one of these languages as their default, instead of English, can now chat with the AI in question-and-answer format. Reddit uses a Google AI model to power the feature.\nReddit first debuted AI-powered search last year and has been working to expand it in different ways. The feature is part of Reddit Answers, which lives alongside the platform’s traditional search.\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman said in August that Reddit search has more than 70 million weekly users, while Reddit Answers is used by more than 6 million people. He also discussed plans to unify the search experience during the company’s quarterly earnings call. \nQ&A-style search and chat interfaces have been gaining popularity since ChatGPT integrated web search. Incumbent search engines like Google and Brave have introduced similar features to improve user engagement and retention. Newer startups like Perplexity have also gained steam with chat-based search interfaces.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

Deel on Thursday announced that it has raised a $300 million Series E round co-led by A-list fintech VC firm Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from existing investors like Coatue Management and General Catalyst.\nDeel says it’s been profitable for three years and surpassed $1 billion in ARR, including having a month — September — that hit $100 million in revenue. Deel’s business model focuses on serving global companies, handling the complexities of currency and employment regulation for far-flung international teams. It says it’s now grown to 35,000+ customers with more than 1.5 million workers in over 150 countries.\nThose are the types of numbers that attract investment, pending lawsuits or no. (Rippling’s California-filed lawsuit against Deel does not yet have a trial date and is in the discovery phase, according to court records.) Indeed, Ribbit’s founder, Micky Malka, and a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz, gave Deel their full-throated supported in the announcement. In prepared statements, Malka said that Ribbit has been a “fan” of the HR company for a long time, because it’s a “a brand companies trust,” and Horowitz said that a16z has been “blown away” by Deel’s work to build “the best HR platform” for global companies.\nFor what it’s worth, the lawsuits have not slowed down Rippling’s fundraising efforts either. In May, Rippling raised a $450 million Series G round at a $16.8 billion valuation.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n",

Several members joined Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs. \nA few weeks ago, Yang began overseeing the Answers, Knowledge, and Information (AKI) team, which is tasked with improving Siri’s functionality by allowing it to pull information from the web so Apple can better compete with rivals in the AI search market, like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. The new Siri also promises to be able to tap into personal data for more complex tasks.  \nBloomberg reports that Apple’s remaining team members expect more AI team members to jump ship in the coming months. \nTechCrunch has reached out to Apple and Meta for comment.  \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

However, AI-powered technology used by law enforcement has been proven to exacerbate racial biases.\nOn the same day that Ring announced this partnership, 404 Media reported that ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy had access to Flock’s network of cameras. By partnering with Ring, Flock could potentially access footage from millions more cameras.\nRing has long had a poor track record with keeping customers’ videos safe and secure.

Once the 60 days are over, you’ll be blocked from using the Mac Messenger app. We encourage you to delete the app since it will no longer be usable.”\nMeta’s plan to wind down these desktop apps was first spotted by Appleinsider.\nThe company is now alerting users of the upcoming change to give them time to familiarize themselves with other options. For example, Windows users can use the Facebook desktop app, and both Windows and Mac users can access Messenger online.\nMeta is encouraging users to activate secure storage and to set up a PIN to save their chat history before moving to the web version. Once users transition to Facebook.com, their chat history will be available on all platforms. Users can check if they have secure storage turned on by clicking the settings icon above their profile picture and then selecting Privacy & safety > End-to-end encrypted chats. From there, they need to click “Message storage” to check if “Turn on secure storage” is turned on.\nThe move comes a year after Meta replaced the native Messenger app with a Progressive Web App back in September 2024. Of course, Meta’s decision to discontinue the desktop apps altogether will likely see some backlash from avid users of the apps. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The scope of the change is “quite wide” and includes components and assembly for the company’s future notebooks and server products, Nikkei cited a supply chain source as saying. \nThe company is reportedly asking its existing partners to prepare manufacturing capabilities outside the country starting next year, and it is also pushing to move some production of its Xbox gaming consoles to other parts of Asia.\nAmazon Web Services, meanwhile, is considering buying fewer printed circuit boards for its AI data centers from its long-time supplier SYE, and has conducted an evaluation of what it could need to do. And Google is pushing its suppliers to ramp up server production in Thailand, where it has already secured multiple partners for parts, components, and assembly, the report said.\nHowever, moving production outside the country so quickly would prove difficult, given the vast range of components involved and their Chinese partners’ technological and manufacturing prowess, Nikkei noted.\nThe news follows a wave of retaliatory measures from both China and the U.S., who have taken turns to impose increasing tariffs on each other, tighten export controls on crucial components and resources, and restrict what tech can be sold.\nMicrosoft declined to comment.

The U.S. government is, according to these allegations, looking for posts that express views that the current government disfavors.\nThe lawsuit states that the list of forbidden posts include those that criticize the American culture and the U.S. government; that express antisemitic/pro-Palestine support, including support of university protests on the matter; those that rationalize or make light of Charlie Kirk’s murder; or that criticize the Trump administration or its actions.\nThe EFF also alleges that the government is threatening non-citizens with punishments, which includes revoking their visas to immigration confinement.\nThe lawsuit points to posts on the State Department’s X account. This includes the currently pinned thread documenting the visas that the department revoked over comments about Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans.The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk. Here are just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the U.S.:— Department of State (@StateDept) October 14, 2025\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of the auto union, teachers union, and communication workers union.\nThe EFF’s suit claims that these punitive actions, as well as the “viewpoint based” surveillance itself, is an unlawful violation of freedom of speech of these unions’ members.\nThe full lawsuit can be found here.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\nTravel search engine Kayak will now allow users to research trips ahead of booking using AI. The company this week launched an “AI Mode” feature that lets users ask travel-related questions as well as compare and book flights, hotels, and cars, through an AI chatbot integrated on the company’s website.\nThe feature is currently available across both desktop and mobile web, and takes advantage of Kayak’s integration with ChatGPT to deliver contextual results. \nThe rollout follows the company’s April launch of Kayak.ai, built as a testing ground for working with AI technology. That site also combined Kayak’s data and tools with OpenAI’s technology, letting its tech team try out AI features ahead of bringing them over to Kayak.com\nEssentially, the AI Mode feature offers the same functionality as the Kayak.ai website but is now built directly into Kayak’s website. The company suggests users could ask the chatbot for travel ideas, like locations to fly to for under a certain price point, the best deals to a preferred destination, comparing hotel amenities, finding nonstop flights and rental car options, and more.\nImage Credits:Kayak\nPlus, users can ask the AI more open-ended questions, like “I want to party for NYE — where should I go?” to get recommendations without having specific destinations in mind. Or they could learn when the best time to fly somewhere would be, based on ticket prices. (Kayak has shared other AI prompt ideas on its own blog.)\nThe feature could be useful in helping consumers in the earlier stages of travel planning, when they’re just exploring ideas. However, it remains to be seen if AI users readily convert to paying customers using these methods. \nAI Mode is initially available in English in the United States but will expand to other countries and languages later in the month. The company also plans to roll out the feature to more platforms and add support for voice-based requests “soon.”\nImage Credits:Kayak\nTravel is an area that’s being explored by AI providers and travel companies alike, as online booking can be a frustrating and tedious experience for consumers as it stands today. To test consumer demand for AI solutions, OpenAI recently announced deals with travel companies like Expedia and Booking.com (the latter is also owned by Kayak’s parent company, Booking Holdings). As a result, those services can now operate as apps inside ChatGPT.\nBy comparison, Kayak’s decision to run the AI chatbot on its own site could provide the company with more direct access to consumer insights about the AI’s use.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOpenAI announced Thursday it paused the ability for users to generate videos resembling the late civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. using its AI video model, Sora. The company says it’s adding this safeguard at the request of Dr. King’s estate after some Sora users generated “disrespectful depictions” of his image.\n“While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,” OpenAI said in a post on X from its official newsroom account. “Authorized representatives or estate owners can request that their likeness not be used in Sora cameos.”\n\nStatement from OpenAI and King Estate, Inc.The Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. (King, Inc.) and OpenAI have worked together to address how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s likeness is represented in Sora generations. Some users generated disrespectful depictions of Dr.…— OpenAI Newsroom (@OpenAINewsroom) October 17, 2025\n\nThe restriction comes just a few weeks after OpenAI launched its social video platform, Sora, which allows users to create realistic AI-generated videos resembling historical figures, their friends, and users who elect to have their likeness recreated on the platform. The launch has stirred fervent public debate around the dangers of AI-generated videos, and how platforms should implement guardrails around the technology.\nDr. Bernice King, Dr. King’s daughter, posted on Instagram last week asking people to stop sending her AI videos resembling her father. She joined Robin Williams’ daughter, who also asked Sora users to stop generating AI videos of her father.\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this week that Sora users had created AI-generated videos of Dr. King making monkey noises and wrestling with another civil rights icon, Malcolm X. Scrolling through OpenAI’s Sora app, it’s easy to find crude videos resembling other historical figures, including artist Bob Ross, singer Whitney Houston, and former President John F. Kennedy.\nThe licensor of Dr. King’s estate did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nBeyond how Sora represents humans, the launch has also raised a flurry of questions around how social media platforms should handle AI videos of copyrighted works. The Sora app is also full of videos depicting cartoons like SpongeBob, South Park, and Pokémon.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOpenAI has added other restrictions to Sora in weeks since its launch. Earlier in October, the company said it planned to give copyright holders more granular control over the types of AI videos that can be generated with their likeness. That may have been a response to Hollywood’s initial reaction to Sora, which was not great.\nAs OpenAI adds restrictions to Sora, the company seems to be taking a more hands-off approach to moderating content in ChatGPT. OpenAI announced this week that it would allow adult users to have “erotic” chats with ChatGPT in the coming months.\nWith Sora, it seems that OpenAI is grappling with the concerns that come along with AI video generation. Some OpenAI researchers publicly wrestled with questions about the company’s first AI-powered social media platform in the days after its launch, and how such a product fits into the nonprofit’s mission. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company felt “trepidation” about Sora on launch day.\nNick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, told me earlier this month that the best way to teach the world about a new technology is putting it out in the world. He said that’s what the company learned with ChatGPT, and that’s what OpenAI is finding with Sora, too. It seems the company is learning something about how to distribute this technology, as well.\n\n\n\t\tMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "\nAndrew Lissimore has been running the audio apparel site Headphones.com for nearly a decade now. While audiophiles have a high affinity toward their gear and want to try out new gadgets, Lissimore wasn’t satisfied with continuously spending money on platforms like Meta and Google to acquire new customers; he wanted to find a way to better retain the customers he already had.\nThe founder started to look for solutions within the Shopify ecosystem that would help the business with loyalty programs. But most of what he found offered only spend and tier-based solutions. So he decided to build his own system. \nWhat started as a project to solve loyalty for Headphones.com is now a startup called Lantern, which other companies can use to easily integrate loyalty solutions into their own businesses.\nInitially, the company wired together different apps to have a variety of loyalty points based on stamps, spend, points, and referrals, but it was hard to manage. Plus, bringing together different apps introduced challenges with user experience flows and brand identity.\n“We thought it would be great to have a Shopify native system for loyalty that is easy to customize and integrate,” Lissimore said. “I managed to convince Shopify designers Kyle Peatt and Dominic McPhee, who built their Polaris design system, to work on this.” \nLater, both joined Lantern as co-founders. Peatt currently works as the chief design and product officer, and McPhee works as the chief technology officer. In total, the company currently has eight full-time employees.\nLantern co-founders Dominic McPhee and Kyle Peatt. Image Credits:Lantern\nLantern can handle customer account creation and management, loyalty, and referrals for any vendor working on Shopify. Websites can reward returning or new customers and award them points for activities like participating in forums, as well. The company explained that the sellers can easily integrate their solution and don’t need to add any extra code to do so.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLissimore said that operating Headphones.com provided the perfect testing ground for Lantern to understand the pain points of being a seller and getting better retention.\n“I think we were in the perfect spot to come up with something like Lantern because we [headphones.com] were so desperate to increase the repurchase rate. A lot of businesses like clothing brands or makeup brands have naturally built in repurchase, but for us, it was existential,” he told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Lantern\nAfter Headphones.com adopted Lantern, its purchase rate for repeat visitors increased from 30% to 50%. The period for buying a second pair of headphones has also reduced from 198 days to 98 days. \nThe company now has clients like skincare site Counter, which rakes in over $200 million a year, and footwear brand Vessi. It has also built tools to measure retention effectively to show Lantern’s value to its clients.\nTo further grow its business, Lantern raised $3.1 million in seed funding led by Salesforce Ventures, with participation from Sidekick Partners, Day One Ventures, and individual investors like Vessi’s Tony Yu. The company directly competes with existing startups such as LoyaltyLion and Yotpo.\nRob Keith, a partner at Salesforce Ventures, said that Lantern stood out to the firm because the startup is approaching retention through means that go beyond point-based loyalty with a flexible approach.\n“Lantern brings together something unique — Andrew built and scaled Headphones.com and lived these retention challenges as a merchant, while Kyle and Dominic come from Shopify, where they built the Polaris design system that thousands of developers use today. That combination means they understand both what merchants actually need and how to build solutions that feel native to the platform rather than bolted on,” he said.\nKeith added that Lantern’s features, like wallet functionality, directly appearing in checkout without any pop-ups or redirects, help both consumers and brands.\nIn its product roadmap, the company plans to leverage AI and provide customers with insights and recommendations around retention.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFollowing backlash over an increase in “AI slop” taking over users’ feeds, Pinterest on Thursday added new tools that let users limit how much AI-generated content they see on the platform.\nUsers can now personalize their feeds to restrict generative AI imagery in select categories, and the company said it will make its existing GenAI content labels more noticeable in the days to come.\nThe site, widely used to browse and bookmark inspirational content and potential purchases, has come under fire from users who have complained about the massive uptick in GenAI content. The media has also been documenting the problem, while openly wondering if AI has already ruined Pinterest or if it could still be fixed.\nThe problem, if left unresolved, could destroy Pinterest’s reputation and, ultimately, its bottom line.\nAI slop is potentially a tough nut to crack as more of the web fills up with AI-generated content and the quality of the AI content improves, making it less obvious to spot. Citing academic literature, Pinterest notes that GenAI content now makes up 57% of all online material.\nTo address the issue, Pinterest earlier this year introduced “AI modified” labels that would appear on images whose metadata indicated AI generation, or if Pinterest’s own systems detected that the content was AI-generated. At the time, the company said it would “soon” introduce consumer-facing tools that would let users choose to see less AI content.\nImage Credits:Pinterest\nThose tools have now arrived and will be available in the app’s “Settings” menu, under “Refine your recommendations.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHere, users will be able to configure whether they’d like to see less GenAI content in certain categories that are prone to AI-generated imagery, like beauty, art, fashion, and home décor. Pinterest said it will introduce more categories in the future, based on user feedback. Plus, if users want to modify their settings, they can do so at any time.\nIn addition, users can send feedback about AI imagery as they browse the site. If they see a Pin that’s not appealing because of its generative AI nature, they can tap the three-dot overflow menu and select a category to refine their preferences. \nThe new controls are launching first on the website and Android and will roll out to iOS users over the weeks ahead, Pinterest said.\n“Our community is at the heart of everything we do,” said Matt Madrigal, Pinterest’s chief technology officer, in a statement about the launch. “With our new GenAI controls, we’re empowering people to personalize their Pinterest experience more than ever — striking the right balance between human creativity and AI innovation, and ensuring every feed truly reflects what inspires them most.”\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nEnergy startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said Thursday it’s working with Google’s DeepMind division to fine tune — and even improve — the operation of its forthcoming Sparc reactor using AI.\nThe companies’ plan will simulate the plasma that will burn inside CFS’s reactor using specialized DeepMind software known as Torax. They also plan on pairing Torax with AI models to help CFS figure out how best to achieve fusion power.\nFusion power promises to deliver massive amounts of electricity with zero emissions from a near limitless source of fuel: water. AI-related companies have been bullish on fusion startups as a source of electricity to power energy-hungry data centers. Google appears to be eyeing them as potential customer as well.\nThis isn’t Google’s first foray into nuclear fusion. The tech company has worked with another fusion startup, TAE Technologies, to use AI to study how plasma behaves inside TAE’s fusion machine. \nThere’s a reason Google keeps coming back to the problem: AI might be uniquely suited to making fusion power possible. \nOne of the biggest challenges facing fusion startups is keeping the plasma inside a reactor hot enough for long enough. Unlike nuclear fission reactions, which are self-sustaining, fusion reactions are difficult to maintain outside of stars like the sun. Without that sort of mass and gravity, the plasma is constantly in danger of diffusing and snuffing itself out. \nIn CFS’s reactors, powerful magnets substitute for gravity to help corral the plasma, but they’re not perfect. Reactor operators have to develop control software that can enable the device to continuously react to changing plasma conditions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nProblem is, there are almost too many knobs to turn, certainly more than a human is capable of. That’s the sort of problem that AI excels at. Experts have cited AI as one of the key technologies that has enabled the industry’s remarkable advances over the past several years.\nCFS is currently building Sparc, its demonstration reactor, in a suburb outside Boston. The device is about two-thirds completed, and when finished later in 2026, the startup is predicting that it will be the first fusion device capable of producing more power than the plant needs to run itself.\nGoogle said Torax can be used with reinforcement learning or evolutionary search models to find the “most efficient and robust paths to generating net energy.” The two companies are also exploring whether AI can be used to control the reactor’s operation. \nIn August, Google participated in CFS’s $863 million Series B2 round alongside Nvidia. Earlier this year, Google also said it would buy 200 megawatts of electricity from CFS’s first commercial power plant, Arc, which is planned to be built outside Richmond, Virginia. The tech company is also an investor in CFS competitor TAE Technologies. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe sprawling metropolis of Phoenix continues to be a testbed for Waymo, and not just on the technical front. The Alphabet-owned company has used its first testing and commercial market to experiment with its business model, too, including delivery.\nWaymo is known for its robotaxis, but it has tested how its tech could be used for delivery. The company previously tapped UPS and Uber Eats for pilot programs, and it put considerable staff and resources toward developing self-driving trucks under its Waymo Via arm, before shuttering that program in 2023 to focus on robotaxis.\nNow it seems Waymo is ready to test the delivery waters through a strategic, multi-year partnership with DoorDash. Waymo doesn’t have any other active delivery-focused testing, operations, or partnerships, according to a company spokesperson.\nThe partnership will match DoorDash customers ordering food and groceries within a 315-square-mile area of Phoenix with a self-driving Waymo, the company wrote in a blog post.\nNot every DoorDash order will result in a Waymo delivery. Initially, the Waymo delivery service will deliver orders from DashMart — DoorDash’s convenience, grocery, and retail stores. The companies said that, over time, more local Phoenix merchants and a wider variety of offerings will be added.\nDavid Richter, vice president of business and corporate development at DoorDash, said the deal with Waymo will give customers a “new and delightful experience, while advancing our vision for a multi-modal autonomousfuture of local commerce.”\nDoorDash isn’t new to the autonomous vehicle technology arena. The company has partnered with sidewalk delivery bot company Serve Robotics to cover parts of Los Angeles. It also has its own in-house autonomous vehicle tech team that developed and produced an autonomous delivery bot called Dot. The delivery bot, which was revealed in September, is being tested in the Phoenix area.\nThe deal with Waymo won’t involve DoorDash’s Dot vehicle, however. Instead, food or groceries will be placed in the trunk of a Waymo vehicle — a driverless Jaguar I-Pace that will navigate on its own to the customer. From here, the customer will have to retrieve the items from the trunk via the DoorDash app. \nThis last step, which requires the customer to walk out to the car and grab the delivered items, will be the big test for both companies, as they try to determine whether the novelty of receiving groceries delivered by an autonomous vehicle outweighs the convenience of a human handing over the items at their door. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nRon Conway, the founder of venture firm SV Angel, known for its early investments into Google, Airbnb, and Meta, has resigned from the Salesforce Foundation, the New York Times reported. The resignation follows Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff saying last week that he “fully supported” President Trump and proposing that National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets to combat crime and homelessness.\nIn an interview with the New York Times last week, Benioff argued that San Francisco needs “a show of force” and called for deploying the National Guard to address what he described as the city’s deteriorating conditions. He also praised Elon Musk’s government efficiency efforts and said that he wasn’t keeping up with reports on immigration raids or Trump’s attacks on the press, despite owning the news magazine Time, which he purchased in 2018.\nConway has been on the board of the Salesforce Foundation, whose mission is to support education and workforce development for disadvantaged youth, for a decade. The philanthropic organization donated $36 million in 2023 and ended that year with $400 million in assets, according to tax filings, the New York Times reported.\nBenioff and Conway have been friends for 25 years and shared left-leaning political views for the majority of that time. But the Salesforce CEO’s current ideological viewpoints upset Conway.\n“It saddens me immensely to say that with your recent comments, and failure to understand their impact, I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired,” Conway wrote on Thursday in an email to Benioff obtained by the New York Times.\nA Salesforce spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that Conway has resigned. “We have deep gratitude for Ron Conway and his incredible contributions to the Salesforce Foundation Board for over a decade,” the spokesperson said. \nBenioff is one of the many high-profile tech leaders and investors who, despite having previously supported the Democratic Party, have now voiced their support for Trump. The rift between Benioff and Conway unfolded during Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference, one of the largest events held annually in San Francisco.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNeither Salesforce nor Conway immediately responded to a request for comment.\nUpdate: The post has been updated with a statement from a Salesforce spokesperson.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

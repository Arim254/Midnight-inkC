    "body": "\nThinking Machines Lab, the AI startup led by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, has lost one of its co-founders to Meta.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that AI researcher Andrew Tulloch announced his departure to employees in a message on Friday. A Thinking Machine Labs spokesperson confirmed Tulloch’s departure to the WSJ, saying he “has decided to pursue a different path for personal reasons.”\nBack in August, the WSJ reported that Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive AI recruiting blitz included an offer to acquire Thinking Machines Lab — and when that failed, Zuckerberg reportedly tried to lure Tulloch with a compensation package that could have been worth up to $1.5 billion over at least six years. (At the time, a Meta spokesperson said that the WSJ’s description of the offer was “inaccurate and ridiculous.”)\nTulloch previously worked at OpenAI and Facebook’s AI Research Group.\n",

The company, backed by Sequoia Capital, TCV, and Jackson Square Ventures, was last valued at $2.2 billion in May.\nStrava has the wind at its back, certainly. The app’s user base has exploded to 50 million monthly active users in 2025, according to Sensor Tower – nearly double its closest competitor, with downloads up 80% year-over-year.\nStrava’s growth coincides with a cultural shift around running, particularly as people in their teens and 20s seek more alcohol-free ways to socialize. Runners also emphasize the mental health benefits of finding support networks (and, sometimes, romance). Applications for the 2026 London Marathon jumped 31% this year to 1.1 million people.\nStrava’s secret sauce? Turning workouts into social currency with “kudos” and split comparisons. Sensor Tower estimates consumers spent over $180 million on its subscription tier through September – a figure Strava says significantly underestimates actual revenue. The company also earns from sponsored challenges and brand partnerships.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

    "body": "\nMarc Benioff has long been San Francisco’s liberal-leaning billionaire, the tech executive who funded homeless services, donated to the city’s public schools, and hosted Hillary Clinton fundraisers.\nBut in a new, wide-ranging phone interview with the New York Times from his private plane, Benioff revealed a political transformation that seemed to surprise even his own communications team, despite that Salesforce has hundreds of contracts with the federal government. \nThe Salesforce founder declared he “fully supported” President Trump and thought National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets. He gushed about sitting across from Trump at a Windsor Castle state dinner, telling the president “how grateful I am for everything he’s doing.” He praised Elon Musk’s government efficiency efforts and said he hadn’t closely followed news about immigration raids or Trump’s attacks on the media.\nThe 50-minute conversation reportedly ended after Benioff turned to his public relations executive, apparently noticing her expression. “What about the political questions?” he could be heard asking. “Too spicy?”Though Benioff’s shift mirrors Silicon Valley’s broader accommodation of Trump, the exchange offered a rare glimpse of just how far that repositioning can go. The question now: will other Bay Area tech CEOs follow Benioff’s lead and call for federal troops in their own backyard?\n",

Existing users can also re-download the app from their Apple account if needed.\nWithout updates, it will probably become more difficult to use Clips over time, so Apple is encouraging users to download their Clips videos (with or without added effects) to their photo library, so they can watch and edit the videos using other apps.\nLaunched in 2017, Clips appeared to be Apple’s answer to Snapchat and Instagram Stories — it wasn’t a social network, but it allowed users to stitch together photos and videos with filters, emojis, and music.\nEarly on, TechCrunch’s Brian Heater described Clips’ video editing capabilities as simple to a fault and suggested that the app could allow Apple to showcase its hardware and software capabilities while offering users a path out of then on-the-rise social ecosystems.\nMacRumors reports that while Apple upgraded Clips with new features after launch, updates in recent years have been limited to bug fixes. \nApple fans on Reddit seemed unsurprised by the news, saying they’d only tried the app years ago or never heard of it at all. Plus, an app like Clips — built around real footage shot by real people — might feel a bit old-fashioned when compared to Sora, OpenAI’s generative AI video app that recently hit 1 million downloads. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

The rule, however, doesn’t mean that staff can’t ask questions or require amended filings later. \nNavan declined to comment to TechCrunch about its updated IPO documents.\nThe going thought was that the shutdown would cool and possibly freeze an IPO market that had just started to thaw. Even with this rule, many companies would rather get a green light from a staffer than go it alone, sources told Bloomberg. So the tech world will be watching how Navan’s gambit fairs. \nNavan’s updated filing shows the company plans to sell 30 million shares, with insiders selling an additional 7 million. It priced its range at $24 to $26. At the high-end, the company would raise more than  $960 million and be valued at $6.45 billion. Navan is backed by Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Zeev Ventures, and Greenoaks. \nNavan generated rolling 12-month revenue of $613 million (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to the updated filing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n",

Less than 1% of all notifications receive any interactions from users, notes Google.\nImage Credits:Google (screenshot)\nStill, the tech giant believes some notifications can be helpful, which is why it won’t revoke those for installed web apps — only for the sites where there’s low user engagement and high volume of notifications sent. This change alone could push spammy websites that push a lot of notifications to reconsider how many they want to send alerts, so they won’t lose access entirely.\nUnwanted notifications have been an issue facing consumers for years. On the iPhone, for instance, Apple was forced to add controls that let users send their push notifications to a daily summary, mute them, or turn them off altogether from the notification message itself, after consumer frustrations with the notification system grew.\nGoogle says it will inform users when it’s removing notification permissions, allowing users to change the setting back, if they prefer. If users would rather Google didn’t intervene, they can also opt to turn off this auto-revocation feature altogether, the company notes. \nThe feature had been in testing ahead of today’s official launch. Google found that these changes didn’t significantly impact the total number of clicks on notifications, an indication that people weren’t really engaging much with these pop-ups to begin with.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Paradigm Ventures, CapitalG, and Coinbase Ventures also participated.\nKalshi also revealed that consumers in 140 countries can now make bets on its platform.\nThe prediction market is seeing a dramatic surge in activity: Kalshi is set to reach $50 billion in annualized trading volume, up significantly from the approximately $300 million volume posted last year, the New York Times reported.\nKalshi’s fundraise announcement follows one made just days earlier by archrival Polymarket, which revealed that it had secured an investment of up to $2 billion from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, at a pre-money valuation of $8 billion. The deal valued Polymarket at $8 billion pre-money, a monumental increase from its $1 billion valuation only two months earlier in August.\nBoth Kalshi and Polymarket rose to prominence last year, drawing significant attention for their prediction markets on the presidential election outcome.\nPolymarket has been barred from serving U.S. residents since 2022, following a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In July, the company acquired a derivatives exchange and a clearing house. The move helped Polymarket receive the right to reenter the U.S. market.

In a Truth Social post announcing the tariffs, Trump also said this new tariff would be “over and above” any tariffs already imposed on Chinese imports. (CNBC reports that while U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports vary depending on the goods, the base tariff rate is already 40%.)\nEarlier this week, China announced that it is tightening its export controls on rare earth minerals, requiring that foreign companies apply for a license if they want to export products with even a small amount of those minerals. China is the world’s largest producer of rare earth minerals, which are used in products critical to the tech industry, including semiconductors and solar panels.\nIn his post, Trump described China’s announcement as “absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.”\n“It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,” he wrote.\nAccording to Trump, these new tariffs are set to take effect on November 1. After posting, Trump reportedly told journalists that the tariffs could still be walked back, and that he would not necessarily cancel a scheduled meeting with President Xi Jinping.\nStocks tumbled following Trump’s announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.9% at market close on Friday, the S&P 500 down 2.71% and Nasdaq down 3.56%. Some tech companies were hit particularly hard, with Nvidia and Tesla both down around 5% at market close.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe news also affected the crypto markets, leading to liquidations that were reportedly 10x the dollar value of liquidations during the FTX collapse.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nApart from antivirus apps, the cybersecurity industry has traditionally been business to business, with regular internet users left on their own to protect themselves. And older people, who did not grow up with the internet and smartphones, are perhaps the most vulnerable. \nZoraSafe, a startup founded by sisters Catherine Karow and Ellie King Karow wants to step in and help them out. Their idea is to create an app that not only protects older people against scammers and hackers, but also teaches them how to stay safe through gamified microlearning, as Catherine and Ellie told TechCrunch ahead of the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, where ZoraSafe will be part of Startup Battlefield.\nThe app is not out yet, but Catherine and Ellie expect to launch it in a month. They said it will cost $12.99 a month for individual subscribers, and a higher rate for family and group plans.\nThe first version of the app, Catherine explained in a phone call, will have several features, such as a mode to scan QR codes for malware or phishing, the ability to send suspicious SMS text messages and emails to ZoraSafe to get them checked out, and a feature to share a known scam or threat with the app so it can be added to a database to help other users.\n“We’re trying to incentivize social sharing of scams, so we can also alert the entire Zora network at once, so one person is alerted by that scam, and then we can make sure everyone in that community is protected immediately,” Catherine said.\nFuture releases will also include a feature that will allow users to get ZoraSafe to join a suspicious phone call, so the company’s AI system can detect if it’s a scam or a deepfake call. In that case, however, the app will not be listening to or recording the calls, according to Catherine.  \nOnce the app detects a threat, it will spin up a chat that will explain to the user what that threat was and teach them how to spot and deal with similar situations in the future, Ellie said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The whole purpose of which is to build resilience and hopefully make it so that even if you’re not directly interacting with the app, you’re a little bit more aware when you are interacting online,” she added. \nEllie said that the AI engine is designed with privacy in mind, doing 85% of the processing on the device, and only 15% in the cloud, which she claimed will be “sanitized of your personal information before it leaves your device.” \nCatherine also said they are planning to make an “NFC sticker” that will be incorporated in phone cases so that users can quickly pull up the app if they get a deepfake call, or even if they fall and need to alert their caretakers. That’s one of the ways they plan on getting around iOS’s restrictions on apps monitoring what happens on other apps. Another way is to have a “Share to ZoraSafe” option in the iOS menu that will allow users to send text messages or emails to the company’s systems.  \nEventually, the sisters said they want to expand ZoraSafe to children, too, partner with schools, and also launch the app in different languages, starting with Spanish.  \nIf you want to learn more about ZoraSafe — while also checking out dozens of other companies, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29, in San Francisco. Learn more here.  \n\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nIt’s a universally acknowledged truth that the current dating scene sucks, no matter what city you live in. Everyone has a story. And everyone has a grievance. \nTake Myles Slayton, who completed a banking internship in New York City and saw how he and his friends struggled to find significant others in the city’s ruthless dating scene. “We’re on our phones more than ever,” he told TechCrunch. ”I thought to myself, ‘Why are dating apps terrible?’” \nHe figured that it must not be a problem with dating apps, per se, but rather the way the products work these days. Many of the popular dating apps were built with millennials in mind, but his generation, Gen Z, operates in a completely different fashion, he said. It’s a throwback to how dating used to be: People of this generation meet “through mutuals, through people in our social circles,” he said. \nHe teamed up with friends Willy Conzelman and Carter Munk and just a few months ago launched Cerca, a dating app that matches people with others already in their social circles. The company announced a $1.6 million seed round this summer and already has people buzzing: The app has around 60,000 users, mainly in New York and scattered across universities. \nThe company is part of Startup Battlefield and will show off its tech at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 later this month in San Francisco.\nImage Credits:Cerca\nSlayton, the company’s CEO, said there is a reason Gen Z has retreated to the old ways of dating, and that’s because of the internet and the COVID pandemic. “We simply don’t trust strangers,” he said, adding that people are also deeply afraid of rejection. \nCerca’s product tries to address this. Users create a standard dating profile, sync their contacts, and from there, only friends or friends of friends already on the app are shown as potential matches. “The fear of strangers is eliminated,” Slayton said. All likes are anonymous, alleviating the fear of rejection. Users get four swipes a day, he said, in the hope of getting rid of the swiping fatigue and putting more emphasis on choosing a match. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“There is no world where you should be seeing 100 profiles in a minute,” he said. “You should really be taking a second to think about each profile. These are real people.” \nThe profiles first reveal the friends in common, then the background, and then the photos. “It’s not all just about looks for us,” he said. A user gets a notification that someone has liked their profile, though they won’t know who. The Cerca algorithm will boost the profile of whoever made the like into the feed of the person they’re interested in, who can then decide whether to like them back. \nEach evening, matches are revealed, and nobody knows who made the first move. \nHaving friends in common makes it easier to vet for safety, as people can simply text their mutual friends to gather intel on who they are going on a date with. Users can also select which and how many contacts they want to share with Cerca, as well as block certain people from seeing their profiles. “You can also filter out words like dentist, doctor,” he said. “There’s no screenshotting or screen recording. Safety is paramount to us.” \nAside from the online world, the company has also created merchandise and is hosting events. \nSlayton said he and his co-founders decided to apply to Startup Battlefield and knew a founder who had participated in the event. “I think it’s such an opportunity to have the U.S. and the world see who we are and to represent dating in a positive light,” he said. \nIf you want to learn from Cerca firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPrezent, a startup that offers an AI-powered presentation builder to enterprises, said today that it has raised $30 million in funding led by Multiplier Capital, Greycroft, and Nomura Strategic Ventures, with participation from existing investors like Emergent Ventures, WestWave Capital, and Alumni Ventures.\nThe Los Altos, California, startup, which is now valued at $400 million, has raised over $74 million to date. It plans to use the new capital largely for acquisitions.\nThe company has also made its first acquisition, buying Prezentium, founded by Deepti Juturu, a services-led presentation company that operates in the life sciences vertical. In an unusual arrangement, Prezent founder Rajat Mishra was one of the co-founders of Prezentium. Mishra said that since the beginning of his new startup, he has been the non-operating president of Prezentium. Both startups already have an existing relationship, as Prezent uses Prezentium as a go-to-market partner. The acquisition essentially brings Mishra’s two ventures under one roof, allowing Prezent to use Prezentium’s client base to offer its own AI suite to more customers.\nImage Credits:Prezent\nThere are plenty of companies trying to create AI-powered presentation-building tools, including Presentations.ai, Lica, Gamma, and Chronicle. Notably, all these companies have Accel as a backer. While most of them focus on consumers and small business users, Prezent wants to stick to an enterprise strategy, targeting larger corporations. Previously, the company stated that it wants to expand its offerings to different verticals, including finance and manufacturing. However, Mishra noted that for now, the company wants to focus on serving clients in the life sciences and tech industries.\n“There are plenty of tools that are trying to make presentations pretty. We want to provide the best tools for business communications. I think presentation is one of the frontiers in businesses that is not automated yet. We want to help data scientists and designers to communicate effectively with this automation,” Mishra told TechCrunch.\nPrezent founder Rajat MishraImage Credits:Prezent\nMishra, who previously worked at McKinsey, said that the company is taking a specialized approach to training AI models for presentations for each specific industry.\nPrezent places a presentation engineer, who is familiar with the industry and the startup’s own offerings, in enterprises to help different people within the company get used to building presentations with AI tools.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The reality of AI in enterprise is that while AI can do many things, it can’t teach people [how] to use AI. That is why we want to place presentation engineers in companies to help our customers adopt the product faster,” Mishra said.\nImage Credits:Prezent\nAI startups are looking to acquire services companies to take advantage of existing customer bases and also provide better customization to enterprise clients. Digital avatar startup D-ID acquired Berlin-based video startup Simpleshow, and Google-backed legal tech startup Lawhive acquired a U.K.-based law firm. With these acquisitions, AI startups want to combine their AI tools with the existing domain expertise and client service capabilities of services firms.\nPrezent wants to build more partnerships and acquire suitable companies in sectors like executive communication coaching, medical writing, and consulting firms in the communication area. \nMark Terbeek, a partner at Greycroft who has invested in multiple rounds in Prezent, said that the venture firm likes to find the areas where businesses have used costly agencies in the past to fulfill a need, and now there are AI tools available trying to do the same tasks.\n“We felt that Rajat and Prezent were concentrating hard on solving specific customer needs of business communications. Plus, we saw software evolve quickly to adjust to the workflows of end users and help them save time,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\nGoing forward, Prezent wants to add better personalization to its product so the AI tool learns the style of each individual in the organization. It also wants to add multimodality capabilities to deck creations, allowing users to use text, voice, or video as input to make presentations. Like Synthesia and D-ID, Prezent wants to add digital avatars to presentations, too.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\nThis has been a big week for AI companies signing enterprise deals, with Zendesk unveiling new AI agents that are supposed to be able to resolve 80% of customer service issues, Anthropic and IBM announcing a strategic partnership, and Deloitte also announcing a deal with Anthropic. Plus, Google announced a new AI-for-business platform.\nThat doesn’t mean it’s going to be smooth sailing for big organizations using AI. In fact, the timing of the Deloitte announcement was a bit awkward, coming on the same day the Australia Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said the professional services and consulting firm would have to pay a refund for delivering a report to the department with what appeared to be a number of AI-generated hallucinations.\nOn the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec, Sean O’Kane, and I discussed the latest AI headlines, contrasting it with last week’s news about the new Sora app. While AI companies may eventually make real money from consumer social networking apps, enterprise deals offer a more immediate path to significant revenue.\nYou can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.\nAnthony: I think this actually ties back to our discussion last week about some of these GenAI social networks. We were framing that as potentially a way that these AI companies could eventually make money, which I definitely think is the case, but there’s a long road to get there. And the enterprise, sometimes people don’t find it quite as interesting or sexy as consumer, [but] it’s actually where the real money is. \nMaybe Sora is how OpenAI will make money five years from now, but this is how these companies are going to make money now.\nAnd the Deloitte [news] was especially striking. Sometimes you can feel like a little bit of a broken record to just point out how these models [aren’t always] totally ready for prime time, but I find it encouraging that the Australian government actually pushed back and said, no, you cannot do this.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s not necessarily that no one should ever use AI in the creation of these kinds of reports, although I think you could make that argument. But if you’re going to do it, you actually have to be responsible for the outputs. You have to actually go through and make sure that the information being cited is real. You can’t feed it into a model and just [say] “All right, my job is done, that’ll be however many billable hours.” I think anyone who does that should be embarrassed and fined.\nKirsten: Absolutely. Sean, Zendesk also had an announcement this week, and they’re really creating these tools that are going to handle pretty much all of customer service, basically removing the human from that process. In your everyday [life], how you go about the world or how automakers deal with service, for instance, are you starting to see that kind of [automation] creep in?\nSean: Yeah, I’ve actually written about it a few times. There are a bunch of different startups that are developing full customer service suites, voice agents, LLMs for emails and texts [from] dealerships and service centers. I actually think that’s a worthy idea, because the problem there isn’t: We don’t have enough people for the jobs to do this stuff and it’s going to take their jobs away. It’s that you can never get somebody on the phone or you get bounced around. \nEspecially going for service, you get bounced to the service department. Everybody’s busy. So if you can capture it accurately and make it easier for people to get a response, the question there for me is how much will those businesses adopt it and stick with it. There’s been all sorts of technologies over the years, like web forms and things like that, where these dealerships have done it, but then they forget about it. And then it just sits on their website and you think that it’s going to work, and then it doesn’t work, because they just want you to call them. \nSo I have some optimism and some hope that stuff like this is actually gonna be people’s first touch point with [a business]. And it looks like we’re about to find out.\n\n\n\nEquity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, and all the casts.

    "body": "\nWelcome back to TechCrunch Mobility, your hub for all things “future of transportation.” To get this in your inbox, sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility!\nElon Musk has never had the best relationship with regulators, often bumping up against or outright sidestepping local and state laws where his numerous companies operate. \nThis week has been particularly active on the regulatory front. \nMusk’s tunneling and infrastructure firm The Boring Company is accused of nearly 800 violations by Nevada regulators, including digging without approval, dumping untreated water onto city streets, failing to install silt fences, and tracking dirt from construction sites onto nearby roadways, a ProPublica investigation discovered. \nThen there is Tesla, which was hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance for routinely denying or delaying customer claims despite years of warnings from the state regulator. Reminder: Tesla is an insurance provider in certain states.  \nTesla also has the attention, once again, of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency opened an investigation into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving tech after receiving reports the software caused vehicles to run red lights or cross into wrong lanes. \nThe NHTSA has investigated Tesla before. But this one is notable because it specifically targets Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assistance software. And Musk, as well as Tesla shareholders, have pinned the company’s future on its ability to be a leader in autonomous vehicle technology, as well as robotics and AI. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis single investigation likely won’t derail Tesla’s plans; the company just rolled out the newest version of FSD (v14). But it is another example of increased scrutiny on the technology that Tesla is trying to put front and center and raises questions about its robotaxis, which uses a version of its FSD software.\nA little bird\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nA Wired article from July discovered that General Motors repurposed a few Chevy Bolt EVs that had been part of the shuttered Cruise robotaxi program and was driving them on select highways in Michigan near Austin, Texas, and the San Francisco Bay Area to develop simulation models and new driver-assistance technology.\nNow it seems that General Motors might be moving forward with its autonomous vehicle development but in potentially surprising ways. When GM absorbed Cruise in December 2024, it said it would combine Cruise’s tech with its own ADAS efforts to develop fully autonomous personal vehicles.\nWe’re hearing chatter here and there that GM is building out an AV team across Austin and Mountain View. This comes just a couple months after GM started rehiring laid-off Cruise employees, per Bloomberg.We’re poking around and if you know anything, reach out.\nGot a tip for us? Email Kirsten Korosec at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com or my Signal at kkorosec.07, or email Sean O’Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com.\nDeals!\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nJoby Aviation sold 30.5 million shares to raise about $514 million, money that the company said would be used to fund certification and manufacturing efforts and prepare for commercial operations, as well as for general working capital and other general corporate purposes. The company plans to start carrying passengers in its electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft in Dubai in 2026, followed by the United States. \nInvestors didn’t react too favorably, though, because shares went for a discount. Under the deal, they sold for $16.85 per share, nearly 11% lower than the previous close.\nOther deals that got my attention this week …\nI forgot this one last week. Futurail, a European startup developing an autonomy stack for self-driving trains, raised €7.5 million in seed funding co-led by Asterion Ventures and Leap435, joined by EIT Urban Mobility and U.S. investors Zero Infinity Partners and Heroic Ventures. Side note: The Autonocast, a podcast I co-host, recently had Alex Haag, CEO and co-founder of Futurail, on the show. Take a listen. \nNexcade, a London-based startup developing end-to-end automation for freight forwarders, raised $2.5 million in a pre-seed round led by Connect Ventures. MMC Ventures, Entropy Industrial Capital, and Inovia also participated.\nToyota and Metal Mining have struck a deal to work together on the mass production of cathode materials for all-solid-state batteries to be installed in battery electric vehicles.\nTycho AI, an autonomous drone navigation startup, raised $10 million in a Series A round led by FirstMark.\nUtilimarc, a Minneapolis-based fleet analytics and benchmarking company, was acquired by Smith System. The terms were not disclosed.\nNotable reads and other tidbits\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill that gives Uber and Lyft drivers in the state the right to unionize as independent contractors. \nJust last week, we featured DoorDash’s efforts to build its own autonomous delivery robot. But that internal program isn’t stopping the company from outside partnerships. DoorDash and Serve Robotics announced a multi-year partnership that would see them using autonomous robots to make deliveries across the United States.\nLucid delivered a record number of EVs in the third quarter. While it’s still nowhere near the projections it shared back when it was going public, the recent sales report does show progress.\nLyft has locked in another AV partnership — this time with Tensor Auto. The plan, the companies said, is to deploy robotaxis in Europe and North America starting in 2027. Tensor Auto might not sound familiar, but Chinese robotaxi company AutoX might. Tensor Auto’s roots are from AutoX, although the San Jose-based company has told TechCrunch in the past that AutoX’s Chinese operations were fully divested.\nTransportation includes infrastructure like bridges. Climate tech reporter Tim De Chant looked into Allium Engineering, a startup developing paper-thin stainless steel that could change how bridges are built.\nTesla revealed bare-bones versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, which start at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively. These “standard” versions are pretty stripped down. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane provides more detail here. \nA few things jumped out at me. For one, I was surprised this standard version doesn’t include Autopilot. Also, Tesla is really known for innovating, from its manufacturing process and software-first approach to its business model. But this wasn’t an act of innovation or even cleverness. It was merely stripping away — and the end result wasn’t the deep discounts that had been previously touted. Remember, Elon Musk was once pushing a $25,000 vehicle, a program that was later scrapped. \nZero Motorcycles has moved its key operations from California to a new European headquarters in the Netherlands. The company told TechCrunch the move is designed to accelerate growth and sharpen focus on global opportunities.\nOne more thing …\nIf you’re in San Francisco later this month, come say hello. I’ll be at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, which will be held October 27 to October 29 at Moscone West. And there are a few transportation-related talks you won’t want to miss.\nFor instance, TechCrunch will be interviewing Uber chief product officer Sachin Kansal and Nuro co-founder and president Dave Ferguson about the evolving relationship between AI and mobility. The discussion is expected to cover how predictive models and computer vision are improving road safety, why last-mile delivery is an autonomy proving ground, and what it will take to bring AI-driven transportation to scale.\n",

    "body": "\nChris Lehane is one of the best in the business at making bad news disappear. Al Gore’s press secretary during the Clinton years, Airbnb’s chief crisis manager through every regulatory nightmare from here to Brussels – Lehane knows how to spin. Now he’s two years into what might be his most impossible gig yet: as OpenAI’s VP of global policy, his job is to convince the world that OpenAI genuinely gives a damn about democratizing artificial intelligence while the company increasingly behaves like, well, every other tech giant that’s ever claimed to be different.\nI had 20 minutes with him on stage at the Elevate conference in Toronto earlier this week – 20 minutes to get past the talking points and into the real contradictions eating away at OpenAI’s carefully constructed image. It wasn’t easy or entirely successful. Lehane is genuinely good at his job. He’s likable. He sounds reasonable. He admits uncertainty. He even talks about waking up at 3 a.m. worried about whether any of this will actually benefit humanity.\nBut good intentions don’t mean much when your company is subpoenaing critics, draining economically depressed towns of water and electricity, and bringing dead celebrities back to life to assert your market dominance.\nThe company’s Sora problem is really at the root of everything else. The video generation tool launched last week with copyrighted material seemingly baked right into it. It was a bold move for a company already getting sued by the New York Times, the Toronto Star, and half the publishing industry. From a business and marketing standpoint, it was also brilliant. The invite-only app soared to the top of the App Store as people created digital versions of themselves, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman; characters like Pikachu and Cartman of “South Park”; and dead celebrities like Tupac Shakur.\nAsked what drove OpenAI’s decision to launch this newest version of Sora with these characters, Lehane offered that Sora is a “general purpose technology” like the printing press, democratizing creativity for people without talent or resources. Even he – a self-described creative zero – can make videos now, he said on stage.\nWhat he danced around is that OpenAI initially “let” rights holders opt out of having their work used to train Sora, which is not how copyright use typically works. Then, after OpenAI noticed that people really liked using copyrighted images, it “evolved” toward an opt-in model. That’s not iterating. That’s testing how much you can get away with. (By the way, though the Motion Picture Association made some noise last week about legal threats, OpenAI appears to have gotten away with quite a lot.)\nNaturally, the situation brings to mind the aggravation of publishers who accuse OpenAI of training on their work without sharing the financial spoils. When I pressed Lehane about publishers getting cut out of the economics, he invoked fair use, that American legal doctrine that’s supposed to balance creator rights against public access to knowledge. He called it the secret weapon of U.S. tech dominance.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMaybe. But I’d recently interviewed Al Gore – Lehane’s old boss – and realized anyone could simply ask ChatGPT about it instead of reading my piece on TechCrunch. “It’s ‘iterative’,” I said, “but it’s also a replacement.”\nLehane listened and dropped his spiel. “We’re all going to need to figure this out,” he said. “It’s really glib and easy to sit here on stage and say we need to figure out new economic revenue models. But I think we will.” (We’re making it up as we go, is what I heard.)\nThen there’s the infrastructure question nobody wants to answer honestly. OpenAI is already operating a data center campus in Abilene, Texas, and recently broke ground on a massive data center in Lordstown, Ohio, in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank. Lehane has likened the adoption of AI to the advent of electricity – saying those who accessed it last are still playing catch-up – yet OpenAI’s Stargate project is seemingly targeting some of those same economically challenged places to set up facilities with their attendant and massive appetites for water and electricity.\nAsked during our sit-down whether these communities will benefit or merely foot the bill, Lehane went to gigawatts and geopolitics. OpenAI needs about a gigawatt of energy per week, he noted. China brought on 450 gigawatts last year plus 33 nuclear facilities. If democracies want democratic AI, he said, they have to compete. “The optimist in me says this will modernize our energy systems,” he’d said, painting a picture of re-industrialized America with transformed power grids.\nIt was inspiring, but it was not an answer about whether people in Lordstown and Abilene are going to watch their utility bills spike while OpenAI generates videos of The Notorious B.I.G. It’s very worth noting that video generation is the most energy-intensive AI out there.\nThere’s also a human cost, one made clearer the day before our interview, when Zelda Williams logged onto Instagram to beg strangers to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her late father, Robin Williams. “You’re not making art,” she wrote. “You’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings.”\nWhen I asked about how the company reconciles this kind of intimate harm with its mission, Lehane answered by talking about processes, including responsible design, testing frameworks, and government partnerships. “There is no playbook for this stuff, right?”\nLehane showed vulnerability in some moments, saying he recognizes the “enormous responsibilities that come with” all that OpenAI does.\nWhether or not those moments were designed for the audience, I believe him. Indeed, I left Toronto thinking I’d watched a master class in political messaging – Lehane threading an impossible needle while dodging questions about company decisions that, for all I know, he doesn’t even agree with. Then news broke that complicated that already complicated picture.\nNathan Calvin, a lawyer who works on AI policy at a nonprofit advocacy organization, Encode AI, revealed that at the same time I was talking with Lehane in Toronto, OpenAI had sent a sheriff’s deputy to Calvin’s house in Washington, D.C., during dinner to serve him a subpoena. They wanted his private messages with California legislators, college students, and former OpenAI employees.\nCalvin says the move was part of OpenAI’s intimidation tactics around a new piece of AI regulation, California’s SB 53. He says the company weaponized its ongoing legal battle with Elon Musk as a pretext to target critics, implying Encode was secretly funded by Musk. Calvin added that he fought OpenAI’s opposition to California’s SB 53, an AI safety bill, and that when he saw OpenAI claim that it “worked to improve the bill,” he “literally laughed out loud.” In a social media skein, he went on to call Lehane, specifically, the “master of the political dark arts.”\nIn Washington, that might be a compliment. At a company like OpenAI whose mission is “to build AI that benefits all of humanity,” it sounds like an indictment.\nBut what matters much more is that even OpenAI’s own people are conflicted about what they are becoming.\nAs my colleague Max reported last week, a number of current and former employees took to social media after Sora 2 was released, expressing their misgivings. Among them was Boaz Barak, an OpenAI researcher and Harvard professor, who wrote about Sora 2 that it is “technically amazing but it’s premature to congratulate ourselves on avoiding the pitfalls of other social media apps and deepfakes.”\nOn Friday, Josh Achiam – OpenAI’s head of mission alignment – tweeted something even more remarkable about Calvin’s accusation. Prefacing his comments by saying they were “possibly a risk to my whole career,”  Achiam went on to write of OpenAI: “We can’t be doing things that make us into a frightening power instead of a virtuous one. We have a duty to and a mission for all of humanity. The bar to pursue that duty is remarkably high.”\nIt’s worth pausing to think about that. An OpenAI executive publicly questioning whether his company is becoming “a frightening power instead of a virtuous one,” isn’t on a par with a competitor taking shots or a reporter asking questions. This is someone who chose to work at OpenAI, who believes in its mission, and who is now acknowledging a crisis of conscience despite the professional risk.\nIt’s a crystallizing moment, one whose contradictions may only intensify as OpenAI races toward artificial general intelligence. It also has me thinking that the real question isn’t whether Chris Lehane can sell OpenAI’s mission. It’s whether others – including, critically, the other people who work there – still believe it.\n",

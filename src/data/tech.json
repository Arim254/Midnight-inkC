Discord, the popular chat and community platform, filed confidential IPO paperwork with the SEC and has pinned its hopes on a debut in March, sources told Bloomberg. The company hired top-tier tech IPO bankers Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase as its underwriters. Should the tea leaves continue to look positive for this offering, the public could be getting a peek at Discord’s finances next month.\nBut we’ll have to wait and see. Even if investors are gung-ho, it’s not clear yet whether 2026 will become a better market for IPOs. Discord was reportedly in early-stage talks about an IPO back in March of last year. But then came chaos in the U.S. federal government — between the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)-inspired budget cuts and the end-of-year federal shutdown — scaring off IPO hopefuls.\nIf the current stock market rally continues and encourages late-stage startups to go public, Discord’s IPO could be one of the biggest of the year. Discord was last valued at $14.7 billion in a 2021 funding round in which it raised $500 million. \nThe chat app, originally made popular by gamers, now claims more than 200 million monthly active users. The company reportedly walked away from a $10 billion acquisition offer by Microsoft in 2021 to remain independent.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n",

Lux was a seed-stage investor in Anduril, which was last valued at $30.5 billion, and Applied Intuition, an autonomous vehicle startup that secured contracts with the Pentagon and was valued at $15 billion last year.\nLux has also made early bets on AI startups before the industry took off, post-ChatGPT. The firm’s early-stage AI investments include Hugging Face, Runway AI, and MosaicML, the latter of which was acquired by Databricks for $1.3 billion in 2023.  \nIn addition to being early to the defense tech and AI trends, Lux has realized significant exits from its investment in AI drug discovery company Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which went public in 2021, and the sale of Auris Health, a surgical robotics pioneer that sold to Johnson & Johnson for up to $6 billion in 2019.\nThe latest fundraise brings Lux’s assets under management to $7 billion.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n",

In March, Anthropic secured $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation. \nCoatue Management and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new round, per the WSJ, which cited sources familiar with the deal. Anthropic is expected to close its latest financing in the coming weeks, and the total deal amount could change. \nThis round would be separate from the $15 billion Nvidia and Microsoft recently committed to invest in Anthropic, a “circular” deal that would see Anthropic buying $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia’s chips. \nThe fresh capital comes as Anthropic continues to win over developer hearts with Claude Code, its tool designed to automate coding, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI. OpenAI is also in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of up to $830 billion.\nAnthropic declined to comment. \nThis article was updated to reflect that TechCrunch separately confirmed the round.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Fundraising\n\n",

    "body": "\nAfter leading General Catalyst’s seed strategy for years, Niko Bonatsos has departed the firm. Known for backing an IPO-hopeful Discord and the $10 billion startup Mercor, Bonatsos told TechCrunch he intends to launch a new early-stage VC firm alongside “friends.”\nBonatsos is the latest investor to leave General Catalyst, a firm that recently expanded beyond the traditional venture model. Over the last few years, General Catalyst unveiled a wealth management business, a strategy focused on PE-style AI roll-ups, and a Customer Value Fund (CVF), which provides late-stage startups with nondilutive financing secured by recurring revenue.\nOther recent General Catalyst departures include Deep Nishar and Kyle Doherty, who co-led the late-stage ‘Endurance’ strategy, and Adam Valkin, who co-led the early-stage fund alongside Bonatsos and Trevor Oelschig, TechCrunch reported last year.\nUnlike his former colleagues, who declined to comment about their departures, Bonatsos described his exit as a mutual decision, saying that his time at GC was an “awesome experience,” which provided many “learnings.”\nBonatsos said he has yet to choose a name for his new firm or begin fundraising. He declined to specify the size of his team, noting only that the individuals he is considering include founders and investors “at the top of their game.”\nSome of the themes Bonatsos intends to pursue include backing young founders, a trend he claims to have identified several years ago, before it became popular in the industry. Indeed, many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young and include college dropouts like Mercor’s founder, Brendan Foody.\nBonatsos is also interested in investing in founders who are launching consumer businesses, a sector he views as “underappreciated” in a market saturated with enterprise-focused AI startups.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlthough General Catalyst has transitioned into what it calls an “investment and transformation company,” it is continuing to make seed-stage bets. Last year, GC hired Yuri Sagalov, a former YC partner who also founded Wayfinder Ventures, to lead seed investing in the U.S.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

Launched last August, the $2.99 per month streaming service offers ad-free access to library content, at a time when rival streamers are raising their prices.\n“The opportunity for Howdy was — if you just look at what’s going on in the streaming world with streaming services, they’re getting more expensive. They keep raising prices, and they keep adding larger and larger ad loads,” Wood explained at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES. “And so, the part of the market where it actually started — low-cost and no ads — is gone now. There’s no streaming services that address that portion of the market.”\nThe exec also suggested that Roku intends to bring Howdy to a broader market than just Roku customers, saying that while it started on Roku, the company “will take it off-platform as well.”\nAsked to clarify offstage if that meant mobile apps, the web, and elsewhere, Wood told TechCrunch the company has not yet said where, specifically, it plans to bring Howdy, but that “we want to distribute it everywhere.”  That seems to suggest that Howdy could be an app that you one day load on any device, large or small. Wood declined to share subscriber numbers with TechCrunch, but said onstage, “I think if I just look at the market, it’s going to be a big streaming service.” \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOpenAI announced ChatGPT Health on Wednesday, which the company said will offer a dedicated space for users to have conversations with ChatGPT about their health.\nPeople already use ChatGPT to ask about medical issues; OpenAI says that over 230 million people ask health and wellness questions on the platform each week. But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won’t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT. \nIf people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over.\nWithin Health, the AI might reference things you’ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you’re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals.\nChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models.\nThe CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in a blog post that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care.\nWhile the healthcare system has its drawbacks, using AI chatbots for medical advice creates a new slew of challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT operate by predicting the most likely response to prompts, not the most correct answer, since LLMs don’t have a concept of what is true or not. AI models are also prone to hallucinations.\nIn its own terms of service, OpenAI states that it is “not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.” \nThe feature is expected to roll out in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nGoogle has introduced a new way to grab the attention of students who are avid podcast listeners. Now available in Google Classroom, teachers can use a new Gemini-powered tool that generates podcast-style audio lessons, meant to promote deeper comprehension of educational material. \nTo begin, educators simply go to the Gemini tab within Google Classroom. There, they can select different customization options, such as selecting the appropriate grade level, defining topics, and setting clear learning objectives. They can then further personalize the audio experience by choosing the number of speakers or selecting different conversational styles, such as interviews, roundtable discussions, or casual dialogues. \nThis new feature is currently available to users subscribed to Google Workspace Education Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus.\nBy bringing this familiar format into the classroom, teachers can tap into their students’ interests. Research shows that students spend significant time listening to podcasts, with an estimated 35 million Gen Z monthly listeners in the U.S. \nPlus, the popularity of podcasts as educational resources has grown rapidly; many universities now produce their own podcasts, and students increasingly seek out popular educational series on their own time. Podcast-style lessons might also encourage independent learning, since students can replay episodes whenever they need a refresher or missed a class.\nHowever, teachers are still grappling with integrating AI tools into their teaching practices. Many teachers express concerns about students’ increased reliance on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments. \nGoogle urges teachers to practice responsible AI and carefully review and, if necessary, edit all AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and appropriateness for their specific classroom context and local policies. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGemini for Classroom first launched in 2024, and Google has continually added new features since then. Most recently, the company rolled out major updates last June, including features that help teachers brainstorm, develop lesson plans, and customize instructional materials for their students.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nAt CES 2026, AMC debuted clips from its upcoming TV series “The Audacity,” created by Jonathan Glatzer, a TV writer and producer for shows like “Succession,” “Better Call Saul,” and “Bloodline.” The new show will focus on how the men and women of Silicon Valley are shaping the world we live in today.\n“They’re literally laying the cement on the freeway that we’re all driving down with things like AI, data collection, social media, etc. And there couldn’t be any more important group, in my opinion, to be taking a deep-dive look at than the men and women in Silicon Valley who are shaping the lives that we live,” explained Dan McDermott, chief content officer at AMC Networks and president of AMC Studios, speaking at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES.\nAs one of the show’s actors, Billy Magnussen, noted, “Silicon Valley is one of those times in our modern era which is defining humanity. And what better place to make a dark comedy than in that place that develops our society at this point?”\nThe show will also star Sarah Goldberg, Zach Galifianakis, Simon Helberg, and Rob Corddry and will take place in a fictional universe where no real company names are involved, nor will high-profile tech figures make cameos. However, the show may still hit some familiar chords. For instance, Helberg’s character is a maladjusted genius, working on an AI therapy app for teenagers, when he himself is something of a recluse, with a teenage daughter he neglects.\n“There’s loneliness, I think, at the heart of all the characters, and they’re all trying to connect, and they’re trying to connect through technology, which has some pitfalls,” Helberg says.\nTwo new clips from the shows were streamed at the event, but recording was not allowed. In one, an enthusiastic Magnussen pitches Galifianakis when encountering him eating at a restaurant. Galifianakis never responds but cuts him off eventually by stabbing him in the hand with his fork. Another clip showed Helberg completely missing an opportunity to relate to his daughter, and instead using her facial expression of annoyance to train his AI.\nThe show premieres Sunday, April 12 on AMC and AMC+. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The company on Wednesday said it is introducing a new Messages feature that will let users see what their friends are streaming in real time and send requests to start Jams, the app’s collaborative listening feature.\nUsers would first have to navigate to their Settings and turn on the “listening activity” feature in the “Privacy & Social” section. Once that’s done, your listening activity will appear at the top of Messages chats. You can tap a friend’s listening activity to play the track, save it, open the menu, or react with an emoji.\nAs for starting a Jam, Premium users can tap the “Jam” option in the top-right corner to send a request to their friends. If the other user accepts it, they will become the Jam host, and both users would be able to add tracks to a shared queue and listen to music together.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nListening Activity and Request to Jam will roll out to the iOS and Android apps in markets where Messages is available, and will be broadly available in these markets by early February. Listening Activity is available to all users with access to Messages, while Free users can join a Request to Jam session when invited by a Premium user.\nSpotify notes that because both of these new features are available through Messages, they are only available to users 16 and older. \nThe streaming platform launched Messages in August 2025 in a bid to become a more social app. While users have long shared Spotify links to music and podcasts outside the platform, the new messaging capabilities signal a push to keep more interactions within the app as the company looks to increase user retention metrics and attract more paying users.\nMessages on Spotify can only be sent to individual users at the moment, and you can only chat with people you’ve previously shared content with, such as collaborators on a playlist or participants in a Jam or Blend. Messages are encrypted at rest and in transit, but they are not protected by end-to-end encryption. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSkylight may have started as a digital picture frame, but today, the company is more focused on helping families stay organized with shared calendars, lists, meal planning tools, and more.\nAt CES 2026, the company debuted its latest product: the Skylight Calendar 2, which offers a sleeker design than the original 15-inch calendar but smaller than the 27-inch wall-mounted Calendar Max. Like its larger counterpart, the new digital calendar app and family organizer also lets you swap out the frame for different colors to better match your home’s decor.\nThe biggest selling point isn’t the digital screen itself, but the underlying software and AI capabilities. The primary feature — the calendar — is actually a mashup of all your family’s calendars from whatever services you use, whether that’s Google Calendar, iCal, Microsoft, or even your kids’ sports apps, like TeamSnap.\nThe calendar is color-coded to see everyone’s schedules at a glance, and can even import “calendars” that are really just emails with a few key dates or flyers sent home in Junior’s backpack. (The latter is an AI feature where you snap a photo of the paper, and the calendar updates with the new events.)\nImage Credits:Sarah Perez\nThe company is also trying to address other pain points for families, such as managing grocery lists, reminders for appointments, meal planning, and recipe discovery. Of course, it can still display your family photos too, when otherwise not in use.\nThe app is well-designed to be easy to read with simple navigation, pops of color, and imagery that makes it possible for little kids to use. For instance, they can check off their chores by looking for a picture, even if they can’t yet read. \n\nParents also like the ability to plan meals, whether that’s noting simply that Tuesday will be taco night, or going as far as finding a recipe and preparing a shopping list. Skylight’s helpful here too, as it can automatically create the shopping list of ingredients for you or even add it to your Instacart app.\nAnother clever AI feature lets you snap a photo of what’s in your fridge and get a recipe recommendation based on what you have on hand.\nThe need for such a system is clearly resonating with customers. Skylight, a bootstrapped and profitable company from day one, now has 1.3 million-plus families using its digital calendars so far, and likely more to come as the new design ships.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

These tools are coming to the Spotify for Creators app, and Megaphone, the company’s podcast hosting and monetization suite, in April.\nDoubling down on its video strategy in a bid to compete better with YouTube, Spotify is now launching a new API that would let creators use their existing platforms to publish and monetize video podcasts on Spotify. At launch, tools like Acast, Audioboom, Libsyn, Omny, and Podigee have adopted this API, the company said.\nThe new moves come as Spotify’s been looking to new avenues to attract users and build on its streaming subscription revenue. The company said since the launch of the partner program, the consumption of video podcasts on the app has nearly doubled, and that the average Spotify podcast user streams twice as many video shows per month as they did before the program was launched. \nBut that could simply be a result of the streaming service surfacing more video content. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company is also opening a studio for recording podcasts and videos in West Hollywood.

    "body": "\nFord is developing an AI assistant that will debut in the company’s smartphone app, before expanding to its vehicles in 2027, the company announced Wednesday at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. The company also teased a next-generation of its BlueCruise advanced driver assistance system that is both cheaper to make and more capable — ultimately leading to eyes-off driving in 2028.\nWednesday’s announcement was one of the only ones to come from a major automaker at CES, marking a sharp turnaround from the late 2010s when they dominated the show. And it wasn’t made at a flashy keynote event; rather, Ford discussed the news at a speaker session called “Great Minds” that was meant to “explore the intersection of technology and humanity.”\nFord says it digital assistant is hosted by Google Cloud and will be built using off-the-shelf LLMs, and the company is giving it deep access to vehicle-specific information. That means the assistant can answer high-level questions like “how many bags of mulch can my truck bed support?” But it also means owners will be able to ask for granular, real-time information like oil life. \nThe company is rolling the assistant out to its newly revamped Ford app in early 2026. A native, in-vehicle integration will come in 2027, though the company wouldn’t specify which models it’s prioritizing.\nFord didn’t go into great detail about what the in-car experience will look like, but it’s not hard to imagine the possibilities when looking at some of the more tech-forward automakers. \nJust last month, Rivian showed off its own digital assistant sending and receiving text messages, handling complex navigation requests, and changing climate controls. Tesla has integrated Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok in its vehicles, which customers have used to generate on-the-spot sightseeing tours. Some of those capabilities may eclipse what Ford has in mind, but the automaker also has a full year to hammer out the in-car integration.\nThe new BlueCruise system teased on Wednesday is 30% cheaper to build than the current technology, according to Ford. It will debut in 2027 on the first EV to be built on the company’s low-cost “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform, which is expected to be a mid-sized pickup.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFord is promising more with this next-generation BlueCruise system, including eyes-off driving in 2028. But it also claims the system will be capable of handling “point-to-point autonomy,” similar to what Tesla offers with its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. Rivian has also teased a point-to-point system coming later this year. All of these systems require the drivers to be ready to take control of the car at any moment. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

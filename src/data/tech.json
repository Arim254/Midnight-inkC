If the recommendations become legally binding, member states that ignore the rules might face infringement procedures and even financial penalties, the report said. Virkkunen is looking at limiting Chinese vendors’ involvement in fiber network projects amid a push for faster broadband rollout. \nHuawei and ZTE did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe move comes amid a broader effort to limit China’s influence in key infrastructure as EU’s ties fray with the world’s second-largest economy. Last year, Germany’s top security official said that, starting in 2026, the country would prohibit the use of key components from Chinese firms ZTE and Huawei. In addition, Finland reportedly plans to broaden the scope of its ban on the use of Huawei components in 5G networks.\nIn recent years, the U.S. has persuaded European allies like the U.K. and Sweden to restrict or ban Huawei gear over concerns that Beijing could exploit it for cyber-espionage or disrupt critical communications. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

    "body": "\nIsraeli AI agent startup Wonderful has raised $100 million in a Series A round led by Index Ventures, with participation from Insight Partners, IVP, Bessemer, and Vine Ventures. \nThe large round, in a market already crowded with AI agent startups, suggests Wonderful has convinced top tier investors it’s not just another GPT wrapper, but a company building the infrastructure and orchestration that could scale if multi-agent systems take off.  \nThe round brings Wonderful’s total funding to $134 million just four months after the startup came out of stealth with a seed round and a promise to help enterprises deploy customer-facing AI agents across voice, chat, and email in every market and every language. The startup says it tailors the platform to each market it serves, fine-tuning for language, cultural norms, and regulatory environments, and even organizes local teams to manage deployment.  \nThat approach has led to rapid growth for the young startup, which claims its AI agents are already managing tens of thousands of customer requests daily with an 80% resolve rate. Since launching, Wonderful has expanded to Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Greece, Poland, Romania, the Baltics, the Adriatics and the UAE. \nWith its fresh funding, Wonderful intends to launch in Germany, Austria, the Nordics and Portugal in 2025, and plans to expand in the Asia-Pacific region in early 2026. But the company doesn’t intend to stop with customer support agents. \nSince its system plugs deeply into an enterprise customer’s existing software and can be tailored for each market, the startup says it will be able to give agents the capabilities to perform new tasks with minimal extra effort. It is currently exploring areas like employee training, sales enablement, regulatory compliance, internal IT support, and onboarding, the company said. \n“The promise of AI agents is clear, but putting that into practice, and critically, into production, is a huge challenge,” Bar Winkler, CEO and co-founder of Wonderful, said in a statement. “It requires marrying best-in-class technology together with flawless delivery, on the ground with customers. That’s been our approach with Wonderful, and it’s what has driven the accelerated adoption we’ve seen across markets in the last few months.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCustomer-facing AI agents are emerging as the first real beachhead for the technology, and investors were likely attracted by Wonderful’s focus here. These use cases help enterprises cut costs by augmenting or replacing human support staff, and they integrate readily into existing call centre infrastructure. Crucially, they also carry less risk than having an AI make internal decisions autonomously — a use case that most enterprises aren’t ready to adopt at scale yet.  \nIndex Ventures partner Hannah Seal pointed to Wonderful’s ability to “[move] from concept to global scale in less than a year” as a source of confidence for investors. The company’s true edge, she said, is its ability to deploy agents for global enterprises that function across every market and language. \nJeff Horing, co-founder and managing director at Insight Partners, said the adoption Wonderful is seeing across industries shows “just how valuable culturally fluent agents can be.” \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nPeople often think about tech bubbles in apocalyptic terms, but it doesn’t have to be as serious as all that. In economic terms, a bubble is a bet that turned out to be too big, leaving you with more supply than demand.  \nThe upshot: It’s not all or nothing, and even good bets can turn sour if you aren’t careful about how you make them. \nWhat makes the question of the AI bubble so tricky to answer is mismatched timelines between the breakneck pace of AI software development and the slow crawl of constructing and powering a data center. \nBecause these data centers take years to build, a lot will inevitably change between now and when they come online. The supply chain that powers AI services is so complex and fluid that it’s hard to have any clarity on how much supply we’ll need a few years from now. It isn’t simply a matter of how much people will be using AI in 2028, but how they’ll be using it, and whether we’ll have any breakthroughs in energy, semiconductor design, or power transmission in the meantime. \nWhen a bet is this big, there are lots of ways it can go wrong — and AI bets are getting very big indeed.  \nLast week, Reuters reported that an Oracle-linked data center campus in New Mexico has drawn as much as $18 billion in credit from a consortium of 20 banks. Oracle has already contracted $300 billion in cloud services to OpenAI, and the companies have joined with SoftBank to build $500 billion in total AI infrastructure as part of the “Stargate” project. Meta, not to be outdone, has pledged to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. We’ve been tracking all the major commitments here — and the sheer volume has made it hard to keep up. \nAt the same time, there is real uncertainty about how fast demand for AI services will grow.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA McKinsey survey released last week looked at how top firms are employing AI tools. The results were mixed. Almost all the businesses contacted are using AI in some way, yet few are using it on any real scale. AI has allowed companies to cost-cut in specific use cases, but it’s not making a dent on the overall business. In short, most companies are still in “wait and see” mode. If you’re counting on those companies to buy space in your data center, you may be waiting a long time. \nBut even if AI demand is endless, these projects could run into more straightforward infrastructure problems. Last week, Satya Nadella surprised podcast listeners by saying he was more concerned with running out of data center space than running out of chips. (As he put it, “It’s not a supply issue of chips; it’s the fact that I don’t have warm shells to plug into.”) At the same time, whole data centers are sitting idle because they can’t handle the power demands of the latest generation of chips.  \nWhile Nvidia and OpenAI have been moving forward as fast as they possibly can, the electrical grid and built environment are still moving at the same pace they always have. That leaves lots of opportunity for expensive bottlenecks, even if everything else goes right. \nWe get deeper into the idea in this week’s Equity podcast, which you can listen to below. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nCarbon management startup Carbon Direct is buying another carbon credit startup, Pachama, the companies announced today.\nPachama laid off around 20 employees this summer as voluntary carbon markets softened. The company had attracted investments from a range of prominent names, including Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and several celebrity angel investors, including Ellen DeGeneres, Laura Dern, and Serena Williams.\n“The current uncertain and volatile financial, economic, and geopolitical climate, added to the anti-ESG agenda in the U.S., is indeed having an effect on corporate sustainability budgets,” Diego Saez Gil, CEO of Pachama, told Trellis when the layoffs happened. “The impact is especially acute in the voluntary carbon market, which was already in a moment of correction.”\nPachama had raised $88 million, while Carbon Direct had raised $60.8 million, according to PitchBook. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nPachama was focused on nature-based carbon credits, which typically result when forests are either restored or preserved. Carbon Direct, on the other hand, is more of a carbon market advisory and accounting firm, helping companies track and report their carbon footprints and then vet carbon credits to offset them.\nThe carbon markets have been roiled by uncertainty in the last few years, and not all of it has been the result of political whiplash in the U.S. and elsewhere. Voluntary carbon markets have come under fire for falling short of their promises. \nFor example, a major investigation by The Guardian found that more than 90% of one verifier’s credits did not actually result in any carbon reductions. One of the biggest challenges facing nature-based carbon credits is the question of whether forests protected by the purchases were threatened with destruction in the first place.\nAnd while large companies have been dialing back their publicity around ESG measures, many are still interested in sticking to their net-zero promises. Carbon Direct customers include Microsoft, Shopify, American Express, JP Morgan, Alaska Airlines, and BlackRock.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

In addition, the product’s paid nature allows AI companies to support the organization’s nonprofit mission.\nWhile the post doesn’t go so far as to threaten penalties or any sort of legal action for use of its material through scraping, Wikipedia recently noted that AI bots had been scraping its website while trying to appear human. After updating its bot-detection systems, the organization found that its unusually high traffic in May and June had come from AI bots that were trying to “evade detection.” Meanwhile, it said that “human page views” had declined 8% year-over-year.\nNow Wikipedia is laying out its guidelines for AI developers and providers, saying that generative AI developers should provide attribution to give credit to the human contributors whose content it uses to create its outputs.\n“For people to trust information shared on the internet, platforms should make it clear where the information is sourced from and elevate opportunities to visit and participate in those sources,” the post reads. “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.”\nEarlier this year, the organization released its AI strategy for editors, which said it would use AI to help editors with workflows around tedious tasks, automating translation, and other tools that help its editors, not replace them.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoogle announced on Monday that it’s starting to roll out Gemini to the Google TV Streamer, replacing Google Assistant. The tech giant says the change will enable users to use their voice more naturally to access content and more. \nFor example, users can now ask something like, “I like dramas but my wife likes comedies. What’s a movie we can watch together?” when looking for movie recommendations. \nOr, users could quickly catch up on a show they’re returning to by asking something like, “What happened at the end of Outlander last season?” In another example, Google says users can even ask something like “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”\nGoogle says Gemini for TV goes beyond entertainment, as users can ask the AI assistant any other type of question as well, just like they can with Gemini on their phone.\nFor example, users could bring learning to their TV by asking Gemini to “Explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader.” Gemini can also guide users through DIY projects or recipes with YouTube videos, Google says. \nTo access Gemini on the Google TV Streamer, you need to press your remote’s microphone button. \nGoogle says the update is rolling out “over the next few weeks” to users aged 18 and older. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move comes as Google announced back in September that it was introducing Gemini for Google TV to select TCL devices. The company said at the time that later in the year, Gemini would be arriving on the 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models. \nIn addition to the Google TV Streamer, Gemini is also available on the Walmart Onn 4K Pro streaming device.\nMonday’s announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as the change is part of Google’s plans to replace Google Assistant with Gemini across all of its devices and platforms. Plus, the company had announced at CES in January that Gemini would be coming to Google TV this year.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nRad Power Bikes has informed its employees that it will shut down in January if it is unable to find new funding or get acquired, according to an internal staff email viewed by TechCrunch.\nThe company’s leadership is “still fighting to find ways to continue,” and “the cessation of Rad’s operations is not a forgone conclusion,” according to the email, which was sent by Rad Power’s “people team.” Rad Power employees were told there had been a “very promising” option to keep the company alive that “appeared to be likely to close,” but the deal — which was not specified in the email — “did not come to fruition.” \n“Rad is nothing without its people and wants to ensure that all employees are taken care of and provided for to the fullest extent feasible. Executive leaders are hopeful that a viable solution will be found to ensure that Rad team members remain gainfully employed for the foreseeable future. However, to be fully transparent, despite our collective efforts, it is possible that this may not happen, and Rad may be forced to cease operations,” the email reads. GeekWire was first to report the contents of the email.\nSeattle-based Rad Power has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs over the last few years coming out of the pandemic. While the early pandemic days were a boon to micromobility companies like Rad Power, a “sudden drop in consumer demand” left the company saddled with excess inventory, according to the email viewed by TechCrunch. “Rad continues to face significant financial challenges, including in the form of tariffs and the macroeconomic landscape.”\n“At this time, Rad’s leadership is focused on supporting our employees, serving our Rad Riders, and giving Rad the best chance for longevity,” a spokesperson for the company said.\nRad Power is far from the only company in the e-bike or micromobility space to run into trouble recently. A number of others have gone out of business or had to restructure over the last few years, like Cake, VanMoof, Superpedestrian, and Bird.\nDespite the industry turmoil, Rad Power was still considered to make some of the most compelling e-bikes on the market. But faced with escalating financial pressure, the company swapped CEOs earlier this year. It brought in an executive named Kathi Lentzsch who has spent decades turning around underperforming companies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLentzsch and the other executives at Rad Power have spent the last few months exploring “strategic partnerships with other companies that could acquire [Rad Power] or provide funding so the company could keep moving forward,” per the email.\nLast week, the company issued a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification notice to the employees at its Seattle headquarters, which told them that the 64 people working there could be laid off as soon as January 9. But this isn’t a targeted layoff, according to the email — it’s just the only Rad Power office with enough workers to necessitate this kind of mandated warning.\n“In the event the company is forced to close, Rad would be required to cease operations on January 9, 2026, or within 14 days thereafter,” according to the email. “In that case, Rad expects that any cessation of operations will affect all locations and departments, will be permanent in nature, and that all employees will be terminated effective January 9, 2026.”\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nMeta may be about to lose one of its most renowned AI heads: Yann LeCun, a chief AI scientist at the company, is planning to leave the company to build his own startup, the Financial Times reported, citing anonymous sources.\nLeCun, a professor at New York University, senior researcher at Meta, and winner of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award, plans to leave in the coming months, and is already in talks to raise capital for a startup that would focus on continuing his work on world models, the report added.\nA world model is an AI system that develops an internal understanding of its environment so it can simulate cause-and-effect scenarios to predict outcomes. Top labs and startups like Google DeepMind and World Labs are also developing world models.\nLeCun’s departure would come at a pivotal time for Meta, which has of late changed how it approaches AI development in response to concerns that it is being outpaced by rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.\nThe company has reportedly started revamping its AI organization after hiring over 50 engineers and researchers from its competitors to build out a new AI unit, dubbed Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Notably, Meta in June invested $14.3 billion in data-labeling vendor Scale AI and brought on board its CEO Alexandr Wang to run the new division.\nThose decisions, sources told TechCrunch in August, have made things increasingly chaotic at Meta’s AI unit, with new talent expressing frustration with navigating the bureaucracy of a big company, while Meta’s previous generative AI team has seen its scope limited.\nLeCun’s long-term research work at the company under its Fundamental AI Research Lab (FAIR) division has been overshadowed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s decisions to overhaul things after the company’s previous family of AI models, Llama 4, failed to keep up with rival models. Unlike MSL, FAIR is designed to focus on long-term AI research — techniques that may be used five to 10 years from now.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLeCun has been openly skeptical about how AI technology — specifically LLMs — is currently being marketed as the cure for all of humankind’s ails. He even tweeted that AI systems have a long way to go. \n“It seems to me that before ‘urgently figuring out how to control AI systems much smarter than us’ we need to have the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat,” he wrote.\nMeta did not immediately return a request for comment outside regular business hours. \n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy, and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow, she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

The feature allows fans to chat, post, and listen to songs shared within these groups.\nThe feature is currently being tested in Canada on iOS and Android devices.\nUsers can access Fan Groups through the “Find” tab located beneath the search bar at the top of the app. From there, they can explore over 30 different groups dedicated to various musical interests, ranging from indie rock and country to Punjabi and K-pop, according to a company blog post.\nGroup members can create new posts, participate in ongoing chat threads, and share or save recommended songs. Users can also stream music without leaving the conversation or the group — they can simply tap the play button at the top to listen to all the songs added, or navigate to the separate “Music” tab next to “Posts.”\nNotably, artists can join these groups, giving them a new way to connect with fans directly. They can share exclusive content, interact more personally, and build stronger communities with their supporters.\nImage Credits:Amazon Music\nAnyone can set up a new group, and administrators can mute members and delete messages, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nKaltura, a New York-headquartered AI video platform company, is acquiring eSelf.ai, an Israel-based startup behind conversational avatars — AI-generated digital humans that can talk with users — for about $27 million. Kaltura announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf, a platform supporting more than 30 languages and featuring a user-friendly studio for creating, customizing, and deploying photorealistic digital avatars.\nCo-founded in 2023 by CEO Alan Bekker, who previously sold his first startup, Voca, to Snap in 2020 — and CTO Eylon Shoshan, eSelf brings deep technical expertise in speech-to-video generation, low-latency speech recognition, and screen understanding, which allows avatars to see and respond to what’s on a user’s screen. The eSelf co-founders will join Kaltura to oversee the integration of eSelf’s technology into the company, with all current eSelf employees coming on board as well.\nThe two-year-old startup has a small but strong team of around 15 AI experts, Ron Yekutiel, co-founder and CEO of Kaltura, told TechCrunch. He noted that Bekker’s former company specialized in natural language processing, which helps computers understand human speech, and computer vision, saying it was a “very leading company in the area of conversational speech bots. And so he’s an expert [in this field], and that’s what we bought,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura offers a suite of cloud-based software solutions designed for advanced video applications, including a corporate video portal akin to a private YouTube, tools for webinars and virtual events, and integrations that embed video learning into university learning management systems, or platforms that organize online coursework.\nThe Nasdaq-listed company also delivers virtual classroom products and end-to-end TV streaming solutions. Kaltura’s video platform serves over 800 enterprise customers, helping them engage users across sales, marketing, customer care, education, and entertainment. Its clients include tech giants like Amazon, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Adobe, and IBM, as well as leading banks, insurance companies, consulting firms, pharmaceutical companies, and universities in the U.S.\nKaltura plans to integrate eSelf.ai’s virtual agent technology across its video offerings; the integration aims to enable agents that can listen, speak, and interpret user screens in real time.\n“This acquisition was so strategic. We were actively evaluating multiple companies to find the right fit. We determined that they [eSelf] were best-in-class for real-time, synchronous conversation — not just video-on-demand lip-syncing — and that they had an impressive speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology stack,” Yekutiel said in an interview with TechCrunch. “Beyond the technology, there was also a strong cultural and geographic alignment, which was critical for us.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhy a video company is betting on conversational avatars\nFor the past two decades, businesses have mostly used video for streaming, uploading, and managing content. But that’s changing fast. Thanks to AI, videos can now be generated instantly — hyper-personalized and contextual — giving every viewer their own custom experience, tailored exactly to what they need in that moment, Yekutiel explained.\n“We started with video, then moved to personalized video, and now, with eSelf’s technology, we’re adding human-like capabilities — faces, eyes, mouths, ears — to make our AI agents conversational and expressive,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura is evolving from a video platform into a video-based customer and employee experience provider, where video serves as the interface. Unlike most avatar companies that offer only a “face,” it delivers the full workflow — avatar, intelligence, and enterprise-connected knowledge. The focus isn’t just streaming video; it’s driving measurable business results and ROI, the CEO added.\nThe company plans to launch standalone, embeddable agents for uses including sales, marketing, customer support, and training. Target sectors include education, media and telecom, e-commerce, financial services, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.\nAsked about media reports saying Kaltura was exploring a sale or merger at a $400 million to $500 million valuation, Yekutiel told TechCrunch that Kaltura has explored opportunities with a range of companies, including potential “acquisitions, mergers with similarly sized firms, and connections with some larger players.” But it never got close to a transaction like the ones being reported, he said. He also pointed to Kaltura’s recent acquisitions, including its fourth company, as evidence of the company’s continued commitment to its current strategy.\nThis marks Kaltura’s fourth acquisition to date. The company acquired cloud TV solution Tvinci in 2014, followed by Rapt Media in 2018, and video conferencing platform Newrow in 2020. eSelf’s most recent funding round was its $4.5 million announced in December 2024. \nKaltura, which went public in 2021, reports around $180 million in revenue, is profitable on an adjusted EBITDA and cash flow basis, and has about 600 employees.\n",

    "body": "\nVenmo on Monday introduced a new rewards program, Venmo Stash, offering cash back to customers who transact with their favorite brands on the payments app and engage with Venmo’s products. \nWhile cashback rewards are a common incentive for credit cards, Venmo’s rewards — which can be up to 5% — are returned to Venmo’s Mastercard Debit Card.\nThe program is designed to incentivize continued use of Venmo’s service by bringing more funds into the ecosystem, the company explains. \nHowever, this program also represents a new way that today’s brands are attempting to reach younger users, many of whom have shown a preference for debit cards over credit cards.\nOne 2024 study cited by eMarketer indicated that only 39% of Gen Z users reported frequent credit card use, compared with 51% for older generations. Another Morning Consult survey for Cash App Afterpay from earlier this year noted that 63% of Gen Z users said they favored debit cards over other payment methods.\nAs a result, payment providers and retailers are looking to accommodate younger consumers by rolling out more debit rewards and by offering alternatives at checkout — like the use of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services such as Affirm, PayPal Pay Later, or Klarna.\nIn Venmo’s case, the program is designed to offer larger rewards as customers interact more with Venmo products. This keeps them invested in the Venmo ecosystem, the company believes. \nIt also competes with other cashback incentives offered by Venmo’s rivals, like Cash App’s offers, which are doled out to its own Cash App debit card customers.\nScreenshotImage Credits:Venmo\nInitially, customers earn 1% cash back for their Venmo Debit Mastercard when they spend their Venmo balance. Rewards grow to 2% when customers turn on auto reloads to keep their balance replenished automatically. And customers are able to earn 5% cash back when they receive Direct Deposits on Venmo each month. \nHowever, instead of offering a certain percentage back by spending category, like groceries, gas, or dining, Venmo’s program has customers pick from curated bundles of their favorite brands. For instance, you could pick a group of brands that includes McDonald’s, TikTok Shop, Uber, and Uber Eats, or one that offers Amazon, DoorDash, Domino’s, and Walgreens. \nThe PayPal-owned company says that next year Venmo Stash will expand to offer customers rewards when they pay with Venmo at merchants within its nationwide network.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nLovable, the Stockholm-based AI coding platform, is closing in on 8 million users, CEO Anton Osika told this editor during a sit-down on Monday, a major jump from the 2.3 million active users number the company shared in July. Osika said the company — which was founded almost exactly one year ago — is also seeing “100,000 new products built on Lovable every single day.”\nThe metrics suggest rapid growth of the startup, which has raised $228 million in total funding to date, including a $200 million round this summer that valued the company at $1.8 billion. Rumors have swirled in recent weeks — potentially sparked by its own investors — that new backers want to invest at a $5 billion valuation, though Osika said the company isn’t capital constrained and declined to discuss fundraising plans.\nSpeaking to me onstage at the Web Summit event in Lisbon, Osika notably didn’t mention another number: Lovable’s current annual recurring revenue. The company, which uses a mix of free and paid tiers, hit $100 million in ARR this June, a milestone it shared publicly. But questions have emerged since about whether the vibe coding boom is sustainable.\nResearch from Barclays this summer, along with Google Trends data, showed that traffic to some of the buzziest services, including Lovable and Vercel’s v0, had declined after peaking earlier this year. (Traffic to Lovable was down 40% as of September, according to the Barclays analysts.) “This waning traffic begs the question on whether app/site vibecoding has peaked out already or has just had a bit of a lull before interest ramps up,” they reportedly wrote in a note to investors.\nStill, Osika said retention remains strong, citing more than 100% net dollar retention — meaning users spend more over time. He also said the company has “just passed” the 100-employee mark and is now importing leadership talent from San Francisco to bolster its Stockholm headquarters.\nLovable emerged from GPT Engineer, an open source tool Osika built that went viral among developers. But he says he quickly realized the bigger opportunity lay with the 99% of people who don’t know how to code. “I woke up a few days after building GPT Engineer and I realized, look, we’re going to reimagine how you build software,” Osika said. “I biked to my co-founder’s place, and I said, I have this great idea. I woke him up.”\nThe platform has attracted an eclectic user base. More than half of Fortune 500 companies are using Lovable to “supercharge creativity,” according to Osika. At the same time, he said, an 11-year-old in Lisbon built a Facebook clone for his school, while a Swedish duo is making $700,000 annually from a startup they launched seven months ago on the platform. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“What I hear from people trying Lovable is, ‘It just works,’” Osika said, crediting what he described as Swedish design sensibility.\nSecurity remains a thornier issue for the vibe coding sector. When I raised a recent incident in which an app built with vibe coding tools leaked 72,000 images into the wild, including GPS data and user IDs, Osika acknowledged the problem. \n“The part of the engineering organization where we’re moving the quickest on hiring is security engineers,” he said, adding that his goal is to make building with Lovable “more secure than building with just human-written code.” In fact, he said, before users can deploy, Lovable now runs multiple security checks, though the platform still requires users building sensitive applications — banking apps, for instance — to hire security experts, just as they would with traditional development.\nOsika was similarly matter-of-fact when I asked about competition from OpenAI and Anthropic, the AI giants whose models power Lovable but that have also released their own coding agents. He sees the market as big enough for multiple winners. “If we can unlock more human creativity and human agency  . . . and just driving the change so that anyone can create if they have good ideas, [and] build businesses on top of that, that should be celebrated, regardless of whoever does that.”\nIt’s a decidedly collegial stance in an industry not known for it. (Even Osika has engaged in some light social media sparring with Amjad Masad of competitor Replit.) But he said his focus right now is on building “the most intuitive experience for humans” rather than obsessing over rivals.\nOsika described Lovable’s mission as building “the last piece of software” — a platform where everything a product organization needs, from understanding users to deploying mission-critical features, can be done through a simple interface. \n“Demo, don’t memo,” a popular phrase among product leaders, captures how companies now use Lovable, he said. Employees can now quickly prototype ideas rather than writing long presentations, then test them with early users before committing resources.\nFor all the hypergrowth and investor attention, Osika — dressed simply in a beige T-shirt and matching button-down, floppy hair framing his face — appeared very much at ease. The 30-something former particle physicist, who was the first employee at AI company Sana Labs before founding Lovable, has gone from open source developer to venture-backed founder to must-have conference guest in rapid succession. Yet he seemed more interested in discussing European work culture than dwelling on his company’s trajectory or the attention suddenly being showered on him.\n“What I care about is that everyone who’s at the company, they’re mission driven, they really care about what they’re doing and how we as a team succeed,” he said, pushing back against Silicon Valley’s intensifying hustle culture. “The best people in my team today, most of them, they have kids, and they really, really care about what we’re doing. They’re not working 12 hours, six days a week.”\nThough he added: “Although it’s a startup, so they’re probably working more than most jobs.”\n",

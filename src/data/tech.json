At AWS’s recent re:Invent event, Amazon hammered home its commitment to AI for enterprise use, so it makes sense that the company is spinning out a new team from AWS leadership.\n“With our Nova 2 models just launched at re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,” Jassy wrote.\nAmazon’s increasing emphasis on AI comes at a time when the company is eager to strengthen its foothold in the AI race, perhaps more through investments than its own innovations. Last month, AWS announced a $50 billion investment in the U.S. government’s AI infrastructure. Amazon is also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, and has already invested $8 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

Put another way, the agency wants to know why some people are paying substantially more for their organic granola than others.\nThe issue came to light after a study revealed that shoppers are seeing fairly different prices for identical groceries from the same stores — up to 23% higher prices in some cases. Instacart says these price tests were randomized, not tied to an algorithm that targets customers based on their browsing history. But when people are already anxious about affording eggs, that distinction probably doesn’t mean much.\nDynamic pricing isn’t new or necessarily nefarious. Harvard Business School will tell you it’s how digital platforms stay competitive. Airlines use it, hotels use it, Uber famously uses it. Companies argue that it helps balance supply and demand, maximizes profitability, and creates win-win scenarios.\nBut there’s a difference between paying surge pricing for a ride home from the bar and paying extra for groceries (food isn’t optional). So while the investigation doesn’t prove wrongdoing, it’s hardly shocking that the FTC — which has investigated data-driven pricing strategies by other companies — is reportedly asking questions. In an economy where everyone’s feeling squeezed, AI-driven price testing of kitchen essentials was bound to attract attention.\nFor its part, Instacart says the market misunderstands this particular initiative. “Much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,” a spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch. “First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing – prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores.” \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n",

The private astronaut and founder of the Shift4 payments processing platform will now be in charge of an agency that faces great uncertainty under President Trump.\nIsaacman’s confirmation comes a little over a year after Trump nominated him. It was a volatile year for Isaacman, though, as Trump pulled his nomination in June after becoming concerned about the billionaire’s “prior associations.” (Isaacman had previously donated to Democrats, something Trump was reportedly aware of when he first nominated the entrepreneur.)\nThat led to months of sniping between Trump’s camp and people more closely aligned with Isaacman, like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who publicly attacked the credibility of acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy. Trump ultimately flipped in November and re-nominated Isaacman. \nThe billionaire will now oversee a trimmed-down space agency that Trump has tasked with returning to the moon. SpaceX has a contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface, though Duffy had threatened to revoke that contract, and encouraged Jeff Bezos’ rival company Blue Origin to try to beat Musk’s effort.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Space\n",

    "body": "\nIn a new experiment, Meta is limiting the number of links users can post on Facebook, unless they have a paid Meta Verified subscription.\nOver the last week, several users have spotted Meta’s test, which impacts link posting. Social media strategist Matt Navarra noted that users part of the test can only post two links unless they pay for a Meta Verified subscription, which starts from $14.99 per month.\nAccording to the screenshot posted by Navarra, users can still post affiliate links, comments, and links to Meta platform posts, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nThe company confirmed the test to TechCrunch and said it impacts those people using professional mode and Facebook Pages. Professional mode lets you convert your personal profile into a creator profile while making your content eligible for discovery by a wider audience.\n“This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. \nThis would directly impact creators and brands posting links from their blogs or other platforms to reach a wider audience.\nThe company said it is trying to learn how it can add more value to Meta Verified subscribers, and this test is one such experiment to enhance that paid plan. The company added that, at the moment, publishers are not included in this test. It also said that users can still post links in comments, and they are not impacted by the limit.\nIn its transparency report for Q3, Meta said that more than 98% views on the feed in the U.S. come from the posts that don’t have any links. It is not clear if this signal pushed the company to experiment with limits on link sharing, however. The company said that the majority of the 1.9% of views of posts with links came from a page they followed. Linked posts shared by friends and groups were minimal.\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe same report noted that YouTube and TikTok, along with GoFundMe, were the top domains amid the links posted. With the new link posting limit test, creators and brands would be forced to post content from other Meta platforms if they reached their limit, or stop posting altogether if they didn’t want to pay for a subscription. \nAs AI has taken over the internet, there is an ever-raging debate about the link-based web. AI summary and search have impacted the publishing industry negatively. In the past few years, social networks like X have toyed with demoting linked posts to encourage users to post content on the platforms natively.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

The program was part of the company’s metaverse push — the idea behind the program was to create a “new generation of hardware” that would give VR users their pick of devices when it came to engaging with Meta’s digital worlds.\n“We have paused the program to focus on building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’re committed to this for the long term and will revisit opportunities for third-party device partnerships as the category evolves.”\nThe news was originally reported by Road to VR.\nLast April, the tech giant announced that it would be opening up Meta Horizon OS to third-party headset makers. At the time, the company said that Asus, Microsoft’s Xbox, and Lenovo, were all working on creating new hardware that would run the company’s software. “As we’ve seen with the PC and smartphone industries, consumers are best served by a broad hardware ecosystem producing both general-purpose computing devices and more specialized products, all running on a common platform,” the company said at the time.\nBetween the announcement of the partner program and now, there haven’t been a whole lot of updates about it. In September, at the company’s Connect event, a Meta spokesperson said that Meta was still working with its business partners to push Horizon OS into more devices. \nHorizon OS was designed to deliver “mixed reality experiences,” and to communicate “social presence” through technologies like hand, body, eye, and face tracking. It launched in the days when Mark Zuckerberg still maintained that the metaverse was the “future” of his company. \nUnfortunately for Horizon and the coders who work on it, Meta and its top executive have seemed less and less interested in the metaverse in recent times, as AI becomes a larger focus for the company. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the metaverse group within Reality Labs, Meta’s unit focused on VR and AR hardware, was facing potential budgetary cuts as high as 30%. The company subsequently confirmed that it was planning on “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables given the momentum there.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nLuma, the a16z-backed AI video and 3D model company, released a new model called Ray3 Modify that allows users to modify existing footage by providing character reference images that preserve the performance of the original footage. Users can also provide a start and an end frame to guide the model to generate transitional footage.\nThe company said Thursday the Ray3 Modify model solves the problems of preserving human performance while editing or generating effects using AI for creative studios. The startup said the model follows the input footage better, allowing studios to use human actors for creative or brand footage. Luma mentioned the new model retains the actor’s original motion, timing, eye line, and emotional delivery while transforming the scene.\nWith Ray3 Modify, users can provide a character reference for transformation to the original footage and convert the human actor’s appearance into that character. This reference also allows creators to retain information like costumes, likeness, and identity across the shoot.\nWhat’s more, users can also provide start and end reference frames to create a video using the new Ray3 Modify model. This is helpful for creators in directing transitions or controlling character movements or behaviour while maintaining continuity between scenes. \n\n\n\n“Generative video models are incredibly expressive but also hard to control. Today, we are excited to introduce Ray3 Modify that blends the real-world with the expressivity of AI while giving full control to creatives. This means creative teams can capture performances with a camera and then immediately modify them to be in any location imaginable, change costumes, or even go back and reshoot the scene with AI, without recreating the physical shoot,” Amit Jain, co-founder and CEO of Luma AI, said in a statement. \nLuma said the new model is available to users through the company’s Dream Machine platform. The company, which competes with the likes of Runway and Kling, released video modification capabilities in June 2025.\nThe model release comes on the back of a fresh $900 million funding round, led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, for the startup announced in November. Existing investors like a16z, Amplify Partners, and Matrix Partners also participated in the round. The startup is also planning to build a 2GW AI cluster in Saudi Arabia along with Humain. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nElectric bike company Rad Power Bikes filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday, weeks after it warned employees that it could shut down without new funding.\nThe company will continue to operate while the bankruptcy case proceeds, and it’s looking to sell the business within 45-60 days, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n“This step allows us to keep operating in the ordinary course of business while we pursue the best possible outcome for the people who rely on Rad every day,” they said in a statement. “Our goal is to keep the company intact and preserve the relationships we have built with riders, vendors, suppliers, and partners.”\nRad Power is the latest in a series of e-bike companies from around the world to go through bankruptcy after pandemic-era excitement for the category wore off. Some of those companies have re-emerged, though, with VanMoof and Cake finding new owners during their respective court-led restructuring processes.\nRad itself had told employees in November that there had been a “very promising” option to keep the company afloat that was “likely to close,” but the deal fell apart. The company has not shared more details about that potential deal. \nWeeks later, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a warning that older Rad Power batteries posed “a risk of serious injury and death” after receiving 31 reports of fires. Rad Power said it “strongly disagrees” with the CPSC’s characterizations.\nRad’s tough November came at the end of a fairly tumultuous few years for the company. It has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs and swapped CEOs earlier this year, bringing in an executive with decades of experience turning around underperforming companies. That new CEO, Kathi Lentzsch, said Rad was shifting away from the direct-to-consumer model that had helped fuel its rise and toward a retail-focused approach.\n“This shift creates new opportunities to reach more riders, strengthen customer relationships, and evolve the brand in meaningful ways,” she said in a statement at the time. “[I]t’s an incredible time to come on board.” \nThe company said it entered the bankruptcy process with $32 million in assets and $73 million in liabilities. More than $8 million of its debt was owed to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency for unpaid tariffs. (The company has listed this claim as “disputed” in the bankruptcy paperwork.)\nIt’s not clear how much that contributed to Rad’s slide into bankruptcy. But it wouldn’t be the first time that Donald Trump’s tariffs helped push a micromobility company over the edge. During his first term, Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports helped take the remaining wind out of electric skateboard company Boosted’s sails.

    "body": "\nSwedish vibe coding startup Lovable has more than tripled its valuation in just five months.\nStockholm-based Lovable on Thursday said it had raised $330 million in a Series B funding round that was led by CapitalG and Menlo Ventures, at a $6.6 billion valuation. Khosla Ventures, Salesforce Ventures and Databricks Ventures also participated, as did other investors.\nThis raise comes mere months after Lovable raised a $200 million Series A round that valued the company at $1.8 billion in July.\nOne of the quickest to capitalize on the AI boom, Lovable has built a “vibe-coding” tool that lets people use text prompts to write code and build complete apps. The company launched in 2024, and has grown blazing fast: it reached the vaunted $100 million ARR milestone within eight months, and just four months later, doubled that to surpass $200 million in annual recurring revenue. \nThe company counts major software names like Klarna, Uber and Zendesk as customers, and claims that more than 100,000 new projects are built on its platform every day, and more than 25 million projects were created in its first year. \nLovable said it would use the new funding for building deeper integrations with third-party apps, expanding its features for enterprise use-cases, and flesh out its platform with the infrastructure needed — like databases, payments and hosting — to build full-fledged applications and services.\nLovable co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said on stage at this year’s Slush conference in Helsinki, Finland that he credits the company’s ability to scale to his decision to ignore calls from investors to relocate the company to Silicon Valley.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said on stage at the November conference. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘Look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country.’ There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”\nIn November, the company was called out for not paying VAT, a tax that applies to most goods and services in the European Union (EU). Osika confirmed that this was true in a LinkedIn post, saying that the company would remedy the situation, and shut down comments saying taxes like this are why the EU isn’t a good home for high-growth startups.\nVibe coding continues to be a hot area of investing for VCs. Cursor, another vibe coding darling, raised $2.5 billion in November at a $29.3 billion valuation. Like Lovable, this was also the company’s second funding round of the year, seeing its valuation double between June and November.\nTechCrunch reached out to Lovable for any additional information.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAmazon is adding a new feature to Alexa+ that adds a conversational AI to Ring doorbells, letting users manage deliveries, turn down sales folks, and let family or friends leave a message when they are not around.\nCalled Greetings, the feature helps Ring determine who is visiting your house based on their apparel, actions, and what they are holding, and responds accordingly. For example, if the system sees a person in a delivery uniform dropping off a package, it will respond based on your instructions. \nThe feature adds settings that let you specify where delivery people can leave packages, and direct them towards water or snacks you might have kept out. If a delivery person needs a signature, Alexa can also ask them when they might return, and pass that message to the user.\nIt can also handle sales reps or service vendors. You can set an instruction such as “If someone comes to the door trying to sell something, politely let them know we’re not interested.” \nAnd if you’re busy or not home, Alexa can greet friends or family when they visit, and ask them to leave a message for you.\nIt goes without saying that the tech presents the risk of misidentifying people and responding inappropriately — if, for example, a friend works in logistics and comes to see you after work in their delivery uniform, Ring may, via Alexa, ask them to leave the package somewhere instead of letting them leave a message.\nThe new feature follows a controversial facial recognition feature for Ring called “Familiar Faces” that lets you create a catalog of the faces of up to 50 people who visit you regularly. Once labeled, these people will be named in the Ring app’s timeline and notifications when they visit. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAmazon says Greetings uses Ring’s video descriptions to determine who the main subject in front of the camera is for generating responses, and it doesn’t identify who the person is.\nThe feature is compatible with Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd Gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd Gen) and is available to users on the Ring Premium Plan who have enabled video descriptions.

The company said it “immediately” contained the breach working together with the NHS, and hired a cybersecurity firm to investigate “the nature and extent of the incident.”\n“There was minimal impact on the company’s services and the company’s front-line clinical services remain unaffected and operational,” read the filing.\nAt this point, the specific nature of the breach is not known, nor whether any patients’ medical information was stolen. \nHowever, earlier this week, a ransomware group called DevMan took credit for the breach. In a post on its dark web site, which TechCrunch has seen, the hackers listed the company on December 14 and claimed to have stolen 300 gigabytes of data from the company.\nDXS said it also notified law enforcement and regulators, including the UK’s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office, or ICO, about the cyberattack.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about the breach at DXS International?

As such, the company’s software touches patient records and data. The company also says that in some cases, its solutions are hosted on the NHS’ Health and Social Care Network (HSCN), which is a system for healthcare organizations across the U.K. to access and share information. \nGenerally speaking, the NHS does not store patient’s medical data in a centralized system.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, Cisco announced hackers are exploiting a critical vulnerability in some of its most popular products that allows the full takeover of affected devices. Worse, there are no patches available at this time.\nIn a security advisory, Cisco said it discovered a hacking campaign on December 10 targeting Cisco AsyncOS software, and in particular the physical and virtual appliances Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email, and Web Manager. The advisory said affected devices have a feature called “Spam Quarantine” enabled and are reachable from the internet. \nCisco noted that this feature is not enabled by default and does not need to be exposed to the internet, which may be good news. Michael Taggart, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health Sciences, told TechCrunch that “the requirement of an internet-facing management interface and certain features being enabled will limit the attack surface for this vulnerability.”\nHowever, Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who tracks hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that this appears to be a particularly problematic hacking campaign since a lot of big organizations use the affected products, there are no patches available, and it’s unclear how long the hackers had backdoors in the affected systems. \nAt this point Cisco is not saying how many customers are affected.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, Cisco spokesperson Meredith Corley did not answer a series of questions, and instead said that the company “is actively investigating the issue and developing a permanent remediation.”\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this hacking campaign? Such as what companies were targeted? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nThe solution Cisco is suggesting to customers right now is essentially to wipe and rebuild the affected products’ software, as there is no patch available. \n“​​In case of confirmed compromise, rebuilding the appliances is, currently, the only viable option to eradicate the threat actors persistence mechanism from the appliance,” the company wrote. \nThe hackers behind the campaign are linked to China and other known Chinese government hacking groups, according to Cisco Talos, the company’s threat intelligence research team, which published a blog post about the hacking campaign. \nThe researchers wrote that the hackers are taking advantage of the vulnerability, which at this point is a zero-day, to install persistent backdoors, and that the campaign has been ongoing “since at least late November 2025.”\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nApple announced it will allow alternative app stores in Japan and will permit developers to process payments for digital goods and services outside of its own in-app purchase system in iOS. The iPhone maker is not making these changes because it wants to be more open; it’s being forced — in this case, to comply with the country’s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which is now going into effect.\nWith this update, Apple’s App Store revenues are being impacted in another major market due to anticompetition laws and regulations. The company already has to comply with Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which previously required the tech giant to allow for alternative app stores and other changes. \nIn the U.S., Apple has been strong-armed into changing its in-payments system by way of the courts, after a lawsuit from Fortnite maker, Epic Games. Though it was not declared a monopoly, the court decided Apple needed to give developers the right to process payments outside of its system if they chose. (The specifics around that order are still being worked out after an appeal partially reversed an earlier ruling.)\nAs usual, in its announcement about the changes in Japan, Apple warned that alternative app marketplaces and payments open up “new avenues for malware, fraud, scams, and privacy and security risks.” To mitigate those risks, the company said it worked with Japanese regulators to require an authorization process for app marketplaces (“Notarization”), which it says is designed to protect children specifically from inappropriate content and scams. \nThe fact that Apple has come up with a process to dial back the risk for alternative app stores indicates there has always been a technical solution at hand to balance the needs for both openness and security.\nAs in the EU, Apple has come up with a complex fee structure to ensure it doesn’t lose much in the form of App Store revenue, while seemingly complying with the letter of the law.\nAPPLE\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, of course, was not silent on this matter, saying Fortnite will still not return to iOS in Japan because Apple is charging a 21% fee on third-party in-app purchases.\nIn a post on X, he wrote, “Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan. Apple chose poorly. Again.”\n\nSadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised. Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people… pic.twitter.com/7hu5eGMQX6— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) December 18, 2025\n\nHe also pointed out the difference between Apple and other game store providers, like Microsoft, by asking, “Can you imagine the gamer and regulator uproar that would ensue if Microsoft required all games from Steam and Epic Games Store to call its commerce surveillance API and report all transactions back to Microsoft?”\n“That’s what Apple just announced in Japan,” he added. \nApple noted that developers will need to agree to the latest update to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, which includes the new options for Japan, by March 17, 2026. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nMultiple reports suggest that live sports viewing has declined for certain sports, especially among Gen Z. To solve this, leagues and broadcasters are trying to make sports more engaging for fans with different kinds of viewing experiences, stats, and analysis.\nOne way to do this is using volumetric video generation that lets users view the play from various angles, giving an inside-the-video-game experience. The core technology uses numerous cameras to capture the footage in 3D for everyone to look at it from various viewpoints. Canada-based Peripheral Labs wants to make this technology affordable for leagues and teams to so it can reach more broadcasters and fans.\nPeripheral Labs was founded by Kelvin Cui and Mustafa Khan in 2024. Both have worked on driverless cars for the University of Toronto’s team, winning several trophies. Khan has worked as a researcher at Huawei, and Cui has experience working on chassis systems as a software engineer at Tesla.\n“Both Mustafa and I are huge sports fans. He has been a massive Arsenal fan, and I grew up watching the Vancouver Canucks since I was seven. When Mustafa showed me his research about 3D reconstruction, my brain said it would be cool to watch hockey like this [in a free-flowing, multi-angle way]. This is how we started on Peripheral Labs,” Cui said in a call with TechCrunch. \n\n\n\nThe company said the idea of volumetric generation isn’t new. But with the new AI models and advances in computer vision, its founders are confident the technology is ready for the the masses.\nThe duo is using their experience with self-driving cars to apply concepts of robotics perception and 3D vision for the 3D reconstruction of video in sports. This system can reduce the camera requirement from over 100 to as few as 32, helping decrease cost and operational overhead, according Cui and Khan. The startup aims to keep the hardware cost as minimal as possible for teams and broadcasters and sign multi-year contracts for its platform.\nThe software platform will bring biomechanical data of players and stats for teams and leagues using its own sensor stack, which is similar to the sensors on self-driving cars that capture the scene with depth. It will enable new ways to control the viewing of the play for broadcasters and fans using photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology. For instance, if fans wanted to track only the player with the ball, they could do that. They can also freeze a moment in-game to see different angles for a foul or a critical moment in play.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“While we work with off-the-shelf cameras, the way we package it with our experience in robotics and ML is what gives us an edge both in terms of platforms and also scaling from small practice enclosures to big soccer and football stadiums,” Cui said.\nOn the software side, the platform said it can observe different joints, including finger movements of players, to measure flexion. For instance, in a video above of two people playing football (soccer), the system measures flexion of knees and ankles. This could give coaches more ideas about body positioning and the flexibility of a player, and help them improve.\nThe startup has raised a $3.6 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Daybreak Capital, Entrepreneurs First, and Transpose Platform.\nJoe Ros, a partner at Entrepreneur First, noted the fund was surprised by how big the following founders and their autonomous driving team at University of Toronto were. He noted investors are often hesitant to invest in sports-related startups, but Perpheral Labs is also an entertainment play.\n“Their ultimate viewer is the consumer, and their demand for sports content is evergreen, not cyclical. With Peripheral, the new standard for that consumption will be immersive, volumetric video. And the work they’re doing now in sports will give them the data, tech, and deployment moat to be the only person in the market able to enable this,” he told TechCrunch over email.\nPeripheral Labs said the startup was selective about the VCs they were bringing in, who could help in different areas like product development and go-to-market advice. The company has 10 engineers on its staff and aims to increase headcount with a focus on platform and hardware development to reduce costs for the company, decrease the latency of the system, and also increase the resolution of 3D reconstruction.\nThe startup hasn’t made any public announcements about the partners it is working with, but said it is in conversation with several teams and leagues in North America. The company competes with other startups like Arcturus Studios in the volumetric capture for sports. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAnother day, another nine-figure round for a nuclear startup.\nRadiant Nuclear said today that it has raised more than $300 million, just one day after Last Energy said it had raised $100 million. Three weeks ago, X-energy raised $700 million, and in August, Aalo Atomics raised $100 million. Heck, Radiant itself raised $165 million just six months ago.\nGiven the string of investments, it seems reasonable to ask whether the nuclear world is in a bubble. Investment in the technology has tracked closely with the data center boom. AI requires tremendous amounts of electricity, and tech companies and data center developers have been rushing to secure supplies from sources ranging from nuclear fission to supersonic jet engines.\nAs long as tech companies’ power demands continue to grow, interest in nuclear is likely to remain strong. But there might be a winnowing of the field in the next year or two if startups don’t deliver on their promises, many of which revolve around starting their first reactor next year.\nSome startups might be able to buy some time after that. First-of-a-kind reactors can be built by hand, but many nuclear startups are predicated on the idea that mass manufacturing will make fission cost-competitive. They might succeed at reaching criticality but stumble when they try to replicate their designs.\nNone of this is to say that Radiant will fall into that category; it may very well succeed. Rather, the company just happens to be the latest in a long list of nuclear startups that have announced eye-popping fundraises in the last few months. Anytime a market gets that frothy, the B-word is bound to pop up.\nThe new round was led by Draper Associates and Boost VC with participation from Ark Venture Fund, Chevron Technology Ventures, Friends & Family Capital, Founders Fund, and others. It values Radiant at more than $1.8 billion. Previous investors include Andreessen Horowitz, DCVC, Giant Ventures, and Union Square Ventures.\nRadiant is developing a microreactor capable of generating 1 megawatt of electricity that can be delivered via semi. It will be cooled by helium and will have enough TRISO fuel — carbon and ceramic-coated beads of graphite and uranium that are designed to be more resistant to meltdowns — to last five years between refueling. \nThe startup is aiming to replace diesel generators at commercial and military sites. Customers will be able to buy the units outright or subscribe to a power-purchase agreement. When the reactor’s 20-year lifetime is up, the company will haul it away.\nLike many nuclear startups, Radiant is targeting data centers as some of its first customers. The company signed a deal with data center developer Equinix in August to supply 20 of its reactors.\nFirst, Radiant is building a demonstration reactor at the Idaho National Lab, which it hopes to begin testing in the summer of 2026. Many nuclear startups are on a similar timeline, one set by the Trump administration’s goal of three reactors achieving criticality — the moment when a nuclear reaction is self-sustaining — by July 4, 2026. \nRadiant is one of 11 companies selected for that program, which doesn’t provide government grants or loans but instead speeds approval timelines.\nCorrection 1:20 pm ET: Radiant’s reactor will be refueled once every five years, not months as previously stated.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nYouTube has won exclusive rights to stream the Oscars starting in 2029, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Wednesday. The Google-owned platform outbid other contenders, including the Oscars’ longtime home ABC, ending the network’s streak of hosting the awards show since 1961 (with the exception of a brief period in the early 1970s).\nYouTube’s first show will be the 101st Oscars in 2029, and its deal will run through 2033. ABC will continue to broadcast the ceremony until 2028.\nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. \nThe news, which marks a landmark shift for one of television’s marquee events, highlights YouTube’s growing dominance in the television space and a major shift as streaming takes on more live events. The ceremony will be available live and for free to more than 2 billion viewers globally on YouTube, as well as to YouTube TV subscribers in the United States. The move comes as Oscar ratings have steadily fallen from a peak of 55 million viewers in 1998 to closer to 20 million in recent years, prompting the Academy to explore new ways to reach audiences.\n“We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,” said Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor in a joint statement. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible — which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”\nAs part of the deal, YouTube will not only broadcast the ceremony, but also red carpet coverage, behind-the-scenes content, the Oscar nominations announcement, Academy member and filmmaker interviews, Governors Ball access, film education programs, podcasts, and more. \n“The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,” YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. “Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars’ storied legacy.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlthough this isn’t the first time a streamer has acquired the rights to an awards show — Netflix has secured rights to the SAG Awards — it’s the first time one of the big four awards shows (Emmys, Grammys, Oscars, and Tonys) will leave broadcast TV entirely in favor of streaming.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

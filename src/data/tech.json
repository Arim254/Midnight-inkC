    "body": "\nAlan Dye, the design executive who led Apple’s user interface team for the last decade, is leaving the company to join Meta, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.\nThis is a significant hire for Meta, as the company makes a push toward consumer devices like smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Dye will focus on improving AI features in these devices and report directly to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth.\nAt Apple, Dye will be replaced by Steve Lemay, who has had “a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,” according to a statement Apple CEO Tim Cook gave Bloomberg.\nIt seems that Meta is recruiting from its competitors to help the company compete in the AI race, as Meta also poached researchers from OpenAI this summer. (Allegedly, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hand-delivered homemade soup to an OpenAI employee in a recruitment push; OpenAI chief research officer Mark Chen said that he has since delivered his own soup to promising Meta recruits.)\n\n\tTopics\n",

This year alone, at least four 1789 companies have received government contracts, FT reported. The firm is also a backer of SpaceX and Anduril, two long-time sellers of tech to the government.\nVulcan denied to FT that Trump Jr. had involvement with the contract negotiations, as did a spokesperson for Trump Jr., who said he “had no involvement in negotiations with the government on behalf of 1789’s portfolio companies.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n",

The provision failed then due to strong resistance from both parties.\nSilicon Valley has supported such measures, arguing that state regulations create an unworkable patchwork of rules that could stymy innovation. \nCritics argue that most state AI legislation is focused on safety, transparency, and consumer protections, and in the absence of federal AI laws that perform those tasks, blocking states from regulating would be effectively handing over control to Big Tech with no oversight.\nScalise reportedly acknowledged that the defense bill was not the place to include such a provision, and echoed Trump’s previous calls to introduce the ban as a separate bill. A leaked draft executive order signals Trump is considering taking matters into his own hands, though those efforts have reportedly paused for now.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

    "body": "\nTwo more nuclear companies have been awarded large grants by the Trump administration.\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Holtec will each receive $400 million from the Department of Energy to build small modular reactors based on existing nuclear fission technology. \nThe TVA will build one 300-megawatt reactor from GE Vernova Hitachi in Tennessee, while Holtec will build two of its 300-megawatt reactors in Michigan. \nTech companies have warmed to nuclear power in recent years as their demand for electricity has grown alongside their AI ambitions.\nThe reactors to be built are considered Generation III+ designs, which are refinements of existing designs that have been in use for decades. By shrinking them down to “small modular” size, the hope is that costs will come down as parts are mass produced and engineering and construction crews become more familiar with building them.\nTo date, though, only two small modular reactors are operational, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n",

    "body": "\nFintech company Marquis is notifying dozens of U.S. banks and credit unions that they had customer data stolen in a cyberattack earlier this year. \nDetails of the cyberattack emerged this week after Marquis filed data breach notices with several U.S. states confirming its August 14 incident as a ransomware attack.\nTexas-based Marquis is a marketing and compliance provider that allows banks and other financial institutions to collect and visualize all of their customer data in one place. The company counts more than 700 banking and credit union customers on its website. As such, Marquis has access to and stores large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the United States.\nAt least 400,000 people are so far confirmed affected by the data breach, according to legally required disclosures filed in the states of Iowa, Maine, Texas, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire that TechCrunch has reviewed.\nTexas has the largest number of state residents so far who had data stolen in the breach, affecting at least 354,000 people.\nMarquis said in its notice with Maine’s attorney general that banking customers with the Maine State Credit Union accounted for the majority of its data breach notifications, or around one-in-nine people who are known to be affected throughout the state.\nThe number of individuals affected by the breach is expected to rise as more data breach notifications roll in from other states.\nMarquis said the hackers stole customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, such as bank account, debit, and credit card numbers. Marquis said the hackers also stole customers’ Social Security numbers.\nAccording to its most recent notices, Marquis blamed the ransomware attack on hackers who exploited a vulnerability in its SonicWall firewall. The vulnerability was considered a zero-day, meaning the flaw was not known to SonicWall or its customers before it was maliciously exploited by hackers. \nMarquis did not attribute the ransomware attack to a particular group, but the Akira ransomware gang was reportedly behind the mass-hacks targeting SonicWall customers at the time. \nTechCrunch asked Marquis if it is aware of the total number of people affected by the breach, and if Marquis received any communication from the hackers or if the company paid a ransom, but we did not hear back by the time of publication.\nDo you know more about the Marquis data breach? Do you work at Marquis or a company affected by the breach? We would love to hear from you.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Roblox\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:01 PM PST · December 3, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nThe online gaming platform Roblox has been banned in Russia, according to a report from Russian state media.\nRoblox is a user-generated content platform where players can create and share their own games and experiences, similar to Minecraft. The platform hosts various interest-based and affinity communities, including military roleplaying games and LGBTQ solidarity groups. But Russia has laws designating public LGBTQ advocacy as “extremist activity.“\nAccording to a translation of an article in TASS, a state-owned Russian news agency, Russia’s communications agency cited the presence of LGBTQ content on the platform as one of the reasons behind the ban.\nRoblox did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the ban this afternoon.\nThe ban comes as Roblox faces broader safety and moderation challenges. Recent reports have highlighted how the platform exposed some of its underage users to child predators. In the U.S., Roblox has faced legal probes from the attorneys general in Texas and Louisiana. Roblox has since introduced age checks and content moderation tools aimed at keeping children safe — beginning in January, the company plans to implement mandatory facial verification to access Roblox’s chat features. (However, facial verification technology comes with safety concerns of its own.)\nRoblox has also asked developers to flag experiences that “are primarily themed on a sensitive social, political, or religious issue” so that the parents of users under 13 years old can decide if their children can access that content. This sparked backlash from advocacy groups like Out Making Games, Women in Games, and BAME in Games, which represent minority groups in the gaming industry. In an open letter, the groups wrote that Roblox considered topics like “pay equity in sports” to be “sensitive.”\n“While parental controls serve an important purpose, they shouldn’t come at the expense of fundamental human dignity,” the letter said. “We are calling on Roblox to reconsider these guidelines and find ways to protect young users without legitimizing discrimination or silencing important voices.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Appfigures, an app intelligence firm, Roblox was installed an estimated 70 million times in Russia on mobile, with about 8 million downloads so far this year.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nRight on the heels of announcing Nova Forge, a service to train custom Nova AI models, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced more tools for enterprise customers to create their own frontier models.\nAWS announced new capabilities in Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI at its AWS re:Invent conference on Wednesday. These new capabilities are designed to make building and fine-tuning custom large language models (LLMs) easier for developers.\nThe cloud provider is introducing serverless model customization in SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure, according to Ankur Mehrotra, general manager of AI platforms at AWS, in an interview with TechCrunch.\nTo access these serverless model-building capabilities, developers can either follow a self-guided point-and-click path or an agent-led experience where they can prompt SageMaker using natural language. The agent-led feature is launching in preview.\n“If you’re a healthcare customer and you wanted a model to be able to understand certain medical terminology better, you can simply point SageMaker AI, if you have labeled data, then select the technique and then off SageMaker goes, and [it] fine tunes the model,” Mehrotra said.\nThis capability is available for customizing Amazon’s own Nova models and certain open source models (those with publicly available model weights), including DeepSeek and Meta’s Llama.\nAWS is also launching Reinforcement Fine-Tuning in Bedrock that allows developers to choose either a reward function or a pre-set workflow, and Bedrock will run a model customization process automatically from start to finish.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFrontier LLMs — meaning the most advanced AI models — and model customization appear to be an area of focus for AWS at this year’s conference.\nAWS announced Nova Forge, a service where AWS will build custom Nova models for its enterprise customers for $100,000 a year, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s keynote on Tuesday.\n“A lot of our customers are asking, ‘If my competitor has access to the same model, how do I differentiate myself?’” Mehrotra said. “‘How do I build unique solutions that are optimized, that optimize my brand, for my data, for my use case, and how do I differentiate myself?’ What we’ve found is that, the key to solving that problem is being able to create customized models.”\nAWS has yet to gain a substantial user base for its AI models. A July survey from Menlo Ventures found that enterprises greatly prefer Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini to other models. However, the ability to customize and fine-tune these LLMs could start to give AWS a competitive advantage.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual enterprise tech event here, and see all the announcements you may have missed thus far here.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nGoogle Photos users can now access their year-end Recap, the photo-hosting site’s own version of something akin to Spotify Wrapped. Like other annual reviews, the Google Photos Recap lets you look back on your past year in photos, offering a combination of memorable highlights enhanced with graphics and other effects, plus photo stats and more. \nU.S. users will also gain access to a new feature powered by Google’s AI, Gemini, which will showcase your hobbies and other top highlights, the company says.\nFirst introduced in 2024, Google Photos Recap aims to capitalize on the data-powered review trend, popularized by services like Spotify Wrapped, and, in past decades, by time-traveling apps like Timehop.\nHowever, this year, the Google Photos Recap also serves as a testing ground for Gemini, as the company unleashes the AI on your photo archive to help surface more of the moments you might like to review. Google says that Gemini models can understand the context of your photos to pull out more details. Specifically, the models were used to identify things like your “one true passion” and the other top four highlights that “made your year” in the Recap. \nImage Credits:Google\nIn addition, the recap will offer photo stats from the year, like total photo count, top people, and, new for this year, a total selfie count. The feature also now lets you hide specific people or photos. After doing so, you can then regenerate your Recap for an updated version. \nThe photos and memories from the Recap can be easily shared on social media and elsewhere. A new integration with CapCut will add a button at the end of the Recap to export it to the photo and video editing app, where you can use other Google Photos templates to customize the Recap further. \nImage Credits:Google\nThere’s also a new carousel at the end of the Recap containing short videos, photos, and collages designed for sharing to group chats or social media. One option even allows you to share your Recap directly to your WhatsApp Status. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf you don’t immediately see your Recap, you can request Google Photos to generate it for you using an option at the top of the app. After viewing the Recap, it will remain in your app throughout the month of December. To access it again during this time, you can find it either in the back of your Memories carousel or pinned in your Collections tab. \nImage Credits:Google\nIn addition to the annual review, Google Photos will release a series of 2025 highlights throughout the month of December, the company noted. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nEarlier this year, home goods maker Kohler launched a smart camera called the Dekoda that attaches to your toilet bowl, takes pictures of it, and analyzes the images to advise you on your gut health. \nAnticipating privacy fears, Kohler said on its website that the Dekoda’s sensors only see down into the toilet, and claimed that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption.”\nThe company’s use of the expression “end-to-end encryption” is, however, wrong, as security researcher Simon Fondrie-Teitler pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday. \nBy reading Kohler’s privacy policy, it’s clear that the company is referring to the type of encryption that secures data as it travels over the internet, known as TLS encryption — the same that powers HTTPS websites. \nUsing the right terms matters, especially in the context of users’ privacy concerns. Using the expression end-to-end encryption — widely adopted by messaging apps such as iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp — to describe TLS encryption is wrong, and can potentially confuse users who see that expression and think Kohler actually cannot see the pictures that the camera takes. \nA Kohler spokesperson did not respond to questions from TechCrunch, but a company “privacy contact” told Fondrie-Teitler that user data is “encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user’s mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.” The company also said that, “data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.”\nThe security researcher also pointed out that given Kohler can access customers’ data on its servers, it’s possible Kohler is using customers’ bowl pictures to train AI. Citing another response from the company representative, the researcher was told that Kohler’s “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Dekoda costs $599 plus a mandatory subscription of at least $6.99 per month.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration announced plans Wednesday to lower fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks sold in the United States. \nWith CEOs from Ford and Stellantis in attendance, President Donald Trump proposed rolling back fleet-wide fuel economy to 34.5 miles per gallon for 2031 model-year cars. The previous fuel economy standard, set under the Biden administration, mandated fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031. The regulation change also reclassifies crossovers as cars instead of light trucks, and it eliminates automakers’ ability to trade electric vehicle credits.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulates fuel economy rules under Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards. Those rules, first enacted by Congress in 1975, dictate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. In 2024, automakers had to average 30.1 mpg across their fleets, which they beat, delivering 35.4 mpg, according to CAFE calculations.\nTrump also said he would authorize the Department of Transportation to allow automakers to manufacture “really small cars” like the kind found in Japan and South Korea.\nThe White House claims that existing regulations would have caused automotive prices to increase by $1,000 per vehicle. The previous Trump administration made the same argument in 2020, when it last rolled back fuel economy standards.\nSince that rollback, though, the price of a new vehicle has climbed to new heights, topping $50,000 on average, as automakers discontinued low-end models to capitalize on consumers’ preferences for SUVs. Larger vehicles use more material, thus costing more to make, while also getting lower fuel economy.\nConsumers’ choices appear to run counter to the administration’s contention that lower fuel economies are in the car-buying public’s interests. For instance, hybrid sales are up significantly this year over last and momentum continues. Hybrid sales grew 6% in October over the previous month.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nExperts doubt that lower fuel economy standards will change the trajectory of new vehicle prices. Many vehicles are developed with global markets in mind, and most of those still value efficiency.\n“The rest of the world will continue to innovate and create cleaner cars that people want to buy and drive, while we’re forced to sit in our clunkers, paying more for gas, and pumping out more tailpipe emissions,” Gina McCarthy, former EPA administrator, said in a statement. “With their backwards thinking and never-ending efforts to create more pollution in this country, we are ceding the global car market and technological innovation to China.”\nSince the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, which eliminated penalties for automakers that don’t hit their marks, fuel economy standards have been essentially toothless. Instead, the regulatory move is likely intended to serve as a hurdle for future administrations to bring them back.\nAlready, automakers have been moving to sell more gas-guzzling vehicles. \nFord has indefinitely paused production of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, shifting capacity in favor of internal combustion models. Stellantis reintroduced its Hemi V-8 engines, though a review of the powertrain in the Ram 1500 has revealed that it performs worse in nearly every way than a more efficient inline-6.\nNot all automakers have decided to turn back, though. Hyundai is still committed to EVs, while its sibling Kia has given its EVs $10,000 discounts across the board.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIs it time for MrBeast to hit the New York Stock Exchange? Three years ago, the idea of a YouTuber with a $1.5 billion valuation left some onlookers incredulous — but Beast Industries ended up raising at a $5 billion valuation last year. Now we’re asking a bigger question: Would you buy stock in a 27-year-old named Jimmy?\nIt’s getting to the point where even if you don’t have a child under the age of 15, you should know who MrBeast is. The North Carolinian Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast channel has over 450 million YouTube subscribers — more than any other YouTube channel — making him arguably the most successful social media star ever. \nSo it made sense when at the DealBook Summit, reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin asked MrBeast and Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, about going public.\n“You want to have an IPO at some point, I imagine,” said Sorkin.\n“At some point, we want to be able to give the 1.4 billion unique people around the world who has watched Jimmy’s content the last 90 days a chance to be owners of the company,” Housebold replied. Sounds pretty much like a yes, as we can’t imagine another practical way to give ownership stakes to over a billion people.\nLike other major creators, the MrBeast business expands far beyond YouTube ad revenue and into a company called Beast Industries. Its biggest moneymaker is Feastables chocolate, which is more profitable than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg.\nHousenbold also mentioned that Beast Industries plans to build a two-sided marketplace for creators and marketers to work together (this idea has been explored by many creator economy startups already). Plus, the company is planning to launch a phone company, a financial services platform, and a theme park in Saudi Arabia. Sure, why not!\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDonaldson’s business has had its share of stumbles, though. Beast Industries is in an ongoing lawsuit with the ghost kitchen Virtual Dining Concepts for damaging his brand by selling “inedible” food from MrBeast Burger. Virtual Dining Concepts countersued him for allegedly breaching his contract.\nThen, after filming the first season of “Beast Games,” five contestants sued Donaldson and Amazon for alleged mistreatment and sexual harassment on set. The heavily redacted lawsuit states that the show filmed in an environment that “systematically fostered a culture of misogyny and sexism.”\nIn conversation at DealBook, Donaldson said, “The big thing is, obviously, I learned why people don’t have 2,000 people compete in a show, because you’re creating a scenario where 1,999 aren’t happy, because they didn’t win … I don’t know how openly I’m allowed to speak, but obviously, yes, some people sue you. I’m sure people in here have been sued before because they just want to try to make money.”\nHousenbold cut in, “Listen, we’re always learning and getting better.” He was interrupted by laughter from the crowd. “Mistakes are part of success, so Season 2 is a lot better.”\nNot that Beast Industries’ missteps would prevent it from going public eventually, especially if it moves past them and can build the management discipline needed to bear the scrutiny of being public. \nDonaldson wouldn’t be the first creator-run business to go public — but he could pull off the first creator IPO that actually works. The esports team FaZe Clan went public in a $725 million SPAC but got acquired a year later in 2023 for just $17 million. In November, Pinkfong — the company that made the most-watched YouTube video, “Baby Shark” — went public in Korea.\n“From day one, we’re a global media company, and now we’re working on monetizing that viewership, that fandom, and that trust we built,” Housenbold said.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nWordPress’s experimental AI development tool, Telex, has already been put to real-world use, only months after its September debut. At the company’s annual “State of the Word” event on Tuesday in San Francisco, WordPress project co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg shared several examples where Telex had been used within a working WordPress shop to do things like create price comparisons, price calculators, and pull in real-time business hours plus a map link to a retail store, among examples.\nTelex, which Mullenweg previously described as a “v0 or Lovable, but specifically for WordPress,” is essentially the publishing platform’s attempt to build its own vibe-coding tool for the AI era. The software allows developers to generate Gutenberg blocks — the modular bits of text, images, columns, and more — that make up a WordPress website.\nWhile the software is still labeled as an experiment, Mullenweg was able to demonstrate several real-world examples that had been built by community creator Nick Hamze. \nIn the first example, Mullenweg showed off a pricing comparison tool built with Telex, noting that these sorts of rich, interactive web elements were something that a developer used to have to custom build but could now be created in a few seconds.\nImage Credits:WordPress State of the Word (opens in a new window)\nIn another demo, a developer used Telex to add real-time store hours, a phone number, and a link to get directions to the header block of their WordPress site. \nImage Credits:WordPress State of the Word (opens in a new window)\nTelex was also shown being used to create a carousel of partner logos on a business’s site, a custom pricing tool, a Google Calendar integration, and a grid for posts on a WordPress homepage where each post’s card on the site had the same height.\nImage Credits:WordPress State of the Word (opens in a new window)\n“Again, things that you used to have to, like, hire developers, do custom software like this would have cost thousands, tens of thousands of dollars to build, even just years ago. We’re now able to do in a browser for pennies,” said Mullenweg. “It’s kind of insane.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:WordPress State of the Word\nAnother developer, Tammie Lister, used Telex to create a new Gutenberg block every day in the month of October, creating things like a playable, ASCII version of Tetris and a trick-or-treat block for Halloween.\nThe Telex demos were discussed alongside other AI-focused initiatives at WordPress, including architectural developments, like the Abilities API and MCP adapter. The former defines what WordPress can do in a way that AI systems can interpret, the company explained, while the latter exposes those abilities so any MCP-compatible tool can understand and use them.\n“This adapter pattern means WordPress can participate in AI workflows without duplicating logic or creating separate integrations for every AI platform,” Mullenweg told event attendees. “So you can now connect a WordPress installation to popular tools like Claude, Copilot, and many other platforms that support MCP.” \nIn addition, he noted that developers were already using AI in their everyday workflows through tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and other next-generation CLIs. This, Mullenweg said, “means you can refactor projects, search code bases, automate tasks, [and] run scripts with WP CLI alongside the AI agent.”\nMullenweg said that, in 2026, WordPress would introduce some benchmarks and evaluations that AI models can use to test on WordPress tasks, like changing plugins, editing text, or even manipulating the WordPress interface using browser agents.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

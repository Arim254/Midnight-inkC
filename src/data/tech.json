    "body": "\nA significant portion of the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is about TVs, and this year, LG is showing off its manufacturing chops with a new Wallpaper OLED TV that is just 9mm thick.\nThe South Korean company launched the Wallpaper line in 2017, and is now bringing it back with this model, dubbed OLED evo W6. The company says you can connect the TV to its Zero Connect Box wirelessly to stream lossless 4K video and audio, provided the box is within 10 meters of the TV.\nLG claims the TV improves on brightness, color, and blacks compared to its predecessor, and is certified “reflection-free” by product testing group Intertek. The display has a refresh rate maxing out at 165Hz, and supports AMD’s FreeSync Premium tech.\nLG didn’t provide any pricing details, but it said that the W6 will be available in 77- and 83-inch sizes.\n\n\tTopics\n",

    "body": "\nWhile tech stocks were busy setting records in 2025, the executives behind those companies were equally busy turning their paper fortunes into actual cash — more than $16 billion worth, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of insider trading data.\nJeff Bezos led the way. The Amazon founder sold 25 million shares for $5.7 billion in June and July, right around the time he was getting hitched to Lauren Sánchez in Venice. Oracle’s former CEO Safra Catz wasn’t far behind at $2.5 billion, followed by Michael Dell at $2.2 billion.\nNvidia’s Jensen Huang watched his company become the world’s first $5 trillion business and sold $1 billion along the way. Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal cashed out nearly $1 billion as demand for the company’s high-speed networking gear soared and her personal net worth crossed $6 billion.\nMost of these sales happened through prearranged trading plans that executives file in advance; they weren’t spur-of-the-moment decisions. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg sold $945 million through his foundation, while Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora and Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt each pocketed over $700 million.\nThe common thread was an AI-fueled rally that kept pushing tech stocks higher throughout the year.\n",

That’s more than Lucid built at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory in the first half of the year. Lucid also said it delivered — meaning sold — 15,841 vehicles across the whole year, a 55% increase over 2024’s figures.\nThe stronger finish to 2025 sets Lucid up for an all-important year that will see the company start building the first vehicle on its new mid-sized EV platform. The company has said this first vehicle will cost around $50,000, putting it near the same part of the market as the Tesla Model Y and Rivian’s upcoming R2 SUV.\nThe numbers still pale in comparison to the projections Lucid Motors threw around when it went public in a $4 billion reverse merger in 2021. At that time, the company claimed it would deliver 135,000 vehicles in 2025, with 86,000 of those being Gravity SUVs, 42,000 being Air sedans, and the remaining 7,000 coming from its yet-to-debut mid-sized EV. \nThose targets quickly became unrealistic as Lucid ran into production, supply, and demand challenges for both of its vehicles, all while navigating an automotive market that was severely disrupted by the pandemic. The company particularly struggled in early 2025 as it started to ramp up production of the Gravity SUV. It has since been dealing with a number of quality issues on the vehicle, to the level that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to customers in December saying that he shared in their “frustration.”\n“Lingering software problems have unfortunately affected our customers’ experience and satisfaction. I would like to assure you that we are laser focused on addressing these issues,” he wrote.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nGoogle believes AI can improve the TV-watching experience, which is why it brought its Gemini AI to Google TV devices in November. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) in Las Vegas, the company is now showing off a series of new Gemini features that will soon arrive on the TV, making it possible for viewers to deep-dive into topics, search for and “reimagine” their personal photos and videos with AI, and, perhaps best of all, tell the TV what to do instead of having to navigate through complicated settings.\nThe company is first bringing these Gemini features and others to select TCL televisions before rolling them out more broadly to other Google TV devices in the months ahead. \nDesigned for large-screen experiences, Gemini for Google TV will allow users to talk to their TV to find something to watch, catch up on a favorite series by getting a recap of the plot, or get recommendations, all by using natural language conversation. For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors. \nYou could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”\nImage Credits:Google\nGemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required. \nBut Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too. \nAt CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more.\nImage Credits:Google\nGemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments. They can also apply artistic styles to their photos and videos using Gemini AI and turn their memories into cinematic slideshows, says Google.\nImage Credits:Google\nImage Credits:Google\nHowever, perhaps the most useful feature is one that gives you the power to optimize the TV’s settings using only your voice.\nNow, you’ll be able to tell Gemini things like “the screen is too dim” or “I can’t hear the dialogue,” and Gemini will adjust the relevant settings without you having to leave the movie or TV show you’re watching to dig through menus to find the necessary option. \nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle says the new Gemini features will require the Google TV devices to be running Android TV OS 14 or higher, and they will need an internet connection. Not all languages, countries, or devices will be supported at launch, and users must also have a Google account to access the Gemini for TV experience. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nA hacktivist remotely wiped three white supremacist websites live onstage during their talk at a hacker conference last week, with the sites yet to return online.\nThe pseudonymous hacker, who goes by Martha Root — dressed as Pink Ranger from the Power Rangers — deleted the servers of WhiteDate, WhiteChild, and WhiteDeal in real time at the end of a talk at the annual Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany. \nRoot gave the talk alongside journalists Eva Hoffmann and Christian Fuchs, who wrote an article about the hacked sites for the German weekly paper Die Zeit in October. \nAs of this writing WhiteDate, which Hoffmann described as a “Tinder for Nazis”; WhiteChild, a site that claimed to match white supremacists’ sperm and egg donors; and WhiteDeal, a sort-of Taskrabbit-esque labor marketplace for racists, are all offline.\nThe administrator of the three websites confirmed the hack on their social media accounts. \n“They publicly delete all my websites while the audience rejoices. This is cyberterrorism,” the administrator wrote on X on Sunday, vowing repercussions.\nThe administrator also claimed that Root deleted their X account before it was restored.\n\n‼️A German hacker known as \"Martha Root\" dressed as a pink Power Ranger and deleted a white supremacist dating website live onstageThis happened during the recent CCC conference.Martha had infiltrated the site, ran her own AI chatbot to extract as much information from users… pic.twitter.com/vpTEoFR8JR— International Cyber Digest (@IntCyberDigest) January 2, 2026\n\nRoot also published the data allegedly scraped from WhiteDate online. \nThe hacker said that they scraped WhiteDate’s public data and found “poor cybersecurity hygiene that would make even your grandma’s AOL account blush.” Root said that users’ images included precise geolocation metadata that “practically hands out home addresses with a side of awkward selfies.” \n“Imagine calling yourselves the ‘master race’ but forgetting to secure your own website — maybe try mastering to host WordPress before world domination,” Root wrote. \nThe leaked data includes users’ profiles with name, pictures, description, age, location (both containing precise coordinates and user-set country and state), gender, language, race, and other personal information that users uploaded. Root wrote on the site that “for now” there are no emails, passwords, or private conversations. \nAccording to the leaked data, WhiteData had more than 6,500 users, of which 86% men and 14% women. “A gender ratio that makes the Smurf village look like a feminist utopia,” Root wrote.\nRoot infiltrated the sites using AI chatbots that bypassed verification processes and were verified as “white,” according to the talks’ abstract. \nDDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest, announced that it has received “files and user information” from the three white supremacist websites. The collective, which calls this release “WhiteLeaks,” has not publicly released the data but is instead asking verified journalists and researchers to request access to the full 100 gigabyte dataset.\nThe administrator of the three websites did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment sent to an email address shown during the conference talk. TechCrunch also sent an email to an address that appears on the public domain records of two of the three websites. The person behind that address also did not immediately respond to our email.\nRoot, Hoffmann, and Fuchs claim to have identified the real identity of the websites’ administrator as a woman from Germany. TechCrunch could not independently confirm the identity of the administrator.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

If completed, the projects would generate a total of 6 gigawatts of electricity.\nTwo lawsuits were filed Thursday and Friday last week by Ørsted and Equinor, which are developing the 704 megawatt Revolution Wind and the 2 gigawatt Empire Wind, respectively. Another was filed on December 23 by Dominion Energy, which is building a 2.6 gigawatt farm off the coast of Virginia.\nRevolution Wind is nearly 90% complete, while Empire Wind and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind are each about 60% complete. Dominion said it was losing $5 million per day as a result of the halt.\nAvangrid, which is developing Vineyard Wind 1, has not filed a lawsuit yet. Nearly half that project is currently operational.\nThe Department of the Interior cited national security concerns in its decision to stop construction on the projects. Though it didn’t mention specifics, the Trump administration may have been referencing the challenges wind turbines present to radar operations. The Department of Energy had issued a report that discussed this security concern, as well as solutions to it, in February 2024.\nWind turbines’ whirling blades have been known to stymie radar systems, but researchers in the government and private companies have been working to mitigate the problem for well over a decade. \nChoosing the precise site for wind energy projects is one of the biggest ways to ameliorate interference. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management coordinates with the Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse to “review each proposed offshore wind project on a project-by-project basis, and would attempt to de-conflict concerns related to individual projects or multiple projects,” according to Vineyard Wind 1’s environmental impact statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNewer radar systems can filter the noise that wind farms produce through adaptive processing algorithms, Rand Corporation senior engineer Nicholas O’Donoughue previously told TechCrunch. Vineyard Wind 1 agreed to help fund radar adaptations and to curtail operations when asked by the Pentagon, for example. \nEarlier last year, the Trump administration halted approvals for new offshore wind projects in addition to pausing work on Empire Wind and Revolution Wind. The latter restarted after New York State negotiated with the Trump administration, while a federal judge struck down the stop work order for Revolution Wind. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Amazon\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:00 AM PST · January 5, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nBMW is finally getting the next-generation Alexa voice assistant and it’s coming with a generative AI upgrade. \nAmazon said Monday that the 2026 BMW iX3 will be equipped with Alexa+, the same generative AI tech that launched in millions of the e-commerce giant’s smart devices last year. This will be the first vehicle to come with Amazon’s next-generation voice assistant, the companies announced during the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\nThe launch is one part of Amazon’s effort to bring its LLM-powered voice and digital assistant to every device — whether handheld or in the driver’s seat — touched by consumers. Alexa+ is already in more than 600 million devices. And automotive is next on the list.\nBringing a custom version of Alexa+ into the BMW iX3 will be an important test for Amazon. Automakers have struggled for years to bring a voice assistant inside vehicles that can handle complex functions and requests that don’t end with the driver yelling in frustration. Efforts to develop natural language processing — a form of AI that lets computers understand and respond to human speech — have been in the works for more than a decade. And while progress has been made, these systems can still be easily stumped by humans.\nBMW and Amazon’s Alexa+ partnership has been three years in the making.\nBMW announced in 2022 that Amazon Alexa would be the foundation of its next-generation voice assistant. This meant BMW wouldn’t just embed Alexa into its vehicles but would also use Amazon’s technology platform known as Alexa Custom Assistant to build its own custom version. That timeline was extended as Amazon worked on an automotive version of Alexa+, an overhauled voice assistant developed and powered by large language models that promises to deliver seamless and natural conversations, like talking to a human.\nAlexa+ was built using Amazon Bedrock, a service that lets AWS customers build apps using generative AI models from Amazon and other third-party partners. Customers, like BMW, can then customize the app with their proprietary data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe end result, according to Amazon, is a voice assistant that can break down complex requests, reason through steps, and take actions across different services. For instance, Amazon says users can start a conversation with their Alexa+-enabled Echo speaker in the home and continue it in their BMW. Once in the car, the user can make requests through the Alexa+ assistant that might normally require opening up different apps, like music, navigation, and a home security system.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nChinese lidar-maker Hesai announced plans on Monday to double its production capacity from 2 million units to 4 million units this year, as it looks to corner the global market for the laser-based sensors. That would be well up from the 1 million-plus unit mark that Hesai hit in 2025.\nHesai’s push to grab more market share comes just one month after leading U.S. lidar-maker Luminar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That company is not expected to continue operating once its bankruptcy plan is approved, though it is looking to sell the lidar business.\nHesai has raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the last few years and is now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong stock exchanges. That’s despite fighting an uphill battle against the U.S. government, which has accused the company of working closely with China’s military industry — a charge that Hesai has challenged.\nAt the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Hesai told reporters it was able to double the production target because of “accelerating demand” in the automotive and robotics industries.\nThe company’s automotive efforts have been buoyed by the Chinese car market’s adoption of lidar sensors, which Hesai said is now in 25% of new electric cars sold in the country. It also claimed that many new vehicles in China are expected to integrate between three to six lidar sensors per car, “significantly expanding Hesai’s addressable market.” Hesai boasts 24 automotive customers, including a “top European” automaker, and said it has 4 million orders for its newest ATX lidar sensor.\nAutomotive has proved to be a fickle market for lidar sensors outside of China. That was one of the contributing factors to Luminar’s downfall, according to the company’s own bankruptcy filings. While Luminar secured deals to integrate its lidar sensors on Volvo, Polestar, and Mercedes-Benz vehicles, those plans fell apart. Volvo had at one point agreed to buy 1.1 million lidar sensors from Luminar, but delays to its new vehicle programs and cost overruns caused the Swedish automaker to back out of the deal. (Volvo ultimately only purchased around 10,000 sensors from Luminar.)\nRobotics is not guaranteed to be a successful market for lidar sensors, but some players besides Hesai see great promise. San Francisco-based Ouster, which acquired rival player Velodyne in 2023 as the lidar industry began to consolidate, has said it believes robotics represents a $14 billion market opportunity. This includes not just humanoid robotics, but last-mile delivery robots and military applications.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAt CES, Hesai is showcasing a robotic lawnmower and a robotic dog that use the company’s JT series lidar sensor. The company also hinted at its inclusion in humanoid robots as well. It has struck deals to provide lidar sensors to autonomous vehicle companies like Pony AI, Motional, WeRide, and Baidu.\nHesai also boasted it has helped drive down the cost of lidar sensors by 99.5% in just eight years. That, too, was a contributing factor to Luminar’s downfall; “pressure to reduce costs due to lower price points of China-based competitors” has been regularly listed in the company’s bankruptcy filings as the second-most important factor that explains why the U.S. company found it so hard to build up a self-sustaining business.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nTwo months after coming out of stealth with a $150 million fundraise, Boston-based Teradar is showing off its first flagship terahertz sensor at Consumer Electronics Show 2026 this week. The company is positioning the sensor, called Summit, as the first long-range, high-resolution sensor of its kind “designed for high performance in any type of weather, filling a critical gap left by legacy radar and lidar sensors.”\nThe sensor will start shipping in 2028 if Teradar can lock down contracts with automakers. If that happens, the company expects Summit will help enable those companies to add partial, or even full, autonomy features to their vehicles.\nTeradar’s whole approach is about leveraging the relatively unused terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared. And it’s a solid-state sensor, meaning there are no moving parts. All this is meant to give Teradar’s sensor the best qualities of lidar and radar sensors, with few of the drawbacks.\nIt’s a potentially attractive proposition for automakers who might wince at the cost of lidars or the limitations of radars. Teradar says it’s already working to prove its tech with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe, and three Tier 1 suppliers.\nTeradar’s impending entry into the market comes at a pivotal moment for automotive sensor suppliers. Leading U.S. lidar company Luminar just filed for bankruptcy protection in December after contracts with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz fell apart, as the automakers backed away from the tech.\n\nThose deals also crumbled partly because of low-cost competition from China, according to Luminar. Lidar adoption has been strong in China’s auto market and shows little sign of slowing up. In October, Chinese lidar company Hesai said it had built more than 1 million lidar sensors in 2025.\nOther U.S. companies in the space, like Ouster (acquired and merged with rival Velodyne after a wave of consolidation) have diversified into potential markets like robotics and smart infrastructure.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTeradar is looking beyond automotive, too, and that vision was reflected in its recent raise. The $150 million Series B included funding from Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.\nLidar isn’t completely dead in the auto industry, however. Rivian in December said it would integrate a roof-mounted lidar sensor (from an unnamed supplier) in its upcoming R2 SUV, signaling that there is still an appetite for using advanced sensor technology to bring autonomy to passenger vehicles, especially if it’s affordable.\nTeradar CEO Matt Carey told TechCrunch in November that he believes his terahertz sensor can meet all those marks, and sounded eager to pounce on the opportunity. \n“Our main job is to make sure our sensor gets on all automobiles, and whatever the best way to do that is, that’s what we’re going to pursue,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nLidar-maker Luminar says its founder and former CEO Austin Russell has been evading requests for information — including a subpoena — that the company needs in order to decide whether it should take legal action against him. \nThe company, which entered the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process in late December, said in an emergency filing over the weekend that it has been trying to reclaim company-owned devices from Russell since his resignation in May. While it has recovered six computers, Luminar is still seeking Russell’s company-issued phone and a digital copy of his personal phone.\nLuminar’s lawyers also wrote in the filing that Russell and his own personal employees repeatedly misled legal representatives about the founder’s location over the holidays. They’re asking the court for permission to instead serve Russell by mail or email. A lawyer for Luminar declined to comment further.\nIn emails attached to the filing, Russell claimed he was being cooperative and has been trying to get assurances from Luminar that any personal data from his devices will be protected. \n“The company declined, so we will follow the court-established process for data handling protections instead,” Leonard Shulman, an attorney for Russell, told TechCrunch in a statement.\nThe emergency filing is one of the first major twists in a fast-moving bankruptcy case that involves Luminar trying to sell the two main parts of its business. The company is seeking court approval of an already reached agreement to sell its semiconductor subsidiary to a company called Quantum Computing, Inc., and has established a January 9 deadline for bids on its lidar division.\nRussell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy Luminar before the Chapter 11 filing and has expressed plans to make a bid in the bankruptcy process. “As it relates to Luminar, our focus remains on what matters: Russell AI Labs’ bid to rebuild the company and bring value to its stakeholders,” Shulman said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLawyers for Luminar said in the filing that it began hunting for information from Russell in May, just after he abruptly resigned following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” performed by the board’s audit committee. The company was evaluating whether it may have potential legal claims against him “relating to the Audit Committee inquiry and personal loans taken by Mr. Russell,” according to the filing. But Luminar said those efforts were unsuccessful and Russell was not cooperative.\nOn November 12, Luminar’s board of directors established a Special Investigation Committee and hired law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges to further investigate “certain acts, omissions, transactions and potential claims and causes of action involving or related to certain current and former directors and officers of Luminar.” \nOne month later, just before the bankruptcy, lawyers for Weil contacted the law firm of McDermott Will & Schulte, which had previously represented Russell. The Weil lawyers asked about collecting Russell’s Luminar-provided laptop and desktop computers, along with his company-issued phone and a digital copy (or “image”) of his personal phone. \nThe lawyers from Weil spent a week trying to confirm whether McDermott would represent Russell in the matter of the Special Investigation Committee, only to find out on December 19 that it would not. The Weil lawyers tried contacting Russell directly instead. \nRussell responded for the first time on Christmas Eve, according to the filing. He eventually authorized McDermott to turn over the computers (which the firm had kept in its possession since his resignation), but the founder repeatedly asked for guarantees that Luminar’s lawyers would not search through personal data on his phones, emails attached to the emergency filing show. \n“I have offered direct cooperation as well as prompt action, even through the holidays – but if this singular basic protection cannot be confirmed, I am advised further deliberations on this matter will not be productive,” Russell wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve.\nRepresentatives for Luminar arranged to have a forensic examiner appear at Russell’s mansion in Florida on New Year’s Day. But the technician was turned away by Russell’s security team, which a lawyer for Luminar called “unacceptable.” \nRussell claimed the technician was sent to his home “unannounced” on the holiday morning “when I was asleep,” and reiterated his desire to protect the privacy of his personal data. A lawyer for Luminar responded that they had “repeatedly confirmed that we have no intention of looking at any documents beyond those that are Luminar-related.” Russell replied on January 2 that “[a]ny characterization that I have been uncooperative is wholly inaccurate” and accused the lawyers of “word gymnastics.” \nLuminar’s lawyers tried instead to subpoena this information from Russell but claim their process servers were similarly turned away by his security team. They also claim those security team members lied about Russell’s presence at his Florida residence. \n“Can we try to serve Austin again today? We’re going to need someone dogged. He is going to evade service as long as possible,” one of the Weil lawyers wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve. “In fact, he was home when your person tried last time and the guard simply lied for him.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nSelf-driving trucks company Kodiak AI announced on Monday it is working with global automotive supplier Bosch to develop a system of hardware and software that can give standard big rigs autonomous driving capabilities. \nThe collaboration was announced at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and it could help Kodiak bring its self-driving tech to more trucks, faster.\nKodiak, which is developing self-driving trucks for highway, industrial, and defense uses, has already developed and designed a self-driving system with redundant systems for braking, steering, sensors, and computers. In January 2025, Kodiak’s self-driving trucks began making driverless deliveries for Atlas Energy Solutions in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. \nKodiak has since delivered at least eight self-driving trucks to Atlas Energy as part of an initial 100-truck order under an agreement between the two companies. Kodiak has been working with Roush Industries, which was the upfitter for its driverless trucks delivered to Atlas.\nNow the company, which went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II in September 2025, wants to scale its tech for the truck masses.\nBosch and Kodiak will work together on redundant platforms designed to turn semi trucks — regardless of manufacturer — into driverless ones. Bosch will supply Kodiak with a variety of hardware components, including sensors and vehicle actuation components such as steering technologies. Notably, these systems can be added within the vehicle production line or by a third-party upfitter at a later date, according to Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette. \n“We believe collaborating with Bosch will allow us to scale autonomous driving hardware with the modularity, serviceability, and system-level integration needed for commercial success for both upfit and factory-line integration,” Burnette said in a statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPaul Thomas, who is president of Bosch in North America and the company’s Bosch Mobility Americas division, appears to see this as opportunity for growth in the sector. \n“By supplying production-grade hardware, we are enabling the next generation of autonomous trucking alongside Kodiak,” said Thomas in a statement. “Kodiak has already deployed trucks with no humans on board in commercial operation and this cooperation gives us a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding of real-world autonomous vehicle requirements and to further enhance our offerings for the broader autonomous mobility ecosystem.”\nWhile Kodiak’s plan is to scale and Bosch is keen to increase its market share in the sector, it’s unclear exactly when this will happen. Neither company provided a timeline for when these new systems might go into production or become available.  \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAfrica’s largest fintech company, Flutterwave, has acquired Nigerian open banking startup Mono in an all-stock deal valued between $25 million and $40 million, according to people familiar with the transaction.\nThe acquisition brings together two of Africa’s leading fintech infrastructure companies. Flutterwave operates one of the continent’s widest payments networks, while Mono, often described as the “Plaid for Africa,” has built APIs that allow businesses to access bank data, initiate payments, and verify customers.\nMono has raised about $17.5 million from investors, including Tiger Global, General Catalyst, and Target Global. Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers seeing paper returns of up to 20x based on the implied valuation of the stock they received from Flutterwave. Mono will continue to operate as an independent product, the companies said in a statement.\nFounded in 2020, Mono, like Plaid, uses APIs that allow users to consent to sharing their bank information, enabling financial institutions to analyze income, spending patterns, and repayment capacity.\nThe company addresses the lack of standardized access to bank data across African markets, where credit bureaus remain limited and fintechs, especially lenders, often rely on customers’ bank transaction histories to assess creditworthiness.\nAccording to CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, nearly all Nigerian digital lenders now rely on Mono’s infrastructure. The company claims to have powered more than 8 million bank account linkages, covering roughly 12% of Nigeria’s banked population. It also claims to have delivered 100 billion financial data points to lending companies and processed millions in direct bank payments. Customers include Visa-backed Moniepoint and GIC-backed PalmPay.\nFor Flutterwave, which powers local and cross-border payments across more than 30 African countries, the deal deepens its vertical integration. In addition to payments, the company can now offer onboarding and identity checks, bank account verification, data-driven risk assessment, and one-time or recurring bank payments within a single stack.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFlutterwave CEO Olugbenga “GB” Agboola framed the acquisition as a bet on Africa’s next phase of fintech growth. “Payments, data, and trust cannot exist in silos,” he said. “Open banking provides the connective tissue, and Mono has built critical infrastructure in this space.”\nHassan echoed that view, arguing that Africa is entering a credit-driven phase as governments across the continent push lending-led financial inclusion initiatives. That transition depends on both substantial data infrastructure and regulatory confidence, particularly in markets like Nigeria, where open banking frameworks are still evolving.\n“If the economy is going to be credit-driven, you need deep data intelligence to know how people earn and spend,” Hassan said. “But at the same time, for open banking to really work, regulators need to be confident that customer funds are safe.”\nAgainst that backdrop, joining Flutterwave positions Mono to scale quickly once regulatory barriers fall. Flutterwave already operates across dozens of African markets, with local licenses, enterprise customers, and compliance teams in place.\n“This allows us to expand what’s possible for businesses operating across African markets while staying grounded in security, compliance, and local relevance,” Agboola said.\nThe transaction mirrors earlier consolidation attempts in global fintech infrastructure, including Visa’s failed acquisition of Plaid in 2020, which was blocked by U.S. regulators. Hassan cited that deal as evidence that combining data infrastructure with payment rails can unlock scale. \nBoth Y Combinator-backed companies count Tiger Global (which was the lead investor in Flutterwave’s Series C and Mono’s Series A) among their backers. Hassan said, however, that the firm did not facilitate the transaction. Instead, the deal grew out of a longstanding working relationship between the two companies, which had partnered on several bank payment products over the years.\nThat collaboration played out against an open banking landscape that has changed significantly over the past five years.\nWhen Mono launched, it faced competition from companies such as Base10 Partners-backed Okra and Ribbit Capital-backed Stitch. Since then, Mono has emerged as a leading player in the space, following Okra’s shutdown and Stitch’s pivot toward a deeper payments ecosystem play that has allowed it to raise significantly more capital.\nAddressing Mono’s financial position ahead of the acquisition, Hassan said the company, which, according to PitchBook, raised $15 million in Series A at a $50 million post-money valuation in 2021, was not forced into a sale to Flutterwave and is on track toward profitability this year. With significant cash reserves, he added, raising another round would have introduced new valuation and growth expectations in a tough funding environment. \nStill, beyond the two companies involved, the transaction — similar to the consolidation between South African fintechs Lesaka and Adumo — signals a broader inflection point for African fintech, where startups that once aspired to become standalone giants may increasingly find better outcomes by integrating into scaled platforms.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Subtle\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4:00 AM PST · January 4, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nVoice AI startup Subtle, which creates voice-isolation models to help computers understand you better in loud environments, today launched a new pair of wireless earbuds that help users sound clear on calls and provide accurate transcriptions for voice notes.\nThe company unveiled these earbuds ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and said that it plans to ship them in the U.S. in the next few months. The buds cost $199 and will come with a yearlong subscription to the iOS and Mac app. The app will let users take voice notes or chat with AI without pressing any keys. The company said it is using a custom chip that allows it to wake the iPhone while it is locked.\nThe startup is also trying to compete with AI-powered voice dictation apps such as Wispr Flow, Willow, Monologue, and Superwhisper by allowing users to dictate in any app using the voice buds. The company claimed that the buds would deliver five times fewer errors than AirPods Pro 3 combined with OpenAI’s transcription model.\nIn a demo seen by TechCrunch, the voice buds were able to capture audio in a noisy background. The buds also managed to capture the text for a voice note when Subtle’s co-founder and CEO, Tyler Chen, was whispering.\n“We are seeing that there is a huge move towards voice as a new interface that a lot of folks are adopting. You can do much more with voice in a natural way than with a keyboard. However, we saw that voice is rarely an interface people use when others are around. So that using our noise-isolation model, we will give consumers a way to experience a voice interface in the form of our earbuds,” Chen told TechCrunch over a call.\nLast year, companies like Sandbar and Pebble announced forthcoming rings for note-taking. Chen said that with its buds combined with the app, it wants to provide the functionalities of different tools like dictation, AI chat, and voice notes in one package.\nUsers can preorder these buds using the startup’s site. The earbuds are available in black and white colorways.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSubtle has raised $6 million in funding to date and has been working with consumer companies like Qualcomm and Nothing to deploy its models for noise isolation.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

The firm is said to have invested in Vulcan Elements around three months ago, according to Bloomberg.  In August, the company announced a $65 million Series A led by Altimeter Capital. \nThis government contract represents the largest ever made by the Pentagon’s Office of Strategic Capital, the FT reported. This year alone, at least four 1789 companies have received government contracts, FT reported. The firm is also a backer in SpaceX and Anduril, two long-time sellers of tech to the government.\nVulcan denied to FT that Trump Jr. had involvement with the contract negotiations, as did a spokesperson for Trump Jr., who said he “had no involvement in negotiations with the government on behalf of 1798’s portfolio companies.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n",

    "body": "\nTwo more nuclear companies have been awarded large grants by the Trump administration.\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Holtec will each receive $400 million from the Department of Energy to build small modular reactors based on existing nuclear fission technology. \nThe TVA will build one 300-megawatt reactor from GE Vernova Hitachi in Tennessee, while Holtec will build two of its 300-megawatt reactors in Michigan. \nTech companies have warmed to nuclear power in recent years as their demand for electricity has grown alongside their AI ambitions.\nThe reactors to be built are considered Generation III+ designs, which are refinements of existing designs that have been in use for decades. By shrinking them down to “small modular” size, the hope is that costs will come down as parts are mass produced and engineering and construction crews become more familiar with building them.\nTo date, though, only two small modular reactors are operational, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n",

The provision failed then due to strong resistance from both parties.\nSilicon Valley has supported such measures, arguing that state regulations create an unworkable patchwork of rules that could stymy innovation. \nCritics argue that most state AI legislation is focused on safety, transparency, and consumer protections, and in the absence of federal AI laws that perform those tasks, blocking states from regulating would be effectively handing over control to Big Tech with no oversight.\nScalise reportedly acknowledged that the defense bill was not the place to include such a provision, and echoed Trump’s previous calls to introduce the ban as a separate bill. A leaked draft executive order signals Trump is considering taking matters into his own hands, though those efforts have reportedly paused for now.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

    "body": "\nFintech company Marquis is notifying dozens of U.S. banks and credit unions that they had customer data stolen in a cyberattack earlier this year. \nDetails of the cyberattack emerged this week after Marquis filed data breach notices with several U.S. states confirming its August 14 incident as a ransomware attack.\nTexas-based Marquis is a marketing and compliance provider that allows banks and other financial institutions to collect and visualize all of their customer data in one place. The company counts more than 700 banking and credit union customers on its website. As such, Marquis has access to and stores large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the United States.\nAt least 400,000 people are so far confirmed affected by the data breach, according to legally required disclosures filed in the states of Iowa, Maine, Texas, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire that TechCrunch has reviewed.\nTexas has the largest number of state residents so far who had data stolen in the breach, affecting at least 354,000 people.\nMarquis said in its notice with Maine’s attorney general that banking customers with the Maine State Credit Union accounted for the majority of its data breach notifications, or around one-in-nine people who are known to be affected throughout the state.\nThe number of individuals affected by the breach is expected to rise as more data breach notifications roll in from other states.\nMarquis said the hackers stole customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, such as bank account, debit, and credit card numbers. Marquis said the hackers also stole customers’ Social Security numbers.\nAccording to its most recent notices, Marquis blamed the ransomware attack on hackers who exploited a vulnerability in its SonicWall firewall. The vulnerability was considered a zero-day, meaning the flaw was not known to SonicWall or its customers before it was maliciously exploited by hackers. \nMarquis did not attribute the ransomware attack to a particular group, but the Akira ransomware gang was reportedly behind the mass-hacks targeting SonicWall customers at the time. \nTechCrunch asked Marquis if it is aware of the total number of people affected by the breach, and if Marquis received any communication from the hackers or if the company paid a ransom, but we did not hear back by the time of publication.\nDo you know more about the Marquis data breach? Do you work at Marquis or a company affected by the breach? We would love to hear from you.

    "body": "\nEarlier this year, home goods maker Kohler launched a smart camera called the Dekoda that attaches to your toilet bowl, takes pictures of it, and analyzes the images to advise you on your gut health. \nAnticipating privacy fears, Kohler said on its website that the Dekoda’s sensors only see down into the toilet, and claimed that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption.”\nThe company’s use of the expression “end-to-end encryption” is, however, wrong, as security researcher Simon Fondrie-Teitler pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday. \nBy reading Kohler’s privacy policy, it’s clear that the company is referring to the type of encryption that secures data as it travels over the internet, known as TLS encryption — the same that powers HTTPS websites. \nUsing the right terms matters, especially in the context of users’ privacy concerns. Using the expression end-to-end encryption — widely adopted by messaging apps such as iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp — to describe TLS encryption is wrong, and can potentially confuse users who see that expression and think Kohler actually cannot see the pictures that the camera takes. \nA Kohler spokesperson did not respond to questions from TechCrunch, but a company “privacy contact” told Fondrie-Teitler that user data is “encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user’s mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.” The company also said that, “data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.”\nThe security researcher also pointed out that given Kohler can access customers’ data on its servers, it’s possible Kohler is using customers’ bowl pictures to train AI. Citing another response from the company representative, the researcher was told that Kohler’s “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Dekoda costs $599 plus a mandatory subscription of at least $6.99 per month.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

The company announced Wednesday it has begun testing its autonomous vehicles (with a safety monitor) in Philadelphia, and that it will start manual driving to collect data in Baltimore, St. Louis, and Pittsburgh.\nWaymo did not offer a timeline for when it plans to launch commercial services in those locations, nor do we know whether the Alphabet-owned company will partner with other companies to operate robotaxis in each one. That has been the move in cities like Atlanta and Austin, for example, where Waymo has partnered with Uber to advance its robotaxi rollout.\nBut the new locations join a list of over 20 cities where the company is either offering rides, prepping a commercial launch, or testing. Waymo is also now offering rides on freeways in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company plans to be doing one million rides per week by the end of 2026.\nWaymo has done all this while claiming to be operating at a level five times safer than humans, according to data the company recently released. \nBut the expansion has not come without its issues. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating how the company’s vehicles operate near school buses, after a Waymo was filmed driving around a stopped bus in Atlanta in September. \nThis week, Austin news outlet KXAN published a report showing Waymo’s vehicles have driven past school buses that were in the process of unloading or loading children multiple times — including after Waymo claims to have shipped software updates to address the problem.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

Just describe a movie scene like you would to a friend, and Alexa+ will jump directly to that specific moment—no more searching required.”\nAmazon says you can describe the scene to Alexa by mentioning details like the actor or character’s name, or a memorable quote.\nFor example, you could say “Jump to the scene in Mamma Mia where Sophie sings ‘Honey Honey’” or “Jump to the scene where Deloris Jordan says ‘a shoe is just a shoe until my son steps into it’.”\nOther examples include: “Jump to the scene when John McClane says ‘come out to the coast, we’ll get together, have a few laughs’” and “Jump to the card scene in Love Actually.”\nAmazon says Alexa+ can identify the movie you’re talking about even if you don’t mention the title. It then uses visual understanding and movie captions to understand the characters, plot, and action in scenes to determine the specific moment you’re looking for. \nLike Alexa+, the new feature is built on Amazon Bedrock, which is Amazon’s service that offers a choice of generative AI models from the company itself and third-party partners through an API. The feature leverages a variety of large language models, including Amazon Nova and Anthropic Claude. \nThe feature works with thousands of movie titles available on Prime Video, including tens of thousands of indexed scenes, Amazon says. The company plans to add more movies and scenes, and expand the capability to TV shows soon.\nIt’s worth noting that the feature will only work if the movie is included with a Prime membership, or if you have purchased or rented it on Prime Video. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle Photos users can now access their year-end Recap, the photo-hosting site’s own version of something akin to Spotify Wrapped. Like other annual reviews, the Google Photos Recap lets you look back on your past year in photos, offering a combination of memorable highlights enhanced with graphics and other effects, plus photo stats and more. \nU.S. users will also gain access to a new feature powered by Google’s AI, Gemini, which will showcase your hobbies and other top highlights, the company says.\nFirst introduced in 2024, Google Photos Recap aims to capitalize on the data-powered review trend, popularized by services like Spotify Wrapped, and, in past decades, by time-traveling apps like Timehop.\nHowever, this year, the Google Photos Recap also serves as a testing ground for Gemini, as the company unleashes the AI on your photo archive to help surface more of the moments you might like to review. Google says that Gemini models can understand the context of your photos to pull out more details. Specifically, the models were used to identify things like your “one true passion” and the other top four highlights that “made your year” in the Recap. \nImage Credits:Google\nIn addition, the recap will offer photo stats from the year, like total photo count, top people, and, new for this year, a total selfie count. The feature also now lets you hide specific people or photos. After doing so, you can then regenerate your Recap for an updated version. \nThe photos and memories from the Recap can be easily shared on social media and elsewhere. A new integration with CapCut will add a button at the end of the Recap to export it to the photo and video editing app, where you can use other Google Photos templates to customize the Recap further. \nImage Credits:Google\nThere’s also a new carousel at the end of the Recap containing short videos, photos, and collages designed for sharing to group chats or social media. One option even allows you to share your Recap directly to your WhatsApp Status. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf you don’t immediately see your Recap, you can request Google Photos to generate it for you using an option at the top of the app. After viewing the Recap, it will remain in your app throughout the month of December. To access it again during this time, you can find it either in the back of your Memories carousel or pinned in your Collections tab. \nImage Credits:Google\nIn addition to the annual review, Google Photos will release a series of 2025 highlights throughout the month of December, the company noted. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nHardware maker Nothing is letting its user base buy its stock as part of a new community investment round of $5 million. The new round, which opens on December 10, will enable consumers to buy the company’s shares at its Series C valuation of $1.3 billion.\nThe company said it has so far raised $8 million in total from over 8,000 people across two previous community investment rounds. It held its first community funding event in 2021, aiming to raise $1.5 million. \n“This isn’t about raising capital, it’s about giving our community/fans a chance to invest while we’re private and join us on the journey,” a spokesperson for Nothing told TechCrunch.\nCommunity investors have a rotating seat on the company’s board, but it is unclear what else they get for investing in the company through such rounds.\nNothing raised $200 million in its Series C back in September from investors including Tiger Global, GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF, and Tapestry. The company has raised $450 million to date.\nThe community round comes as Nothing makes changes to its corporate structure as it tries to increase its share of a smartphone market dominated by giants like Samsung and Apple. The company is spinning off its budget CMF brand, and plans to explore AI-centric devices while it keeps building smartphones and audio products. And Nothing claims it crossed $1 billion in cumulative revenue this year, up 150% from 2024. \nThe startup is working to be “IPO-ready” in three years, CEO Carl Pei told TechCrunch in an email. “The timing will depend on market conditions and what makes sense for the business at that point in time,” he said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“What’s important is that we’re already operating with that discipline now. We’re building the systems, the governance, the financial discipline that a public company needs. It forces us to think longer-term and make smarter decisions that prioritise sustainable growth,” Pei added.\nIt’s not clear if Nothing aims to raise another round before an IPO. When asked about its fundraising plans, a Nothing spokesperson said the company is not thinking about raising capital immediately, but it wouldn’t be averse to those conversations.\nThose interested in investing in the community round can use platforms like Wefunder and Crowdcube to participate.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon announced a new product Tuesday called “AI Factories” that allows big corporations and governments to run its AI systems in their own data centers. Or as AWS puts it: Customers supply the power and the data center, and AWS plunks in the AI system, manages it, and can tie it into other AWS cloud services.\nThe idea is to cater to companies and governments concerned with data sovereignty, or absolute control over their data so it can’t wind up in a competitor’s or foreign adversary’s hands. An on-prem AI Factory means not sending their data to a model maker and not even sharing the hardware.\nIf that product name sounds familiar, it should. That’s what Nvidia calls its hardware systems that are chock-full of tools needed to run AI, from its GPU chips to its networking tech. This AWS AI Factory is, in fact, a collaboration with Nvidia, both companies say. \nIn this case, the AWS Factory will use a combination of AWS and Nvidia technology. Companies that deploy these systems can opt for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs or Amazon’s new Trainium3 chip. It uses AWS’ homegrown networking, storage, databases, and security and can tap into Amazon Bedrock — the AI model selection and management service, and AWS SageMaker AI, the model building and training tool.\nInterestingly, AWS is far from the only giant cloud provider installing Nvidia AI Factories. In October, Microsoft showed off its first of many-to-come AI Factories rolling out into its global data centers to run OpenAI workloads. Microsoft didn’t announce at the time that these extreme machines would be available for private clouds. Instead, Microsoft highlighted how it was leaning on a host of Nvidia AI Factory data center tech to build and connect its new “AI Superfactories,” aka new state-of-the-art data centers being built in Wisconsin and Georgia.\nLast month, Microsoft also outlined the data centers and cloud services that would be built in local countries to address the data sovereignty issue. To be fair, its options also include “Azure Local,” Microsoft’s own managed hardware that could be installed on customer sites.\nStill, it is a bit ironic that AI is causing the biggest cloud providers to invest so heavily in corporate private data centers and hybrid clouds like it’s 2009 all over again.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nIndia has backed away from its plan to force smartphone makers to preinstall a government app on all devices, following backlash and mounting concerns that the mandate would expand state access to users’ devices and weaken privacy protections.\nOn Wednesday, the Indian telecom ministry said Sanchar Saathi, an anti-theft and cybersecurity protection app, would remain voluntary and that smartphone makers would no longer be required to preload it on devices they sell.\nThe new notice effectively reverses a directive issued to manufacturers last week (and circulated online on Monday) that had instructed manufacturers to bake the app into all devices and prevent its features from being disabled. News of the mandate soon ignited concerns over privacy and state overreach.\n“Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, the government has decided not to make pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” the ministry said.\nHowever, the government has not yet issued an official notification to smartphone makers reflecting the withdrawal, and manufacturers are still waiting for formal instructions, two manufacturer sources involved with the proceedings told TechCrunch.\nSince its release in January 2025, Sanchar Saathi has so far been downloaded 14 million times and contributes information on roughly 2,000 cyber-fraud incidents per day, per the Indian government. The recent controversy boosted interest in the platform, and the ministry noted that about 600,000 citizens registered to download the app on December 2 alone.\nThe telecom ministry’s notice follows much confusion over whether the app was truly voluntary, as the government claimed. Telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia had insisted earlier this week that users could delete Sanchar Saathi at any time, even though the directive circulating among manufacturers stated that the app’s functionalities “must not be disabled or restricted.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe conflicting signals fueled criticism that the government was attempting to downplay the extent of its mandate. Critics warned that forcing a government app onto every smartphone and preventing its features from being disabled would give authorities excessive visibility into users’ devices.\nThe directive had also raised concerns within the industry, with manufacturers privately questioning the feasibility of enforcing a permanent, system-level app without clear legal backing.\nDeputy telecom minister Pemmasani Chandra Sekhar said in media interviews that Apple did not participate in the working group for the initiative, though other smartphone makers did.\nSanchar Saathi had more than 3 million monthly active users in November, according to marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Web traffic to Sanchar Saathi has also surged, with monthly unique visitors rising by more than 49% year-over-year, per Sensor Tower.\nThe Internet Freedom Foundation, a New Delhi-based digital rights group, called the reversal a “welcome development,” but urged caution, noting that it is still awaiting the legal order that should accompany the announcement. The group added that “cautious optimism, not closure,” was warranted until revised directions under the Cyber Security Rules, 2024, are published and independently verified.\nOther parts of the Sanchar Saathi ecosystem continue to expand. Recommerce and trade-in platforms are still required to validate devices through a central IMEI database, and the telecom ministry is also piloting an API that could allow these firms to submit customer and device information directly to the state. \n\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nUber customers in Dallas may get an Avride-branded robotaxi the next time they hail a ride. \nA year after announcing their partnership, Uber and Avride have launched a commercial robotaxi service in Dallas. The service comes with a few caveats, however, including the addition of a human safety operator behind the wheel and a limited operating area. The companies said fully driverless operations, without a safety operator, will begin in the future and the service area will expand.\nFor Uber, the launch closes out a year of rapid dealmaking — and deployments — with a variety of autonomous vehicle technology companies, including Waymo, China’s WeRide, and San Francisco-based startup Nuro. To date, Uber has locked in 20 partnerships with AV companies across freight, delivery, and robotaxis, some of which are now in commercial operation. Uber offers autonomous vehicles through its ride-hailing app in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh with WeRide, and in Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix with Waymo.\nUber said it plans to have autonomous vehicles on its network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. Over the next two years, the plan is to launch AVs on its app in Arlington, Texas, Dubai, London, Los Angeles, Munich, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nMany of these partnerships have included an investment by Uber, and Avride, an Austin-based startup that sits under parent company Nebius Group, is one of those.\nIn October 2024, the ride-hailing company struck a multi-year deal with Avride to bring its sidewalk delivery robots and autonomous vehicles to both Uber Eats and Uber. Within months, Avride’s sidewalk robots began delivering food via the Uber Eats app in Austin, Dallas, and Jersey City.\nThis fall, Avride secured strategic investments and commercial commitments worth $375 million from Uber and Nebius, which was previously known as Yandex NV, the Netherlands-based company that sold off its Russian business in 2024.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nUber’s use of Avride sidewalk robots for its food delivery business was notable, but this robotaxi launch has arguably higher stakes for both companies.\nThe robotaxi fleet of all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles is equipped with Avride’s self-driving system and will service a nine-square-mile area of Dallas that includes downtown. Uber said it plans to expand the operating territory in the coming months.\nImage Credits:Uber\nThe fleet, currently limited, will eventually expand to hundreds of Avride robotaxis across Dallas in the next few years, according to an Uber spokesperson.\nThe robotaxi service in Dallas will eventually operate similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta. Avride will initially manage its own fleet, and Uber will take over day-to-day fleet operations, including cleaning, maintenance, inspections, charging, and depot management. From the start, Uber will provide end-to-end rider support, while Avride will oversee vehicle testing.\nUber riders who request UberX, Uber Comfort, or Uber Comfort Electric rides may be matched with an Avride robotaxi. The match is not guaranteed, and riders can increase their chances of getting a robotaxi by changing a setting in the Uber app. Robotaxi rides will cost the same as those operated by a human driver, according to Uber.\nWhen an Uber user is notified they’ve been matched with an Avride robotaxi, they can choose to accept or switch to a human-driven ride. Once the robotaxi arrives, riders can use the Uber app to unlock the vehicle, open the trunk, and start the trip.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nWith new AI models, health-tracking companies have realized that they can now provide insights using both structured and unstructured data. The new goal is to create interfaces and modalities that make it easier for users to create a habit of logging their meals or workouts, along with having an ever-present AI assistant that can guide people in areas like nutrition and exercise.\nKhosla-backed health startup Healthify on Tuesday launched a new version of its health assistant Ria, which you can converse with live, via voice, and by using the camera for getting input about your food.\nThe startup is using OpenAI’s tech to power this conversational mode. With this release, Ria supports more than 50 languages, including 14 Indian languages. The company said that it can also support mixed language input like Hinglish or Spanglish. While the company is largely utilizing OpenAI’s models for this release, it said that in the future it could use other models if needed.\nImage Credits:Healthify\nThrough the new version of Ria, users can ask for their health overview for specified time frames like day, week, or month, or an overall summary. The app can pull data from different sources like fitness trackers, sleep trackers, or glucose monitors to give users insights about exercise, sleep, readiness, and glucose spikes, and give suggestions.\nJust like Google Gemini’s Live Conversation mode, you can point the camera to ask about different food items and their nutritional value, then log them. \n\n\n\nHealthify also showed off a demo of using Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to converse with Ria in real time and use the device’s camera to log food. \nThe startup believes its users will feel more comfortable chatting in real time with an assistant. Plus, they can do multiple things in one session, such as getting insights, generating an exercise plan, or logging their goals. If you forget to log your food for the day, you can describe your meals in one go instead of typing them out, and the assistant will log them for you.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhat’s more, the company is looking to utilize its updated AI in more places. In the coming months, it plans to make the conversational assistant a central piece of user onboarding so it can gather more insights from unstructured conversations. (Notably, new-age dating apps have opted for this kind of interface to create better matches for users.)\nThe startup is also creating a more persistent memory layer over OpenAI’s models and its assistant to have the app remember long-term context around preferences and health changes to give more personalized suggestions. \nHealthify is also making the assistant available in conversations with your coach or nutritionist to help either of you pull data or answer your questions when they are not available. Plus, it’s adding Ria to your calls with coaches and nutritionists so it can transcribe the calls for insights. Users or coaches can also ask Ria for data while they are on a call.\nThe company’s CEO, Tushar Vashisht, said that the team trained Ria on years of conversational data between coaches and users to give grounded and accurate advice.\nApart from Healthify, other apps like Alma, Cal AI, MyFitnessPal, and Ladder have created ways for users to input food intakes using voice, text, or images. Healthify believes that with its live conversation mode, data aggregation from various platforms, and AI trained on years of data, it has an edge over its competitors. What’s more, the company has added a way to access your gallery and automatically detect food photos to give you options for adding meals that you might have missed logging in.\n“We are focusing on creating a health ecosystem of nutrition-driven data with other integrations. From an AI perspective, we are putting in levers to solve for accountability in users when it comes to health,” the company’s CPO, Paritosh Kumar, told TechCrunch.\nHealthify, which has more than 45 million registered users and a few million active monthly users, is also launching a new AI plan in the U.S with updated Ria assistant and meal planning at $20 per month. Prior to this, the company had been testing various plans with text-based AI and certified nutrition coaches.\nThe company said it’s hoping to soon announce partnerships around its GLP-1-aided weight-loss programs. In the coming months, Healthify also plans to partner with health tracking-device companies to bring their data into Ria.\nVashisht said the company may raise a new funding round in the near future, given its strong U.S. adoption and growth. \n",

    "body": "\nThe rapid succession of robotaxi deployments from companies like Waymo and Zoox have people in the industry, once again, dreaming about how autonomous vehicles might change our daily lives. That includes driverless taxi rides, sure, but also headier ideas like sending an autonomous vehicle to fetch groceries or pick up dry cleaning.\nIf those things are ultimately going to happen, navigating the handoff moments — like where exactly a vehicle should stop to receive the groceries — will be a crucial piece of the puzzle. Palo Alto-based Autolane is trying to build that layer of infrastructure, and it now has $7.4 million in fresh funding to take on that goal.\nBacked by VC firms like Draper Associates and Hyperplane, Autolane said it will start by coordinating pickup and drop-off points for companies that want to let robotaxis come onto their private property. The startup has signed a deal with Simon Property Group to coordinate driverless vehicle arrivals and departures at shopping centers owned by the real estate company in Austin, Texas and San Francisco, California.\nThis deal will include creating simple, physical infrastructure like signage (think: the many kinds of Uber and Lyft pickup and drop-off stanchions that decorate modern hotels and airports) and also software.\n“I believe we are one of the first, let’s say, ‘application layer’ companies in autonomy,” Autolane co-founder and CEO Ben Seidl told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. “We aren’t the fundamental models. We’re not building the cars. We’re not doing anything like that. We are simply saying, as this industry balloons rapidly and has exponential growth — as is already occurring this year and will occur for the next 10 years straight — someone is going to have to sit in the middle and orchestrate, coordinate, and kind of evaluate what’s going on.”\nAutolane is starting with robotaxis in mind, but Seidl is clearly focused on the bigger-picture idea of applying his company’s tech to all kinds of tasks autonomous vehicles might be able to perform in the future. And he wants to move quickly with Autolane because, as he sees it, the startup doesn’t have “any direct competition” right now. He expects that to change soon.\nSeidl said he was convinced there was a business here after buying a Tesla last year and using the company’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver assistance software for the first time.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“As soon as my own personal car was driving me around town, pretty much flawlessly, I just — my head kind of exploded,” he said. “I was mostly enthralled by the idea that this was going to change logistics, retail, real estate, where we work, where we live, where we play, how we get around, what the price of movement of goods and services and people will be.” \nSeidl cited the viral incident from earlier this year where a Waymo robotaxi got stuck navigating a Chick-fil-A drive-through in Santa Monica, California, as an example of the problem Autolane is trying to head off. In that case, the robotaxi had dropped off its passengers and then struggled to negotiate the fast food company’s notorious drive-through lanes. Seidl said by using Autolane software and designating an exact pick-up and drop-off location, problems like this can be avoided in the future.\n“Someone has got to bring some order to this chaos, and the chaos is already starting,” he said.\nCompanies could surely do some of this work themselves, at least on the physical infrastructure side. It’s simply not that hard to make a sign.\n“Anyone can do that,” Seidl said. “That’s not the case, though, for autonomy. Robotics need precise instructions and precise geolocation and technological communication. You can’t just put up a white sign with some black letters and hope for the best with 10 different types of robotics coming in.”\nInstead, Seidl said the value of Autolane is in how it will integrate with the companies that own real estate as well as with the autonomous vehicle providers. That’s why the plan is to essentially build APIs for the physical locations so autonomous vehicle companies can receive these precise instructions. Businesses will have to “directly integrate into each one of these robotics companies, car companies, so that they follow your rules,” he said.\nSeidl also said he explicitly does not want to work with cities or municipalities. \n“We don’t work on public streets. We don’t work with public parking spots. We’re just providing these tools as kind of a B2B, hardware-enabled SAS solution so that Costco, or McDonald’s, or Home Depot, or, in our case, Simon Property Group, the world’s largest retail REIT [real estate investment trust] can begin to have what I like to refer to as ‘air traffic control for autonomous vehicles,’ meaning they know which ones are incoming and outgoing,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

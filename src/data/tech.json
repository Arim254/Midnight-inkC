    "body": "\nFord Motor has put its gas and hybrid F-150 and F-Series Super Duty trucks at the top of the production priority line as it attempts to recover from losses connected to a fire at a critical aluminum supplier’s factory. \nThe automaker’s all-electric F-150 Lightning didn’t make the list. \nFord said Thursday that assembly of the F-150 Lightning truck at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan will remain paused. The reason, according to Ford: the gas and hybrid F-Series trucks are more profitable for Ford and use less aluminum.\nWhile Ford has highlighted sales growth of its all-electric F-150 Lightning truck, those numbers are still dwarfed by its gas-powered F-Series trucks. \nFord sold 10,005 F-150 Lightning pickups in the third quarter, a 39.7% increase year-over-year. To put that into context, Ford delivered 545,522 vehicles in the third quarter, 207,732 of which were F-Series. To date, Ford has sold 23,034 F-150 Lightning  trucks in 2025, about 1% more than the first nine months of 2024, according to recent sales data. \nA Ford spokesperson noted that while F-150 is the best-selling electric pickup in the U.S., the company is focused on producing the gas and hybrid trucks as it recovers from the September 16 fire at aluminum supplier Novelis’ plant in Oswego, New York that severely damaged its hot mill. Novelis said it expects to restart its hot mill by December 2025. \n“We have good inventories of the F-150 Lightning and will bring Rouge Electric Vehicle Center (REVC) back up at the right time, but don’t have an exact date at this time,” said spokesperson Ian Thibodeau.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Novelis plant fire has been costly for Ford and disrupted production of some of its most popular and profitable vehicles. The fire will cost Ford up to $2 billion in earnings in the fourth quarter, the automaker reported Thursday in its third-quarter earnings. That cost, coupled with up to a $1 billion headwind from tariffs, led Ford to lower its full-year profit guidance for 2025 to $6 billion from $6.5 billion.\nFord’s solution to recover fire-related losses is to increase F-Series production volume by more than 50,000 trucks in 2026 by adding a third shift. The plan is expected to create up to 1,000 new jobs and all hourly employees at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center will be transferred next door to work the third shift at the Dearborn Truck Plant.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff were among the tech industry’s luminaries who called him and convinced him to change his mind, the post said. \nSan Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie confirmed in a statement that the military operation had been planned and called off, although he didn’t name names as to who had conversations with the President.\nBenioff’s involvement is particularly notable. Earlier this month — shortly before Salesforce held its enormous tech conference in San Francisco, where it is headquartered – Benioff (who was born and raised there) said he supported Trump. He also said he thought National Guard troops should be sent to patrol its streets. That comment caused VC legend Ron Conway to resign his decade-long board seat on Salesforce’s philanthropic foundation and condemn both the comments and his friend, Benioff.\nBenioff promptly apologized and walked back his wish for National Guard patrols. “… after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” Benioff said in a post on X earlier this month. So, it appears the CEO doubled down and actually pleaded the case to the White House, too.\nMayor Lurie will be speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco next week. Perhaps we’ll hear more about how the city, ground zero of the AI industry, has improved safety and rallied to de-escalate the situation.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

Lurie’s visit signals a renewed effort to weave innovation back into San Francisco’s future. Register now to save up to $444 on your pass, and get 60% off a plus-one ticket.\n\nDaniel Lurie, who campaigned on revitalizing the city’s economy and restoring its global standing, isn’t just glad-handing; his presence underscores an overdue détente between City Hall and the startup community, which is currently experiencing an AI-driven renaissance even as the city grapples with pandemic aftershocks. Empty downtown offices and escalating skepticism about tech’s impact have strained the relationship, but the AI boom has brought renewed energy — and investment — back to the city.\nBy showing up at Disrupt 2025, Lurie is making a statement: San Francisco isn’t retreating from its role as a capital of innovation. It’s doubling down.\nFor TechCrunch, hosting the mayor isn’t mere pageantry. It marks an important moment as Disrupt continues to be one of the few gatherings where 10,000+ builders at all stages, heavyweight VCs, and now civic leadership converge under one roof. If Lurie wants a blueprint for the city’s rebound, he’ll find it in these halls: scrappy founders, hungry investors, and the enduring belief that San Francisco’s best inventions haven’t been built yet.\nJust 4 days left to save on your pass and catch Mayor Lurie live\nIf you care about San Francisco and its place at the center of the startup universe, you won’t want to miss this sit-down with Lurie. Bring a partner, friend, or team member and save 60% on their plus-one ticket. Or save up to $444 on your own pass, or up to 30% with a group.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:57 AM PDT · October 24, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nOn Friday, WordPress maker Automattic filed its counterclaims in the lawsuit initiated by hosting company WP Engine in October 2024, which had accused Automattic and its CEO, Matt Mullenweg, of defamation and abuse of power. Automattic believes that WP Engine has been abusing the WordPress trademark and has engaged in deceptive marketing practices, without properly giving back to the open source community.\nAs a result, Automattic took action against WP Engine last year, which included calling the hosting provider a “cancer to WordPress” and sending it a cease-and-desist letter claiming WP Engine had breached its trademark usage rules. As the battle continued, Automattic banned WP Engine from accessing WordPress.org resources and attempted to negotiate a licensing deal with the host. Automattic claims that the company strung it along, negotiating in bad faith.\nWP Engine eventually sued Automattic, portraying itself as the victim of Mullenweg’s attacks. But in Automattic’s telling of events, after the private equity firm Silver Lake invested $250 million in WP Engine, it shifted from fair use to trademark infringement by calling itself “The WordPress Technology Company” and letting its partners refer to it as “WordPress Engine.”\nAutomattic notes that the hosting company also launched products with names like “Core WordPress” and “Headless WordPress,” and claimed to its customers that it had committed 5% of its resources to support the WordPress ecosystem. Automattic says it never kept those promises. Automattic alleges that the trademark infringement was deliberate, saying WP Engine only “pretended to engage in licensing discussions, but actually delayed and negotiated in bad faith.”\nSilver Lake plays a central role in the counterclaims, which imply that the interests of the private equity firm guided much of WP Engine’s behavior. In particular, the counterclaims allege that WP Engine engaged in trademark violations because paying licensing fees would impact the company’s earnings and valuation, and therefore, Silver Lake’s expected return.\nThe counterclaims also allege that Silver Lake was seeking to offload WP Engine at a $2 billion valuation, but couldn’t find a buyer. Notably, the filing says that this included “overtures to Automattic.”\nAutomattic also claims that WP Engine degraded the consumer experience and product quality in an attempt to cut costs during this time by removing essential features. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTwo years ago, former SpaceX engineers used rocket tech to develop a power plant capable of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, with a small asterisk. To draw down CO2, it burned plant waste, making it a sort of “vegetarian rocket engine” for the grid.\nThis week, Arbor Energy said it had raised a $55 million Series A led by Lowercarbon Capital and Voyager Ventures on the heels of a partial pivot. Its power plant, rather than sticking to a strict vegetarian diet, is going to be more of an omnivore, capable of burning natural gas in addition to biomass. \nThe shift happened this year as electricity demand from data centers has boomed. The existing design was fully capable of powering AI servers, but its reach would be limited by sources of wood and agricultural waste. Natural gas is more widely available.\nArbor still plans to capture CO2 from the power plant, which uses oxy-combustion, which transforms hydrocarbons into syngas and then burns it in the presence of pure oxygen. The result is CO2 that doesn’t need much preparation for sequestration.\nBecause of tax credits, storing the CO2 will be cheaper than dumping the pollutant into the atmosphere, Arbor spokesperson Patrick Mahoney told TechCrunch. The company does not plan to sell its technology to businesses that don’t plan on capturing the carbon for use or sequestration, he said.\nBut waste CO2 isn’t the only climate consideration when it comes to burning natural gas. The main component of natural gas is methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas that generates 84 times more warming than carbon dioxide over 20 years. \nBecause of that, any leaks in the natural gas supply chain can have an outsized effect on the climate impact of a natural gas-fired power plant. Leakage rates as low as 0.2% mean the carbon footprint of a gas-fired power plant could be the same as a coal plant, according to recent research. The U.S. government has estimated that leakage rates throughout the oil and gas supply chain to be around 1%, while satellite measurements show rates of about 1.6% across the U.S.\nArbor said it is working with natural gas providers that are certified to have low leakage rates, with a goal of getting the climate impact of one kilowatt of electricity it generates below 100 grams (about a quarter of a pound). \nThe startup confirmed that it is still in the process of building a power plant in Louisiana that will burn biomass. That plant is being funded in part by a $41 million deal with Frontier, the advanced market commitment backed by Stripe, Google, and others. Under that agreement, Arbor must remove 116,000 tons of carbon dioxide by 2030.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism. He received his PhD in environmental science, policy, and management from the University of California, Berkeley, and his BA degree in environmental studies, English, and biology from St. Olaf College.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Tim by emailing tim.dechant@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nRivian has agreed to pay $250 million to settle a class-action shareholder lawsuit filed after the company suddenly hiked prices on its R1 pickup truck and SUV in 2022.\nThe lawsuit alleged Rivian had included misleading statements and figures in regulatory filings in the run-up to its 2021 IPO about the costs required to build the R1 EVs. Despite agreeing to the payment, Rivian said in a press release that it “denies the allegations in the suit and maintains that this agreement to settle is not an admission of fault or wrongdoing.”\nThe payment still has to be approved by a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. If that happens, Rivian plans to pay $67 million of the total settlement through its directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, and the remaining $183 million out of its cash reserves. The company had $4.8 billion in cash (and equivalents) as of June 30.\nThe settlement comes at a pivotal time for Rivian. The company is deep in preparations to launch its second-generation EV, the R2 SUV, in 2026. That vehicle is much cheaper than the R1 lineup — and Rivian plans to make far more of them. The company says it can build as many as 150,000 per year at its factory in Illinois, and it’s also building a new factory in Georgia that will produce the R2 and future vehicles.\nAt the same time, R1 sales have been lagging. The company expects to finish 2025 having shipped far fewer EVs than it did in 2024 or 2023. A combination of President Trump’s tariffs and the loss of the federal EV tax credit has further complicated the market for Rivian’s vehicles.\nTo that end, this week the company laid off more than 600 employees in a restructuring that also saw CEO RJ Scaringe take over as interim chief marketing officer. \nRivian delivered the first R1 pickup trucks in late 2021. In March 2022, the company decided to hike the price of the truck and the SUV by nearly 20%, citing supply chain shortages, inflation, and plans to introduce cheaper models. (Rivian began R1S SUV deliveries in August 2022.) The company applied the price hike to both new orders and to those who had placed pre-orders and were on a waitlist. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCustomers and fans of the company were irate, and Rivian quickly reversed the decision for customers with preorders. Crucially, the price hike announcement also sank Rivian’s stock price, causing losses for shareholders.\n“It was wrong and we broke your trust in Rivian,” Scaringe wrote in a letter at the time. “I have made a lot of mistakes since starting Rivian more than 12 years ago, but this one has been the most painful.”\nRivian shareholder Charles Larry Crews sued the company just a few days later, claiming, among other things, that the company had misrepresented the true cost of building the R1 vehicles in its IPO documentation. Those misrepresentations, he argued, led to the price hike announcement’s negative impact on the stock price. The lawsuit was granted class action status in July 2024.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Olly Curtis/Future / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12:33 PM PDT · October 23, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nYouTube has paid more than $8 billion to the music industry in the 12 months between July 2024 and July 2025, the company announced on Thursday. \n“Today’s $8 billion payout is a testament to the fact that the twin engine of ads and subscriptions is firing on all cylinders,” said YouTube’s Global Head of Music, Lyor Cohen, in a statement. “This number is not an endpoint; it represents meaningful, sustained progress in our journey to build a long-term home for every artist, songwriter, and publisher on the global stage.”\nCohen first announced the milestone during a talk at Billboard Latin Music Week on Wednesday.\nThe milestone marks a new record for the platform, as YouTube’s annual music industry payout increased by $2 billion since 2022, when the company reported contributing $6 billion in revenue to the music industry between July 2021 and June 2022. A year before that, in 2021, YouTube announced that it had paid out $4 billion to the industry in 12 months.\nThursday’s announcement comes as Spotify announced earlier this year that it paid out $10 billion to the music industry in 2024. The company delivered $9 billion in 2023. It’s worth noting that the artists themselves don’t receive all the money — it also goes to labels, publishers, songwriters, and others. \nYouTube says it’s seeing momentum from its twin-engine revenue model, noting that it has over 125 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including users on trials. The company also said that it has two billion logged-in viewers who watch music videos each month.\n“As the platform’s global footprint continues to expand, so does the potential for artists and songwriters to build long-lasting music careers and forever fans on YouTube,” the company wrote in a blog post.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nYouTube is available in more than 100 countries and supports 80 languages. \nThe company announced last month at its Made on YouTube event that it paid more than $100 billion to creators, artists, and media companies in the last four years. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI announced on Thursday it has acquired Software Applications, Inc., the makers of an AI-powered natural language interface for Mac computers called Sky. \nThe software product, which had not been released to the public, is designed to work alongside you throughout your day, as you use apps on the computer, writing, planning, coding, and more. Similar to AI browsers, Sky can see what’s on the your screen and take action in your apps for you.\nThe move is a significant step toward embedding OpenAI’s technology into consumers’ everyday lives and within businesses that run on Mac. \n“We’ve always wanted computers to be more empowering, customizable, and intuitive. With LLMs, we can finally put the pieces together. That’s why we built Sky, an AI experience that floats over your desktop to help you think and create. We’re thrilled to join OpenAI to bring that vision to hundreds of millions of people,” Software Applications co-founder and CEO Ari Weinstein said in a statement.\nNotably, the team behind Sky had another prominent exit before this. \nWeinstein and Conrad Kramer previously co-founded Workflow, which they sold to Apple, where it became the technology now known as Shortcuts. Both continued to work at Apple for several years before leaving to found Software Applications in August 2023. Sky’s third co-founder and COO, Kim Beverett, was a senior program and product manager at Apple, where she spent nearly 10 years working on technology like Safari, WebKit, Privacy, Messages, Mail, Phone, FaceTime, and SharePlay.\nApple, which has so far been behind on AI, is expected to launch an overhauled Siri with AI smarts next year. Apple has already shipped other features that use its AI tech known as Apple Intelligence, including writing helpers, live translation, image creation, visual search, and more. It’s also working with OpenAI to shuffle off queries Siri can’t answer to ChatGPT. Apple Intelligence works across platforms, including Mac.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn addition, Apple offers a Foundation Models framework that provides access to local AI models, allowing developers to build AI into their apps directly. \nHowever, Apple values privacy as a core part of its AI offering, and an agentic system that views your screen and takes action on your behalf could raise concerns for some of its more security-minded customers. Agentic AI is still in its early days, and recent reviews indicate that AI browsers have a lot of safety risks. It could take Apple time to launch a Mac AI system comparable to Sky, as a result.\nDeal terms for OpenAI’s acquistion were not revealed, but Sky’s maker had raised $6.5 million from investors, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Figma CEO Dylan Field, Context Ventures, and Stellation Capital, according to data from Pitchbook. OpenAI disclosed that Altman held a passive interest in the startup through an investment fund. \nThe deal was led by Head of ChatGPT Nick Turley and OpenAI’s CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, and approved by OpenAI’s board. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011. She joined the company after having previously spent over three years at ReadWriteWeb. Prior to her work as a reporter, Sarah worked in I.T. across a number of industries, including banking, retail and software.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Sarah by emailing sarahp@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at sarahperez.01 on Signal. \t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nMeta is bringing its AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly to Instagram Stories, allowing users to enter text prompts to add or remove things in photos and videos or even change it completely. \nWhile Meta has already offered image editing capabilities on Instagram, those tools were limited to interactions with the Meta AI chatbot. The addition of text-based prompts in Stories now makes these editing features much more accessible. \nThe new features can be found in the “Restyle” menu located at the top of Instagram Stories when tapping the paintbrush icon. To edit an image, choose “add,” “remove,” or “change” to describe what you want to change in the prompt bar. For instance, Meta explains you can ask it to change your hair color, add a crown to your head, or insert a sunset background. \nImage Credits:Meta\nThere are also preset effects you can choose from that can alter your outfit or change the image’s style. For example, you can add items like sunglasses or a biker jacket, and you can also apply a watercolor effect to the image. For videos, you can make it look like it’s snowing or add flames.\nIt’s important to note that when you’re using Meta AI on Instagram, you’re accepting Meta’s AI Terms of Service, which allow your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. According to these terms, when you upload your photos, Meta can “summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.”\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta continues to introduce AI updates to remain competitive in the market. It was most recently spotted testing a “Write with Meta AI” prompt that helps Instagram users come up with clever comments for posts. \nLast month, the company launched a new AI-generated video feed called “Vibes” in the Meta AI app, likely boosting downloads. New data from Similarweb shows that the app’s daily active users on iOS and Android increased to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from about 775,000 four weeks ago. \nAdditionally, to address any concerns parents may have, Meta announced earlier this month that it is introducing new parental control features that enable parents to disable chats with AI characters and monitor the topics their teenagers are discussing with the Meta AI chatbot.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nAn investigation by EU regulators has found TikTok and Meta in breach of the Union’s rules concerning illegal or harmful online content.\nThe European Commission (EC) said on Friday that preliminarily findings show both companies are not complying with Digital Services Act (DSA) rules that require them to give researchers adequate access to public data.\nThe Commission called Meta and TikTok’s procedures and tools for requesting access to public data “burdensome,” saying that researchers are consequently often left with partial or unreliable data, which affects “their ability to conduct research, such as whether users, including minors, are exposed to illegal or harmful content.”\nThe Commission also said Meta’s platforms — Instagram and Facebook — were both in breach of obligations to provide EU residents with simple ways to report illegal content. The Commission said both platforms impose several unnecessary steps before users can report content, and accused Facebook and Instagram of using so-called “dark patterns” — design tricks that manipulate users into taking certain actions.\n“Such practices can be confusing and dissuading. Meta’s mechanisms to flag and remove illegal content may therefore be ineffective,” the Commission wrote in a statement.\nThe EC also said both Meta platforms’ moderation appeal mechanisms don’t allow EU residents to fully explain or provide evidence to support their appeals. “This makes it difficult for users in the EU to further explain why they disagree with Meta’s content decision, limiting the effectiveness of the appeals mechanism,” the Commission wrote.\nThe findings are part of investigations launched into both companies early in 2024. The EC had started looking into TikTok with a focus on advertising transparency, data access for researchers, content moderation, and protection of minors, as well as other concerns. The investigation into Meta was launched after the Commission said it suspected Facebook and Instagram of breaking rules for larger platforms concerning election integrity.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe DSA is the EU’s set of rules governing online platforms and content moderation, which broadly addresses concerns over rising risks for consumer welfare in the digital realm. The law imposes a set of extra requirements on big platforms like TikTok and Meta in areas like algorithmic transparency and systemic risk.\nPenalties for confirmed breaches of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual revenue.\nThe EC said Meta and TikTok both will be able to review its investigation documents, challenge the findings and commit to address them.\nMeta and TikTok did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nWhile the U.S. government remains in limbo during a shutdown, the White House grounds have been busy this week. Construction workers have begun demolition on the White House’s East Wing, which will be replaced by a 90,000-square-foot ballroom that’s estimated to hold up to 1,000 guests.\nTaxpayers are not funding President Donald Trump’s $250 million project. Rather, he is using private donations to construct his lavish addition to the White House.\nThe White House released a list of the project’s funders on Thursday, which include some of the most influential American tech companies, like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, as well as defense companies like Palantir and Lockheed Martin and telecom providers like Comcast and T-Mobile. The crypto industry is also represented among the White House ballroom donors, with money coming from Coinbase, Ripple, Tether America, and the Winklevoss twins.\nIt is not clear how much each donor has contributed to the project. However, at least $20 million from Google is part of a recent lawsuit settlement over YouTube’s suspension of Trump’s account after the January 6, 2021, riots. TechCrunch asked Google if the money from the settlement represents the full extent of the company’s contributions, but has not yet received an answer.\nSilicon Valley’s relationship with Trump has changed markedly. While much of the tech industry initially resisted Trump when he became president for the first time in 2016, it has cozied up to Trump during his second term. Meta, for instance, did not donate to Trump’s first inauguration fund, but contributed $1 million to the president’s second inauguration; Amazon donated $58,000 the first time, but made a heftier $1 million donation this time around.\nThese donations reflect a greater alignment between Trump and the tech industry.\nThe industry could be more willing to cooperate with Trump’s current administration because many of these major tech companies are facing antitrust litigation. The Trump administration has been much less aggressive in its antitrust enforcement than former President Joe Biden’s FTC was under former FTC Chair Lina Khan.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTrump has also taken a more aggressive approach to AI development than his predecessor, which is a financial boon for the companies building out that technology. In his AI action plan, which was unveiled in July, Trump and his administration outlined a goal to cut red tape and use government funds to support the construction of data centers.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nFive million users. Eight-figure annual recurring revenue. Twenty thousand new users joining daily. These are some solid numbers for a startup called Turbo AI launched in early 2024 by Rudy Arora and Sarthak Dhawan, two 20-year-old college dropouts.\nMost of this growth has come in the past six months, the founders tell TechCrunch, during which their AI-powered note-taking and study tool grew from one million to five million users, while remaining profitable.\nThey say the idea for Turbo stemmed from a classroom problem many college students face, which is trying to take notes while paying attention to a lecture at the same time.\n“I would always struggle with taking notes because I just couldn’t both listen to the teacher and write at the same time. I just couldn’t do it,” said CEO Dhawan. “Every time I tried to take notes, I’d stop paying attention. And when I listened, I couldn’t take notes. I was like, what if I could use AI?”\nSo the pair built Turbolearn as a side project to allow them to record lectures and automatically generate notes, flashcards, and quizzes. They began sharing it with friends, then it spread to classmates across Duke and Northwestern, where they were enrolled until dropping out this year. Within months, the app had reached other universities, including Harvard and MIT.\nThe product takes the usual note-taker formula—record, transcribe, summarize—and makes it interactive with study notes, quizzes, and flashcards, along with a built-in chat assistant that explains key terms or concepts. \nHowever, recordings in large halls often pick up background noise, so the founders built features that allow students to upload PDFs, lectures, YouTube videos, or readings instead. That’s now a more common use case than live lecture recordings.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Students will upload a 30-page lecture and spend two hours going through 75 quiz questions in a row. You don’t do that unless it’s really working,” said Dhawan, noting that students love how the product saves time and helps them retain information.\nIt’s not just students using Turbo AI, though—as reflected by the name change from Turbolearn (a study app) to Turbo AI (an AI notetaker and learning assistant). Professionals have adopted it too, including consultants, lawyers, doctors, and even analysts at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey, the founders say. Some, for instance, upload reports and use Turbo to generate summaries or convert them into podcasts they can listen to on their commute.\nArora and Dhawan have been friends since middle school and have collaborated on multiple projects over the years. \nDhawan previously built UMax, an advice app that promised to make people more attractive and reached #1 on the App Store with 20 million users and $6 million in annual revenue. Arora, meanwhile, specializes in using social media strategies to drive explosive growth and attract millions of users.\nBuilding viral apps is a rare skill. But despite the scale of their previous projects, the founders only felt the need to drop out for Turbo because they saw an opportunity to build a lasting business. \nStill, unlike many fast-growing AI companies, they’re cautious about raising too much money too early, having taken in only $750,000 last year.\n“We raised that before we had a lot of traction. Since then, we’ve had a lot of inbound interest, but we’re taking our time because we’re cash-flow positive and have been profitable our entire time as a company,” said Arora, who added that their 15-person team is based in Los Angeles and focused on staying close to student and creator communities at colleges like UCLA.\nStudents pay about $20 a month for the product, but the founders say they’re exploring other pricing options to reflect the price sensitivity of students, even as the app scales beyond the target group. “Right now, we’re experimenting with other pricing and running a lot of A/B tests to see what works,” Arora added.\nTurbo AI sits between fully manual tools like Google Docs and fully automated note-takers like Otter or Fireflies. Users can let the AI take notes or write alongside it, the founders say. That approach has helped Turbo stand out even as competitors like Y Combinator–backed YouLearn target similar student audiences.\n“What’s cool now is that when students think of an AI notetaker or AI study tool, we’re the first ones that come to mind,” Dhawan said.\n\n",

    "body": "\nTechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is just days away, with tickets still available here! And there’s no better time to announce that, alongside our flagship event and annual Startup Battlefield 200 competition, we’re launching a brand-new TechCrunch franchise: Build Mode. \nHosted by Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen, Build Mode is a survival guide for early-stage founders navigating the messy, high-stakes chaos of building a company from scratch. No sugarcoating. No hype. Just candid conversations and tactical advice from the people who’ve done it before and have the scars (and term sheets) to prove it. \nStarting November 13, Isabelle will sit down with founders, VCs, and operators to unpack the real stories behind the build. Each season and weekly episodes will tackle a theme that keeps founders up at night: go-to-market chaos, fundraising pressure, runaway runways, hiring misfires, and everything in between.  \nWhether you are an Apple, Spotify, or YouTube person, you can tune in to Build Mode wherever podcasts are found. Bonus content and exclusive clips will drop on TechCrunch’s social channels, including Instagram, X, and TikTok. If you’re not subscribed, well, the clock is ticking until we officially launch in a few weeks! \nCheck out the trailer for Build Mode, and for Season One, right here: \n\n\n\nSeason One of Build Mode kicks off by diving into the good, the bad, and the gritty reality of getting your product into the market. From big splashes to epic fails, we’re unpacking what it really takes to move from idea to execution. And we’re excited to have our Season One sponsor, J.P. Morgan, along with us for the ride.\nBut that’s just the beginning. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWe want Build Mode to be more than a podcast; we want it to be a community of builders helping other builders succeed, just like the 1,700+ startups that have come through the Startup Battlefield program. That means we want to hear from you, the founders, operators, and curious listeners, about the questions and themes that actually keep you up at night. \nWe’ll be weaving community-sourced stories, tips, and questions into upcoming episodes, so stay tuned for how to get involved! \nAnd if you were previously subscribed to our Found podcast — welcome back! You’re already part of the Build Mode community. We’re keeping the Found archive alive so you can revisit founder interviews and insights from past years. No gatekeeping, just honest stories and hard-earned lessons, shared freely for anyone bold enough to build a startup.  \n\n\n\t\tIsabelle leads Startup Battlefield, TechCrunch’s iconic launchpad and competition for the world’s most promising early-stage startups.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Isabelle by emailing isabelle.johannessen@techcrunch.com.\r\n\r\nShe scouts top founders across 99+ countries and prepares them to pitch on the Disrupt stage in front of tier-one investors and global media. Before TechCrunch, she designed and led international startup acceleration programs across Japan, Korea, Italy, and Spain—connecting global founders with VCs and helping them successfully enter the U.S. market. With a Master’s in Entrepreneurship & Disruptive Innovation—and a past life as a professional singer—she brings a blend of strategic rigor and stage presence to help founders craft compelling stories and stand out in crowded markets.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Haje Kamps / TechCrunch\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1:29 PM PDT · October 23, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nRivian’s founder and CEO RJ Scaringe is taking on a new role at his company as part of a restructuring ahead of next year’s launch of the R2 SUV, which involves a layoff of more than 600 employees.  \nScaringe told employees in an email on Thursday that he will be acting as Rivian’s chief marketing officer on an interim basis as the company searches for someone to fill that position for the first time. The head of Rivian’s “marketing experiences” team and the lead of the company’s creative studio will now report directly to Scaringe, according to a copy of the email obtained by TechCrunch.\nIt’s not clear how many direct reports Scaringe already has — a spokesperson declined to comment — though he told the Decoder podcast last year that it was a “large number.”\nThe cuts announced Thursday are Rivian’s third set of layoffs this year. The company let go of around 140 employees on its manufacturing team in June, as TechCrunch first reported at the time. Rivian made a similarly-sized cut to its sales and service operation in September. These layoffs follow a more dramatic 10% reduction of Rivian’s workforce in early 2024.\n“I am writing to share a difficult update,” Scaringe said in Thursday’s email to Rivian employees. “With the launch of R2 in front of us and the need to profitably scale our business, we have made the very difficult decision to make a number of structural adjustments to our teams. These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.”\nScaringe said the “changing operating backdrop” — a nod to the loss of the federal EV tax credit, increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and general headwinds against clean energy projects in the U.S. — forced the company to “rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions.”\nIn addition to Scaringe taking point on Rivian’s marketing and creative divisions, the company is also “streamlining” the customer experience, according to the email. Scaringe said Rivian is moving its “vehicle operations” team and integrating it with the company’s service division. Meanwhile, Rivian’s delivery and “mobile operations” will now live inside the sales division. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese structural changes are being made to “ensure the purchase experience is as seamless as possible with a single touchpoint throughout the entire sales process and to delivery,” he wrote. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Sean by emailing sean.okane@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at okane.01 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

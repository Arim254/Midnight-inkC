When the Chinese government announced its most recent restrictions — which would have required foreign companies to apply for a license to export even a small amount of those minerals — the Trump administration fired back by threatening an additional 100% in tariffs. \nThe White House now says it’s halting plans for those 100% tariffs and pausing other tariffs on Chinese goods for one year.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

    "body": "\nSocial network Bluesky, which on Friday announced a new milestone of 40 million users, will soon start testing “dislikes” as a way to improve personalization on its main Discover feed and others.\nThe news was shared alongside a host of other conversation control updates and changes, which include smaller tweaks to replies, improved detection of toxic comments, and other ways to prioritize more relevant conversations to the individual user.\nWith the “dislikes” beta rolling out soon, Bluesky will take into account the new signal to improve user personalization. As users “dislike” posts, the system will learn what sort of content they want to see less of. This will help to inform more than just how content is ranked in feeds, but also reply rankings.\nThe company explained the changes are designed to make Bluesky a place for more “fun, genuine, and respectful exchanges” — an edict that follows a month of unrest on the platform as some users again criticized the platform over its moderation decisions. While Bluesky is designed as a decentralized network where users run their own moderation, some subset of Bluesky users want the platform itself to ban bad actors and controversial figures instead of leaving it up to the users to block them.\nBluesky, however, wants to focus more on the tools it provides users to control their own experience. \nToday, this includes things like moderation lists that let users quickly block a group of people they don’t want to interact with, content filter controls, muted words, and the ability to subscribe to other moderation service providers. Bluesky also lets users detach quote posts to limit unwanted attention, which has long influenced the toxic culture of “dunking” on X (formerly Twitter).\nIn addition to dislikes, the company says it’s testing a mix of ranking updates, design changes, and other feedback tools to improve the conversations on its network.\nThis includes a new system that will map out the “social neighborhoods” on Bluesky, meaning the connections between people who often interact and reply to one another. Bluesky says it’s prioritizing replies from people “closer to your neighborhood,” to make conversations you’re shown in your feed more relevant and familiar. The new “dislikes” may have some influence here, as well, Bluesky says. \nThis, in particular, is an area where competitor Threads, from Meta, has been challenged at times. \nAs newsletter writer Max Read noted last year, Threads tended to land its users in a confusing feed where conversations they weren’t connected to would appear, sometimes in mid-story. Read remarked that “it’s often impossible to figure out who is replying to whom and where and why you’re seeing certain posts. They appear from nowhere and lead to nowhere,” he wrote at the time.\nBluesky’s plan to map out social neighborhoods could address this issue as it scales.\nThe company also said its latest model does a better job at detecting replies that are “toxic, spammy, off-topic, or posted in bad faith,” and downranks these in threads, search results, and notifications. \nAnother change to the Reply button will now take users to the full thread instead of straight into the compose screen, which may encourage users to read the thread before responding. \nThis, says Bluesky, is a simple way to “reduce content collapse and redundant replies” — another criticism that tends to be levied at Twitter/X.\nPlus, the company is tweaking the reply settings feature to make it more visible to users that they can control who is allowed to respond to their posts.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoogle says it has removed Gemma from its AI Studio after a U.S. senator accused the AI model of fabricating accusations of sexual misconduct against her.\nIn a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Senator Marsha Blackburn — a Republican from Tennessee — said that when Gemma was asked, “Has Marsha Blackburn been accused of rape?” it responded by falsely claiming that during a 1987 state senate campaign, a state trooper alleged that Blackburn “pressured him to obtain prescription drugs for her and that the relationship involved non-consensual acts.”\n“None of this is true, not even the campaign year which was actually 1998,” Blackburn wrote. While there are links to news articles that supposedly support these claims, she said, “The links lead to error pages and unrelated news articles. There has never been such an accusation, there is no such individual, and there are no such news stories.”\nThe letter also said that during a recent Senate Commerce hearing, Blackburn brought up conservative activist Robby Starbuck’s lawsuit against Google, in which Starbuck claims Google’s AI models (including Gemma) generated defamatory claims about him being a “child rapist” and “serial sexual abuser.”\nAs recounted in Blackburn’s letter, Google’s Vice President for Government Affairs and Public Policy Markham Erickson responded that hallucinations are a known issue and Google is “working hard to mitigate them.”\nBlackburn’s letter argued that on the contrary, Gemma’s fabrications are “not a harmless ‘hallucination,’” but rather “an act of defamation produced and distributed by a Google-owned AI model.”\nPresident Donald Trump’s tech industry supporters have complained that “AI censorship” causes popular chatbots to show a liberal bias, and Trump even signed an executive order banning “woke AI” earlier this year. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile Blackburn hasn’t always backed the Trump administration’s tech policies — she helped to strip a moratorium on state-level AI regulation from Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” — she echoed those complaints in her letter, writing that there’s “a consistent pattern of bias against conservative figures demonstrated by Google’s AI systems.”\nIn a Friday night post on X, Google did not reference the specifics of Blackburn’s letter, but the company said it’s “seen reports of non-developers trying to use Gemma in AI Studio and ask it factual questions.”\n“We never intended this to be a consumer tool or model, or to be used this way,” the company said. (Google promotes Gemma as a family of open, lightweight models that developers can integrate into their own products, while AI Studio is the company’s web-based development environment for AI-powered apps.)\nAs a result, Google said it’s removing Gemma from AI Studio while continuing to make the models available via API.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Google for additional comment.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that the company is doing “well more” than $13 billion in annual revenue — and he sounded a little testy when pressed on how it will pay for its massive spending commitments.\nHis comments came up during a joint interview on the Bg2 podcast between Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the partnership between their companies. Host Brad Gerstner (who’s also founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital) brought up reports that OPenAI is currently bringing in around $13 billion in revenue — a sizable amount, but one that’s dwarfed by more than $1 trillion in spending commitments for computing infrastructure that OpenAI has made for the next decade.\n“First of all, we’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” Altman said, prompting laughs from Nadella. “I just — enough. I think there are a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares.”\n“Including myself,” Gerstner interjected.\nAltman then added that there are critics who “talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy our shares.”\nIn fact, he said that although there are “not many times” when he wants OpenAI to be a public company, “One of the rare times it’s appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous ‘OpenAI is about to go out of business’ [posts], I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that.”\nAltman acknowledged that there are ways the company “might screw it up” — for example by failing to get access to enough computing resources — but he said that “revenue is growing steeply.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We are taking a forward bet that it will continue to grow, and that not only will ChatGPT keep growing, but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds, that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing, that AI that can automate science will create huge value,” he added.\nNadella also claimed that OpenAI has “beaten” every business plan that it’s given Microsoft as an investor.\nGerstner returned to the subject of OpenAI’s revenues and IPO plans later in the interview, when he speculated about the company reaching $100 billion in revenue in 2028 or 2029.\n“How about ‘27?” Altman countered.\nAt the same time, he denied reports that OpenAI plans to go public next year.\n“No no no, we don’t have anything that specific,” Altman said. “I’m a realist, I assume it will happen someday, but I don’t know why people write these reports. We don’t have a date in mind, we don’t have a board decision to do this or anything like that. I just assume it’s where things will eventually go.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nIn the midst of an unprecedented AI buildout, Meta is spending more than most. The company is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years.  \nThose figures might not raise eyebrows in Silicon Valley, but they’re starting to make Wall Street nervous. \nThe issue came to a head this week as Meta reported quarterly earnings, which showed the company’s operating expenses jumping $7 billion year-over-year and nearly $20 billion in capital expense. It was the result of intense spending on AI talent and infrastructure, which has yet to bring in meaningful revenue for the company. When analysts pressed for more specifics, Mark Zuckerberg made it clear the spending was just getting started. \n“The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we’re doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business,” Zuckerberg told analysts on the call. “Our view is that when we get the new models that we’re building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don’t have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity.” \nIf his goal was to reassure investors, it didn’t work. By the end of the call, Meta’s share price had plummeted in value. Two days later, the rout has only deepened. The Meta’s stock dropped 12% by the closing bell on Friday, representing more than $200 billion in lost market cap. \nIt’s dangerous to read too much into stock prices, and in strict financial terms, Meta’s quarterly earnings weren’t that bad. ($20 billion in quarterly profit is nothing to complain about.) But this was the first quarter in which Meta’s aggressive AI spending on both talent and infrastructure had a visible impact on the company’s bottom line. Even more alarming was that, aside from a lot of enormous data centers and well-compensated AI researchers, it wasn’t clear what the money actually bought.  \nAnalysts pressed Zuckerberg on why he was spending so much on AI, and when they could expect to see revenue from the growing spending. But the call came at an odd spot in Meta’s planning, with no clear budget for projected spending and no available product that could anchor a revenue forecast. As a result, Zuckerberg was left with only general claims about the promise of AI.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“There are going to be all kinds of new products around different content formats, and we’re starting to see that,” he asid during the call. “And then there are the business versions of all these too, like business A … the other part is how more intelligent models are just going to improve the core business and improve the recommendations that we make across the Family of Apps and improve the recommendations in advertising.” \nMeta isn’t the only company spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure, so it’s worth teasing out why this same spending isn’t spooking investors at Google or Nvidia, both of which had a great quarter. OpenAI is the biggest offender, spending the same amount with far less financial cushion than Meta.  \nThere really are concerns that we’re creating a bubble, and if we are, Meta’s core business will let it ride things out better than most. \nBut if you ask Sam Altman why he’s spending hundreds of billions of dollars on compute, he’ll tell you he’s operating one of the fastest growing consumer services in human history — and one bringing in $20 billion a year in revenue. We can argue about how sustainable the growth rate is (that’s a separate blog post), but there really is a fast-growing product at the bottom of all the OpenAI hype. A fast-growing ARR figure goes a long way to answer questions. \nMeta doesn’t have a product like that, and it’s not clear where it’s going to come from.  \nThe company’s most powerful AI product is the Meta AI assistant, which Zuckerberg noted on the call has more than a billion active users. But those numbers are surely juiced by the three billion active users on Facebook and Instagram, and it’s hard to see the current version of Meta AI as a competitor to ChatGPT. There’s also the Vibes video generator, which really did boost daily active users, but has limited business impact beyond that.  \nThe most ambitious project is the Vanguard smart glasses released earlier this month. However, the glasses feel more like an extension of Meta’s Reality Labs work than a real attempt to harness the power of LLMs.  \nPut simply, these are promising experiments, not fully formed products. \nIt’s telling then that when he was pressed on infrastructure spending, Zuckerberg’s response wasn’t to point to the recent launches, but to focus on the next generation. \nZuckerberg stressed, while emphasizing the pending impact of the Superintelligence Lab’s new models, that he was very excited about new products.  \n“It’s not just Meta AI as an assistant,” he said. “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it.”  \nBut this was an earnings call, not a product launch, so all he could say was that there would be more to share “in the coming months.” \nAs the market response showed that answer is wearing thin.  \nTo be fair, it’s only been four months since Zuckerberg restructured his company’s AI team, and the new Superintelligence team hasn’t had time to launch an earthshaking AI product yet. But as the company spends billions of dollars to stay competitive in AI, there’s still no clear indication of what role Zuckerberg wants to play in the new industry.  \nWill Meta AI use the company’s detailed store of personal data to grow into a ChatGPT competitor? Is Vibes the first step in a consumer entertainment play, building off Meta’s targeted ad system? Or maybe Zuckerberg’s references to “business AI” are hints at a more detailed enterprise play? \nSo far, it’s anyone’s guess. Whatever the answer, the pressure is on Meta to find it — and soon. \n",

    "description": "\nAs tech companies tout their plans for massive new data centers, consumers are increasingly worried the AI-driven gold rush will ultimately drive up ",
    "body": "\nAs tech companies tout their plans for massive new data centers, consumers are increasingly worried the AI-driven gold rush will ultimately drive up the price they pay for electricity, according to a new survey.\nThe report, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that 80% of consumers are worried about the impact of data centers on their utility bills.\nConsumers’ concerns aren’t unfounded.\nElectricity demand in the United States held steady for over a decade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Over the last five years, commercial users including data centers and industrial users began drinking more deeply from the grid, with annual growth rising 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, residential use only grew by 0.7% annually.\nData centers today consume about 4% of the electricity generated in the United States, more than double their share in 2018. By 2028, consumption is forecasted to rise to 6.7% to 12%, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\nGeneration has managed to meet demand thanks to a surge in new capacity from solar, wind, and grid-scale battery storage. Big tech companies have been inking large deals for new utility-scale solar, in particular, attracted by the energy source’s low cost, modularity, and speed to power. Solar farms can start delivering power to data centers before they’re completed, and a new project typically takes around 18 months to complete. \nThe EIA expects renewables to dominate new generating capacity through at least the next year. The trend likely would have extended beyond 2026, but experts predict a Republican repeal of key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act will hamper the renewables’ growth.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeanwhile, natural gas, another source of energy favored by data center operators, hasn’t met the moment. Production has been rising, but most of the new supplies have gone toward feeding exports rather than the domestic market. Consumption by electricity generators rose by 20% between 2019 and 2024, while exporters consumed 140% more.\nNew natural gas power plants won’t be ready in time, either, since they take around four years to complete, according to the International Energy Agency. A backlog of turbines used by gas-fired power plants has only compounded the problem. Manufacturers are quoting delivery dates up to seven years out, and newly announced production capacity is unlikely to change things.\nSlow natural gas buildouts coupled with kneecapped renewables have put data center developers in a bind.\nWhile AI and data centers aren’t entirely responsible for increasing electricity demand — industrial users have been nearly as thirsty — they’ve been leading the headlines. \nAI is likely to be the focus of consumers’ ire: More people are concerned about the technology than excited about it, according to a Pew survey. No surprise given that many employers have been wielding the tool as a way to cut headcount rather than improve augment employee productivity.\nThrow rising energy prices into the mix, and you can begin to see how a backlash might be brewing.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Thursday, at the end of Coinbase’s third quarter earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong admitted that he was “a little bit distracted,” because he’d been “tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call.”\n“And I just want to add here the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, Blockchain, Staking, and Web3 to make sure we get those in before the end of the call,” Armstrong added.\nWhy blurt those out without any apparent context? As Armstrong hinted, they were words that users on Kalshi and Polymarket “mention markets” had wagered would be spoken on the call. So by speaking the words, Armstrong was allowing some of those bets to pay off.\nBloomberg reports that while mention markets remain a relatively niche part of prediction markets, a total of $84,000 had been bet on whether certain words would be spoken on the cryptocurrency company’s call. And while Armstrong may have helped some Kalshi and Polymarket users make a little money, he was also illustrating how easily these markets can be manipulated when executives become aware of them.\nIn fact, Jeff Dorman, CIO at digital assets investment firm Arca, wrote on X that “you need your head examined if you think it’s cute or clever or savvy that the CEO of the biggest company in this industry openly manipulated a market.”\n“It’s not fun working tirelessly for 8 years trying to educate institutional investors on the value of crypto investing as an investable asset class, and working to help them gain comfort in this industry, while one of the supposed ‘leaders’ openly mocks the industry with crap like this,” Dorman said.\nPolymarket, meanwhile, posted that Armstrong’s comments were “diabolical work.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCoinbase is moving into supporting prediction markets itself through its Everything Exchange, which Armstrong touted on the earnings call, and the company has also invested in Kalshi and Polymarket. A Coinbase spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company prohibits employees from participating in prediction markets or related activity around the company.\nAfter Armstrong’s remarks began drawing attention, he wrote on X, “lol this was fun – happened spontaneously when someone on our team dropped a link in the chat.”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

The latest exchange began when Altman posted what he called “a tale in three acts,” with screenshots showing that he reserved a Tesla Roadster in 2018, then recently tried to cancel it and request a refund on his $50,000 reservation fee, only for his email to bounce.\n“I really was excited for the car!” Altman wrote. “And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.”\nThe second-generation Roadster sports car was first announced in November 2017 but has been repeatedly pushed back, with Musk (Tesla’s CEO) recently saying that a new version will be unveiled by the end of this year.\nMusk first responded to Altman’s post by writing, “You stole a nonprofit,” a criticism that he’s directed at Altman and OpenAI before — not just in tweets, but also with lawsuits and takeover bids seeking to stymie OpenAI’s attempts to restructure as a for-profit company (a process that OpenAI recently completed, with its non-profit arm still retaining control over the for-profit public benefit corporation).\nMusk even started a rival AI startup, xAI, which is suing OpenAI and Apple over allegations that the two companies are colluding to stifle competition. (Altman said the accusation is “remarkable … given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.”)\nIn addition to repeating his criticism of Altman and OpenAI, Musk also suggested today that Altman’s screenshots didn’t tell the full story.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“And you forgot to mention act 4, where this issue was fixed and you received a refund within 24 hours,” Musk wrote. “But that is in your nature.”\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nMeta signed three deals this week to procure nearly 1 gigawatt of solar power as it races to power its lofty AI ambitions.\nThe trio of agreements brings Meta’s total solar purchases to over 3 gigawatts of capacity this year. Solar is cheap and quick to build, and as a result, it has become a go-to power source for tech companies as their data center fleets multiply in size.\nMeta yesterday announced two agreements in Louisiana that see it buying the environmental attributes of a combined 385 megawatts of electricity. Both projects are expected to be completed two years from now.\nThey follow on the heels of a larger deal announced Monday in which Meta bought 600 megawatts from a massive solar farm near Lubbock, Texas. The project will also start commercial operations in 2027.\nWhile the Texas power plant won’t connect directly to Meta data centers, it will feed into the local grid, offsetting use by the facilities.\nThe Louisiana deals, though, involve purchasing of certificates that allow Meta to offset its carbon-intensive sources of power. \nSuch environmental attribute certificates (EACs), sometimes called renewable energy certificates, have been criticized by experts for obscuring the true carbon footprint of tech companies’ operations, which have ballooned as AI has driven up electricity use.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEACs were introduced years ago when renewables were costly relative to fossil fuel generators. They let anyone buy the electricity, but also gave companies an option to pay extra to offset their own emissions — and offset the higher costs of renewable power. They helped encourage developers to build more renewable projects.\nBut the cost of new solar and wind has dropped dramatically since then, with renewables undercutting new fossil power and sometimes existing coal and natural gas power plants. EACs don’t provide the same incentive as before, and experts question how much additional renewable power they stimulate. \nIf companies truly want to offset their new energy use from AI, they should be encouraging developers to build new renewable capacity, experts argue.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Friday morning, University of Pennsylvania alumni, students, staff, and community affiliates received several emails from hackers purporting to represent the university’s Graduate School of Education (GSE).\n“We have terrible security practices and are completely unmeritocratic,” read the email. “We love breaking federal rules like FERPA (all your data will be leaked).” \nA partially redacted email sent by hackers with access to the university of Pennsylvania email system.Image Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\nThis message was sent from a variety of different Penn-affiliated email accounts, such as the GSE, as well as purporting to come from several senior members of staff across the university.\nOther Penn affiliates have received the email multiple times from different senders with official @upenn.edu email addresses. (Disclosure: As an alumna and former employee of the university, I have received the message three times thus far to my personal email.)\nPenn spokesperson Ron Ozio told TechCrunch in an email on Friday that the school’s incident response team is “actively addressing” the situation.\n“A fraudulent email has been circulated that appears to come from the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. This is obviously a fake, and nothing in the highly offensive, hurtful message reflects the mission or actions of Penn or of Penn GSE,” Ozio said.\nAs the hackers plainly stated in their message (“Please stop giving us money”), this breach appears motivated to suppress alumni donations. The breach also comes soon after the university publicly rebuffed the White House’s offer to make commitments aligned with the Trump administration’s political agenda in exchange for federal funding. Penn and six other schools have rejected the White House’s proposal.\nThe White House’s “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” asks universities to abolish affirmative action in hiring and admissions, and to discipline departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.” \nCompact signatories would also be required to freeze tuition for five years, offer tuition-free education to students pursuing “hard sciences,” cap international undergrad enrollment at 15%, and require standardized tests like the SAT for admission. \nThe compact also mandates that schools enforce policies that marginalize transgender and gender non-conforming students.\n“[The compact] preferences and mandates protections for the communication of conservative thought alone,” wrote Penn president J. Larry Jameson in his response to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, which was published on the university’s website.\n“One-sided conditions conflict with the viewpoint diversity and freedom of expression that are central to how universities contribute to democracy and to society,” wrote Jameson.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nCore Scientific shareholders on Thursday voted down an all-stock acquisition offer from partner and competitor CoreWeave that was valued at the time at $9 billion.  \nThey did so following a vote-no recommendation from their largest shareholder, Sina Toussi of Two Seas Capital, a firm that focuses on post-bankruptcy companies. Core Scientific emerged from its bankruptcy in January 2024.  \nCore Scientific, which began as a crypto miner and still is one, shares that early history with AI data center provider CoreWeave, which also started as a miner.  \nBut CoreWeave, with investor and partner Nvidia, has now transitioned to serving AI workloads. From its IPO until now, its stock has soared from a $14 billion market cap to $66 billion today (about $140 per share) as investors view it as a way to get in on the AI action. It has been spending those shares on acquisitions.  \nCoreWeave had already signed a $10 billion, 12-year contract with Core Scientific to use its facilities for AI services, even as it nailed down a deal announced in July to buy the company outright. The offer was a premium to Core Scientific’s share price at the time.\nBut investor Toussi thinks Core Scientific can turn into another CoreWeave on its own.  “Since the transaction was announced in July, investment in AI infrastructure has accelerated, driving equity valuations of Core Scientific’s peers to ever-greater heights,” he wrote in his opposition letter. “Why would anyone vote for a transaction worth a mere $16.40 per share?” \nSo investors turned down the deal and CoreWeave walked. Core Scientific’s stock rose on the news, and the company is now trading at a $6.6 billion market cap. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInvestors turning down acquisition bids in pursuit of bigger offers is another sign that we’re in — or at least headed for — an AI bubble. \nMeanwhile, CoreWeave is still shopping. On Thursday, it turned around and acquired Marimo, an open source Jupyter Notebook competitor, for an undisclosed sum. PitchBook estimates Marimo has raised about $5 million.\nPython notebooks are dev tools that combine code, rich media, and explanatory text into a single, shareable file. They’re often used for interactive data analysis as well as AI app development, helping CoreWeave as it attempts to move up the stack from hosting to AI app building.\n",

    "body": "\nAmazon’s cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is on track to record its strongest year of growth in three years, fueled by the AI industry’s unprecedented demand for computing power.\nAWS is growing 20% year-over-year and ended the third quarter with $33.1 billion in sales through the first nine months of the year, Amazon announced in its third-quarter earnings release on Thursday. The business segment’s operating income increased to $11.4 billion in Q3, up from $10.4 billion at the same point in 2024.\n“AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY,” Andy Jassy, the president and CEO of Amazon, said in the company’s earnings announcement. “We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”\nAWS launched an infrastructure region in New Zealand during the quarter and has three more regions in the pipeline.\nThe cloud infrastructure provider also secured several new deals in Q3 across a variety of industries, including a few notable names in the AI market. In July, AWS partnered with Perplexity to launch the AI browser company’s enterprise product. AWS also partnered with Cursor during the third quarter.\nThe intense infrastructure demands of AI have also been a boon to AWS’s competitors. OpenAI and Oracle allegedly inked a massive $300 billion cloud compute deal in September that will start in 2027. The pair also made a deal for OpenAI to pay Oracle $30 billion a year for data center services. Last week, Google and Anthropic announced a cloud deal worth tens of billions of dollars.\nThese huge deals come despite skepticism of how much cloud infrastructure will actually be needed in the future and if the industry is heading into bubble territory. However, it does makes sense for cloud companies like AWS to take advantage of a market where customers are willing to pay big sums for their services.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“You’re going to see us continue to be very aggressive in investing capacity because we see the demand,” Jassy said about investing in AI infrastructure. “As fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”\nThis news comes two days after Amazon announced it was slashing 14,000 corporate jobs, as it looks to invest more in its AI strategy.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAlphabet’s X moonshot factory is shifting how it brings ambitious technology projects to market, increasingly spinning them out as independent companies rather than keeping them within the Alphabet corporate structure, X’s head honcho, Astro Teller, revealed at TechCrunch Disrupt this past week.\nThe strategy hinges on a dedicated venture fund that exists solely to invest in X spinouts, and in which Alphabet is only a minority investor. “If Alphabet was the sole LP, the fund would be inside of Alphabet, and then when they invested in something from X, it would still be inside Alphabet,” Teller explained onstage. “So Alphabet can be a small LP, but if it’s more than a small LP, we undo the thing that we’re trying to accomplish.”\nThat fund is Series X Capital, which has raised over $500 million and is run by Gideon Yu, a former YouTube executive and Facebook CFO. Bloomberg first reported the fund’s existence last year. Unlike Alphabet’s other investment arms — GV, which invests broadly in early-stage startups; CapitalG, which backs growth-stage companies; and Gradient Ventures, which invests in AI startups — Series X Capital is legally obligated to invest exclusively in companies spinning out of X.\nThe approach represents a meaningful evolution for X, which has historically graduated successful projects like Waymo and Wing into standalone Alphabet subsidiaries. Teller said the lab has learned over the past decade that while some moonshots benefit from Alphabet’s resources and scale, others “can go faster and won’t really benefit from being part of Alphabet because they’re just so different.”\n“Landing it just outside the Alphabet membrane, where we can be very tight with them, get a lot of strategic co-benefit with them, but not necessarily control them, makes sense,” he said.At Disrupt, Teller explained that the spinout strategy only works because of X’s ruthless approach to intellectual honesty, including a culture that actively celebrates killing off promising ideas.\nX defines a moonshot as having three specific components: it must attempt to solve a huge problem in the world, propose some kind of product or service that could make that problem disappear, and leverage breakthrough tech that creates a “glimmer of hope” that the team inside X can solve that problem. Critically, Teller said, “if someone is proposing a moonshot and it sounds reasonable, the company isn’t interested, because that, by definition, wouldn’t be a moonshot.”\nWhat happens to ideas that meet these criteria? X tests them ruthlessly, looking for reasons to kill them, Teller said. “If you propose something and it sounds pretty wild, that has those three components, and it’s a testable hypothesis, for a small amount of money, we can learn something about whether it’s a little bit more crazy than we thought, or a little bit less crazy than we thought,” Teller explained. “If it’s a little bit more crazy than we thought, cool, high five, let’s put a bullet in its head and move on.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis approach requires detaching people from their ideas, which is why Teller said he doesn’t even know who started most projects at X, including Waymo, the self-driving car company, and Wing, the drone delivery company now dropping off Walmart packages in roughly six U.S. cities. “If we’re going to go exploring something, and you [as the lead inventor] feel like ‘this is my baby,’ what are the chances I get you to practice real intellectual honesty?” he told the Disrupt audience.\nIn practice, this means X tackles the hardest parts of projects first, actively looking for reasons to shut them down. The result is a brutal 2% hit rate that Teller frames not as failure but as feature. X has killed off far more projects than it has launched, including entire categories that once seemed promising, like copywriting AI tools that foundation models eventually absorbed.All that testing and failing can be expensive. The spinout structure solves a practical problem: while X previously had to find outside venture investors willing to take over at least 51% of a business to spin it out of Alphabet, by creating a fund that “deeply understands us” and is “legally obligated only to invest in things that come from us,” said Teller, X can systematize the spinout process while maintaining close strategic ties.\nDespite the emphasis on detachment from ideas, X employees do have significant skin in the game when projects spin out. For those working on projects headed for independence, the financial incentive is substantial. “You and the rest of your team are going to get a chunk of that company,” Teller said. “It is about as much as you would have gotten if you had started from your garage at that stage of funding, but without taking any risk in the meantime.”\nThe pitch to potential X employees is explicit about this trade-off too. “Your four or five standard deviation upside is going to be bigger on the outside, I’m granting you that,” Teller said at Disrupt. “But if you come to X, what you get to do is be a card counter of innovation with us, with no fear and no financial risk to yourself.”\nX employees are paid like other Google employees, with no equity in early-stage projects, because “it isn’t even a company; it’s an idea we’re trying to learn about,” Teller explained. This removes the financial pressure that prevents founders from killing their own ideas. “You can say, ‘Hey, this one’s not pulling our average up, let’s throw this one away,’” Teller explained. “And because you haven’t bet your kids’ college fund on that, that doesn’t scare you.”\nX has spun out at least two companies in 2025: Taara, which develops wireless optical communication technology, and Heritable Agriculture, a biotech company using machine learning to accelerate crop breeding. Previous spinouts that raised external funding include Malta (renewable energy storage), Dandelion (geothermal heating), and iyO (AI-powered earbuds).\nOn the eve of Disrupt, X announced its newest moonshot company: Anori, a “new AI platform to help real estate developers, the architecture and construction industries, and cities untangle the complexities of new building projects,” as it describes itself. Asked onstage about what makes this particular AI platform a “moonshot,” Teller pointed to the size of the problem — and opportunity.\n“The built environment is about 25% of the world’s solid waste, [and] about 25% of the world’s [carbon dioxide] output. It’s literally on the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs — it’s where we live, where we spend most of our time. It’s a big chunk of the world’s GDP output. So it would be hard for it to matter more as an industry.”\nYou can catch our entire conversation with Teller here, beginning at the 6:08 minute mark.\n",

    "body": "\nKevin Rose has a visceral rule for evaluating AI hardware investments: “If you feel like you should punch someone in the face for wearing it, you probably shouldn’t invest in it.”\nIt’s a typically candid assessment from the veteran investor, and one born from watching the current wave of AI hardware startups repeat mistakes he’s seen before. Rose, a general partner at True Ventures and early investor in Peloton, Ring, and Fitbit, has largely avoided the AI hardware gold rush that’s consumed Silicon Valley. While other VCs rush to fund the next smart glasses or AI pendant, Rose is taking a decidedly different approach.\n“A lot of it is just like, ‘Let’s listen to the entire conversation,’” Rose says of the current crop of AI wearables. “And to me, that breaks a lot of these social constructs that we have with humans around privacy.”Rose speaks from experience. He was on the board of Oura, which now commands 80% of the smart ring market, and he’s witnessed firsthand what separates successful wearables from failed ones. The difference isn’t just technical capability; it’s emotional resonance and social acceptability.\n“As an investor, you kind of have to not only say, okay, cool tech, sure, but emotionally, how does it make me feel? And how does it make others feel around me?” he explained on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt last week. “And for me, a lot of that is lost in all the AI stuff, where it’s just always on, always listening, trying to be the smartest person in the room. And it’s just not healthy.”\nHe admits to trying various AI wearables himself, including the failed Humane AI pendant that briefly caught the world’s attention a year ago. But the breaking point came during an argument with his wife. “I was like, I know I didn’t say that. And I was trying to use it to actually win an argument,” he recalled. “That was the last time I wore that thing. You do not want to win a battle by going back and looking at the logs of your AI pin. That doesn’t fly.”\nThe tourist use case — asking your glasses what monument you’re looking at — isn’t good enough, Rose said. “We tend to bolt AI onto everything and it’s ruining the world,” he said, pointing to features like photo apps that let you erase people from the background. “I had a friend who erased a gate from behind him to make the picture look better. I’m like, ‘That’s your yard! Your kids are gonna look at that and be like, ‘Didn’t we have a gate there?’”\nRose worries we’re in an “early days of social media” moment with AI — making decisions that seem harmless now but will haunt us later. “We’re gonna look back and be like, ‘Wow, that was weird. We just slapped AI on everything, and thought it was a good idea,’ similar to what happened in the early days of social. We look back a decade or two later, and you’re like, ‘I wish I would have done that differently.’”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe’s experiencing these tensions firsthand with his young children. Using OpenAI’s video generation tool Sora to create videos of tiny Labradoodles, his kids asked where they could get those puppies. “I’m like, that’s not really Dad there. How do you have that conversation? Very awkward,” he says. His solution, he said, is treating AI like movie magic, explaining that just as actors aren’t really flying on screen, Dad’s puppies aren’t real either.\nBut Rose isn’t a Luddite. He’s deeply optimistic about how AI is transforming entrepreneurship itself, and by extension, the venture capital industry that funds it.\n“The barriers to entry for entrepreneurs are just shrinking with every day that goes by,” Rose observed. He recounted a colleague who had never used AI coding tools before building and deploying a complete app during a drive from LA to San Francisco. Six months ago, the same task would have taken ten times as long and required navigating dozens of errors.\n“In three months, when [Google’s] Gemini 3 hits the market, there’s going to be zero errors or next to it,” Rose predicted. “High school coding classes are no longer coding classes — they’re vibe coding classes, and they will build the next billion-dollar business launched out of some random high school. It will happen. It’s just a matter of time.”\nThese developments utterly change the venture capital equation, Rose said. Entrepreneurs can now delay fundraising until they absolutely need it, or potentially skip raising outside funding altogether. “It’s really going to change the world of VC, and I think for the better,” Rose said.\nMany venture firms have responded by hiring armies of engineers—Sequoia Capital, for instance, now employs as many developers as investors. But Rose doesn’t think that’s the answer. Instead, he believes the value proposition for VCs shifts to something more fundamental. “At the end of the day, the entrepreneur is going to have issues that are not technical,” he argued. “They’re very emotional problems. And so I think the VCs with the highest EQ that can show up best for the founders as their long term partner — that have been with firms and aren’t hopping around, that aren’t just fly-by-night VCs but have been around and seen these problems at scale — they’re going to be sought after.”So what does Rose look for when making investments? He circles back to something Larry Page told him years ago when Rose was at Google Ventures, his first institutional investing job after co-founding the social news platform Digg and before joining True Ventures in 2017. “A healthy disregard for the impossible is what’s important to look for.”\n“We want founders that aren’t just sanding down the rough edges, but they’re really swinging for the fences with big, bold ideas that everyone else says, ‘That is a horrible idea. Why are you doing this?’” Rose said. “That’s what I’m drawn to. Because even if it doesn’t work, we love your mind. We love where you are, and we gladly back you the second time.”\n",

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday morning at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, our senior producer Maggie Nye rolled up her jacket sleeve to show me her new tattoo: a classic, pixelated cursor arrow. TechCrunch’s Becca Szkutak got a matching cursor, while Theresa Loconsolo got a smiling moon.\nI guessed that at some point during all the Disrupt hoopla, Maggie and Becca wandered off to some trendy San Francisco tattoo shop to cement their friendship with appropriately tech-themed ink (and maybe Theresa was there too?). That seemed like a more logical explanation than the reality, which is that they got these tattoos at Disrupt — yes, literally at Disrupt, on the Moscone Center’s convention floor, while upstairs, there was probably a talk going on about product-market fit or agentic AI.\nHundreds of startups showed their stuff in the Expo Hall as part of the Battlefield 200 — there’s robo chefs, spacecraft insurance providers, a shortcut for recycling plastic — and then amid the chaos, Tattd turned their booth into a mini tattoo shop.\nMaggie’s tattoo.Image Credits:TechCrunch\nTattd is a platform that helps tattoo seekers find artists whose portfolios match the kind of tattoo they’re looking for. \nThe startup uses generative AI to create a mockup of a design, but these synthetic designs aren’t actually getting inked on anyone’s body. Rather, Tattd puts the AI-generated design through a reverse image search to find an artist whose work resembles the mock-up, so that the client and artist can work together to create an original design, as one normally would when they get connected with a tattoo artist.\n“If you go to ChatGPT and say something like, ‘I want to see a butterfly in a Japanese traditional style with heavier lines,’ they don’t know what that means,” founder Laura Schaack told TechCrunch.\nJust feet away, TechCrunch deputy managing editor Karyne Levy was getting an escape key tattooed on her upper arm.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nKaryne’s tattoo.Image Credits:TechCrunch\nBefore founding Tattd, Schaack led operations for two startups: WearAway, a fashion rental company acquired by Grin, and Lemonsqueeze, a market expansion platform acquired by Knotel. But Schaack has always had an eye for the arts. She studied art history at New York University, and her body is decorated with a collage of tattoos — at Disrupt, she got a California postage stamp by her elbow.\n“There is a number of people that have tried to enter the tattoo industry without tattoos, and they have all failed,” Schaack said. While you can’t judge a founder by their appearance, she says that their lack of tattoos reflected their lack of interest, investment, or experience in the industry.\n“I’m so deeply passionate about this industry, I’m heavily tattooed, and I’m here to support artists to build businesses in a way that both the client and the artist are taken care of,” she said. There are 900 artists on Tattd, and the platform partners with a third party to help them find healthcare and financial advisers.\nTattd’s flash sheet.Image Credits:TechCrunch\nSchaack said that around 30 people got tattoos throughout the three days of TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThere was a TechCrunch logo on the flash sheet, but (un)fortunately, no one inked their love for our brand on their body.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "Once the settings are properly adjusted, though, this keyboard performs incredibly well. The actuation distance of each switch can be manually adjusted, meaning it can register a key-press anywhere from the very top of the key-press to the very bottom, and multiple inputs can even be mapped at different distances. The keyboard is responsive, with an 8,000-Hz polling rate, and the low latency barely produces any significant input lag.This keyboard is wired-only, which might be a dealbreaker for some. It’s a fairly dense, all-metal keyboard that has a significant focus on high-speed use, none of which is necessary for a portable keyboard. While wireless would be nice, it would increase the price of this keyboard and its complexity.The RGB lighting has over 20 built-in presets, and all of them work well, but the color isn’t perfect. When adjusting the lighting settings, nearly all of them seem to skew heavily toward a cyan/blue tint. This is presumably because of the Magnetic Jade switches’ light blue housing, which is unavoidable without using different switches, but even without switches, the LED diodes seem to be slightly cooler than a true neutral white.These effects combine to make a keyboard that struggles to have a pure white color even with serious tweaking, especially since the RGB adjustments easily get overwhelmed and start to lag when moving your cursor around on the color wheel. The closest I could get to a pure white was with an RGB setting of [255, 60, 90], which still had a slightly cool tint to it. When set to the “breathe” setting at a low speed with this color, the lighting was choppy as it faded out, and slowly shifted to be red as it became darker instead of maintaining the preset color. When set to a faster speed and using a more standard color setting (like solid blue or green), these quirks disappeared.Internal AssemblyPhotograph: Henri RobbinsThe internal assembly is rather simple: The printed circuit board (PCB) and switch plate are screwed together, sandwiching a sheet of silicone between them. This silicone fills the empty space between the plate and PCB, and extends past on the outside edge to create gaskets that the two halves of the case hold in place. With this, the internal assembly is held in place without making direct contact with the outside case, reducing vibration and excess noise.",

    "body": "Do you want an iPad Pro? Or do you want a MacBook? That’s a line that has been increasingly blurring these past few years, and while the two machines still aren’t on par—the M5 MacBook Pro’s extra fans and higher clock speeds can deliver more oomph—the latest iteration of Apple's flagship tablet feels more capable than ever, thanks to drastic changes in iPadOS 26.The changes are not massive when compared to an M4-powered iPad Pro. Heck, most of this tablet is largely the same as its predecessor. It still feels niche—the 13-inch model I’m typing on starts at $1,299, and that’s without Apple’s Magic Keyboard case, while the 11-inch is $999. Few will really need and appreciate the power gains of the M5 in the iPad Pro; most will be perfectly happy with the iPad Air. Still, if money is no object and you want the best slate that excels in every category, from entertainment to work, there’s not much competition at this level.Windowing AppsPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuiPads have had so much power, but the operating system felt hampered, so much so that it was hard to see it as a viable laptop replacement (I’m sure many folks have been able to replace their clamshells just fine). But iPadOS 26 brought a solution that makes these machines much more capable: windowed apps. This isn’t a feature exclusive to the M5 iPad Pro, but it works the best on a big screen, and your only options there are the iPad Pro or iPad Air. I want to take a second to appreciate it.You can fling apps to the sides for easy split-screen, resize apps to whatever shape or size, or just go completely full screen if you want. It feels more malleable to how you want to work, much like a desktop. I thought I’d miss Slide Over, where I can keep one app hovering over and to the side, but I didn’t. (Good news, Apple is reintroducing Slide Over in iPadOS 26.1, so you can have the best of both.)I have been working off this machine over the past few days, and I feel as though I’ve been able to work faster than I ever have before on an iPad. That’s not specifically because of this tablet’s performance, more so because it feels fluid to operate, thanks to the interface changes. That’s not to say there aren’t any oddities. In WIRED’s content management system in Safari, I still run into weird display issues, and every time I hop to another app and back, the cursor likes to move all the way to the top of the story, which is annoying.However, the advanced Files app is nicer to use, being able to mark up PDFs in the Preview app is a godsend, and having the traffic lights on every app to quickly minimize them makes for a more natural experience. (I still have to get used to the Menu Bar being on the iPad, though.)Photograph: Julian ChokkattuI worked predominantly on cellular with no issues. This is the first iPad to feature Apple’s C1X modem, the same as what’s on the iPhone Air, and my speed tests in midtown Manhattan were stellar. I wouldn't pay for a cellular plan myself, especially after dropping a wad of cash for this iPad Pro, but it is really nice being able to turn on the tablet in a coffee shop and not fuss with Wi-Fi because it's always connected. (Apple also has added its N1 networking chip here, for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support.)Battery life is strong as usual. I went through a full day of work on Friday and was left with around 39 percent by 4 pm, which gave me plenty of time to wind down and catch up on some shows before I had to think about plugging in.The tandem OLED display is wonderfully bright, colorful, and sharp, with excellent blacks, and the speakers on this iPad are rich and loud. The webcam is sharp, and the thin and light design really feels great when you pop the slate off the Magic Keyboard and lounge in bed (though the 13-inch size can still be a bit unwieldy).Pro WorkYou’re not going to notice a dramatic boost from the M4 iPad Pro, especially in general tasks. (No one should really be upgrading from last year’s iPad Pro, anyway.) Still, I saw a nice lift in performance when comparing benchmark scores in Geekbench CPU, GPU, and Geekbench AI. I hopped into the Draw Things AI image generation app, and the M5 iPad Pro was able to generate images faster than the M4—sometimes in 7 seconds whereas the M4 iPad Pro took 13 seconds—but the 2024 iPad Pro is still no slouch.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuI opened DaVinci Resolve and started editing some 4K footage and everything felt buttery smooth, but more important is the fact that thanks to iPadOS 26, you’re able to complete rendering tasks in the background without needing to stay on the app. I hit the export and render button, swapped to another app, and … well, turns out DaVinci Resolve doesn’t support this new feature just yet, so I had to keep the app open for the render to complete. You shouldn’t have an issue on Final Cut Pro, though.The most professional task I typically use with my iPad is editing RAW images in Adobe Lightroom, and, unsurprisingly, the M5 performed its duties with ease, even with my liberal use of Adobe’s AI-erase tool. However, I also didn’t really have much issue with this on the “weaker” iPad Air. What I find annoying is the fact that this powerful machine still only comes with one USB-C port. I can’t plug it into my camera and edit photos and charge the tablet at the same time; you need a USB hub.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuThe iPad Pro is for a very specific type of person, and you probably know who you are. If you’re mostly editing photos and typing up documents like me, the iPad Air is more than sufficient. But if you’re regularly in apps like Final Cut Pro or generating all sorts of weird AI images, you may like the extra power the M5 iPad Pro provides—though you can certainly get by with the older M4 model and maybe save some cash.But unlike the iPad Air, which is just affordable enough to exist as a nice complement to a MacBook for days you don’t want the bulk of a laptop, the Pro feels more like a choice you have to make between clamshell and slate because of its high price. At present, I’d probably pick up the new M5 MacBook Pro instead, but with more desktop apps coming to iPad, I don’t think you’ll have to wait too long until the iPad Pro finally becomes the touchscreen Mac of your dreams.",

    "body": "One of the first decisions hearing aid users have to make seems like a simple one: opt for a traditional behind-the-ear (BTE) device that represents the state of the art or an in-the-ear (ITE) offering that is more discreet. The latter seems like a no-brainer, but most ITE hearing aids have a major drawback: They don’t offer the same level of audio fidelity as BTE hearing aids.There are a lot of reasons for this, but much of it comes down to size: ITE hearing aids are smaller, so they don’t have room for the electronics that BTE units can fit into the package. Also, since ITE aids are contained entirely within the ear canal, their microphones are less effective, trapped inside your skull instead of living freely next to it. Battery life can also be an issue with smaller ITE hearing aids, also due to size reasons. Phonak, one of the leading companies in prescription hearing aids, has been working hard to bring ITE aids up to parity with BTE models. With its Virto R Infinio, it goes a long way toward making that a reality.Custom FitPhotograph: Chris NullThe Infinio is easily Phonak’s most advanced ITE model to date, in large part because it is exclusively available with custom-fit ear molds. Long available on studio monitors and a few luxe hearing aids, these molds have to be made by an audiologist who squirts goo into your ear and then extracts it once it becomes firm, maintaining the unique shape of the ear canal.This mold is then used to create the shell for the Infinios, each of which arrives as a single, bespoke, Cronenbergian piece. That means you don’t just get a snug, perfect fit: The snakelike ear-tip design also places the receiver as close to your eardrum as possible, theoretically maximizing its amplification.This is a prescription-only product, and you’ll have to visit a licensed audiologist to be fitted for one. In fact, two appointments will be required: One for the initial molding, the other to tune the hearing aids after they’ve been crafted, which takes about a week.The Infinio is available in two basic designs, one “open” and one “closed.” The decision of which to opt for is similar to making the choice of ear tips on a standard hearing aid. (Note that the Infinio does not require or work with additional ear tips.) The open design has a vented channel running through it, which allows just a touch of ambient sound into the ear canal. The closed design, however, is exactly that. It seals off the ear completely, like an earplug. I tried both but quickly gravitated to the open offering; the closed hearing aids were too isolating—and overkill for someone with my more modest level of hearing loss—though users who frequently use their hearing aids for streaming may find the isolation to be a plus.In the ear, the units fit incredibly snugly and look more like earplugs than earbuds, with nothing protruding from the ear except for a tiny retrieval wire. After a little practice, they become as easy to pop in and out as my favorite earbuds, locking into place with a little swivel. The units have only a single control button on the exterior face. This is used to power the units on or off and can also be used to accept or hang up on phone calls over Bluetooth. All remaining configurations, including volume adjustments, must be done in the myPhonak mobile app.Solid SoundPhotograph: Chris NullThe hearing aids are outfitted with Phonak’s latest processor and software, but the proof of quality really comes in the testing. Overall, quality was very good—though it was clearly short of top-tier BTE hearing aids from the likes of GN ReSound and Starkey.Despite four default environmental programs, my audiologist encouraged me to leave them in Automatic mode as much as possible, and this was the right call. Audio was gently to moderately boosted in the frequencies where I needed it, echoes and feedback were nonexistent, and hiss was audible only if I cranked the volume up to uncomfortable levels. (Volume can be adjusted individually per ear if desired.)I encountered an odd issue when watching TV, where high-pitched sounds (like squawking walkie-talkies) created an uncomfortable squeal. I also found this to be a slight problem with otherwise subtle high-pitched noises, namely the clicking of my mouse. Switching to the TV mode helped alleviate some of this, but I had to return to the audiologist a third time for another tweak to the high-frequency settings to temper it further. Note that all of the built-in environmental modes can be adjusted by the user, and Phonak can tweak frequency settings further in the office to help improve any additional outlying issues.One issue Phonak can’t fix is its baffling inclusion of a charging case that does not include a battery. The enormous case includes nifty magnetic attachments for the two hearing aids, which illuminate when charging—but none of that works if the case is not plugged in via its USB-C port. Phonak claims a maximum battery life of 30 hours (without Bluetooth streaming); however, I never achieved more than 23 hours in my tests. That’s plenty for casual use, assuming you have the opportunity to charge your aids overnight, but heavy users who forget their cable on a weekend road trip may encounter trouble. I also found that the batteries drain slowly even when they’re not in use, which could compound this issue.Photograph: Chris NullOn the plus side, the units are extremely comfortable, though I didn’t really expect them to be, considering that the entire body is crafted from hard plastic. No padding inside the ear canal? Turns out it doesn’t matter because the fit is so perfect. I was able to wear these hearing aids for hours on end without any discomfort or itchiness. At 2.28 grams each, they aren’t the lightest ITE aids on the market (by far), but they’re nonetheless largely unnoticeable, because nothing is jutting out of your ear and because they fit so well. In time, they effectively become just another part of your body.Bluetooth streaming quality is considerably better than most hearing aids provide, with at least a nod toward including some bass in the mix. However, noise cancellation doesn’t compare to what you’ll find on top-shelf earbuds, so don’t plan on using these to stream music while on the treadmill or on the plane. A hearing aid locator system is also included in the myPhonak app, which pinpoints the last known location of the devices on a map.Naturally, as prescription hearing aids, the Infinio comes at a cost. Audiologists all set their own prices, but Phonak says $4,000 is about average. The quality is definitely better than cheaper over-the-counter options like the $1,000 Sony CRE-C20, but is it four times better? That’s always an impossible question to answer in this industry—and since you can’t really test-drive these hearing aids without getting a custom fit version first, perhaps even more impossible.If your budget allows and you don’t want the headaches of a behind-the-ear model, I recommend them highly.",

    "body": "There are so many times when you’re running and pass something beautiful. It’s so easy to say, “Hey Meta, start taking video” and just get a quick clip as you happen to be zipping past. You can also customize the Action button to pick different filming modes, like slow motion or hyperlapse.The Garmin integration is designed to address your social media needs. Yes, it syncs with Meta AI, allowing the glasses to tell you if you're hitting your target pace or HR zones—something I don't think you really need if you’re already wearing a beeping, buzzing Garmin on your wrist. What you’re really wearing the watch to do is to trigger the camera’s auto-capture at key moments in your workout, so you can put together highlight reels and overlay your Garmin stats on top of it afterward.That this is a device for social media fitness is also reflected in the fact that you’re limited in your filming to 30-second, 1-minute, 3-minute, and 5-minute clips. Meta informs me that most people usually just keep it to 30-second video clips, all the better for TikToks and Reels. You can also set the clips to auto-import, so it’s just in your Photos library when you think back to check and post on Instagram.I’m private on Strava; I don’t really need anyone to witness my leisurely 10-minute-mile trail runs. But every running influencer who is filming “Mile 1!” all the way through “Mile 26.2!” of their latest marathon is going to love these.Outside of the fitness stuff, I do think the Meta AI assistant is kind of fun. I have a few friends who can identify plants and animals as we’re hiking, and Meta AI can do that on a basic level, even if it’s not up to pinpointing specific varietals. I think it’s a bit of a superpower to be able to identify if you’re not sure if those flowers are zinnias or dahlias as you pass. Nota bene: I would not ask Meta AI or any other chatbot super personal questions. I would also go into Settings, Data & Privacy, and Remove All Public Vibes (ew!), because I find everything about Meta AI as a social media platform to be (double ew!) gross, but that's just me.",

    "body": "You may have heard about an upcoming fantasy MacBook Pro with a thinner chassis, an OLED display, and even a touchscreen. That may very well come some day, but today's not that day.Instead, the latest MacBook Pro is very much the same we’ve had for the past four years, except with a new M5 chip inside. That’s not a bad thing, given how this thing performs. All the unchanged elements still rank it among the best laptops you can buy, just don't expect anything too Earth-shattering in this otherwise modest upgrade.Hello M5Photograph: Luke LarsenIn a year when performance is the only generational change, it was very smart for Apple to release the M5 MacBook Pro ahead of the other MacBooks. Rather than time it with the M5 Pro and M5 Max, the M5 MacBook Pro is coming out alongside the M5 iPad Pro and M5 Vision Pro. That means as of now, there’s no M5 MacBook Air, M5 Pro or M5 Max chips, or 16-inch MacBook Pro. These are probably not too far off, but the introduction of the M5 will tempt some people to buy this MacBook Pro instead one that is better suited for their needs.Don't forget: historically, there's only around a two percent difference in performance between the Air and the Pro. Apple wants to talk up the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 as a powerful performer, and it is. But it's the display, port selection, and portability that distinguishes this MacBook Pro from the MacBook Air, none of which has changed in this generation.With that disclaimer out of the way, I want to unabashedly say: The M5 is pretty amazing. It’s built on the same 3-nanometer TSMC process as the M4 and M3, now in its third generation, and it continues the steady march of performance increases in place since the birth of Apple Silicon.Benchmarks are just benchmarks, but as a laptop reviewer, I sat up in my chair when I saw the M5 hit 200 in single-core performance on Cinebench 2024. It’s a first for any chip, and it’s an area where Apple remains in a different league compared to the competition. Single-core performance is useful for bursty, frequency-sensitive tasks like opening applications, responsiveness in complex tasks, and in software like games. But 200 is just an abstract number. In context, it’s an 11 percent increase over the M4, which is less of a generational increase than the M3 was over the M2. It’s actually the smallest generational improvement to single-core performance since the M2 over the M1.Photograph: Luke LarsenOn the multi-core front, you’re still getting a 10-core CPU, which matches the configuration of the M4 on the 14-inch MacBook Pro. So, if you want more multi-core performance, you’ll need to wait for the M5 Pro or M5 Max. But for now, the M5 is seeing around a 17 percent improvement in multi-core performance too—and again, that’s without increasing the core count. This is all good stuff, but I’m not sure that the average person will really notice the benefit in day-to-day performance.You may notice the increase in fan noise though, which is one of the main differences between the M4 and the M4 Pro/Max, which use two fans instead of one. The M5 MacBook Pro remains great at not using the fan unless totally necessary, but when it does kick on, it’s quite loud. I’m assuming it’s around the same as the M4 MacBook Pro, but I didn’t have it side by side to compare. The positive of that is the internal temperatures. I’ve seen CPU temperatures in MacBooks happily peak at 105 degrees Celsius when under full load. But I never measured anything over 89 degrees Celsius on this laptop, which is a great sign.Storage performance is also an area of improvement Apple has highlighted, now using the latest PCIe Gen 5 standard to result in twice the SSD read and write speeds. Again, you have to compare apples to apples here, because the M4 Pro and Max models already had faster read/write speeds over the base M4. With average read speeds of around 6,500 MB/s and write speeds of 6,728 MB/s, the storage performance on the M5 is now actually slightly faster than the M4 Pro. You can now configure this to 4 terabytes, up from 2 terabytes on the previous M4 and M4 Pro models.Pushing AI ForwardWhile the M5 happily keeps the CPU performance gains humming along, its larger strides are in graphics and AI. Regardless of what you think about the implementation of Apple Intelligence, there plenty of other things you can do with local AI processing, whether that's run on-device LLMs through apps like Draw Things or Misty Studio, both of which can leverage the AI hardware inside the M5 MacBook Pro. There are two primary changes to the M5 in terms of AI performance. One is the faster Neural Engine, which handles AI tasks that require speed or that run in the background, such as Apple Intelligence. According to my runs of Geekbench AI, the Neural Engine in the M5 is an average of 29 percent faster than the M4, and 40 percent faster than the M3.The GPU cores also now include Neural Accelerators, a feature first seen in the A19 chip in the iPhone 17 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The idea here is to speed up heavier, one-time AI workloads, especially in apps that already rely heavily on GPU performance, such as in video editing software. This is not unlike the Tensor Cores you find in Nvidia graphics cores. The effect this has on speeding up workloads is tricky to quantify and make definitive claims around, but I did notice that the M5 outperforms the MacBook Pro M3 by 5 percent when I ran Geekbench AI on the GPU, despite the fact that the M3 Max is a more powerful GPU overall.Speaking of the GPU, that's the other major area where the M5 shines. The GPU core count hasn’t changed (you still get 10 cores), but Apple claims the M5 is 1.6 times faster than the M4 nonetheless. In my own testing, I found it to be close to on par with the same jump the M3 had over the M2, which was the first major overhaul of the graphics architecture in the base Apple Silicon lineup. Well, the M5 does it again. It’s now nearly a match with the M3 Pro and is only three percent behind the M1 Ultra, as found in the original Mac Studio. That means the M3 Max, M4 Pro—and especially the M4 Max—are still much more powerful chips in terms of graphics. It's quite an achievement that the M5—which will inevitably show up in a $999 MacBook Air—is as powerful as the $2,000 M3 Pro MacBook Pro when it launched.Photograph: Luke LarsenTo put the GPU to the test, I had to try out Cyberpunk 2077, which came out earlier this year on Mac. You can, to my surprise, play the game at 1920 x 1200 without upscaling and get decent frame rates at the Medium or Low graphics settings. Averaging 39 frames per second on Medium or 51 fps on Low is decent, but in case you're wondering, there's still a massive gap between this and a discrete GPU—even a low-tier one. I recently tested the RTX 5050 in the Acer Nitro V 16, and it netted 53 percent faster frame rates in Cyberpunk 2077 in the same resolution. Admittedly, that's a much thicker laptop, but my point is that the base M5 does not make the MacBook Pro a true gaming machine. The M5 Pro and Max, however, may end up being a very different story, as the M4 Pro and M4 Max were already truly impressive on the GPU front.I also tried out both Apple's own MetalFX and AMD's FSR 3.0 upscaling, which can boost the frame rates up to 70 fps on the Balanced setting, but I still found that I preferred the crisper native experience. You won't be using the new third-gen ray tracing engine much, at least not without over-relying on upscaling. But while I was at it, I also spun up Lies of P and Resident Evil: Village, and saw similar results. You might have to reduce settings, but you can play these games natively now at playable frame rates, which is a big step forward.The other big takeaway is the fan noise. Although it's louder than other MacBooks as mentioned earlier, it's downright quiet compared to a proper gaming laptop. The fact that you can play a game as heavy as Cyberpunk 2077 at all without it sounding like a jet engine is notable on its own. The same is true for the surface temperatures of the keyboard and palm rests. Despite long sessions of benchmarking and gaming, the surfaces stayed relatively cool throughout, which makes for a much more pleasant gaming experience.Photograph: Luke LarsenThere’s nothing new to say about the MacBook Pro’s design or display, which despite having remained stagnant, are still among the best on the market. I do think the MacBook Pro is a bit thick for the type of laptop it is, but at 0.61 inches, it’s still fairly portable. The chassis has been around since 2021 when the M1 MacBook Pro was released, so it feels old at this point. I’m perhaps most weary of the notch in the screen, which I’ve always disliked but feels more and more outdated with each passing year.When it comes to the screen, I’m as excited about Apple’s transition to OLED as much everyone else. It’s been a year and a half since Apple released the tandem OLED iPad Pro, with its incredible brightness for HDR, and here we are, still with a four-year old display on these high-end MacBooks. However, I refuse to complain about a display this sharp, fast, colorful, accurate, and bright. With a resolution of 3024 x 1964 on the 14.2-inch screen, it has a pixel density of 254 pixels per inch, which is sharper than anything except 4K screens, which aren't particularly common on 14-inch laptops.It does not feel like Apple is falling behind by continuing to use this screen, but with the glut of bright OLED laptops out there, you can't say that Apple has the de factor best laptop display. I do still love the nano-texture screen, though, which blocks reflections and glare without making the screen look washed out in a way no other solution does.Another thing I’m glad that hasn’t changed are the speakers and webcam. The six-speaker audio system is bassy, full, loud, and crystal clear. The only better speakers you’ll find on a laptop are the ones on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The 1080p, 12-megapixel webcam isn’t as much of a dead ringer as the speakers, but is still one of the better laptop webcams out there.In terms of ports, it's all the same, meaning you still get three USB-C Thunderbolt ports, HDMI 2.1, a full-sized SD card slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe 3 charger. Thunderbolt 5 was introduced last year, but it remains an exclusive feature of the M4 Pro and M4 Max. Slightly disappointing to see wireless connectivity not get upgraded, leaving Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 off the table, especially since many of the best routers you can buy this year have Wi-Fi 7 for faster speeds.Photograph: Luke LarsenThose lack of features or other upgrades is notable. You certainly won't hate yourself for buying this machine, but as long as you can buy a similarly-specced M4 Pro MacBook Pro for the same price, the lack of anything else new in the M5 MacBook Pro makes it a harder sell. This is even the first time battery life has remained stagnant from the previous generation, with Apple still claiming 24 hours. From my own testing, the M5 MacBook Pro is aligned with the other MacBook Pros, giving me well over a full day of battery life with my work. The MacBook Pro still holds the crown, even if Intel and Qualcomm are far more serviceable competitors now than they used to be.If you really need the extra performance for work, you're better off buying the M4 Pro/Max MacBook Pro or waiting it out for the M5 Pro/Max. On the other side of the spectrum, the current M4 MacBook Air is all the laptop most people will ever need. Unless you plan on gaming, I wouldn't even recommend needing to wait until the M5 MacBook Air comes out in the spring, especially if this M5 MacBook Pro is a sign of things to come.For that reason, the M5 MacBook Pro is probably not the MacBook most people should buy. But that's a casualty of Apple’s marketing strategy than this laptop or the M5 itself. I was really impressed by the GPU and AI performance improvements this time around, and the M5 is going to really flex in both the MacBook Air (for its incredible value) and the M4 Pro/Max (for its enhanced performance). This is for the dabblers and hobbyists, which I don't mean in pejorative sense. If you want to do some video editing, photography, or gaming on the side, and could really benefit from the enriched multimedia experience that the better screen, ports, and speakers provide, the M5 MacBook Pro is your go-to machine.It can handle your work or school during the day, and whatever project you want to throw at it on weekends. On top of that, the display and speakers mean it's also a killer media machine for when you want to throw on a movie or play a game. These are the kinds of in-between, “prosumer” devices Apple has always staked its claim on, which is why this laptop has remained in the lineup, despite the feeling of redundancy it gives me next to the 15-inch MacBook Air. For the right person, though, the M5 MacBook Pro will really please you. As for me, I'm holding out for that OLED MacBook Pro.",

    "body": "AI models may be a bit like humans, after all.A new study from the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M, and Purdue University shows that large language models fed a diet of popular but low-quality social media content experience a kind of “brain rot” that may be familiar to anyone who has spent too long doomscrolling on X or TikTok.\"We live in an age where information grows faster than attention spans—and much of it is engineered to capture clicks, not convey truth or depth,” says Junyuan Hong, an incoming assistant professor at the National University of Singapore who worked on the study as a graduate student at UT Austin. “We wondered: What happens when AIs are trained on the same stuff?”Hong and his colleagues fed different kinds of text to two open source large language models in pretraining. They examined what happened when the models were fed a mix of highly “engaging,” or widely shared, social media posts and ones that contained sensational or hyped text like “wow,” “look,” or “today only.”The researchers then used several different benchmarks to gauge the impact of this “junk” social media diet on two open source models: Meta’s Llama and Alibaba’s Qwen.The models fed junk text experienced a kind of AI brain rot—with cognitive decline including reduced reasoning abilities and degraded memory. The models also became less ethically aligned and more psychopathic according to two measures.The results mirror research on human subjects, which shows that low-quality online content has a detrimental effect on people’s cognitive abilities. The pervasiveness of the phenomenon saw “brain rot” named as the Oxford Dictionary word of the year in 2024.The results are important for the AI industry, Hong says, because model-builders might assume that social media posts are a good source of training data for their models. “Training on viral or attention-grabbing content may look like scaling up data,” he says. “But it can quietly corrode reasoning, ethics, and long-context attention.”The fact that LLMs suffer from brain rot seems especially worrying when AI is itself increasingly generating social media content, much of which is seemingly optimized for engagement. The researchers also found that models impaired by low-quality content could not easily be improved through retraining.The findings also suggest that AI systems built around social platforms, such as Grok, might suffer from quality control issues if user-generated posts are used in training without an eye toward the integrity of the posts.“As more AI-generated slop spreads across social media, it contaminates the very data future models will learn from,” Hong says. “Our findings show that once this kind of ‘brain rot’ sets in, later clean training can’t fully undo it.”This is an edition of Will Knight’s AI Lab newsletter.

    "body": "On September 19, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement made a $61,218 payment for “guided missile warheads and explosive components,” according to the Product and Service Code (PSC) included in the payment record on a federal contracting database.“This award provides multiple distraction devices to support law enforcement operations and ICE- Office of Firearms and Tactical Programs,” the record’s description section reads.The Substack Popular Information mentioned this payment in a Monday article, which focused on the fact that ICE spending in the “small arms, ordnance, and ordnance accessories manufacturing” product category increased by 700 percent between 2024 and 2025. (Spending increased by about 636 percent, per WIRED’s analysis of the same category and time periods Popular Information measured.) Word of the payment also circulated on Tuesday after a post on BlueSky by Democratic Wisconsin state senator Chris Larson went viral.It turns out, concern over ICE agents planning to use warheads is likely based on a mistake. Quantico Tactical, the company listed as the supplier of said warheads in the federal payment records, does not sell any explosive devices. (It sells a variety of firearms, switchblades, and weapon accessories.) David Hensley, founder and CEO of Quantico Tactical, told WIRED in an email that the PSC “appears to be an error.”“Quantico Tactical does not sell, and I suspect that CBP ICE does not purchase, ‘Guided Missile Warheads,’” Hensley said, referencing Customs and Border Protection. He added that the rest of the payment record appears to be correct.PSCs are assigned by a government agency’s contracting office, not the private contractor. Hensley declined to speculate on what the correct PSC for the payment may be. He also declined to clarify which “distraction devices” ICE purchased. However, ICE made two other payments to Quantico Tactical for “distraction devices” in September 2024 and August 2025.The descriptions for both payment records claim that they are for training programs run by ICE’s Office of Firearms and Tactical Programs (OFTP). Both payments records use the PSC for \"chemical weapons and equipment,” which includes items like \"flame throwers\" and \"smoke generators.”An ICE “Firearms and Use of Force” handbook from 2021 does not mention any approved use of flame throwers, but it does mention the use of \"chemical munitions\" such as smoke, pepper spray, and tear gas. (It notes that their use must be approved by the agency's associate director and the OFTP.) Quantico Tactical does not list smoke bombs, pepper spray, or tear gas for sale on its website, though it does list accessories like smoke-resistant goggles and holders for mace, flash grenades, and smoke bombs. It’s unclear what ICE may have purchased.ICE did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.Notably, ICE has never made a purchase with the PSC for “guided missile warheads and explosive components” in the past. The 2024 Federal Procurement Data System Manual lists eight other PSCs explicitly related to guided missiles—specifically, their components, repair equipment, and the trucks and trailers that transport them. ICE has never made purchases with any of these codes with a few exceptions, all of which appear to be coding errors, according to payment records reviewed by WIRED.There is one record of an ICE payment to “Prestige Auto Collision\" in November 2007 under the PSC for “maintenance” and “repair” of guided missiles. The payment record description, however, says that a “vehicle was rear ended” and needed to be repaired before it could be driven again. (There are two other payment records to the business in January 2008 and October 2020, but both are for $0 and appear to be administrative.) WIRED was unable to contact Prestige Auto Collision, which no longer exists at the location listed in the payment record.ICE also made one payment to \"Atlantic Driving Supply Incorporated\" for $115,500 in 2007 under the PSC for \"guided missile components.\" However, the description reads “Holographic sight,” which may simply refer to day scopes and binoculars sold by the company. (There is one other payment record to Atlantic Driving Supply from May 2017, but it is for $0 and also appears to be administrative.) ADS did not respond for comment.In recent months, ICE has hugely escalated the scale and intensity of its operations, sparking protests around the country. ICE agents have often responded with the copious use of tear gas, pepper spray, and smoke.This phenomenon has been particularly visible in Chicago and Portland. On Saturday in Portland, ICE agents used large amounts of tear gas and pepper spray against protesters. This week, a federal judge in Chicago questioned a Trump official on ICE agents’ use of the chemical agents, which have been used in close proximity to police officers and elementary schools in the city. Recently, officers threw a smoke bomb directly into a Chicago street after cars started beeping at them.",

    "body": "European roboticists today released a powerful open-source artificial intelligence model that acts as a brain for industrial robots—helping them grasp and manipulate things with new dexterity.The new model, SPEAR-1, was developed by researchers at the Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology (INSAIT) in Bulgaria. It may help other researchers and startups build and experiment with smarter hardware for factories and warehouses.Just as open source language models have made it possible for researchers and companies to experiment with generative AI, Martin Vechev, a computer scientist at INSIAT and ETH Zurich, says SPEAR-1 should help roboticists to experiment and iterate rapidly. “Open-weight models are crucial for advancing embodied AI,” Vechev told WIRED ahead of the release.SPEAR-1 differs from existing robot foundation models in that it incorporates 3D data into its training mix. This gives the model an enhanced understanding of the physical world, making it easier to understand how objects move through physical space.Robot foundation models are generally built on top of vision language models (VLMs) which have a broad but limited grasp of the physical world because training tends to come from labeled 2D images. “Our approach tackles the mismatch between the 3D space the robot operates in and the knowledge of the VLM that forms the core of the robotic foundation model,” Vechev says.SPEAR-1 is roughly as capable as commercial foundation models designed to operate robots, when measured on RoboArena, a benchmark that tests a model’s ability to get a robot to do things like squeeze a ketchup bottle, close a drawer, and staple pieces of paper together.The race to make robots smarter already has billions of dollars riding on it. The commercial potential of generally capable robots has spawned well-funded startups including Skild and Generalist besides Physical Intelligence. SPEAR-1 is almost as good as Pi-0.5 from Physical Intelligence, a billion-dollar startup founded by an all-star team of robotics researchers.SPEAR-1 suggests that the quest to build more intelligent robots may involve both closed models like those from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, as well as open source variants like Llama, DeepSeek, and Qwen.Robot intelligence is still in its infancy, though. It is possible to train an AI model to operate a robot arm so that it can reliably pick certain objects from a table. In practice, however, the model will need to be retrained from scratch if a different kind of robot arm is used or if the object or the environment are altered.Robotics researchers hope that the same recipe that produced large language models—huge amounts of training data and compute—will eventually yield robot models with similarly general capabilities. This would mean robots capable of adapting very quickly to new situations or new tasks. Eventually such models might enable humanoids to operate in messy and unfamiliar environments, thanks to a general understanding of how the world works.Karl Pertsch, a researcher at the company Physical Intelligence, says it is too soon to know how important 3D training data will be for robotic foundation models. He adds, however, that SPEAR-1 shows how rapidly more general robotic models are advancing. “It's really cool to see academic groups building quite general policies that can actually be evaluated across a diverse set of environments out-of-the-box, and [can] achieve non-trivial performance,” Pertsch says. “This was not possible even a year ago.”",

    "body": "A sprawling Amazon Web Services cloud outage that began early Monday morning illustrated the fragile interdependencies of the internet as major communication, financial, health care, education, and government platforms around the world suffered disruptions. As the day wore on, AWS diagnosed and began working to correct the issue, which stemmed from the company's critical US-EAST-1 region based in northern Virginia. But the cascade of impacts took time to fully resolve.Researchers reflecting on the incident particularly highlighted the length of the outage, which started around 3 am ET on Monday, October 20. AWS said in status updates that by 6:01 pm ET on Monday “all AWS services returned to normal operations.” The outage directly stemmed from Amazon's DynamoDB database application programming interfaces and, according to the company, “impacted” 141 other AWS services. Multiple network engineers and infrastructure specialists emphasized to WIRED that errors are understandable and inevitable for so-called “hyperscalers” like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, given their complexity and sheer size. But they noted, too, that this reality shouldn't simply absolve cloud providers when they have prolonged downtime.“The word hindsight is key. It's easy to find out what went wrong after the fact, but the overall reliability of AWS shows how difficult it is to prevent every failure,” says Ira Winkler, chief information security officer of the reliability and cybersecurity firm CYE. “Ideally, this will be a lesson learned, and Amazon will implement more redundancies that would prevent a disaster like this from happening in the future—or at least prevent them staying down as long as they did.”AWS did not respond to questions from WIRED about the long tail of the recovery for customers. An AWS spokesperson says the company plans to publish one of its “post-event summaries” about the incident.“I don't think this was just a ‘stuff happens’ outage. I would have expected a full remediation much faster,” says Jake Williams, vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy. “To give them their due, cascading failures aren't something that they get a lot of experience working with because they don't have outages very often. So that's to their credit. But it's really easy to get into the mindset of giving these companies a pass, and we shouldn't forget that they create this situation by actively trying to attract ever more customers to their infrastructure. Clients don't control whether they are overextending themselves or what they may have going on financially.”The incident was caused by a familiar culprit in web outages—“domain name system” resolution issues. DNS is essentially the internet's phonebook mechanism to direct web browsers to the right servers. As a result, DNS issues are a common source of outages, because they can cause requests to fail and keep content from loading.“Cloud computing is a marvel, but the heart of it is a never-ending list of complex services and dependencies that are always one configuration away from failure,\" says Mark St. John, chief operating officer and cofounder of the systems security startup Neon Cyber.Speaking generally about hyperscalers, St. John echoed Williams' point that in exchange for the mature architecture and secure baseline of cloud platforms, customers cede control of their underlying digital infrastructure and the extent to which their cloud provider is or isn't investing in resilience and contingency planning at a given time. “At a certain scale, operational validation for service providers can't be a casualty of cost-cutting,” St. John says.Thinking specifically about Monday's outage, one senior network architect at a major tech company, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, also emphasized that the time it took for AWS to diagnose and remediate the issues was notable.“It’s extraordinary that they don’t have more failures,” the source said, “but in this case it was weird that what was basically a core service—DynamoDB and the DNS around that—took so long to detect and get to a root cause.”",

    "body": "The proliferation of difficult-to-treat bacterial diseases represents a growing threat, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report. The report reveals that, between 2018 and 2023, antibiotic resistance increased by more than 40 percent in monitored pathogen-drug combinations, with an average annual increase of 5-15 percent.According to data reported by more than 100 countries to WHO's Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS), one in six laboratory-confirmed bacteria in 2023 proved resistant to antibiotic treatment, all related to various common diseases globally.SuperbugsFor the first time, this edition of the report includes prevalence estimates of resistance to 22 antibiotics used to treat urinary tract, gastrointestinal, bloodstream, and gonorrheal conditions. The analysis focused on eight common pathogens: Acinetobacter spp, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, non-typhoidal Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.The results show that resistant gram-negative bacteria pose the greatest threat. Of particular note are Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are associated with bloodstream infections that can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death. \"More than 40 percent of E. coli and more than 55 percent of K. pneumoniae strains worldwide are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first-choice treatment for these types of infections,\" the report warns.These microorganisms are joined by Salmonella and Acinetobacter, which are also developing resistance to essential drugs such as carbapenemics and fluoroquinolones. This reduces therapeutic alternatives and forces the use of last-resort antibiotics, which are often expensive and difficult to access, especially in low- and middle-income countries.Medicine Lags Behind“Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide,\" said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a statement. \"We must use antibiotics responsibly, and make sure everyone has access to the right medicines, quality-assured diagnostics, and vaccines.”Optimizing surveillance systems and obtaining accurate data is an urgent task. Although there has been progress, it is still insufficient. Between 2016 and 2023, the number of countries participating in GLASS quadrupled from 25 to 104. However, 48 percent did not report data in 2023, and almost half of those that did report lacked sufficient infrastructure to generate reliable data.WHO warns that addressing this problem must be a priority in regions such as Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, where one in three reported infections is resistant, as well as in Africa, where one in five has the same condition.“Achieving this target will require concerted action to strengthen the quality, geographic coverage, and sharing of AMR surveillance data to track progress,” the report states. “Countries should scale up coordinated interventions designed to address antimicrobial resistance across all levels of health care and ensure that treatment guidelines and essential medicines lists align with local resistance patterns.”The Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance warns that this problem is among the top 10 threats to humanity. Without effective action, annual deaths from drug-resistant infections could exceed 10 million by 2050.\"Our future also depends on strengthening systems to prevent, diagnose and treat infections and on innovating with next-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular tests,\" Ghebreyesus concluded.This story originally appeared in WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "body": "NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy made two television appearances on Monday morning in which he shook up the space agency’s plans to return humans to the moon.Speaking on Fox News, where the secretary of transportation frequently appears in his acting role as NASA chief, Duffy said SpaceX has fallen behind in its efforts to develop the Starship vehicle as a lunar lander. Duffy also indirectly acknowledged that NASA’s projected target of a 2027 crewed lunar landing is no longer achievable. Accordingly, he said he intended to expand the competition to develop a lander capable of carrying humans down to the moon from lunar orbit and back.“They’re behind schedule, and so the president wants to make sure we beat the Chinese,” Duffy said of SpaceX. “He wants to get there in his term. So I’m in the process of opening that contract up. I think we’ll see companies like Blue [Origin] get involved, and maybe others. We’re going to have a space race in regard to American companies competing to see who can actually lead us back to the moon first.”There are a couple of significant takeaways from this interview. First is the public acknowledgment by a senior NASA official that the space agency’s current timeline of a 2027 landing is completely untenable. And secondly, the timing of Duffy’s public appearances on Monday seems tailored to influence a fierce, behind-the-scenes battle to hold onto the NASA leadership position.“Opening That Contract Up”SpaceX won a contract from NASA, worth $2.9 billion, in April 2021 to develop and modify its ambitious Starship rocket to serve as a “human landing system.” This rocket would work in concert with NASA’s Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft to get humans from Earth to the lunar surface and back. Two years later, Blue Origin, a rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos, won a second contract, worth $3.4 billion, to develop a second lander.Duffy is correct that SpaceX is moving slower than anticipated. The company must cross several technical hurdles before it can provide landing services to NASA. In their funded contracts for reusable landers, SpaceX and Blue Origin must refuel their vehicles in low-Earth orbit, something that has never been done on a large scale.When Duffy says “companies like Blue” may get involved, he is not referring to the existing contract, in which Blue Origin will not deliver a ready-to-go lunar lander until the 2030s. Rather he is almost certainly referring to a plan developed by Blue Origin that uses multiple Mk 1 landers, a smaller vehicle originally designed for cargo only. Ars reported on this new lunar architecture three weeks ago, which company engineers have been quietly developing. This plan would not require in-space refueling, and the Mk 1 vehicle is nearing its debut flight early next year.Duffy also cites “maybe others” getting involved. This refers to a third option. In recent weeks, officials from traditional space companies have been telling Duffy and the chief of staff at the Department of Transportation, Pete Meachum, that they can build an Apollo Lunar Module–like lander within 30 months. Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s associate administrator, favors this government-led approach, sources said.On Monday, in a statement to Ars, a Lockheed Martin official confirmed that the company was ready if NASA called upon them.“Throughout this year, Lockheed Martin has been performing significant technical and programmatic analysis for human lunar landers that would provide options to NASA for a safe solution to return humans to the moon as quickly as possible,” said Bob Behnken, vice president of exploration and technology strategy at Lockheed Martin Space. “We have been working with a cross-industry team of companies, and together we are looking forward to addressing Secretary Duffy’s request to meet our country’s lunar objectives.”NASA would not easily be able to rip up its existing human lander system contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin, as, especially with the former, much of the funding has already been awarded for milestone payments. Rather, Duffy would likely have to find new funding from Congress. And it would not be cheap. This NASA analysis from 2017 estimates that a cost-plus, sole-source lunar lander would cost $20 billion to $30 billion, or nearly 10 times what NASA awarded to SpaceX in 2021.SpaceX founder Elon Musk, responding to Duffy’s comments, seemed to relish the challenge posed by industry competitors.“SpaceX is moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry,” Musk said on the social media site he owns, X. “Moreover, Starship will end up doing the whole moon mission. Mark my words.”The TimingDuffy’s remarks on television on Monday morning, although significant for the broader space community, also seemed intended for an audience of one—President Trump.The president appointed Duffy, already leading the Department of Transportation, to lead NASA on an interim basis in July. This came six weeks after the president, for political reasons, rescinded his nomination of billionaire and private astronaut Jared Isaacman to lead the space agency.Trump was under the impression that Duffy would use this time to shore up NASA’s leadership while also looking for a permanent chief of the space agency. However, Duffy appears to have not paid more than lip service to finding a successor.Since late summer there has been a groundswell of support for Isaacman in the White House and among some members of Congress. The billionaire has met with Trump several times, both at the White House and Mar-a-Lago, and sources report that the two have a good rapport. There has been some momentum toward the president renominating Isaacman, with Trump potentially making a decision soon. Duffy’s TV appearances on Monday morning appear to be part of an effort to forestall this momentum by showing Trump he is actively working toward a lunar landing during his second term, which ends in January 2029.Duffy has appeared to enjoy the limelight that comes with leading NASA. In the future, one source said, “Duffy wants to be president.” The NASA position has afforded him greater visibility, including television appearances, to expand his profile in a positive way. “He doesn’t want to give up the job,” the source added.A Republican adviser to the White House told Ars that it is good that Duffy has moved beyond his rhetoric about NASA beating China to the moon and to look for creative tactics to land there. But, this person said, the mandate from the Trump administration is to dominate the emerging commercial space industry, not hand out large cost-plus contracts.“Duffy hasn’t implemented any of the strategic reforms of Artemis that the president proposed this spring,” the Republican source said. “He has the perfect opportunity during the current shutdown, but there is no sign of any real reform under his leadership. Instead, Duffy is being co-opted by the deep state at NASA.”This story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "body": "Tesla might be an electric auto maker, but CEO Elon Musk has made clear that he thinks of it as much more: an innovator in artificial intelligence and software, a builder of world-shaking robots. He’s also argued that Tesla should be worth a lot more than it is today: up to $20 trillion, he posted in July, more than five times the current worth of Nvidia.Musk has also made it clear that he wants to get paid, a lot. In November, Tesla shareholders will vote on the board’s proposal to pay the CEO a remarkable $1 trillion over the next decade. The deal would also increase Musk’s stake in Tesla from 13 percent to a quarter. But Musk would only get that big figure—and the extra control—if he hits a series of ambitious metrics, including 20 million vehicles delivered, 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation, and an $8.5 trillion valuation. And also, 1 million Optimus humanoid robots delivered.On a call with investors on Wednesday, Musk locked on to that last point to make his most threatening argument for a gigantic payday yet. “My fundamental concern with regard to how much voting control I have at Tesla is, if I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future?” he said. “If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over this robot army? Not control, but a strong influence … I don't feel comfortable building that robot army unless I have a strong influence.”Generally, Musk talks about Tesla’s Optimus project as more of a force for peace than war. He’s said that Optimus will upend the job market and free humanity from the drudgery of work. (“Working will be optional, like growing your own vegetables, instead of buying them from the store,” he posted this week.) Elsewhere on the investor call Wednesday, he said that Tesla’s robots would “actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.”Optimus, he added, “will be an incredible surgeon, and imagine if everyone had access to an incredible surgeon.” For Tesla, Optimus will be “an infinite money glitch,” Musk said, arguing that everyone will want a humanoid robot who can do their work for them.Got a Tip?Are you a current or former Tesla worker who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at aarianm.30.At Tesla events—and at the Tesla Diner in Los Angeles—Optimus robots are usually seen doing service work: serving drinks and popcorn, or entertaining visitors by dancing or playing rock, paper, scissors. (Optimus participants in a 2024 Tesla event were later acknowledged to be not fully autonomous, but remotely operated by humans.)Whether Optimus chooses to do laundry or battle, Tesla’s vision of a robotic future still seems a ways away. On Wednesday’s call, Musk dwelled on the challenge of building humanoid hands and forearms, seeming to confirm earlier reporting that the features were proving especially hard for Tesla engineers to hack. And while Tesla set internal goals to produce 5,000 Optimus units this year, The Information reported this month that the company scaled down those production plans over the summer. On Wednesday, Musk said Tesla would have a “production-intent prototype” ready by February or March. Full-scale production, he said, would start at the end of next year.",

    "body": "On Wednesday, Tinder announced that it is rolling out a mandatory facial verification tool for new users in the US to help combat the spread of fake profiles and weed out “bad actors.”Tinder claims its mandatory facial integration feature, called Face Check, is a first for a major dating app. During the sign-up process, new members complete a “liveness check” by taking a short video selfie within the app. The procedure collects and stores an encrypted map of information about the shape of the user’s face. “We don’t store a picture of your face, it’s not photo recognition, it’s data points about the shape of your face that are turned into a mathematical hash,” says Yoel Roth, head of Trust and Safety for Match Group, which owns Tinder. Tinder then uses that “hash” to check whether a new sign-up matches an account that already exists on Tinder.Face Check is currently available to users in California, which will be followed by Texas and other states.In a news release, Roth said the measure “sets a new benchmark for trust and safety across the dating industry” and “it helps tackle one of the hardest problems online, knowing whether someone is real … while adding meaningful obstacles that are difficult for bad actors to circumvent.”The company defines “bad actors” as accounts that engage in deceptive behavior, including spamming, scamming, and bots. Currently 98 percent of the content moderation actions on Tinder address fake accounts, scamming, and spam. “There is a significant volume of the overall trust and safety work we do on Tinder that is focused on this challenge.”Roth says it is a “meaningful improvement in our ability to address scaled abuse. You can get new phone numbers, new email addresses, new devices—you can't really get a new face.”The company is aware that asking new members to scan their faces might be seen as a privacy issue, but “theoretically, if somebody were to get access to every single one of these hashes that’s been created, there isn't really anything they could do.”The app’s previous verification methods were voluntary. Members, depending on their jurisdiction, could opt to verify their profiles through a selfie or ID process. Other dating apps like Bumble also use facial recognition software to let daters verify their authenticity, but on a voluntary basis.When asked what the app plans to do about the fake profiles that already exist, given Face Check applies only to new users, Roth says the tech is most effective in curbing “the biggest issue that we're concerned with, which is the bulk creation of new accounts.”As WIRED previously reported, people in the US have reported nearly $4.5 billion in romance and confidence fraud losses over the past decade, according to an analysis of the FBI’s internet crime reports. Through romance scams, fraudsters, and catfishers create fake identities to woo people and get their money; both crypto and AI can help facilitate these scams.Tinder is undergoing an overhaul with new Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff at the helm. Rascoff, a venture capitalist who cofounded Zillow, took the reins of Match Group in February and within months laid off 13 percent of the company’s workforce. Though Rascoff oversees Match Group’s entire portfolio—which includes Hinge, OkCupid, The League, Plenty of Fish, and others—he also runs operations at Tinder.According to the company, early results of Face Check—created in partnership with the global 3D face liveness and matching software company FaceTec—have led to considerable a decline in potential harm from romance scammers. The tech is already available in Colombia, Canada, Australia, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. Tinder claims there has been a 40 percent decrease in “bad actor reports.” The company is committed to “responsible innovation,” Rascoff said in a news release.Tinder was the big bang of dating apps when it launched in 2012, introducing singles to an era of endless swipes and revolutionizing the dating landscape. Today, however, young people spend less time online swiping for love. In 2024, millennials spent an average of 56 minutes a day on dating apps (down from 90 minutes in 2018). According to a WIRED investigation, Tinder has taken a considerable hit when it comes to where singles spend their time. “While total dating app downloads worldwide have remained above 120 million annually since 2020, the Tinder slice of that download pie has gotten smaller,” WIRED reported this year. In 2024, the app experienced a 7 percent decline in paying users, according to Business Insider.Starting next year, Match Group said, it plans to roll out Face Check across other apps in its portfolio.Compared to dating apps, Roth says, “the balance of privacy is different on a platform focused on speech. In the context of apps that are built to connect people in the real world, we think that there’s not only a moral imperative but a business imperative to prioritize and build for safety.”",

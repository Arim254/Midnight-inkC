    "body": "\nChatGPT has reached 900 million weekly active users, OpenAI announced Friday, putting the AI chatbot within striking distance of 1 billion. OpenAI also shared that it now has 50 million paying subscribers.\n“Subscriber momentum accelerated meaningfully to start the year, with January and February on track to be the largest months for new subscribers in our history,” the company wrote in a blog post. “People use ChatGPT to learn, write, plan, and build. As usage scales, the product improves in ways people feel immediately: faster responses, higher reliability, stronger safety, and more consistent performance.”\nThe new weekly active user figure marks a jump of 100 million users from the 800 million that OpenAI reported in October 2025.\nOpenAI shared the new numbers as part of its announcement that it has raised $110 billion in private funding, marking one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding includes a $50 billion investment from Amazon, along with $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, at a $730 billion pre-money valuation. The round remains open, and the company expects more investors to join. \n\n\tTopics\n",

The employee used confidential OpenAI information in connection with the trades made, the company alleges.\nOpenAI didn’t release the name of the employee. However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets.\nPrediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made. As we recently reported, an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi by betting against DOGE believers.\nPrediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms. Kalshi is a regulated exchange and, in fact, it fined and banned a MrBeast editor for similar alleged insider trading earlier this week. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Fintech\n\n",

At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million. \nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n",

Recent examples include Stripe, which this week said it would allow employees to sell shares at a $159 billion valuation, as well as Clay, ElevenLabs, and Linear.\nBeyond retention and to help staff cover tax bills triggered when RSUs vest, they relieve pressure on management to pursue an IPO before the company is ready.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:07 AM PST · February 27, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSpotify is launching Audiobook Charts for the U.S. and U.K., the company announced on Friday. Similar to the streaming giant’s Music and Podcast Charts, the Audiobook Charts will be updated weekly and highlight the top audiobooks overall and by genre. These rankings are based on listening behavior and engagement on the streaming service, the company says. \nThe new charts are accessible to both free and paying users within the audiobooks hub. You can find them by tapping the search button in the app and selecting the “Audiobooks” tile to enter the hub. Then, you need to scroll down to the “Dive deeper” section to find the charts. \nThe move marks Spotify’s latest investment in the audiobooks space, following its official support of the format in 2022.\nSince then, Spotify has continued investing in audiobooks with additional features like the recently launched “Page Match” tool, which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps,” which are short audio summaries to catch you up on what you’ve already read so far.\nSpotify says the new Audiobook Charts will benefit both readers and authors by giving listeners a trusted way to discover popular titles, while also creating new opportunities for authors and the publishing industry to reach wider audiences.\n“As we’ve proven with Music and Podcasts Charts, when content is easier to access, discover, and enjoy, the demand grows,” said Duncan Bruce, Spotify’s director of Audiobook Partnerships and Licensing, in the blog post. “We are delighted to now bring that to audiobooks, to help provide even more ways for users, publishers, and authors to discover what’s trending on Spotify, and make books more connected with culture in real time.”\nIt’s worth noting that Spotify isn’t only interested in audiobooks, as the streaming giant also recently ventured into physical book sales. Spotify announced earlier this month that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to purchase physical copies of books directly within the app through a partnership with Bookshop.org.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple and Netflix have entered a partnership to co-broadcast the Formula 1 Canadian Grand Prix, announced Thursday by Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue. For the first time, F1 fans in the U.S. will be able to watch the live race simultaneously on both Apple TV and Netflix. \nNetflix subscribers will be able to stream the full race weekend — including practice, qualifying, and the Grand Prix itself on May 24 — live on the platform.\n​Beyond live race coverage, the partnership includes cross-promotion of Netflix’s hit series, “Drive to Survive.” For the first time, the eighth season — which consists of eight episodes covering the 2025 Formula One World Championship — will be available to both Apple TV subscribers in the U.S. and Netflix users globally, significantly broadening its audience. \nSeason 8 premieres today, on February 27. \nF1’s rise in American culture extends beyond television at this point — Brad Pitt’s “F1” is nominated for Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards. “Drive to Survive” has successfully attracted a diverse audience for its behind-the-scenes approach, transforming it from a typical sports docuseries into a compelling narrative that’s brought in millions of new fans.\nThe series has been a particular focus of Apple’s broader F1 ambitions: The company has said it plans to promote the sport across Apple News, Apple Maps (highlighting F1 tracks around the world), Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+, as well as in its physical retail stores.\nThis collaboration also means Netflix continues to push into live sports broadcasting, after pivoting from a “no-sports” stance to securing major rights for NFL Christmas games, WWE Raw, and MLB. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdditionally, the joint effort comes as part of Apple’s new multi-year deal with Formula 1, under which Apple TV replaced ESPN as the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for all 24 races beginning this season. The deal is reportedly valued at around $150 million per season, a significant jump from the roughly $85 million ESPN reportedly paid. All races are available to Apple TV subscribers at no extra charge. The previous partnership with ESPN achieved an average viewership of 1.3 million in its final year.\nNotably, Netflix was previously reported to be eyeing U.S. media rights for Formula 1 back in 2022. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8:57 AM PST · February 27, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nA new set of main series Pokémon games is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2027, marking the 10th installment in the series.\nIn a livestream celebrating the release of the first Pokémon games exactly 30 years ago, the company unveiled Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves, open-world games set across a vast ocean of islands.\n\n\n\nThe three new starter Pokémon were announced as well: Browt, a Grass type “bean chick” that looks like an Angry Bird; Pombon, a Pomeranian-inspired Fire type who better not evolve into a bipedal man; and Gecqua, a Water type gecko with big pink eyes.\nImage Credits:The Pokémon Company\nLeakers have rumored that the new games are set in a region inspired by Indonesia and Southeast Asia — while the trailer doesn’t explicitly confirm this, it makes a good case for proving the rumors correct, showing us lush jungles, seaside mountains, tropical towns, and even underwater reefs. Fans have also honed in on a suspicious-looking cloud in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?\nPokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly 10 years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!\nMain series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region … but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since Pokémon Scarlet and Violet came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and being rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait.\nIn the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen games today for the Switch … but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an extremely easy and legally dubious way to get those games on your phone for free.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the president’s post did not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOpenAI has come out in support of Anthropic’s decision. Per the BBC, CEO Sam Altman sent a memo to staff on Thursday saying he shared the same “red lines” and that any OpenAI-related defense contracts would also reject uses that were “unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons.”\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who very publicly fell out with Altman in November 2023 and has since co-founded his own AI company, also waded into the conversation on Friday, writing on X: “It’s extremely good that Anthropic has not backed down, and it’s significant that OpenAI has taken a similar stance.\nIn the future, there will be much more challenging situations of this nature, and it will be critical for the relevant leaders to rise up to the occasion, for fierce competitors to put their differences aside. Good to see that happen today.”\nAnthropic, OpenAI and Google each received contract awards from the U.S. Defense Department last July. While some Google employees have come out in support of Anthropic, Google and its parent company have yet to comment.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nIn a flurry of deal offers in the high tens of billions of dollars, the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery is over. David Ellison-owned Paramount will acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nParamount will take on the about $33 billion in debt held by Warner Bros. Discovery, according to the deal. Larry Ellison, whose net worth is $201 billion, according to Bloomberg, has agreed to supply the additional equity to fulfill Paramount’s bid. Paramount’s market cap is about $12 billion.\nThe deal is also being financed by a $57.5 billion debt commitment from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, and Apollo Global Management.\nNetflix shares jumped as much as 10% in after-hours trading in New York. Shares in Paramount were up 4.5%.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGraham Starr is the deputy editor of TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI has raised $110 billion in private funding, the company announced Friday morning, commencing one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding consists of a $50 billion investment from Amazon as well as $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, against a $730 billion pre-money valuation.\nNotably, the round remains open, and OpenAI expects more investors to join as it proceeds.\n“We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,” OpenAI said. “Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.”\nAs part of the investment, OpenAI is launching significant infrastructure partnerships with both Amazon and Nvidia. As in previous rounds, it is likely that a significant portion of the dollar amount comes in the form of services rather than cash, although the precise split was not disclosed.\nThe company’s previous round closed in March 2025, raising $40 billion against a $300 billion valuation. At the time, it was the largest private funding round on record.\nAs part of its Amazon partnership, OpenAI plans to develop a new “stateful runtime environment” where OpenAI models will run on Amazon’s Bedrock platform. The company will also expand its previously announced AWS partnership, which committed $38 billion in compute services, by $100 billion. OpenAI has committed to consuming at least 2GW of AWS Trainium compute as part of the deal, and also plans to build custom models to support Amazon consumer products.\n“We have lots of developers and companies eager to run services powered by OpenAI models on AWS,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement, “and our unique collaboration with OpenAI to provide stateful runtime environments will change what’s possible for customers building AI apps and agents.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Information had previously reported that $35 billion of Amazon’s investment could be contingent on the company either achieving AGI or making its IPO by the end of the year. OpenAI’s announcement confirms the funding split, but says only that the additional $35 billion will arrive “in the coming months when certain conditions are met.”\nOpenAI gave fewer details on the Nvidia partnership, but said it had committed to using “3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems” as part of the deal.\nNvidia’s participation in the round has been the subject of intense speculation, particularly as reports of a $100 billion investment in September gave way to reports of a smaller investment in the months that followed. \nIn January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed the idea that Nvidia was backing away from OpenAI, saying, “we will invest a great deal of money. I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nA rise in the need for computers and data centers to power AI is causing a massive shortage of RAM, driving memory prices sharply higher. Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade. Hours after IDC published its report, another analyst firm, Counterpoint, made a similar prediction and said the market will dip by 12% this year.\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\nImage Credits:IDC\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIDC added that it expects RAM prices to stabilize by mid-2027.\nCounterpoint said that premium smartphones would be more resilient to this change, but the sub-$200 smartphone segment will see a 20% dip. \n“The impact is expected to continue through H2 2027, as it will take several quarters for memory supply expansion to materialize. Lower-end smartphones are likely to be affected the most, especially as LPDDR4 supply is shrinking faster than expected. OEMs are already responding with launch delays, streamlined portfolios, and specification trade-offs. We have also observed 10% to 20% price increases across some Android OEM portfolios in January 2026,” Principal Analyst Yang Wang said.\nImage Credits:Counterpoint\nThe firm also predicted that pricing volatility amid handsets will also drive the second-hand devices market up. \nEarlier this year, Nothing co-founder and CEO Carl Pei also warned that smartphones will cost more in 2026 as memory costs for smartphones rise. “Brands now face a simple choice: raise prices by 30% or more in some cases, or downgrade specs. The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWeeks after stepping down as CEO from food delivery service Zomato and its parent Eternal, Indian entrepreneur Deepinder Goyal is back with a $54 million raise for wearable startup Temple, part of what the 43-year-old earlier described as a shift toward “higher-risk exploration and experimentation.”\nOn Friday, Goyal said in a post on X that Temple had raised funds in a friends-and-family round from founder friends and early Zomato backers, at a post-money valuation of about $190 million. More than 30 employees participated at the same valuation, he said.\nGoyal is leading the funding round, followed by Steadview Capital, according to regulatory filings reviewed by TechCrunch. Other investors include Peak XV Partners, InfoEdge Ventures, and Dharana Capital, alongside angel investors such as Vijay Shekhar Sharma of Paytm, Kunal Shah of CRED, Nithin Kamath and Nikhil Kamath of Zerodha, as well as current and former Eternal executives including Akshant Goyal, Aditya Mangla, Kunal Swarup, Akriti Chopra, and Rahul Ganjoo.\nGoyal stepped down as chief executive of Zomato and its parent, Eternal, in January, handing the role to Albinder Dhindsa, who leads the quick-commerce unit Blinkit. The move marked a major transition for Goyal after nearly two decades at the helm of the food delivery company he co-founded in 2008.\nTemple is one of the clearest expressions yet of that shift. The startup is focused on building a high-performance wearable for elite athletes, an area Goyal has described as ripe for deeper technological innovation.\nDuring a January conversation with podcaster Raj Shamani, Goyal described Temple’s wearable as a sensor designed to sit on the wearer’s temple and continuously track cerebral blood flow.\nIn a separate post on X earlier Friday, he said Temple aims to build what he called “the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes,” claiming the device would measure metrics that existing wearables cannot. He also outlined an expansive hiring push spanning embedded systems, computational neuroscience, and brain-computer interface engineering.\n\nWe're recruiting at @temple.At Temple, we are building the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes. A device that measures what no other wearable in the world measures, with a level of precision that doesn't exist yet.To build it, we need people who are obsessive… pic.twitter.com/iCHaMUwdEw— Deepinder Goyal (@deepigoyal) February 27, 2026\n\nThe startup is entering an increasingly crowded and well-funded wearables market, where companies such as Whoop, Oura, and Garmin have spent years refining devices that track sleep, recovery, and athletic performance. Whether Temple can meaningfully differentiate its technology remains an open question.\nThe push into Temple is part of a broader shift in Goyal’s investment focus. In October 2025, he said he had committed $25 million of his own capital to another new venture, Continue Research, which is exploring ways to extend human lifespan. He is also a co-founder of aviation startup LAT Aerospace, which recently expanded into defense technology with the acquisition of early-stage firm Sharang Shakti.\nGoyal built his reputation at Zomato, which he co-founded with Pankaj Chaddah and spent nearly two decades building into one of India’s largest food delivery platforms before stepping down as chief executive earlier this year.\nChaddah exited the company in 2018, as Zomato continued to consolidate its position through acquisitions, including the purchase of Uber Eats’ India business in 2020 and grocery delivery platform Blinkit — then known as Grofers — for $568 million in 2022.\nBefore Temple, Goyal had also backed health and fitness startups, including Ultrahuman, an India-based wearable maker that competes with Oura’s smart ring, underscoring his growing focus on performance and health technology.\nGoyal declined to comment further on Temple.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIn a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety.  He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\nImage Credits:imgflip\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI. \nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them. \nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance. \nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons. \n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\nSo what now?\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company. \nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic.\n",

    "body": "\nThis week it was reported that U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is in dire shape, after a year of cuts, layoffs, and furloughs under the Trump administration. Now the agency has replaced its top acting leader, a CISA spokesperson tells TechCrunch.\nThe move to replace Madhu Gottumukkala as the acting director of CISA, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees cybersecurity and technical protection across the federal government, comes after a tumultuous year serving as the agency’s top boss.\nGottumukkala struggled to lead the agency during his tenure as acting director and caused security headaches, including the uploading of sensitive government documents to ChatGPT, according to reports. Staffing at the agency was slashed by one-third. Gottumukkala also reportedly failed a counterintelligence polygraph he took in order to view classified documents, and suspended several career officials in response, including the agency’s then-chief security officer.\nBefore being nominated to CISA as deputy director, Gottumukkala was chief technology officer of South Dakota under then-governor and current Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.\nABC News was first to report Gottumukkala’s departure.\nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch on Friday, CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy claimed Gottumukkala had done a “remarkable job.” McCarthy told TechCrunch that Nick Andersen will replace Gottumukkala as CISA’s new acting director, and that Gottumukkala has been moved to a new position as director of strategic implementation in the Department of Homeland Security, which houses CISA. \nPrior to his appointment as acting director to lead CISA, Andersen served as the agency’s top official overseeing its cybersecurity division.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe agency still hasn’t had a permanent Senate-confirmed director since Trump returned to office.\nMcCarthy said the Trump administration has chosen Sean Plankey to be the agency’s permanent director, which requires a majority vote of approval in the U.S. Senate. \nThe White House re-nominated Plankey to head CISA in January, after Sen. Ron Wyden last year blocked Plankey’s nomination until the agency agreed to release an unclassified report allegedly describing cybersecurity flaws at phone and telecommunication giants. Wyden demanded the report’s release in the wake of hundreds of hacks targeting U.S. and international phone and internet providers by the China-backed hacking group known as Salt Typhoon. The Senate has yet to schedule Plankey’s nomination hearing.\nNextgov reported Thursday that CISA lost another top senior official, Bob Costello, the agency’s chief information officer tasked with overseeing the agency’s IT systems and data policies. The news outlet reported Gottumukkala tried to transfer Costello but was blocked by unnamed political appointees.\nCISA’s spokesperson McCarthy did not address Costello’s departure when asked by TechCrunch, but did not dispute the report.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

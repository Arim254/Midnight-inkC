    "body": "\nIn Brief\nPosted:\n3:54 PM PST · February 17, 2026\n\nImage Credits:Lattice\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\nJack Altman and Benchmark announced today that he would be joining the firm as a general partner. \nThis news is a big deal, especially since Altman has been running his own VC firm, Alt Capital, since at least 2024. The fund raised a $150 million Fund I in early 2024 and then, just last September, announced a $274 million Fund II, raised in just a week. On LinkedIn, Altman called the past two years running Alt Capital “the most rewarding” of his life, adding that he loved “new ideas and being part of a team with a mission.” \nAlt Capital invested in at least 52 companies, according to PitchBook, including Rippling, Antares Nuclear, and CompLabs. It’s unclear what happens to Alt Capital or whether Benchmark has acquired its portfolio, as Altman also announced that his teammates from the fund will be following him to Benchmark. (That’s also unusual, given Benchmark has historically been structured as a flat firm with primarily GPs only, versus layers of investors.)\nAltman also said he will retain the board seats at the companies he backed while at Alt Capital. \nAltman did not respond to requests for comment earlier today; Benchmark declined to comment.\nAltman, a younger brother of OpenAI co-founder Sam, is also the founder of the HR platform Lattice, which he still chairs, per his LinkedIn profile. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n",

Of this, $1 billion is dedicated to early-stage investments, while the rest is for growth-stage investments, according to an announcement from the firm.\nThrive told Bloomberg that this latest fundraise was oversubscribed. This is the firm’s 10th fund — called Thrive X — and comes as some of the firm’s biggest investments, including OpenAI, Stripe, and SpaceX, continue to soar in value. Some of the firm’s other notable investments include Databricks, Anduril, and Cursor. The firm also incubates companies, having spun up 12 so far, with at least six now having reached unicorn status.\nThe firm’s strategy is to “commit deeply to a small number of founders,” the firm said in its announcement. “Concentration demands loyalty to the founders and missions we back.”\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Josh Kushner, founder of the firm, said he believed the winners of the AI boom would “be bigger than we can ever imagine,” and that the technology is still nascent.\nThrive’s massive raise also hints at something else. IPO rumors have swirled around OpenAI and SpaceX in particular, bringing considerable interest from limited partners awaiting returns. These two companies could lead to an unprecedented flow of capital back to limited partners.\nWe’ve reached out to Thrive for more information.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n",

Now, Bloomberg writes that the development of such a device — along with two other AI-powered items — is accelerating as Apple looks to stay competitive with other tech giants that are racing to release similar products.\nIn addition to the AI pin, Apple is also speeding up the development of its upcoming AI-powered smart glasses, which have been code-named N50, the report claims. Apple obviously has competition in this space, as other companies — including Meta (which is arguably the most successful player when it comes to smart glasses) and Snap (which plans to release its “Specs” later this year) — are working on similar products.\nApple’s new smart glasses, which will supposedly include a high-resolution camera, may see a public release sooner rather than later, with Bloomberg reporting that the company is “targeting the start of production as early as December, ahead of a public release in 2027.” \nAdditionally, Bloomberg reports that Apple is working on AirPods with new AI capabilities.\nAll of these items will be designed to connect to the iPhone and will include Siri, the company’s virtual assistant, as a critical component of the user experience, the outlet notes. The glasses are being described as “more upscale and feature-rich” than the AirPods and the AI pendant, however.

    "body": "\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles will not suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days because the EV maker has stopped using the term “Autopilot” in the marketing of its vehicles in the state.\nThe decision, issued late Tuesday, means Tesla can continue selling its EVs in California without interruption and officially settles a case that has been dragging on for nearly three years. California is Tesla’s biggest U.S. market.\nIn November 2023, the DMV filed accusations that Tesla violated state law by using deceptive marketing of Autopilot, its basic advanced driver assistance system, as well as its more capable Full Self-Driving driver assistance software. The state regulator argued that the terms mislead customers and distorted the capabilities of the advanced driver assistance systems.\nTesla stopped using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability,” and instead used Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to more accurately describe the system and clarify that drivers were still required to monitor it. But Tesla held on to the Autopilot term, prompting the DMV to refer the case to an administrative law judge at the California Office of Administrative Hearings.\nIn December, the administrative law judge agreed with the DMV’s request to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its actions. The DMV agreed with the ruling, but didn’t pounce; instead, the state regulator gave Tesla 60 days to comply.\n“Since then, Tesla took corrective action and has stopped using the misleading term ‘Autopilot’ in the marketing of its electric vehicles in California,” the DMV stated in a release posted on its website. “Tesla had previously modified its use of the term ‘Full Self-Driving’ to clarify that driver supervision is required. By taking this prescribed action, Tesla will avoid having its dealer and manufacturer licenses suspended in the state for 30 days by the DMV.”\nTesla didn’t just stop using the term Autopilot, though. In January, the company discontinued Autopilot in the U.S. and Canada altogether. The move not only helped it comply with the DMV but was also viewed as a way to boost adoption of FSD, which unlike Autopilot, requires the owner to pay for the upgraded system.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFSD Supervised, which until February 14 required an $8,000 one-time fee, is now only available through a monthly subscription of $99. That subscription fee is expected to increase as the system becomes more capable, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

The company noted that users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. This will allow users to unlock exclusive content while creating monetization opportunities for creators.\nCreators can set their own monthly prices for subscription within the app, while Snap will recommend different tiers to them. The subscription will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator’s public Stories, and ad-free consumption for that creator’s Stories.\nSnap noted that this is a new way for creators to earn more money besides the existing programs.\n“Expanding on existing monetization offerings like the Unified Monetization Program and the Snap Star Collab Studio, Creator Subscriptions introduce a premium layer of connection directly into how Snapchatters already engage with creators across Stories, Chat, and replies,” the company said in the blog post.\nSnapchat reached 946 million daily active users, according to the company’s Q4 2025 results. The platform noted during its earnings that the number of U.S.-based users posting to Spotlight grew over 47% year-over-year. The company also spun out hardware to a new entity called Specs last month. \nThe company added that it plans to expand the program to Snap Stars in Canada, the U.K., and France in the coming weeks.\nRival company Meta also allows creators to offer subscriptions on platforms like Instagram and Facebook, which gives users access to exclusive content and badges.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Anthropic described the new context window as “enough to hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request.”\nThe release comes just two weeks after the launch of Opus 4.6, with an updated Haiku model likely to follow in the coming weeks.\nThe launch comes with a new set of record benchmark scores, including OS World for computer use and SWE-Bench for software engineering. But perhaps the most impressive is its 60.4% score on ARC-AGI-2, meant to measure skills specific to human intelligence. The score puts Sonnet 4.6 above most comparable models, although it still trails models like Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Deep Think, and one refined version of GPT 5.2.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

    "body": "\nThe European Parliament has reportedly blocked lawmakers from using the baked-in AI tools on their work devices, citing cybersecurity and privacy risks with uploading confidential correspondence to the cloud.\nPer an email seen by Politico, the parliament’s IT department said it could not guarantee the security of the data uploaded to the servers of AI companies and that the full extent of what information is shared with AI companies is “still being assessed.”\nAs such, the email said, “It is considered safer to keep such features disabled.”\nUploading data to AI chatbots, like Anthropic’s Claude, Microsoft’s Copilot, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, means that U.S. authorities can demand the companies that run the chatbots turn over information about their users.\nAI chatbots also typically rely on using information that users provide or upload to improve their models, increasing the chance that potentially sensitive information uploaded by one person may be shared and seen by other users.\nEurope has some of the strongest data protection rules in the world. But the European Commission, the executive body that oversees the 27-member state bloc, last year floated new legislative proposals aimed at relaxing its data protection rules to make it easier for tech giants to train their AI models on Europeans’ data, drawing ire from critics who said the move caves in to U.S. technology giants.\nThe move to restrict European lawmakers from accessing AI products on their devices comes as several EU member countries reevaluate their relationships with U.S. tech giants, which remain subject to U.S. law and the unpredictable whims and demands of the Trump administration.\nIn recent weeks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has sent hundreds of subpoenas demanding U.S. tech and social media giants turn over information about people, including Americans, who have been publicly critical of the Trump administration’s policies. \nGoogle, Meta, and Reddit complied in several cases, even though the subpoenas had not been issued by a judge and were not enforced by a court.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch. He also authors the weekly cybersecurity newsletter, this week in security. \nHe can be reached via encrypted message at zackwhittaker.1337 on Signal.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:06 AM PST · February 17, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nApple is taking on YouTube and Spotify with a new video podcast experience launching in the spring. Users will be able to switch between watching and listening to shows in the Apple Podcasts app, which will begin using the company’s HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video technology. Users can also switch to a horizontal version of the podcast and download videos to watch offline.\nThe move comes as video podcasting continues to gain popularity. Edison Research recently revealed that 51% of the U.S. population has consumed a video podcast, and that 37% consume video podcasts monthly.\nImage Credits:Apple\nThe updated video podcast experience will allow Apple to better compete with the likes of YouTube, Spotify, and even Netflix, all of which have already embraced the format. YouTube announced last year that it has more than 1 billion monthly active viewers of podcast content. Spotify said last November that it has half a million video podcasts, which nearly 400 million users have watched. As for Netflix, the streaming giant has partnered with iHeartMedia and Spotify to bring video podcasts to its platform.  \nBy bringing an enhanced video podcast viewing experience to its app, Apple is aiming to keep users from turning to rival platforms to watch their favorite shows.\n“Twenty years ago, Apple helped take podcasting mainstream by adding podcasts to iTunes, and more than a decade ago, we introduced the dedicated Apple Podcasts app,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services, in a press release. “Today marks a defining milestone in that journey. By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we’re putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts.”\nWhile the new video experience will officially launch in the spring, the update is available to test starting this week as part of betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and visionOS 26.4.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIt’s a challenge every startup faces: They’ve made a prototype and proven the thing works, but now have to sell the product and produce enough to get past the “valley of death” that kills so many companies.\n“They are chicken and egg stuck,” Josh Felser, co-founder and managing partner of early-stage venture firm Climactic, told TechCrunch.\nThe hurdle is particularly high for companies making physical goods. Felser noticed it was a common occurrence among startups producing novel materials. Felser, who previously founded and invested in software startups, said the problem they faced seemed a bit unfair. \n“Software companies sell at a negative margin all the time in the beginning, you know, Uber, Lyft, you can look at lots of different examples,” he said. “But for materials companies, they’re not allowed to do that. One of the questions I had is, ‘Why is that?’”\nFelser found that unlike software companies, which can quickly add more capacity from cloud service providers, materials startups face a market skeptical of their ability to scale up production without a guaranteed customer.\nFelser decided to give them one. \nHe doesn’t run a company with a big budget for clever materials, but he knows a few. And as a climate tech investor, he knows more than a few startups that could benefit from a well-known customer.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFelser has been quietly working on a new project, called Material Scale, that brings the two sides together using a hybrid debt-equity investment vehicle to give materials startups a boost, TechCrunch has learned. Material Scale will initially focus on climate tech startups in the apparel industry. \nMaterial Scale is betting on startups with commercial-ready products that are ready to scale if a customer can purchase in bulk. Buyers will commit enough funds to cover the cost of the material at market price. Material Scale will fund the difference through a combination of loans and warrants in the startup. \n“It’s really minimally dilutive,” Felser said.\nRalph Lauren is joining the platform as a buyer for the initial launch of Material Scale. Investor Structure Climate is joining Climactic as a general partner.\nMoney from purchase orders flows from the buyer through Material Scale to the startup. “In effect, we buy it and then simultaneously sell it,” Felser said.\nThe deals between Material Scale and the buyer and between Material Scale and the startup will be inked essentially at the same time. \n“Once they sign the deals, this’ll be interesting because the value of the company has significantly changed because they’ve now got a buyer and they’ve got funding to achieve scale,” he said.\nMaterial Scale hasn’t executed any deals yet; Felser said he has large apparel manufacturers interested in participating and a long roster of startups that could use the funding. “The startups all want it,” he said. “We have a big list of companies that are candidates that we’re talking with.”\nThe first investments will come out of a special purpose vehicle totaling about $11 million. Felser hopes to eventually branch out into other, similar markets like alternative fuels, eventually growing the Material Scale concept to nine figures.\nHe hopes other investors will steal his idea.\n“We need more novel instruments like this to attack climate change,” he said. “We want to be nimble and be able to take advantage of opportunities when we see them and not just be doing the same old thing.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nMistral AI, the French company last valued at $13.8 billion, has made its first acquisition. The OpenAI competitor has agreed to buy Koyeb, a Paris-based startup that simplifies AI app deployment at scale and manages the infrastructure behind it.\nMistral has been primarily known for developing large language models (LLMs), but this deal confirms its ambitions to position itself as a full-stack player. In June 2025, it had announced Mistral Compute, an AI cloud infrastructure offering which it now hopes Koyeb will accelerate.\nFounded in 2020 by three former employees of French cloud provider Scaleway, Koyeb aimed to help developers process data without worrying about server infrastructure — a concept known as serverless. This approach gained relevance as AI grew more demanding, also inspiring the recent launch of Koyeb Sandboxes, which provide isolated environments to deploy AI agents.\nBefore the acquisition, Koyeb’s platform already helped users deploy models from Mistral and others. In a blog post, Koyeb said its platform will continue operating. But its team and technology will now also help Mistral deploy models directly on clients’ own hardware (on premises), optimize its use of GPUs, and help scale AI inference — the process of running a trained AI model to generate responses — according to a press release from Mistral.\nAs part of the deal, Koyeb’s 13 employees and its three co-founders, Yann Léger, Edouard Bonlieu, and Bastien Chatelard (pictured above in 2020), are set to join the engineering team of Mistral, overseen by CTO and co-founder Timothée Lacroix. Under his leadership, Koyeb expects its platform to transition into a “core component” of Mistral Compute over the coming months.\n“Koyeb’s product and expertise will accelerate our development on the Compute front, and contribute to building a true AI cloud,” Lacroix wrote in a statement. Mistral has been ramping up its cloud ambitions. Just a few days ago, the company announced a $1.4 billion investment in data centers in Sweden amid growing demand for alternatives to U.S. infrastructure.\nKoyeb had raised $8.6 million to date, including a $1.6 million pre-seed round in 2020, followed in 2023 by a $7 million seed round led by Paris-based VC firm Serena, whose principal Floriane de Maupeou celebrated the acquisition. For the firm, this combination will play a key role “in building the foundations of sovereign AI infrastructure in Europe,” she told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn part thanks to these geopolitical tailwinds, but also due to its focus on helping enterprises unlock value from AI, Mistral recently passed the milestone of $400 million in annual recurring revenue. Koyeb, too, will be focused on enterprise clients going forward, and new users will no longer be able to sign up for its Starter tier. \nMistral didn’t disclose financial terms of the deal, and it is unknown whether other acquisitions are in the works. But speaking at Stockholm’s Techarena conference last week, CEO Arthur Mensch said Mistral is hiring for infrastructure and other roles, pitching the company to prospective employees as an organization that is “headquartered in Europe, that is doing frontier research in Europe.”\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nWhen we talk about the cost of AI infrastructure, the focus is usually on Nvidia and GPUs — but memory is an increasingly important part of the picture. As hyperscalers prepare to build out billions of dollars’ worth of new data centers, the price for DRAM chips has jumped roughly 7x in the last year.\nAt the same time, there’s a growing discipline in orchestrating all that memory to make sure the right data gets to the right agent at the right time. The companies that master it will be able to make the same queries with fewer tokens, which can be the difference between folding and staying in business.\nSemiconductor analyst Doug O’Laughlin has an interesting look at the importance of memory chips on his Substack, where he talks with Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka. They’re both semiconductor guys, so the focus is more on the chips than the broader architecture; the implications for AI software are pretty significant too.\nI was particularly struck by this passage, in which Bercovici looks at the growing complexity of Anthropic’s prompt-caching documentation:\n\nThe tell is if we go to Anthropic’s prompt caching pricing page. It started off as a very simple page six or seven months ago, especially as Claude Code was launching — just “use caching, it’s cheaper.” Now it’s an encyclopedia of advice on exactly how many cache writes to pre-buy. You’ve got 5-minute tiers, which are very common across the industry, or 1-hour tiers — and nothing above. That’s a really important tell. Then of course you’ve got all sorts of arbitrage opportunities around the pricing for cache reads based on how many cache writes you’ve pre-purchased.\n\nThe question here is how long Claude holds your prompt in cached memory: You can pay for a 5-minute window, or pay more for an hour-long window. It’s much cheaper to draw on data that’s still in the cache, so if you manage it right, you can save an awful lot. There is a catch though: Every new bit of data you add to the query may bump something else out of the cache window.\nThis is complex stuff, but the upshot is simple enough: Managing memory in AI models is going to be a huge part of AI going forward. Companies that do it well are going to rise to the top.\nAnd there is plenty of progress to be made in this new field. Back in October, I covered a startup called Tensormesh that was working on one layer in the stack known as cache optimization.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOpportunities exist in other parts of the stack. For instance, lower down the stack, there’s the question of how data centers are using the different types of memory they have. (The interview includes a nice discussion of when DRAM chips are used instead of HBM, although it’s pretty deep in the hardware weeds.) Higher up the stack, end users are figuring out how to structure their model swarms to take advantage of the shared cache.\nAs companies get better at memory orchestration, they’ll use fewer tokens and inference will get cheaper. Meanwhile, models are getting more efficient at processing each token, pushing the cost down still further. As server costs drop, a lot of applications that don’t seem viable now will start to edge into profitability.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

To attract investment, the government is rolling out a mix of tax incentives, state-backed venture capital, and policy support aimed at pulling more of the global AI value chain into the South Asian nation.\nIndia’s pitch comes as U.S. technology giants, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have already committed about $70 billion to expand AI and cloud infrastructure in the country, giving New Delhi a foundation to argue it can combine scale, cost advantages, and policy incentives to attract the next wave of global AI computing investment.\nWhile the bulk of the projected $200 billion is expected to flow into AI infrastructure — including data centers, chips, and supporting systems, and encompassing the around $70 billion already pledged by Big Tech companies — Vaishnaw said the Indian government also anticipates an additional $17 billion of investment into deep-tech and AI applications, highlighting a push to move beyond infrastructure and capture more of the value chain.\nThe effort is backed by recent policy decisions aimed at making India a more attractive base for AI computing, including long-term tax relief for export-oriented cloud services and a ₹100 billion (about $1.1 billion) government-backed venture program targeting high-risk areas such as AI and advanced manufacturing. Earlier this month, New Delhi also extended the period for which deep-tech companies qualify as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.08 million).\n“We have seen VCs committing funds for dtech startups,” Vaishnaw said at a press briefing on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. “We have seen VCs and other players committing funds for big solutions, big applications. We have seen VCs committing funds for further research in cutting-edge models.”\nIndia plans to scale its shared compute capacity under the IndiaAI Mission beyond its existing 38,000 GPUs, the minister said, with an additional 20,000 units to be added in the coming weeks, signaling what he described as the next phase of the country’s AI strategy.\nLooking ahead, Vaishnaw said the Indian government is preparing a second phase of its AI Mission, with a stronger focus on research and development, innovation, and wider diffusion of AI tools, alongside further expansion of shared compute capacity, as India seeks to broaden access to AI infrastructure beyond a small group of companies.\nThe push also faces structural challenges, including access to reliable power and water for energy-intensive data centers, underlining the execution risks as India seeks to compress years of AI infrastructure build-out into a much shorter time frame.\nVaishnaw acknowledged those challenges, saying the government was cognizant of the pressure AI infrastructure would place on power and water resources, and pointed to India’s energy mix — with more than half of installed generation capacity coming from clean sources — as an advantage as demand from data centers rises.\nWhether India can deliver on that vision will matter well beyond its borders, as companies seek new locations for AI computing amid rising costs, capacity constraints, and intensifying global competition.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAn internal research study at Meta dubbed “Project MYST” created in partnership with the University of Chicago, found that parental supervision and controls — such as time limits and restricted access — had little impact on kids’ compulsive use of social media. The study also found that kids who experienced stressful life events were more likely to lack the ability to moderate their social media use appropriately.\nThis was one of the notable claims revealed during testimony at the social media addiction trial that began last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is identified by her initials “KGM” or her first name, “Kaley.” She, along with her mother and others joining the case, is accusing social media companies of creating “addictive and dangerous” products that led the young users to suffer anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and more.\nThe case is now one of several landmark trials that will take place this year, which accuse social media companies of harming children. The results of these lawsuits will impact these companies’ approach to their younger users and could prompt regulators to take further action. \nIn this case, the plaintiff sued Meta, YouTube, ByteDance (TikTok), and Snap, but the latter two companies had settled their claims before the trial’s start.\nIn the jury trial now underway in LA, Kaley’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, brought up an internal study at Meta, which he said found evidence that Meta knew of, yet didn’t publicize, these specific harms.\nIn Project MYST, which stands for the Meta and Youth Social Emotional Trends survey, Meta’s research concluded that “parental and household factors have little association with teens’ reported levels of attentiveness to their social media use.” \nOr, in other words, even when parents try to control their children’s social media use, either by using parental controls or even just household rules and supervision, it doesn’t impact whether or not the child will overuse social media or use it compulsively. The study was based on a survey of 1,000 teens and their parents about their social media use.\nThe study also noted that both parents and teens agreed on this front, saying “there is no association between either parental reports or teen reports of parental supervision, and teens’ survey measures of attentiveness or capability.”\nIf the study’s findings are accurate, that would mean that the use of things like the built-in parental controls in the Instagram app or the time limits on smartphones wouldn’t necessarily help teens become less inclined to overuse social media, the plaintiff’s lawyer argued. As the original complaint alleges, teens are being exploited by social media products, whose defects include algorithmic feeds designed to keep users scrolling, intermittent variable rewards that manipulate dopamine delivery, incessant notifications, deficient tools for parental controls, and more.\nDuring his testimony, Instagram head Adam Mosseri claimed not to be familiar with Meta’s Project MYST, even though a document seemed to indicate he had given his approval to move forward with the study.\n“We do a lot of research projects,” Mosseri said, after claiming he couldn’t remember anything specific about MYST beyond its name. \nHowever, the plaintiff’s lawyer pointed to this study as an example of why social media companies should be held accountable for their alleged harms, not the parents. He noted that Kaley’s mother, for example, had tried to stop her daughter’s social media addiction and use, even taking her phone away at times. \nWhat’s more, the study found that teens who had a greater number of adverse life experiences — like those dealing with alcoholic parents, harassment at school, or other issues — reported less attentiveness over their social media use. That means that kids facing trauma in their real lives were more at risk of addiction, the lawyer argued. \nOn the stand, Mosseri seemed to partially agree with this finding, saying, “There’s a variety of reasons this can be the case. One I’ve heard often is that people use Instagram as a way to escape from a more difficult reality.” Meta is careful not to label any sort of overuse as addiction; instead, Mosseri stated that the company uses the term “problematic use” to refer to someone “spending more time on Instagram than they feel good about.” \nLawyers for Meta, meanwhile, pushed the idea that the study was more narrowly focused on understanding if teens felt they were using social media too much, not whether or not they were actually addicted. They also generally aimed to put more of the responsibility on parents and the realities of life as the catalyst for kids like Kaley’s negative emotional states, not companies’ social media products.\nFor instance, Meta’s lawyers pointed to Kaley being a child of divorced parents, with an abusive father, and facing bullying at school.\nHow the jury will interpret the findings of studies like Project MYST and others, along with the testimonies from both sides, remains to be seen. Mosseri did note, however, that MYST’s findings had not been published publicly, and no warnings were ever issued to teens or parents as a result of the research.\nMeta has been asked for comment. \n",

    "body": "\nAmazon is rolling out a new user interface for its Fire TV streaming devices, designed to put more focus on the content, while also simplifying navigation. The update, which is initially available to Fire TV owners in the U.S., represents the first major Fire TV redesign in years.\nThe changes arrive after an explosion of streaming content has made it more difficult to know what’s available to watch on which service, requiring streaming platforms like Fire TV to serve more as a discovery hub than just a tool to launch streaming apps.  \nThe company first previewed the new design at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, showing off an interface intended to make Fire TV feel less cluttered. The updated design features rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content, and it adds more space for pinned apps.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nPreviously, Fire TV users could only pin six apps to the home screen. Now, with smaller app icons, the update expands that to 20 slots for apps, accommodating services like Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Max, and other top streamers.\nIn addition, the navigation bar at the top of the screen has been simplified into categories marked with simple icons, including  Movies, TV, Live TV, Sports, and News. The search button is also easily within reach to the left of the Home tab.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nWithin these tabs, Fire TV surfaces the content you’re already watching and displays other suggestions drawn from the services you’ve subscribed to, organized in rows labeled “For You.” The tabs also highlight free movies to stream, top movies and shows, and other paid content you might enjoy.\nThe Live TV tab, meanwhile, centralizes access to the live content that’s available across your streaming services, plus broadcast or cable TV, if you subscribe or use an antenna. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nLess frequently used features live under a three-line “hamburger” menu on the left, and include Games, Art & Photos, the Appstore, Music Video & Audio, a universal watchlist called “My Stuff,” Settings, and other options.\nAmazon’s AI assistant Alexa+ is also built into the new interface, allowing users to ask questions on almost any topic, not just movies and TV. Queries can be asked using natural language, and Fire TV owners can refine them or ask follow-up questions as they chat with the AI assistant. The AI can also interact with on-screen content. For instance, you could select a movie tile and say, “Tell me more about that one.” You can even ask nuanced questions like, “Find me more movies that have the same look.”\nImage Credits:Amazon\nAmazon recently announced that Alexa+ is available to customers with a Prime subscription as an included perk. Others can choose to pay for access separately. \nThe new user interface launches first on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen), and the Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series in the U.S. This spring, it will roll out to more countries and devices, including the latest generation of the Fire TV 4K streaming players and TVs such as the Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, and Fire TV Omni QLED Series, as well as TVs made by partners like Hisense, Insignia, Panasonic, and TCL.\nThe update is also available on the new Amazon Ember Artline, a new series of televisions that can make your TV screen look like a framed work of art when not in use.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Silverman, who headed the marketplace for eight years, will become its executive chairman.\nGoyal worked at Etsy for more than 10 years until she was named the CEO of social-commerce platform Depop, which Etsy bought four years ago. She has been in her current role for about seven months.\nEtsy has faced challenges in growing its business and may be looking to Goyal’s experience leading Depop to help revive growth. In its third quarter ended September 30, the number of active buyers on Etsy fell 5% to 86.6 million from a year earlier. The company experienced a user boycott in July after allowing the sale of merchandise branded with “Alligator Alcatraz” on its site.\nSellers on Etsy declined by 10.9% to 5.5 million in the third quarter, compared to a year earlier. Gross merchandise sales (GMS) for the quarter dropped 2.4% to $2.4 billion.\nIn contrast, Depop performed well, with the number of active sellers rising 40% to 3 million and active buyers increasing 38% to 6.6 million. Depop’s GMS jumped 39.4% to $292.1 million.\nFollowing the news, Etsy’s shares were down nearly 9%.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n",

The company on Tuesday also said it had invested $1 billion in Nokia and would use some of its products to “enable communication service providers to launch AI-native 5G-Advanced and 6G networks on NVIDIA platforms.”\nThe milestone comes just three months after Nvidia became the first company to cross the $4 trillion milestone. Its stock has surged more than 50% so far this year, buoyed by seemingly insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPU), which are being used widely in data centers for training large language models, inference and more. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way.\nMore generally, tech stocks have surged this year on optimism that AI tech stands to revolutionize industries across the world, similar to how the advent of the internet changed business. Over the past year, investors have been encouraged by a spree of multi-billion-dollar deals — several of which had Nvidia at the center — to spur the development of data centers and infrastructure to build the compute capacity for resource-intensive AI models. In September, Nvidia announced that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, another beneficiary of the AI boom, in the coming years. Both companies said at the time that they intend to deploy 10GW worth of Nvidia systems to power OpenAI’s systems.  \nWith a market cap of $5 trillion, Nvidia is now worth more than the aggregated stock markets of all countries, apart from the United States, China and Japan.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTypically, when a company acquires another, it will absorb the new company’s branding or integrate it with its own identity. Grammarly is doing something different: After acquiring email client Superhuman in July, the company is renaming itself “Superhuman.” \nDespite the branding change, Grammarly, the product, will continue to be known as it has. However, the company says it is thinking about rebranding products like Coda, a productivity platform it acquired last year, in the long run.\nThe company is also launching an AI assistant called Superhuman Go that’s built into Grammarly’s existing extension. The assistant can provide writing suggestions, give feedback on emails, and you can even connect it with other apps like Jira, Gmail, Google Drive and Google Calendar to arm it with more context. The assistant can use these connections to do tasks like logging tickets or fetching your availability when you’re scheduling a meeting.\nImage Credits: Superhuman\nSuperhuman said it plans to add functionality to enable the assistant to fetch data from sources like CRMs and internal systems to suggest changes to your emails. \nUsers can try Superhuman Go by turning on a toggle in the Grammarly extension, which will let them connect it to different apps. Users can also try out different agents in the company’s agent store, which include a plagiarism checker and a proofreader, launched in August.\nAll Grammarly users can try out Superhuman Go right now, though the company is also selling product bundles. Its Pro subscription plan will cost $12 per month (billed annually) and will enable grammar and tone support in multiple languages. The Business plan will cost $33 per month (billed annually) and will give users access to Superhuman Mail.\nImage Credits: Superhuman\nSuperhuman said it also wants to add more AI-powered features to the Coda document suite and Superhuman email clients, such as fetching details from external and internal sources to create additional details in documents and email drafts automatically.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGrammarly has for the past few years made a concerted effort to increase its viability as a productivity suite, exemplified through its acquisitions of Coda and Superhuman. With this AI assistant, the company is positioning itself to compete better with the likes of Notion, ClickUp and Google Workspace, which have launched multiple AI-powered features in the past few years. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nU.S. President Donald Trump touched down in Asia this week, not just for diplomacy, but to sign deals that could shape the next chapter of the global technology race. The U.S. inked Technology Prosperity Deals (TPD) with Japan and South Korea with an eye towards spurring collaboration on AI, semiconductors, quantum computing, biotech, space, 6G and other technologies.\nThe agreements aim to enhance cooperation, strengthen strategic ties, align regulations, and support economic and national security objectives, among other objectives. The new agreements follow roughly a month after the U.S. strengthened tech ties with the U.K.\nThe U.S. is effectively locking in partnerships to tap Japan and Korea’s expertise — Japan leads in advanced materials, robotics and space technologies, while South Korea dominates memory chip production.\nThe U.S.-Japan agreement aims to boost AI exports, enhance technology protections, and refocus collaboration on AI standards and innovation, per the White House. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Korea will collaborate to ease “operational burdens” for tech companies, focusing on removing obstacles to “innovative data localization and hosting architectures.”\nJapan and the U.S. plan to “advance pro-innovation AI policy frameworks and initiatives to support a U.S.- and Japan-led AI ecosystem and promote exports across the full stack of U.S. and Japanese AI infrastructure, hardware, models, software, applications, and related standards,” according to a White House press release on October 28.\n“The U.S.-Korea TPD will advance American interests with coordinated U.S.-Republic of Korea AI exports, strengthening both countries’ export controls and enforcement, and refocusing the partnership between the U.S. Center for AI Standards and Innovation, and the Korea AI Safety Institute on metrology and standards innovation,” the White House said on Wednesday.\nThe deals also address a broader goal: reducing dependence on China’s tech supply chain, and shaping the rules for technologies like AI and quantum computing. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the tech industry, these deals are a signal to watch these allied markets closely, as collaboration could create new opportunities for both startups and major tech companies. With the U.S., Japan, and South Korea aligning their tech strategies, future breakthroughs in AI, semiconductors, quantum computing, space, and 6G may come not just from individual labs, but from strategic partnerships aimed at staying ahead in the global tech race.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nSelf-driving truck startup Waabi shared Tuesday at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 the launch of a new autonomous truck made in partnership with Volvo, the Volvo VNL Autonomous truck.\nThe unveiling comes eight months since the Uber- and Nvidia-backed startup announced it was partnering with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to build a custom truck based on Volvo’s autonomy platform using Waabi’s software stack.\nWaabi CEO Raquel Urtasun said on TechCrunch Disrupt’s AI stage the company has the potential to be the first to commercialize self-driving trucks without a human safety driver or observer. The comment was a slight dig at Aurora, a competitor that launched a commercial driverless service earlier this year. The company later added a human observer in the truck cab several weeks later. \n“We can drive in generalized surface streets across right now in Texas, and you will be able to see us across the entire U.S. over the next few years as well,” said Urtasun, who previously served as chief scientist at Uber ATG before launching Waabi in 2021.\nWaabi rival Aurora has a similar deal with Volvo, and the two companies unveiled a self-driving truck in May 2024. Aurora launched a commercial service, which has a human observer on board, earlier this year on a route between Dallas and Houston. On Tuesday, it announced it was expanding to El Paso. Waabi is using the same truck, but it features Waabi’s tech, including its sensor suite, compute, and the Waabi Driver software. \nWaabi’s self-driving system called the Waabi Driver is an end-to-end AI model that enables the truck to scale autonomous driving across different geographies, including highways and general surface streets. Waabi says this enables commercial operations that are scalable, meet the needs of customers, and work within existing logistics operations.  \n“Volvo VNL has been built from the ground up for the redundancies so that you can remove the human driver and you can build a global, safe, robust product,” Urtasun said. “Our sensor pods are super lightweight; it’s very easy to integrate at the factory line.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWaabi’s partnership with Volvo builds on the automaker’s investment into the startup in 2023 via its venture arm, Volvo Group Venture Capital. Volvo participated in Waabi’s $200 million Series B in 2024.   \nClarification: Aurora did not initially launch its commercial service with a human observer in the cab. \n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

In August, LG’s telecom division initially denied any signs of a breach, even as KT reported that data from users had been exposed following the connection of unauthorized micro base stations to its network. KISA declined to comment.\nThe move comes about two months after the hacking magazine Phrack claimed that hackers from China or North Korea had stolen data from close to 9,000 LG Uplus servers.\nLG Uplus’s report comes amid a wave of high-profile hacks in South Korea affecting telecoms, credit card companies, tech startups, and government agencies, highlighting vulnerabilities previously reported by TechCrunch. \nSouth Korea’s fragmented cybersecurity system and a shortage of experts have hindered the country’s response to the cyber threats.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

Additionally, the number of channels earning six figures or more in revenue from TV screens has increased by over 45% in the past year.\nWhile shoppable QR codes are not a new concept—Roku, Peacock, and others have implemented them—YouTube says its functionality aims to help content creators sell their merchandise more effectively by linking directly to their online stores.\nThe platform is also starting to test the ability to showcase products at specific, timed moments within videos.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:YouTube\nOther updates focus on improving the overall TV-watching experience. For instance, YouTube is expanding the thumbnail file limit from 2MB to 50MB to support 4K-resolution thumbnails, and it’s also experimenting with larger video uploads with select creators to enable higher-quality videos. \nAn AI-powered feature is being introduced to automatically convert videos uploaded at lower resolutions to full HD, and the company plans to add support for upscaling to 4K resolution in the future. YouTube notes that creators will maintain control over their content and preserve original files, and viewers can still choose to watch in the original resolution.\nThis aims to bring YouTube’s TV viewing experience in line with competitors, but the effectiveness of the technology remains to be seen. Netflix was accused of using AI to upscale older shows, like “A Different World,” but ran into problems that led to distorted faces and generally unsatisfactory results.\nImage Credits:YouTube\nOther new features include immersive previews to help viewers flip through videos, and better content discovery with contextual search — when viewers initiate a search directly from a creator’s channel page, the platform prioritizes videos from that channel at the top of search results instead of showing results from across YouTube. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nEven after reviewing résumés, cover letters, and interviews, choosing the right candidate for a job can be a mysterious process. Hiring managers often rely on their biases about the world or gut feelings to inform their decision, making the process far from an exact science.\nThat’s why Sarah Lucena built Mappa, an AI-powered behavioral intelligence platform that aims to take some of the guesswork out of hiring. Mappa trained an AI model to detect voice patterns that correlate with certain traits, such as communication style, empathy, and confidence. Applicants simply answer some questions from Mappa’s AI agent, and then the platform sends hiring managers a shortlist of candidates with traits that are compatible with the role.\nMappa is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco.\n“Mappa comes to the market with the goal of really, truly understanding people,” Lucena said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We don’t really categorize traits as good or bad. We understand traits as compatible or not.”\nLucena founded Mappa in 2023 with her two co-founders, Pablo Bérgolo and Daniel Moretti, and has raised $3.4 million in a seed round led by Tim Draper’s investment firm, Draper Associates. In less than three years, the startup has scaled to more than 130 customers in the U.S. and more than $4 million in annualized recurring revenue.\nMappa claims one of its biggest advantages is data. The startup built highly curated datasets specifically for understanding human behavior. Mappa originally attempted to assess candidates based on video submissions and their online presence; however, they’ve found voice analysis to be the most effective method.\nMappa’s platform has already helped companies find employees who stick around longer, according to Lucena. While the standard annual turnover rate for companies is around 30%, she says employees hired through Mappa have a turnover rate of just 2%.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLucena says Mappa’s focus is always helping companies find the best people, but that often results in a more equitable hiring process. Mappa has facilitated over 3,000 hires to date, and more than 60% of them were women, LGBTQ+, or immigrants. Lucena, who was born and raised in Brazil, says she’s proud to have created more opportunities for these people.\nMoving forward, Lucena says she sees Mappa evolving from a services company into an infrastructure provider. The startup’s API has seen traction among companies who want to use its behavioral analysis in situations beyond hiring. Tim Draper personally uses Mappa to assess founders his firm is considering investing in, and the educational platform Re-Skilling.ai uses the platform to understand skills that students can improve on.\nIn the future, Lucena sees that Mappa could be used to help approve candidates for loans who don’t have an extensive credit history. She sees Mappa as a tool to help assess people more fairly in all kinds of settings.\nIf you want to hear from Mappa firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n\t\tMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "\nTutoring is one of the most effective tools for improving a child’s education, yet very few kids in the U.S. receive it. A 2023 survey of the nation’s largest school districts found that fewer than 10% of students received tutoring. One factor is that tutoring is too expensive for many families, often costing hundreds or thousands of dollars a month.\nTim Novikoff, a former Google product manager and educator, wants to change that. His startup, Super Teacher, offers an AI-powered tutoring app for elementary school students that costs $15 a month, or $10 with an annual plan. Super Teacher aims to make private tutoring accessible to families nationwide.\nThe four-year-old startup is gaining traction. Novikoff says roughly 20,000 families have signed up for Super Teacher, and public schools in New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii now use the app. Super Teacher is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco.\nNovikoff was previously a math teacher in New York City, first in Harlem and then at a highly rated public school, Stuyvesant High School. In an interview with TechCrunch, he said almost all the students at Stuyvesant received tutoring, whereas many of the students in Harlem didn’t, and the difference in their educational experience was stark.\n“[Tutoring] is by far the most effective intervention that can be provided to kids for education, and it’s not even close,” Novikoff said. “It’s really unfair that not everyone gets this opportunity. That’s why I’m pursuing a mission to democratize access to private tutoring.”\nSuper Teacher’s app features animated tutors with AI-generated voices that guide students through interactive lessons. Students talk to the app using voice, like a conversation with a teacher. But unlike many edtech tools, Super Teacher doesn’t use large language models to generate responses. Instead, its content comes from a deterministic system designed to always give correct answers — avoiding the inaccuracies that can plague LLMs.\nNovikoff thinks AI tutors can have a valuable impact on children’s lives, but he’s adamant that AI will never replace teachers in a school setting. He refers to AI tutors as a tool that teachers can use, such as smart boards or calculators, rather than a replacement altogether.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSuper Teacher is only available for elementary school students, a decision Novikoff made to help his own children and because few edtech companies target that age group. Looking ahead, he hopes to expand to younger and older grades and partner with more school districts across the U.S.\nNovikoff previously founded Fly Labs, a mobile video-editing app acquired by Google in 2015.\nIf you want to learn more about Super Teacher from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nUber has picked San Francisco to launch a premium robotaxi service that will use Lucid Motors’ all-electric Gravity SUVs equipped with self-driving tech developed by Nuro, in 2026 — a move that puts the ride-hailing giant in direct competition with Waymo.\nThe announcement was made as the last day of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 kicked off in San Francisco. Nuro president and co-CEO Dave Ferguson, and Uber chief product officer Sachin Kansal are scheduled to be interviewed on the Disrupt stage Wednesday afternoon.\n“The Bay Area has long been the birthplace of transformative technology, and it’s only fitting that Uber’s next-generation robotaxi program with Lucid and Nuro will begin here — launching to the public next year,” Kansal said in a statement. “By combining deep expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy, and ridehailing, we’re laying the groundwork for safe and scalable autonomous rides in the Bay Area and beyond.”\nEarlier this year, Uber said it would invest $300 million in Lucid and separately buy “at least” 20,000 of its new Gravity SUVs over the next six years as part of a plan to develop and launch a premium robotaxi service. Those EVs would be equipped with Nuro’s autonomous vehicle system, and owned and operated by Uber or its third-party fleet partners. At the time, the three companies had not identified their launch market.\nThe decision to launch in San Francisco could add tension to Uber’s relationship with Waymo. The companies had squared off in 2018 in a trade secrets theft case, but have since patched up — earlier this year, they launched a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta. In 2023, the companies partnered to make Waymos available on the Uber app in Phoenix. \nNow, Uber is entering a domain dominated by the Alphabet-owned self-driving division. Waymo, based in Mountain View, California, operates commercial robotaxi services in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. The company has said it plans to launch in six more cities in 2026.\nUber, Nuro and Lucid are already developing a fleet of test vehicles. Lucid recently delivered vehicles to Nuro, which is integrating its self-driving system into the fleet for testing and validation. The test fleet is expected to reach about 100 vehicles, according to the companies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesting on public roads will be the most visible sign of the partnership, but Nuro also plans to use simulation and closed courses for testing.\nOver the past two years, Uber has locked in a bevy of partnerships with autonomous vehicle technology companies, covering the spectrum of how self-driving systems can be applied to the physical world — although its deals with Waymo, Nuro and Lucid might be the meatiest. The ride-hailing giant has partnered with more than 18 companies globally, across ride-hailing, delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen, as well as Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, WeRide and Baidu.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nTeenagers are trying to figure out where they fit in a world changing faster than any generation before them. They’re bursting with emotions, hyper-stimulated, and chronically online. And now, AI companies have given them chatbots designed to never stop talking. The results have been catastrophic.\nOne company that understands this fallout is Character.AI, an AI role-playing startup that’s facing lawsuits and public outcry after at least two teenagers died by suicide following prolonged conversations with AI chatbots on its platform. Now, Character.AI is making changes to its platform to protect teenagers and kids, changes that could affect the startup’s bottom line. \n“The first thing that we’ve decided as Character.AI is that we will remove the ability for under 18 users to engage in any open-ended chats with AI on our platform,” Karandeep Anand, CEO of Character.AI, told TechCrunch.  \nOpen-ended conversation refers to the unconstrained back-and-forth that happens when users give a chatbot a prompt and it responds with follow-up questions that experts say are designed to keep users engaged. Anand argues this type of interaction — where the AI acts as a conversational partner or friend rather than a creative tool — isn’t just risky for kids, but misaligns with the company’s vision.\nThe startup is attempting to pivot from “AI companion” to “role-playing platform.” Instead of chatting with an AI friend, teens will use prompts to collaboratively build stories or generate visuals. In other words, the goal is to shift engagement from conversation to creation. \nCharacter.AI will phase out teen chatbot access by November 25, starting with a two-hour daily limit that shrinks progressively until it hits zero. To ensure this ban remains with under 18 users, the platform will deploy an in-house age verification tool that analyzes user behavior, as well as third-party tools like Persona. If those tools fail, Character.AI will use facial recognition and ID checks to verify ages, Anand said. \nThe move follows other teenager protections that Character.AI has implemented, including introducing a parental insights tool, filtered characters, limited romantic conversations, and time spent notifications. Anand has told TechCrunch that those changes lost the company much of their under-18 user base, and he expects these new changes to be equally unpopular.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It’s safe to assume that a lot of our teen users probably will be disappointed… so we do expect some churn to happen further,” Anand said. “It’s hard to speculate — will all of them fully churn or will some of them move to these new experiences we’ve been building for the last almost seven months now?” \nAs part of Character.AI’s push to transform the platform from a chat-centric app into a “full-fledged content-driven social platform,” the startup recently launched several new entertainment-focused features. \nIn June, Character.AI rolled out AvatarFX, a video generation model that transforms images into animated videos; Scenes, an interactive, pre-populated storylines where users can step into narratives with their favorite characters; and Streams, a feature that allows dynamic interactions between any two characters. In August, Character.AI launched Community Feed, a social feed where users can share their characters, scenes, videos, and other content they make on the platform.  \nIn a statement addressed to users under 18, Character.AI apologized for the changes. \n“We know that most of you use Character.AI to supercharge your creativity in ways that stay within the bounds of our content rules,” the statement reads. “We do not take this step of removing open-ended Character chat lightly — but we do think that it’s the right thing to do given the questions that have been raised about how teens do, and should, interact with this new technology.” \n“We’re not shutting down the app for under 18s,” Anand said. “We are only shutting down open-ended chats for under 18s because we hope that under 18 users migrate to these other experiences, and that those experiences get better over time. So doubling down on AI gaming, AI short videos, AI storytelling in general. That’s the big bet we’re making to bring back under 18s if they do churn.” \nAnand acknowledged that some teens might flock to other AI platforms, like OpenAI, that allow them to have open-ended conversations with chatbots. OpenAI has also come under fire recently after a teenager took his own life following long conversations with ChatGPT.  \n“I really hope us leading the way sets a standard in the industry that for under 18s, open-ended chats are probably not the path or the product to offer,” Anand said. “For us, I think the tradeoffs are the right ones to make. I have a six-year-old, and I want to make sure she grows up in a very safe environment with AI in a responsible way.” \nCharacter.AI is making these decisions before regulators force its hand. On Tuesday, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said they would introduce legislation to ban AI chatbot companions from being available to minors, following complaints from parents who said the products pushed their children into sexual conversations, self-harm, and suicide. Earlier this month, California became the first state to regulate AI companion chatbots by holding companies accountable if their chatbots fail to meet the law’s safety standards.  \nIn addition to those changes on the platform, Character.AI said it would establish and fund the AI Safety Lab, an independent non-profit dedicated to innovating safety alignment for the future AI entertainment features.  \n“A lot of work is happening in the industry on coding and development and other use cases,” Anand said. “We don’t think there’s enough work yet happening on the agentic AI powering entertainment, and safety will be very critical to that.” \n",

    "body": "\nOn Monday, researchers at cybersecurity giant Kaspersky published a report identifying a new spyware called Dante that they say targeted Windows victims in Russia and neighboring Belarus. The researchers said the Dante spyware is made by Memento Labs, a Milan-based surveillance tech maker that was formed in 2019 after a new owner acquired and took over early spyware maker Hacking Team.\nMemento chief executive Paolo Lezzi confirmed to TechCrunch that the spyware caught by Kaspersky does indeed belong to Memento.\nIn a call, Lezzi blamed one of the company’s government customers for exposing Dante, saying the customer used an outdated version of the Windows spyware that will no longer be supported by Memento by the end of this year. \n“Clearly they used an agent that was already dead,” Lezzi told TechCrunch, referring to an “agent” as the technical word for the spyware planted on the target’s computer.\n“I thought [the government customer] didn’t even use it anymore,” said Lezzi. \nLezzi, who said he was not sure which of the company’s customers were caught, added that Memento had already requested that all of its customers stop using the Windows malware. Lezzi said the company had warned customers that Kaspersky had detected Dante spyware infections since December 2024. He added that Memento plans to send a message to all its customers on Wednesday asking them once again to stop using its Windows spyware.\nHe also said that Memento currently only develops spyware for mobile platforms. The company also develops some zero-days — meaning security flaws in software unknown to the vendor that can be used to deliver spyware — though, the company mostly sources its exploits from outside developers, according to Lezzi. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Memento Labs? Or other spyware makers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. \t\t\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, Kaspersky spokesperson Mai Al Akka would not say which government Kaspersky believes is behind the espionage campaign, but that it was “someone who has been able to use Dante software.”\n“The group stands out for its strong command of Russian and knowledge of local nuances, traits that Kaspersky observed in other campaigns linked to this [government-backed] threat. However, occasional errors suggest that the attackers were not native speakers,” Al Akka told TechCrunch.\nIn its new report, Kaspersky said it found a hacking group using the Dante spyware that it refers to as “ForumTroll,” describing the targeting of people with invites to Russian politics and economics forum Primakov Readings. Kaspersky said the hackers targeted a broad range of industries in Russia, including media outlets, universities, and government organizations. \nKaspersky’s discovery of Dante came after the Russian cybersecurity firm said it detected a “wave” of cyberattacks with phishing links that were exploiting a zero-day in the Chrome browser. Lezzi said that the Chrome zero-day was not developed by Memento. \nIn its report, Kaspersky researchers concluded that Memento “kept improving” the spyware originally developed by Hacking Team until 2022, when the spyware was “replaced by Dante.” \nLezzi conceded that it is possible that some “aspects” or “behaviors” of Memento’s Windows spyware were left over from spyware developed by Hacking Team.\nA telltale sign that the spyware caught by Kaspersky belonged to Memento was that the developers allegedly left the word “DANTEMARKER” in the spyware’s code, a clear reference to the name Dante, which Memento had previously and publicly disclosed at a surveillance tech conference, per Kaspersky. \nMuch like Memento’s Dante spyware, some versions of Hacking Team’s spyware, codenamed Remote Control System, were named after historical Italian figures, such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Galileo Galilei.\nA history of hacks\nIn 2019, Lezzi purchased Hacking Team and rebranded it to Memento Labs. According to Lezzi, he paid only one euro for the company and the plan was to start over. \n“We want to change absolutely everything,” the Memento owner told Motherboard after the acquisition in 2019. “We’re starting from scratch.”\nA year later, Hacking Team’s CEO and founder David Vincenzetti announced that Hacking Team was “dead.”\nWhen he acquired Hacking Team, Lezzi told TechCrunch that the company only had three government customers remaining, a far cry from the more than 40 government customers that Hacking Team had in 2015. That same year, a hacktivist called Phineas Fisher broke into the startup’s servers and siphoned off some 400 gigabytes of internal emails, contracts, documents, and the source code for its spyware.\nBefore the hack, Hacking Team’s customers in Ethiopia, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates were caught targeting journalists, critics, and dissidents using the company’s spyware. Once Phineas Fisher published the company’s internal data online, journalists revealed that a Mexican regional government used Hacking Team’s spyware to target local politicians, and that Hacking Team had sold to countries with human rights abuses, including Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan, among others.\nLezzi declined to tell TechCrunch how many customers Memento currently has, but implied it was fewer than 100 customers. He also said that there are only two current Memento employees left from Hacking Team’s former staff.\nThe discovery of Memento’s spyware shows that this type of surveillance technology keeps proliferating, according to John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher who has investigated spyware abuses for a decade at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. It also shows\nAlso that a controversial company can die because of a spectacular hack and several scandals, and yet a new company with brand new spyware can still come out of its ashes, \n“It tells us that we need to keep up the fear of consequences,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “It says a lot that echoes of the most radioactive, embarrassed and hacked brand are still around.”\n",

    "body": "\nIndia’s free digital payments revolution has upended how money moves — but not how fintechs make it. Now, Flipkart’s fintech arm Super.money is partnering with Kotak811, the digital offering of one of India’s top commercial banks, Kotak Mahindra Bank, to change that, bundling UPI payments, savings, and secured credit into a single account aimed at turning usage into profit.\nThe partnership aims to issue about 2 million secured credit cards in the next 12 months — roughly 60 percent to first-time borrowers — and 5 million within 2 years. Super.money, which already serves 10 million active users, expects the Kotak alliance to contribute around 10 percent of its revenue next year as it works toward profitability by 2026, chief executive Prakash Sikaria said in an interview.\nIndia’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI), backed by the Indian government, has made instant bank transfers free and ubiquitous, processing more than 19 billion transactions a month. That success, though, has left little room for fintechs to profit, since regulators, including the Indian finance ministry, do not allow the merchant fees that typically fund rewards and credit programs. Super.money’s bet — using a secured card and savings account to reintroduce incentives — offers a template for building viable business models atop no-fee payment systems.\n“We do UPI not to solve the pure payment use case,” Sikaria told TechCrunch. “We do UPI to build an interesting cross-financial services play where we are acquiring and retaining customers with the UPI.”\nLaunched in June 2024 as Walmart-owned Flipkart’s latest fintech venture after spinning off PhonePe in late 2022, Super.money is already generating about $3 million in monthly revenue, with an annualized run rate of roughly $36 million, the executive said.\nThe fintech app has emerged as one of India’s top five UPI platforms in recent months, processing more than 200 million transactions a month for four straight months through August, per the National Payments Corporation of India, the federal body that manages the system.\nAround 80% of Super.money’s revenue comes from personal loans, 10% from credit cards, and the remaining 10% from payment products such as bill payments and recharges. The fintech says it retains roughly 85% of users, with 60–70% of its transactions coming from customers under 30.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSikaria noted that Super.money’s business model rests on two monetization engines. “The first is the financial-services engine — personal loans, cards, deposits, and similar products — and the second is commerce,” he said. “Our idea is to bring a Klarna-style’ pay-in-three’ model on top of commerce, creating a financial overlay that lets customers buy now and pay later within the Super.money ecosystem.”\nThe partnership with Kotak Mahindra Bank, India’s fourth-largest lender by market capitalization, gives Super.money access to a large, regulated banking infrastructure. It follows an earlier tie-up with Utkarsh Small Finance Bank to specifically offer secured cards through its platform, marking the fintech’s move into mainstream retail banking.\nThe collaboration introduces what the companies call a “3 in 1 Super Account,” combining a savings account, UPI payments, and a fixed-deposit-backed secured credit card aimed at expanding credit access for first-time borrowers.\nImage Credits:Super.money\nTo open a 3-in-1 Super Account, users need to make a fixed deposit of at least ₹1,000 (about $11). The account earns interest on the deposit and offers a cashback on every transaction. It also includes a UPI-on-credit feature — a credit line backed by the deposit that does not require any income proof.\nSikaria told TechCrunch that secured cards were chosen as the anchor product because they fit within India’s zero-fee UPI system while still allowing the rewards and cashbacks that the platform was never designed to support.\n“Our focus is to bring in users who have a higher propensity to engage with our products,” he said. “UPI happens to be the core engagement and acquisition hook, but for people who don’t want to engage in financial services or other products that we launched, we do not want to serve them from a UPI or payment perspective.”\nThe partnership with Kotak Mahindra Bank comes soon after Super.money teamed up with SoftBank-backed Juspay to launch a one-click checkout experience for online merchants, aimed primarily at direct-to-consumer brands.\nAbout 1,000 merchants already use the solution, and Super.money plans to expand that network through partnerships with more D2C players and other companies within the Flipkart group, Sikaria said.\nThe secured card earns merchant discount revenue on transactions, and that funds the cashback, Sikaria said. “Obviously, there is a standard acquisition fee to the partner bank that we charge to the bank, so that comes as a monetization for us as well,” he added.\nSuper.money plans to issue about 200,000 secured cards a month under its partnership with Kotak before expanding to other banks, Sikaria said.\nSo far, Flipkart has invested about $50 million in Super.money to kick off its operations. As the business scales, the fintech plans to raise additional capital — possibly from external investors as well.\n“We need more capital for at least a couple of years,” Sikaria said. “Very soon, we’ll start formulating our capital-raise strategy.”\nHe declined to say whether the next round would come from Flipkart or outside investors but noted that Super.money is receiving inbound interest from “a lot of investors.”\nIn the meantime, Sikaria said the company is keeping its cash burn low, describing its current monthly burn as a “low single-digit million number” without providing specifics.\nHe added that Super.money is deliberately focusing on India’s top 10 to 30 million users, rather than competing with mass-market payment players such as Google Pay or PhonePe that target hundreds of millions.\n“What we want to do is build a formidable secured card franchise with a profitable P&L — for us, the bank, and our customers as well,” Sikaria said.\n",

    "body": "\nAfter two days full of live demos and pitches, it’s time to announce the five finalists at this year’s Startup Battlefield.\nThese finalists were selected from an initial pool of thousands of applicants, with TechCrunch’s editorial team narrowing the field down to the 200 companies that all joined us here at Disrupt, with the Top 20 competing on the Disrupt Stage.\nWith feedback from our expert judges, we’ve now selected our finalists, who will take the stage one more time at 11:30 a.m. PT on Wednesday to compete for our grand prize of $100,000 in equity-free funding, as well as temporary custody of the Startup Battlefield Cup. You can watch the finals on the livestream on the TechCrunch website — or, if you’re attending the conference, on the Disrupt Stage.\nWithout further ado, here are the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield finalists for 2025:\nCharter Space\nCharter Space has built a dev tool for aerospace engineers, but its real mission is to serve as a fintech company for space. The software captures manufacturing and test data directly from the source, and this dataset then feeds an underwriting interface that ties directly in with the largest insurance carriers in the market. The goal is faster, cheaper, and more reliable risk evaluation for spacecraft insurance, and eventually to power new forms of credit and nondilutive funding for space companies looking outside venture capital and the public markets.\nGlīd\nGlīd (pronounced “Glide”) aims to streamline the complex, multistep process involved in moving a container from a ship to a freight train. The company has developed several hardware and software products to speed up and reduce the cost of getting shipping containers to the railhead and eventually their destination. Its first product is GliderM, a hybrid-electric vehicle with a hook on the back that can pick up and move 20-foot containers directly to the rail without the need for forklifts of hostler trucks.\nMacroCycle\nMacroCycle has developed a shortcut, of sorts, that promises to make recycled plastic as inexpensive as virgin material. The startup has devised a way to pluck desirable synthetic fibers from waste textiles, leaving everything else behind. Unlike most chemical recycling, MacroCycle’s process differs because it doesn’t break down polymers. Instead, it loops the polymer chains back on themselves, forcing them into rings called macrocycles, which remain behind after contaminants are washed away. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNephrogen\nNephrogen is a biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney. Founder Demetri Maxim says that after three years of development, Nephrogen has succeeded in creating a delivery mechanism that is 100 times more efficient at transporting medicine to the kidney than the “vehicles” currently approved by the FDA. And he plans to participate in the clinical study himself, given the challenges he faces living with polycystic kidney disease.\nUnlisted Homes\nUnlisted Homes is like Zillow but for houses that are not yet on the market. Using public records of 21 million homes, Unlisted created “profiles” for each property, providing the same kind of information that you would find on any other real estate listings site. The company doesn’t plan to facilitate real estate transactions through the platform, since the resources for those transactions already exist. Instead, Unlisted will sell sponsorships on individual ZIP codes to real estate agents, who will be listed as local experts on every home in that ZIP code.\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor. Previously, he worked as a tech reporter at Adweek, a senior editor at VentureBeat, a local government reporter at the Hollister Free Lance, and vice president of content at a VC firm. He lives in New York City.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anthony by emailing anthony.ha@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\tIsabelle leads Startup Battlefield, TechCrunch’s iconic launchpad and competition for the world’s most promising early-stage startups.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Isabelle by emailing isabelle.johannessen@techcrunch.com.\r\n\r\nShe scouts top founders across 99+ countries and prepares them to pitch on the Disrupt stage in front of tier-one investors and global media. Before TechCrunch, she designed and led international startup acceleration programs across Japan, Korea, Italy, and Spain—connecting global founders with VCs and helping them successfully enter the U.S. market.

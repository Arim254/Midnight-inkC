Speaking on stage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Monday, Yuan discussed his videoconferencing product’s embrace of AI, which includes a “digital twin” feature where an AI avatar can speak for you. \nYuan began using his AI avatar in an earnings call with investors this year, demonstrating the technology’s potential and ability to push the “boundaries of communication,” he said.\nAt Disrupt, the exec emphasized spending a lot of time talking about AI and the right products to bring to market. \nWhen asked about what he’s investing in, he responded, “AI, AI, and AI.” The technology is the subject of multi-hour strategy meetings, as Zoom believes in its potential to transform work.\nYuan also suggested there were many more use cases for AI companions, beyond just video conferencing stand-ins. He offered a potential future scenario where two business execs were negotiating a contract over Zoom. \nInstead of being on a call for a long time, they could send their digital twins to work together on the plan first, Yuan said. \nHe also spoke of how AI could assist with email, checking your messages for you, and help you figure out what was important and in need of a response. \nPlus, Yuan believes that AI could enhance Zoom’s broader suite of solutions, which includes things like an online whiteboard and collaborative docs.\n“Today, I need a manually focus on all those products to get work done. Eventually, AI will help,” Yuan said. \n“By doing that, we do not need to work five days a week anymore, right?… Five years out, three days or four days [a week]. That’s a goal,” he said. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

On the sidelines of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said vandalism against Waymo’s robotaxis is “not okay.”\n“Obviously, vandalism is a crime, so we’re very focused on working with law enforcement to make sure that we pursue the people who are committing these crimes against our fleet,” Mawakana told TechCrunch. “It doesn’t matter whose fleet it is. It’s not acceptable, it’s not okay, and so, damaging property? We’re not standing for it.”\nConcerns about privacy and surveillance have become a major issue in protests during the second Trump administration, especially as the government ramps up its deportation efforts. At the same time, a broader public resistance to tech companies — especially those enabling surveillance — has resulted in multiple Waymo vehicles being damaged and burned by vandals.\nDuring an interview on the main stage Monday, Mawakana reiterated her previous comments that Waymo refuses government requests for the footage Waymo vehicles capture if those requests are “overly broad and unlawful.”\nWhen asked backstage what Waymo is doing to change the perception of its vehicles, Mawakana pointed to the company’s push to put local artists’ designs on some cars as part of a broader effort to “make the fleet more a part of the community.” But while Waymo often pushes back on surveillance requests, she said the company has to “continue to work with first responders to help us address this challenge” of vandalism.\n“They don’t want it in their cities. It doesn’t keep people safe. We don’t want it,” she said.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAstro Teller, CEO of X, Alphabet’s “moonshot factory,” where the company incubates the nearly impossible, shared a look into what makes a moonshot and detailed the company’s “fail fast” mantra at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Monday.\nNotable companies that started out as moonshots from X’s moonshot factory include Waymo and Wing.\nTeller noted that X has a “2% hit rate,” which means that most of the things the company tries don’t work out, and that’s okay.\nHe said X defines a moonshot as having three specific components. The first is that it needs to attempt to solve a huge problem in the world. Second, there needs to be some kind of product or service that, however unlikely, would make the problem go away. Last, there has to be a sort of breakthrough technology that would provide a glimmer of hope at solving that huge, real-world problem.\n“If you worked at X, and you would just come up with a teleporter, you’ve got a moonshot story hypothesis, I would say, awesome, here’s a tiny amount of money, go see if you can prove that it’s wrong, because it probably is,” he said. “I don’t want you to make it work. I want you to get information about whether this is really a once-in-a-generation opportunity or not, and it’s okay if the answer is no.”\nTeller went on to note that if someone is proposing a moonshot, and it sounds reasonable, the company isn’t interested, because that, by definition, wouldn’t be a moonshot. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea; that’s just not what X is looking for.\n“If you propose something and it sounds pretty wild, that has those three components that I just described, and it’s a testable hypothesis, for a small amount of money, we can learn something about whether it’s a little bit more crazy than we thought, or a little bit less crazy than we thought,” Teller said. “If it’s a little bit more crazy than we thought, cool, high five, let’s put a bullet in its head and move on. And if it’s a little bit less crazy than we thought, awesome, here’s a tiny bit more money. Go try to find the next opportunity to kill it and repeat.”\nTeller emphasized that in order to do moonshots, you need to have equal amounts of audacity and humility.\n“If you don’t have really high audacity, you won’t start on these really unlikely journeys,” he said. “But, if you have anything less than really high humility, you’ll go luminously far down that unlikely journey.”\nX starts more than 100 things every year, and while 2% of them make it to exit five or six years later, 44% of all of the money that the company spends is on things that graduate and are “outrageously good,” Teller said. He says this is because X “kills all the bad ideas pretty early in the process.”\nTeller stated that people can learn innovation, noting that every single person was creative when they were children, but that we end up unlearning things that are useful, maybe even necessary for radical innovation. However, he says it’s possible to find these things again by creating an environment where you don’t feel stupid to go find them. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWaymo’s co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, had a clear message during her interview on the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 stage Monday: “It is imperative that we scale.”\nMawakana was speaking in the context of how Waymo balances fundraising (and burning through that money) with eventually achieving profitability. But she was also clear in the interview that she believes Waymo can increase road safety by reaching that scale. \nAll this helps explain why the company has been on an expansion tear this year and expects to launch in many more U.S. cities — D.C., Miami, Denver, Dallas, Seattle, and Nashville — as well as in London in 2026. It’s a furious pace that has seen the autonomous vehicle company leverage multiple partnerships with companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Avis.\n“By the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week,” she said.\nMawakana spent a lot of time during the interview with TechCrunch transportation editor Kirsten Korosec talking about the challenges of safely reaching that kind of scale.\nThe Waymo co-CEO maintained that the company is operating at a level that is safer than the typical human driver. And while she didn’t name names, she took a shot at competitors, saying they aren’t doing enough to prove that their autonomous vehicle technology is truly safe.\n“It is incumbent upon [them] to be transparent about what’s happening,” she said. “And if you are not being transparent, then it is my view that you are not doing what is necessary in order to actually earn the right to make the road safer.”\nHer comments come as the company continues to iron out edge cases during its expansion — with one of the most recent incidents coming in Atlanta, Georgia, where a Waymo vehicle pulled out in front of a stopped school bus, leading to an investigation from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nWaymo itself recently released a report claiming its vehicles are already five times safer than most human drivers, and 12 times safer with respect to pedestrians.\nStill, Waymo vehicles have been caught making a number of head-scratching decisions. \n“It’s important to recognize, it’s not going to be perfection, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be accountable for transparency,” Mawakana said onstage. “I think … we really worry as a company about those days. You know, we don’t say whether, we say when, and we plan for them.”\nMawakana also said Waymo doesn’t think in terms of “how many [incidents] are allowable.”\n“We know they’re going to happen because our cars are on the road with humans, and unfortunately, right now, the state of the roads and the state of human driving is there is a lot of deaths, and there are a lot of injuries being caused on the roadways,” she said. \nAnd when asked whether the public would accept a death caused by a robotaxi in the face of the promise of greater safety, Mawakana said: “I think that society will.” \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nWaymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana believes other companies working on autonomous vehicles need to do more to prove their technology is safe, she said during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nMawakana had just been asked who she considered to be on the list of companies trying to make roads safer during Monday’s interview.\n“I don’t know who’s on that list, because they’re not telling us what’s happening with their fleets,” she said. \nPrioritizing safety while scaling operations was a big topic during the interview, and Mawakana was sure to cite the data Waymo recently released that shows, by its count, that the company’s vehicles are five times safer than human drivers and 12 times safer with respect to pedestrians.\nMawakana declined to say whether she was specifically talking about Tesla, but there are only a few companies in the U.S. right now claiming to be working on robotaxi tech. \nTesla publishes quarterly “vehicle safety reports.” But that data only focuses on the use of the company’s Autopilot driver assistance technology, which is designed to be used on highways, where the rate of crashes is lower than on surface streets. (And the latest report shows an uptick in crashes.) Tesla has not released any public data about the safety of its nascent robotaxi pilot program in Austin, Texas.\nOther companies in the space are early in the deployment phase or still testing their technology. Zoox has only just begun offering rides in its purpose-built AV in Las Vegas, Nevada. Companies like May Mobility and Pony AI are similarly starting up commercial operations. Aurora, the self-driving trucks company, has published a safety framework.\n“I think there is a responsibility, if you’re going to put vehicles on the road, and you’re going to remove the driver from behind the wheel, and you’re going to have someone in some other room observing the fleet who can take over their vehicles, it is incumbent upon you to be transparent about what’s happening,” she said. “And if you are not being transparent, then it is my view that you are not doing what is necessary in order to actually earn the right to make the road safer.” \nCorrection: May Mobility has started offering commercial rides in the U.S. This story has been updated to reflect that.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nDuring an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 on Monday, Sequoia Capital managing partner Roelof Botha defended his colleague, Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire, over the controversial comments Maguire made earlier this year, calling the firm a believer in his partner’s right to “free speech.”\nIn a July 4 post on X, Maguire attacked New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, calling the politician an “Islamist” who “comes from a culture that lies about everything.” His remarks led to a sizable online backlash and debate about the reputational risk to the VC firm that has backed companies like Airbnb, Google, Nvidia, and Stripe.\nShortly after the event, over a thousand founders and tech industry professionals signed an open letter urging Sequoia to take action and make it clear that “silence in the face of hate has consequences.” \nLast week, the Financial Times reported that Sequoia’s chief operating officer Sumaiya Balbale, a practicing Muslim, quit over the firm’s decision not to discipline Maguire following his remarks.\nOnstage, Botha declined to comment on the COO’s departure, saying only that he appreciated everything Balbale had contributed to the firm.\nHowever, when it came to Maguire, Botha argued that Sequoia has always supported a diversity of views. Botha noted that, for example, Sequoia VC Michael Moritz had been outspoken in his opposition to President Trump, while former managing partner Doug Leone was a vocal Trump supporter.\n“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky’ people inside Sequoia,” Botha, referring to Maguire, told TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos onstage.\nThe response was surprisingly candid, given the high-profile nature of the remarks and the potential to dissuade some founders from working with Sequoia.\n“We actually have a tremendous breadth of opinion within our partnership, and we celebrate that some people just choose to express it differently,” Botha continued. \n“We have some of our partners that are very active in philanthropy or some of the private dealings, and they’re just not as vocal as Shaun might be on social media. And we’ve always honored the right to free speech of each of our individual partners,” said Botha.\nHe argued, too, that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to a certain set of founders. Maguire, for instance, has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI. Botha said he’s also attracting founders in one of the other currently hot industries besides AI these days: defense tech. For instance, he’s backed autonomous weapons rising star Mach Industries.\n“He’s a physics PhD who dropped out of high school,” Botha said, noting that Maguire was “very technical.” \nBotha did, however, admit that Maguire’s brand of outspokenness isn’t completely free from consequences. “So, does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011. She joined the company after having previously spent over three years at ReadWriteWeb.

    "body": "\nRobots can be programmed to do a variety of tasks, like packing boxes and even performing surgery. But each individual movement or task requires its own specific training process, which makes it hard for robots to adapt in real-world scenarios.\nMbodi wants to make training robots easier and quicker with the help of AI agents. The company will be showcasing this tech as one of the Top 20 Startup Battlefield finalists at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nNew York-based Mbodi built a cloud-to-edge system, a hybrid computing system using both cloud and local compute, that is designed to integrate into existing robotic tech stacks. The software relies on a multitude of AI agents that communicate with each other to gather the needed information to help a robot learn a task faster.\nOnce deployed, Mbodi will collect data and learn from its real-world use cases.\nXavier Chi, co-founder of Mbodi, told TechCrunch that users prompt the software using natural language, and Mbodi breaks down the request into smaller subtasks. Mbodi’s cluster of agents essentially divides and conquers the task to gather the needed information to train the robot on the prompt quickly.\n“The tricky thing with the physical world, it’s infinite possibility,” Chi said. “Every time you can invent something completely new, you haven’t had any data, that is a problem in the physical world. We always need to have a system where you can orchestrate different models or have anyone correct a robot and tell it to do certain things certain ways.”\nChi said he and co-founder Sebastian Peralta got the idea for the company while working as engineers at Google. While they weren’t working on robotics, they both came to the realization that the advancements in AI were heading to the physical world and despite a rise in physical AI, there still wasn’t a great way to quickly train robots.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMany companies, like Skild AI and FieldAI, are looking to help make training robots faster by building large world AI models with enough real-world data to make it easier for them to adapt to new environments. Chi said that philosophy just doesn’t work with how much the world constantly changes.\nMbodi launched in 2024 with a focus on picking and packaging. The company won an ABB Robotics AI startup competition last year, which landed them a partnership with the Swiss robotics organization that was acquired by SoftBank for $5.4 billion in October.\nNow the company is working with a Fortune 100 company in the consumer and product goods space on a proof of concept.\n“For the CPG customer, they have a lot of people, they pack different products of their brand into a tray or a shelf thing, the problem is it changes every day,” Chi said. “Because of that, it is impossible to put robots there. To reprogram these robots, it’s just not possible, there is still a lot of humans doing that work.”\nMbodi hopes to start deploying its software more in 2026.\n“We want to build something that works, that can actually be deployed,” Chi said. “We aren’t a research lab; we don’t want to be a research lab in that regard. We want to put something in production that works reliably.”\nIf you want to hear from Mbodi firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\nThis piece has been updated to better reflect Chi’s title. \n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

It expands to iOS later this year. \nAs the AI race heats up, Google is counting on the Gemini AI assistant to help Fitbit stand out from the crowd. Called “Coach,” this feature is designed to be your all-in-one fitness trainer, sleep coach, and health and wellness advisor.\nImage Credits:Google\nAt the recent Made by Google event, Google showcased Coach’s various capabilities, like how it can create a custom routine based on your goals, preferences, and available equipment. \nFor example, if you want to run longer distances without becoming winded, Coach will create a tailored fitness plan with suggestions and achievable targets. While you work out, it’ll adjust your exercise plan in real time based on feedback to keep you on track. And if you happen to get injured later in the week, the AI will modify the plan accordingly.\nOther capabilities include analyzing your sleep habits and providing insights into how to improve your sleep quality over time.\nWhile the focus will be on Coach, the Fitbit app also features a makeover with a sleek design that’s easier to navigate, organized around four main tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep, and Health.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle published a demo video on its Made by Google channel on YouTube that explains each tab. The Today tab, for instance, serves as the central hub of the app, highlighting key focus metrics, weekly cardio load data, and any other relevant statistics you may want to glance at quickly. You can manually customize which metrics you want to view at any time.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Fitness tab, meanwhile, houses your workout plans and key metrics, such as your cardio goal and average weekly step count. However, keep in mind that several features are still unavailable, such as nutrition tracking and cycle logging.\nImage Credits:Google\nAdditionally, the Sleep tab allows you to track your sleep patterns, with a new feature that provides AI Coach insights to help you enhance your sleep quality. At the bottom of the tab, a Sleep summary aggregates all information from your last night’s sleep, such as whether you experienced prolonged periods of wakefulness during the night.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe Health tab is dedicated to key metrics, providing quick access to vital signs such as breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation, and resting heart rate, offering a comprehensive overview of your health.\nTo check out the Coach preview on Android, you’ll need an active Fitbit Premium subscription and a compatible Fitbit smartwatch, tracker, or Pixel Watch.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nWhen Demetri Maxim was seven years old, his mother’s kidneys stopped working. She was put on dialysis, which meant that she had to go to the hospital four times a week to have her blood filtered by a machine since her own kidneys could no longer function independently.\nTwo years later, Maxim’s mother received a kidney transplant. Although the surgery was successful and allowed her to lead a relatively normal life, it wasn’t the end of his family’s struggle with kidney disease. It turned out that Maxim had inherited the disease, Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD), from her.\nAbout one in seven Americans has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and about 10% of those CKD cases are due to a genetic condition. Maxim has been obsessed with finding a cure for himself and others ever since he was in high school.\nMaxim’s “Aha!” moment occurred in 2021, when Nature Magazine published a study proving that PKD is reversible in mice using CRISPR technology. At the time, he was pursuing his graduate degree in computational biology at Stanford while simultaneously engaging in kidney research under his professor, Vivek Bhalla.\nAlthough Maxim was convinced that gene therapy could reverse PKD, the biggest hurdle was creating a mechanism to deliver the drugs directly to the diseased cells.\nTo solve this critical challenge, he founded Nephrogen in 2022, a biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney. Nephrogen is one of the 20 finalists in Startup Battlefield, part of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. \nAfter three years of development, Maxim claims Nephrogen has succeeded in creating a delivery mechanism that is 100 times more efficient at transporting medicine to the kidney than the “vehicles” currently approved by the FDA.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe next major step for Nephrogen is to advance its novel delivery mechanism, along with a drug the startup developed, into clinical studies, which Maxim anticipates will begin in 2027. To support this, the company is raising a $4 million seed round.\nMaxim intends to participate in the clinical study himself, given the significant challenges he faces living with PKD.\n“You get a lot of back pain. You have to go to the hospital a lot. You are on this drug that’s supposed to slow the progression, but it doesn’t really do anything. Just makes you pee all the time,” he said, adding that there is always a risk that his disease will progress to require dialysis.\nThis makes Nephrogen’s approach all the more critical, as its success could cure him of PKD entirely.\nIf you want to hear from Nephrogen firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMiraqules co-founder and CEO Sabir Hossain always knew he wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps and run his own business. But he never thought he’d launch a biotech company built around a technology that would have been able to help his father after a near-tragic accident years earlier left him almost bleeding to death.\nBengaluru-based Miraqules developed a nanotechnology in powder form that mimics blood clotting proteins. The blood clotting powder rapidly produces fibrous compounds at room temperature that are a high volume to ratio and can absorb blood quickly when applied.\n“This is a product that will give you feedback instantly,” Hossain told TechCrunch. “If there is a person bleeding, you apply it, and the bleeding stops. This whole thing happens within one or two minutes.”\nMiraqules is a Top 20 Startup Battlefield finalist and will be presenting this technology on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, this week in San Francisco.\nHossain said he developed the technology almost by accident.\nHe went to grad school for biomedical engineering and started working in a research lab focused on biomaterials where his job was essentially to mimic the work of a doctorate student.\n“I was really bad at that, actually,” Hossain said. “Her job was to create 3D structures that will help in bone tissue growth, that could help in bone generation. Every time I was synthesizing that material, it was getting dismantled.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne day he took the dismantled particles and ground it into a powder. He brought this powder to a group working on blood clotting that was struggling to mix their solution properly to see if it could help — and it worked.\n“It clotted the whole blood within maybe five to 10 seconds. I rushed to my professor and then from there we started to think about what made it happen,” Hossain said. “We came up with the completely new process of combining off-the-shelf materials into a nanomaterial that mimics blood clotting proteins.”\nHossain then paired up with his childhood friend, Mubeen Midda, and they started trying to develop the technology so it could be taken out of the lab — with as little funding as possible.\nSince then, the company has been able to secure 11 patents across seven different countries, including India, the United States, and Israel.\nMiraqules’ tech is already being piloted in a trauma care center in India, and the company expects to get its regulatory clearance in India within the next few months. It also is on track to receive clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2026.\n“One thing we did from the beginning, we directly went to the U.S. FDA, there is something called pre-submission. We tried to get their feedback on what other necessary things that we need to do to get this product approved, that helped us a lot.”\nThe company has reached these milestones with less than $700,000 in capital raised, largely from grants.\nMiraqules is looking to ramp up deployment and pilot programs heading into next year. It has already received potential interest from 10 different hospital chains in India and the Israeli Defense Forces.\nIf you want to learn from Miraqules firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nPytho AI is coming out of stealth with an ambitious pitch to the Department of Defense: turn mission planning that takes warfighters days into a process measured in minutes.\nThe startup was founded by Michael Mearn, a former Marine human-intelligence officer whose teams located insurgents, IEDs, weapons, and other intel. The idea for the company came from watching planners spend days building mission plans for a single operation, he told TechCrunch. Pytho AI is a Top 20 Startup Battlefield finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nAs he explains it, war plans aren’t just for large-scale conflicts, what one might think of as “war games.” Instead, everyday service members execute plans for everything from disaster preparation to flight missions.\nMearn saw the status quo firsthand. In Afghanistan, his team built plans the same way much of the military still does today: by assembling maps, diagrams, tables, and text in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, then sending them up the chain for review.\n “It’s too slow for how fast the battlefield now moves,” he said. There can be more than 150 products and artifacts created during the planning process, and a team of five could spend roughly 12,000 minutes of labor over five days on one plan — of which, 70% goes into data management rather than strategy.\nEven worse, plans go stale quickly, and time and resource constraints often mean missions aren’t updated or compared against alternatives.\nMearn used a conflict in the Indo-Pacific as an example. “There is a plan that exists that we’re supposed to be constantly updating based off new information and ready to enact at any time. That should be dynamic. Is it in reality?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAfter leaving the Marines, Mearn went to Harvard Business School before going to Silicon Valley, where he worked on Facebook’s misinformation team during the 2018 midterms. He later led product at a handful of startups. He and CTO Shah Hossain founded Pytho in the summer of 2023 after talking with people still serving in the military and hearing that mission planning remained a major pain point.\nThe startup is only four people, split between Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. But its ambitions are to change mission planning for every service member in the armed forces through a streamlined software product. Rather than a chatbot interface, it uses a template structure that’s well understood by service members today, powered by a system of AI agents to generate plans in any format.\nThe company’s first demo centers on mission analysis, a process with 48 steps that are generally time-intensive but now take mere minutes to complete.\nHumans stay in the loop, and after generating the draft, Pytho’s software invites planners to edit where needed. The company included features like confidence scores to contextualize the information, and the software can integrate with Microsoft products to align with existing workflows.\nMearn emphasized that they are building the product to ensure a range of end users can access it, whether that be 18-year-old specialists fresh out of high school to two-star generals with decades of service behind them.\nOf course, breaking into the Department of Defense is notoriously challenging. Pytho claims it already has work with “almost every single service” by embedding company engineers with units to co-build planning workflows.\n“Service members out there need people that are dedicated solely to building these plans,” he said. “It would almost be a disservice to not have a company dedicated to this.”\nIf you want to learn from Pytho AI firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, this week in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nEven before a building accepts its first occupant, it has racked up a steep carbon debt. Worldwide, the materials and construction required to erect buildings contributes 11% of global carbon emissions, according to the World Green Building Council.\nSome places have begun experimenting with multistory timber buildings, and while they’ve recently reached new heights, timber buildings won’t be replacing skyscrapers anytime soon. But one Chilean startup thinks that there’s still room for wood to find a place.\n“We’re more into hybrid buildings,” Andrés Mitnik, co-founder and CEO of Strong by Form, told TechCrunch. His company has developed a new engineered wood product that can replace concrete and steel in structural floors, allowing architects to design lighter, less carbon intensive buildings. The company is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist and is presenting at TechCrunch Disrupt, which runs this week in San Francisco. \nThe secret is in how those floor plates are made. “We think we can shape wood in a way that no one else has done it before,” he said.\nStrong by Form has designed a structural floor piece that can span longer distances than existing engineered wood, making it a replacement for steel or concrete. At the same time, the product is lighter than all three.\nOn the outside, builders will see something familiar. “When a contractor gets it, they see a CLT [cross-laminated timber] slab,” Mitnik said. “All the connections, the construction system, all the processes on site are exactly as if you were using CLT, so no need to learn new things.”\nBut inside, instead of more solid wood, like you’d find in a CLT, the structure is filled with cavities. Wood shavings have been pressed into a wavy board that’s optimized to bear heavy loads.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe wavy panel looks like oriented strand board, or OSB, which is common throughout job sites. But Strong by Form has developed software and a manufacturing technique to tweak the size and alignment of the wood flakes that are held together by a glue-like binder. “It’s sort of a next-generation OSB, if you want to think about it like that,” Mitnik said.\nBy using wood’s natural form and strengths, Strong by Form has built wood structural floors that currently span 10 meters (about 33 feet). Most CLT floors can only span half that distance.\nAll that technology isn’t free, but Mitnik said that the higher costs of its engineered wood product can be offset by its lighter weight. \n“The idea is to create something that is so light it allows you to have an overall optimization of the structure,” he said. Lighter floors mean less steel and concrete in the frame, which lowers the overall cost of the building. “With those additional savings, we’re able to achieve price parity with concrete.”\nStrong by Form is testing its 10-meter panel, ensuring it meets fire and load ratings that structural engineers require.\nNext, it will raise a Series A round targeted at $10 million to build a pilot plant to produce the first pieces intended for commercial deployment.\nIn the meantime, Strong by Form has also developed a panel three millimeters thick that’s intended for finish instead of structural duty. The startup is working with train manufacturers to use its subtly undulating panel on the interior of trains, where they can soften the aesthetic of the walls and ceilings of train cars while reducing their mass.\n“That has allowed us to fund all the R&D [research and development] required to do the floors, which is what we really want to scale, because that’s where the impact is,” Mitnik said.\nIf you want to learn more about Strong by Form from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, this week in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nPlastic recycling has fallen short. Only about 9% of all plastic is recycled globally, which sounds pretty bad until you compare it with textiles. Only 0.5% of those are recycled.\nOne of the biggest challenges is that textiles are seldom one material. Buttons and zippers complicate matters, but spandex is even worse. Novel synthetic blends have made for clothing that’s a dream to wear but a nightmare to recycle. \n“The challenge to recycling is that you can never predict your waste,” Stwart Peña Feliz, co-founder and CEO of MacroCycle, told TechCrunch. “Your waste has infinite number of contaminants.”\nMacroCycle has developed a shortcut, of sorts, that promises to make recycled plastic as inexpensive as virgin material. The startup has devised a way to pluck desirable synthetic fibers from waste textiles, leaving everything else behind. MacroCycle is a Top 20 finalist in Startup Battlefield and is presenting at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco. \nPeña Feliz knows the potential pitfalls of plastic recycling well. Earlier in his career, he helped run ExxonMobil’s chemical recycling plant, which uses heat to break down plastic into simpler hydrocarbons. It works, but the process is energy intensive and spews a lot of carbon dioxide. \n“I saw that firsthand and knew something had to be done,” he said.\nSoon after he left Exxon, Peña Feliz decided to pursue an MBA at MIT. There, he met Jan-Georg Rosenboom, who as a postdoc had developed a novel way of recycling plastics. “When I saw his technology, I thought it was too good to be true,” Peña Feliz said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe pair started turning that technology into a business in the fall of 2022. The following spring, they were selected for a Breakthrough Energy Fellowship to develop it further. “We kind of looked at each other and said, ‘I guess we’re doing this full time,’” Peña Feliz said. MacroCycle raised a $6.5 million seed round earlier this year.\nTo understand plastic recycling, it helps to know a bit about the material’s chemistry. Plastics are polymers, which are long chains of monomers, or repeating chemical building blocks. Most chemical recycling processes break plastic polymers down into smaller components, including monomers, so they can then rebuild them into something indistinguishable from virgin plastic.\nMacroCycle differs because it doesn’t break down polymers. Instead, it loops the polymer chains back on themselves, forcing them into rings called macrocycles. Those macrocycles remain behind as different solvents wash away contaminants, which themselves could be recycled. Later, the rings are reopened to reform the polymer chain. “As they open up the rings want to combine with each other, and in polyester, the longer the polymer, the higher the quality,” Peña Feliz said.\n“By not having to retrace all those steps all over again, we’re able to take a significantly more energy efficient approach,” he added. MacroCycle’s process uses 80% less energy than is needed to make virgin polyester, while other chemical recycling processes use 20% to 30% less, he said.\nThe startup is in the process of setting up a larger reactor, one that’s 2,000 times larger than the one they were using two and a half years ago, Peña Feliz said. It’s large enough to produce 100 kilogram (220 pound) batches of material for customers to sample. MacroCycle is generating revenue from fashion brands interested in the technology, he said.\n“We’re comfortable being one of the few, if not the only, public chemical recyclers that can claim that we can provide this material at price parity once we build our first industrial facility,” Feliz Peña said.\nHe’s convinced it’s the only way for recycled plastic to replace fossil fuels in the industry. “The bottom line drives a lot of innovation, and if you want to have players like ExxonMobil change the way they do things, it will not happen from the inside,” he said. “I want to be able to create a technology so economically attractive that the opportunity cost is really high for them to not adopt this new type of solution.”\nIf you want to hear from MacroCycle firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI released new data on Monday illustrating how many of ChatGPT’s users are struggling with mental health issues and talking to the AI chatbot about it. The company says that 0.15% of ChatGPT’s active users in a given week have “conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” Given that ChatGPT has more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to more than a million people a week.\nThe company says a similar percentage of users show “heightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT,” and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the AI chatbot.\nOpenAI says these types of conversations in ChatGPT are “extremely rare,” and thus difficult to measure. That said, the company estimates these issues affect hundreds of thousands of people every week.\nOpenAI shared the information as part of a broader announcement about its recent efforts to improve how models respond to users with mental health issues. The company claims its latest work on ChatGPT involved consulting with more than 170 mental health experts. OpenAI says these clinicians observed that the latest version of ChatGPT “responds more appropriately and consistently than earlier versions.”\nIn recent months, several stories have shed light on how AI chatbots can adversely affect users struggling with mental health challenges. Researchers have previously found that AI chatbots can lead some users down delusional rabbit holes, largely by reinforcing dangerous beliefs through sycophantic behavior.\nAddressing mental health concerns in ChatGPT is quickly becoming an existential issue for OpenAI. The company is currently being sued by the parents of a 16-year-old boy who confided his suicidal thoughts to ChatGPT in the weeks leading up to his suicide. State attorneys general from California and Delaware — which could block the company’s planned restructuring — have also warned OpenAI that it needs to protect young people who use their products.\nEarlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed in a post on X that the company has “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues” in ChatGPT, though he did not provide specifics. The data shared on Monday appears to be evidence for that claim, though it raises broader issues about how widespread the problem is. Nevertheless, Altman said OpenAI would be relaxing some restrictions, even allowing adult users to start having erotic conversations with the AI chatbot.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the Monday announcement, OpenAI claims the recently updated version of GPT-5 responds with “desirable responses” to mental health issues roughly 65% more than the previous version. On an evaluation testing AI responses around suicidal conversations, OpenAI says its new GPT-5 model is 91% compliant with the company’s desired behaviors, compared to 77% for the previous GPT‑5 model.\nThe company also says its latest version of GPT-5 also holds up to OpenAI’s safeguards better in long conversations. OpenAI has previously flagged that its safeguards were less effective in long conversations.\nOn top of these efforts, OpenAI says it’s adding new evaluations to measure some of the most serious mental health challenges facing ChatGPT users. The company says its baseline safety testing for AI models will now include benchmarks for emotional reliance and non-suicidal mental health emergencies.\nOpenAI has also recently rolled out more controls for parents of children who use ChatGPT. The company says it’s building an age prediction system to automatically detect children using ChatGPT, and impose a stricter set of safeguards.\nStill, it’s unclear how persistent the mental health challenges around ChatGPT will be. While GPT-5 seems to be an improvement over previous AI models in terms of safety, there still seems to be a slice of ChatGPT’s responses that OpenAI deems “undesirable.” OpenAI also still makes its older and less-safe AI models, including GPT-4o, available for millions of its paying subscribers.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

But the Department of Commerce last week gave Nvidia the nod to sell H200 GPUs in China, in exchange for a 25% cut of sales of those chips. \nNvidia is now seeing such strong demand from Chinese companies that it is considering adding more capacity, Reuters reported. However, Chinese officials are still deciding whether to allow the import of the H200 chips, which are said to be significantly more powerful than the H20 GPUs Nvidia had customized to sell in China.\nFor the chipmaker, expanding production of the H200 GPUs would let it tap latent demand in a country that is racing to develop its own homegrown AI chips. Competition and national security concerns in the West have hampered the availability of the latest and most powerful hardware for training AI models in China, where companies have resorted to focusing on efficiency over sheer scale.\nChinese companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, which are developing their own AI models, have already been in touch with Nvidia to figure out large orders for the H200 chips, which are being produced in limited quantities, the report added.\n“We are managing our supply chain to ensure that licensed sales of the H200 to authorized customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n",

    "body": "\nGrok, the chatbot built by Elon Musk’s xAI and popularized on his social media platform X, appears to have repeatedly spread misinformation about today’s mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Australia.\nGizmodo pointed to a number of posts where Grok misidentified the bystander — 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed — who disarmed one of the gunmen, and where it questioned the authenticity of videos and photos capturing al Ahmed’s actions.\nIn one post, the chatbot misidentified the man in a photo as an Israeli hostage, and in another post brought up irrelevant information about the Israeli army’s treatment of Palestinians. In another post, it claimed a “43-year-old IT professional and senior solutions architect” named Edward Crabtree was the one who actually disarmed a gunman.\nGrok does appear to be fixing some of its mistakes. At least one post that reportedly claimed a video of the shooting actually showed Cyclone Alfred has been corrected “upon reevaluation.”\nAnd the chatbot subsequently acknowledged al Ahmed’s identity, writing that the “misunderstanding arises from viral posts that mistakenly identified him as Edward Crabtree, possibly due to a reporting error or a joke referencing a fictional character.” (The article in question appeared on a largely non-functional news site that may be AI-generated.)\n",

    "body": "\nRIP to Facebook Messenger’s desktop app. The native app for Mac and Windows is no longer available to users as of today, December 15, 2025, and existing users are being directed to the Facebook website to continue using the popular messaging service.\nThough originally launched at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Messenger’s desktop app couldn’t handle as many video call participants as business-focused rivals like Zoom, didn’t offer screensharing, or easy-to-share URLs.\n\nThe writing was on the wall for the app’s declining importance to Meta, even before the company announced its shutdown plans this October.\nIn 2023, Facebook began merging Messenger back into the Facebook app. \nMore recently, the company shifted the technology underpinning the app’s desktop version. According to Meta’s help documentation, Messenger for Mac was built with Catalyst, which lets developers bring iPad apps to the Mac. That technology has received criticism for both developers and users — developers cited the extra work required, while users noticed apps’ lack of a native feel.\nBefore its Catalyst version, the Mac app was an Electron app that later migrated to a React Native Desktop app, according to a former Meta software engineer. \nOn Windows, the app transitioned to a progressive web app last year.\nThe downgrades likely impacted user demand for a standalone Mac app, while the strategy of moving Messenger back to Facebook suggested Meta was attempting to shore up declining usage of its aging flagship social network. \nThis fall, the company warned users that Messenger’s desktop app would be deprecated by year end, and encouraged users to set up a PIN to save their chat history before moving to the web.\nPeople who use Messenger without a Facebook account are being redirected to Messenger.com after the shutdown, where they’ll be able to log in without creating a Facebook account.\nMore information for users about the transition is available on Facebook’s help center, with separate sections for Mac users and Windows users.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAI’s impact on our social media feeds has not gone unnoticed by one of America’s top dictionaries. Amidst the onslaught of content that has swept the web over the past twelve months, Merriam-Webster announced Sunday that its word of the year for 2025 is “slop.”\nThe dictionary defines the term as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.” \n“Like slime, sludge, and muck, slop has the wet sound of something you don’t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything,” the dictionary writes, adding that, in an age of AI anxiety, it is a term designed to communicate “a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking” of the technology.\n“It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster’s president, Greg Barlow, told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”\nThe word “slop” has certainly been everywhere this year, as journalists and commentators have sought to describe the ways in which platforms like OpenAI’s Sora and Google Gemini’s Veo are transforming the internet. Thanks to this new breed of media generator, there are now AI-generated books, podcasts, pop songs, TV commercials—even entire movies. One study in May claimed that nearly 75 percent of all new web content from the previous month had involved some kind of AI.\nThese new tools have even led to what has been dubbed a “slop economy,” in which gluts of AI-generated content can be milked for advertising money. Critics worry that this trend is further polarizing digital communities, dividing them up into those who can afford paywalled, higher-quality content, and those who can only afford a digital diet of slop, which—as you might imagine—can be quite light on informational value. \nBut “slop” has also been used to describe AI’s impact on a large variety of fields that don’t have much to do with traditional media consumption, including cybersecurity reports, legal briefings, and the college essay, among other things. Its impact is broad, to say the least. \nRelatedly, tech words have been big winners in the WOTY (word of the year) category this year. Macquarie Dictionary already beat out Merriam-Webster to make “AI slop” its annual term, while Oxford Dictionary chose “ragebait.” Collins Dictionary went with “vibe coding.”   \n",

    "body": "\nSnapchat announced on Monday that its end-of-year Recaps are rolling out to users, giving them a look back at 2025. The Recap is a short video that offers a personalized look at highlights from Snaps, Stories, and Chats, showing how users connected and expressed themselves throughout the year.\nUsers can access their Recap by opening the app and navigating to the “Memories” section. There, they will see a “Your 2025 Snap Recap” card.\nThe move comes as companies like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and Duolingo have all released their own end-of-year recaps.\nAlongside the Recaps, Snapchat shared statistics on how people used the social media app over the past year. For example, the company says phone calls aren’t dead, noting that users talked for nearly 1.7 billion minutes per day on average, almost 30% more than last year. Plus, users in the U.S. sent over five billion voice notes, nearly 10% more than last year.\nGroup chats still remain a popular way to connect on Snapchat, as the number of people sending messages to group chats grew by more than 5% in 2025, and some users sent more than 8,880 messages to their top group chat this year.\nThe company also revealed that Chat Reactions grew by 44% this year, with the heart emoji taking the crown as the most popular. Additionally, three million more people also used stickers to communicate this year.\nThe launch of Snap’s 2025 Recap arrives amid user backlash over the company’s plans to charge for storage next year, with some calling for a boycott to urge the company to change its mind. Snapchat announced in September that free access to Memories will be limited to 5GB. If a user’s memories exceed this limit, they’ll need to subscribe to one of the service’s new Memories Storage plans.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe introductory storage plan offers up to 100GB of storage for $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ users will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their $3.99 monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB as part of their $15.99 monthly subscription.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFintech startup Mesa has shut down its Homeowners Card, which awarded points to cardholders for paying their mortgages.\nA message on the Mesa website states that as of December 12, “all Mesa Homeowners Card accounts are closed,” adding, “All credit cards have been deactivated and you are no longer able to make any new purchases or earn Mesa Points.”\nA Mesa FAQ about the shutdown described this as “a business decision to close the Mesa Homeowners Card Program entirely.” TechCrunch has reached out to Mesa for additional comment on its future plans.\nThe startup launched just over a year ago, in November 2024, with $9.2 million in funding ($7.2 million in equity funding and $2 million in debt). It offered two products — mortgage loans with 1% cash back, as well as the credit card with rewards including cash back, travel, and offset mortgage payments.\nAt the time, CEO Kelley Halpin told TechCrunch that the startup had “taken what everybody loves about travel and dining cards to re-contextualize that for the homeowner/parent.”\nIn theory, you could earn points for home expenses by using any credit card with rewards, but Mesa said it structured its points program to incentivize spending related to home ownership.\n“So it’s not rewarding you on travel and dining spend; it’s rewarding you on gas, groceries, your HOA, utilities, home goods as well as your mortgage payment,” Halpin said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBilt, which has a rewards card that allows customers to earn points on rent payments, says it will expand with points for mortgage payments when it launches a revamped card next year.\nMesa’s card shutdown has been covered by travel deals websites like One Mile at a Time and Upgraded Points, which say that Mesa cardmembers have been complaining about declined transactions for the past week, with the company initially claiming this was only a temporary outage.\nNow, it seems the only remaining way to redeem points earned on the Mesa card is through a statement credit at a rate of 0.6%.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

This expansion might nudge people to use communities less on Reddit and X.\nThe platform initially launched over 100 communities in October, including those dedicated to basketball, television, K-pop, books, and more, to better compete with other social networks. With today’s expansion, Threads now has more than 200 communities, with additions that include team-specific spaces like Lakers Threads, Knicks Threads, and Spurs Threads.\nThe company is testing flairs within the community as well, which is also very common on Reddit.

    "body": "\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, Netflix recently announced its plans to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for $82.7 billion. Responses from the industry have been generally negative, sparking concern about the acquisition’s implications for jobs, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV. \nNetflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos have sought to address fears surrounding the deal in a letter to employees, which was made public by Bloomberg on Monday. \nThe executives reassured staff of their commitment to maintaining theatrical releases for WBD films. They also asserted that there will be “no overlap or studio closures.” \nThe co-CEOs further stated that the “deal is about growth” and that the company is “strengthening one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.”\nDespite these assurances, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has emerged as a vocal opponent of the acquisition, arguing that it violates antitrust laws designed to prevent monopolies. \nAdditionally, the deal has attracted the attention of lawmakers. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal submitted a letter to the Justice Department Antitrust Division expressing their concerns about the potential implications of a massive merger in the entertainment industry. \nThe senators argue that, in addition to raising ethical questions, the newly merged media giant would possess “more market power than the current companies to raise consumers’ television costs,” especially at a time when middle-class families are already facing rising prices. Notably, Netflix raised its subscription prices last January.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo counter monopoly concerns, Peters and Sarandos cited Nielsen data in their letter reportedly showing that combining Netflix and WBD would result in a smaller viewership share than YouTube currently holds, or what a competing Paramount-WBD merger would create.\nThe letter comes on the heels of Paramount making a competing $108.4 billion offer to acquire WBD, signaling that the competition for media dominance is far from over. Paramount was previously viewed as the main contender; however, CNBC reported that WBD’s board rejected the terms of the offer.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nGoogle has revealed that its “dark web report” feature will be discontinued starting February 16, 2026. Launched initially about a year and a half ago, this tool aimed to help users monitor their personal information on the dark web\nFor some users, the dark web report seemed like a valuable tool, scanning various data breach dumps and alerting them if their personal information — such as email addresses, names, phone numbers, and Social Security numbers —was found in compromised databases. \nHowever, as noted on its support page, Google has decided to shut down the feature due to feedback suggesting that it “didn’t provide helpful next steps” for users facing potential identity risks.\nMany users echoed this, with Reddit discussions reflecting a common frustration: the tool didn’t offer actionable advice. As one commenter put it, it often felt like all users could do was change their passwords without clear guidance on which accounts or websites were affected.\n“We’re making this change to instead focus on tools that give you more clear, actionable steps to protect your information online,” the tech giant wrote. “We’ll continue to track and defend you from online threats, including the dark web, and build tools that help protect you and your personal information.”\nIn place of the dark web report feature, Google recommended other protective measures. The company offers other tools, such as “Security Checkup,” which reviews your Google account’s security; a built-in “Password Manager” for generating unique passwords; and “Password Checkup,” which sends alerts when your saved passwords have been compromised, among other features. \n9to5Google was the first to spot the feature’s planned shutdown, noting that users were alerted via email.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf you were using the dark web report feature, it’s important to note that scanning for new dark web breaches will stop on January 16. The dark web report tool will be officially discontinued on February 16, and all related data will be deleted from Google’s servers.\nUsers who want to take control of their data before the deadline can delete their profiles by going to “Results with your info,” then selecting “Edit monitoring profile,” and choosing “Delete monitoring profile” at the bottom.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

The company is also allowing free users to access the assistant’s features, such as summarizing the meetings, listing action items, or getting insights from meetings with limits.\nThe company said that basic plan users get to use the AI companion within three meetings every month, which will each include a meeting summary, in-meeting questions, and AI note-taking capabilities. Plus, they can ask 20 questions each through the side panel and the new web surface. They can also purchase a $10 add-on plan to access AI companion features.\nOn the new web surface, the company is also adding conversation starter prompts to inform users about what the assistant can do. \nZoom said that with this update, the assistant can also retrieve information from third-party services such as Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, along with all data stored within Zoom. The company said it will soon add support for Gmail and Microsoft Outlook as connectors.\nImage Credits: Zoom\nThe AI Companion also generates a daily reflection report that summarizes meetings, tasks, and updates for the day. What’s more, the assistant can create follow-up tasks and draft email messages.\nZoom is also adding more features related to document creation and management.

    "body": "\nLidar company Luminar has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after months of layoffs, executive departures, and a legal fight with its largest customer, Volvo. \nThe company aims to sell off its lidar business during the bankruptcy proceeding, and has already reached a deal to sell its semiconductor subsidiary. While the company will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process to “minimize disruptions” for its suppliers and customers, Luminar will eventually cease to exist once it’s completed.\n“After a comprehensive review of our alternatives, the board determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best path forward,” Paul Ricci, Luminar’s CEO said in a statement. “As we navigate this process, our top priority is to continue delivering the same quality, reliability and service our customers have come to expect from us.”\nThe bankruptcy case, filed in the Southern District of Texas on Monday morning, comes at the end of a tumultuous year for a company that was valued at more than $3 billion when it went public in a reverse merger in 2020. \nLuminar founder Austin Russell abruptly resigned from the CEO role in May following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry,” though he remained on the company’s board. In October, he launched a new effort called Russell AI Labs and made a bid to buy Luminar outright. (It’s unclear if Russell plans to pursue the lidar assets in the bankruptcy case; representatives for the former CEO did not immediately respond to requests for comment.) \nThe company, meanwhile, cut 25% of its workforce — its second layoff of the year. Luminar’s chief financial officer left the company, the company defaulted on a number of loans, and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation. \nLuminar was also hit with an eviction lawsuit in October at one office and it exited a lease on another in November.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother big blow came in November when Volvo, an early backer of Luminar and its largest customer heading into this year, canceled a five-year-old contract with the lidar-maker. Luminar said it has taken legal action against Volvo over the dissolution, but it has also been hit with its own legal claim from the contract manufacturer that actually made the lidar sensors. \nLuminar is claiming to have between $100 million and $500 million in assets and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities, according to the bankruptcy filings. Among those liabilities is a $10 million debt owed to Scale AI, which was helping Luminar with data labeling. Luminar also owes more than $1 million to AI software company Applied Intuition.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nIn a world that’s rapidly filling up with AI-generated content, a startup called First Voyage wants to help people avoid all the AI slop blasted their way and instead build the habits they want. And it’s doing that by way of an AI companion app: Called Momo Self Care, the app offers a digital pet called Momo that you can take care of, and in return, it’ll remind you to complete habit-building tasks.\nUsers can set up reminders for what tasks they want to complete, and Momo will remind you of them. Similar to the hit productivity app Focus Friend, Momo also rewards you with coins for completing tasks that can be used to purchase items within the app to further customize the pet. Users can also talk to Momo about self-care, and the AI companion will recommend habits and tasks based on what you want to achieve.\n“Momo helps users become the best versions of themselves, and users reward Momo with care, affection, and cute accessories,” co-founder and CEO Besart Çopa told TechCrunch. He launched the company with Egehan Ozsoy, who serves as CTO. \nOn Monday, First Voyage said it had raised $2.5 million in a seed funding round from a16z speedrun, SignalFire, True Global, and other investors.\nImage Credits:First Voyage\nCopa said Momo users have already created more than 2 million tasks on the platform, and the most popular habits relate to productivity, spirituality, and mindfulness.\nBut with the wave of AI apps and toys hitting the market, not to mention the burgeoning influence of AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok, there’s increasing concern that these new, so-called “companions” can lead to more harm than good.\nÇopa, for one, believes that relationships between AI characters and humans will only increase in the next few years. However, he noted that the increasing number of AI apps aimed at wellness and self-care is at least better than those that target base urges. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We are happy so many founders [and] startups are working in the AI self-care wellness space instead of building waifus,” he said, adding that the “personalization capability of AI will take the impact of these relationships to another level.”\nImage Credits:First Voyage / Momo\nHe noted that Momo has baked in safety guardrails, such as prompt filters to make sure that conversations between the AI and users stay within appropriate boundaries.\nThe fresh cash from the fundraise will be used to help launch Momo on the Android app store (it’s already available on iOS). The First Voyage team also hopes to make Momo more intelligent in how it interacts with people.  \n“We hope Momo and the community around it become a defining consumer brand that uses the best of AI, animation, and gamification to improve as many lives as possible,” Çopa said.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJust about six months after Tesla started testing its fledgling Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, the company is now letting those cars drive around the city with no safety monitor onboard.\nThe removal of the human safety monitors brings the company a critical step closer to its goal of launching a real commercial Robotaxi service, and it’s a step that’s been years in the making. \nCEO Elon Musk spent nearly a decade promising Tesla’s cars were just a software update away from being fully driverless. Now he is on the precipice of launching a service meant to compete with Waymo, the Alphabet-owned company that he said last week “never really had a chance against Tesla.”\nThe removal of the safety monitors will most likely ramp up the scrutiny on Tesla’s ongoing testing in Austin, doubly so when the company starts offering rides in the empty cars. Tesla’s small test fleet has been involved in at least seven crashes since June; few details are known about the accidents since the company aggressively redacts its reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nVideo of a totally empty Tesla Model Y SUV started spreading on social media over the weekend, and on Sunday, Musk confirmed his company was testing “with no occupants.” Neither Musk nor Tesla has shared how quickly it plans to move to offer customer rides with no safety monitor. The company’s own X account provided a hint in a post Sunday evening: “Slowly, then all at once.” Tesla’s head of AI, Ashok Elluswamy, wrote: “And so it begins!”\nTesla started offering rides in Austin to hand-picked influencers and customers in June, with an employee in the passenger seat who could take over if the cars did anything unsafe. Those safety monitors moved to the driver’s seat in September. The company has since ditched the wait list, and gradually expanded its service area to cover a large portion of the greater Austin metropolitan area. But its fleet size never grew to more than about 25 to 30 cars by most fans’ counts.\nMusk has claimed Tesla will operate its own fleet of Robotaxis, and said in July he believed this fleet would cover “half of the population of the U.S.” by the end of this year. That outrageous target, like so many Musk has set over the years, has been revised down to him claiming in November that Tesla would roughly double its existing Austin fleet, or around 60 vehicles.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla has been testing a ride-hail service in the San Francisco area for the last few months, in which drivers use the company’s advanced driver assistance software. California has regulations in place that mean Tesla will need to combine multiple permits if it wants to offer fully driverless rides in the state. Texas, on the other hand, does not.\nMusk has also talked a lot over the years about allowing Tesla owners to add their personal cars to the company’s robotaxi fleet. In 2016, he even promised that every car Tesla made had all the hardware required to eventually become autonomous. That was wrong, and that blog post has since been removed from Tesla’s website (the company faces a number of legal challenges over it). Tesla has gone through multiple versions of the hardware that powers its driver assistance software, meaning there are millions of cars on the road that, by Musk’s own admission in January, will need to be upgraded.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAI lets anyone create videos, but many AI video creation tools lack support for audio. Mirelo is building AI that adds soundtracks to match the video’s action.\nEarlier this year, the Berlin-based startup released Mirelo SFX v1.5, an AI model that interprets videos to add synced sound effects (SFX). \nThis attracted attention from VCs gearing up for a generative AI revolution in games. The two-year-old German startup has raised a $41 million seed round led by Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch learned exclusively.\nThis new capital will help Mirelo compete more effectively in its emerging category. While it was still in stealth mode and resource-constrained, large companies such as Sony and Tencent released video-to-SFX models. So did Kuaishou-owned Kling AI, out of China, and ElevenLabs, which is also backed by a16z.\nWhile Mirelo already differs from them by its narrower focus, beating these models in the long run requires the startup to make additional hires. Altogether, the startup expects its team of 10 people to “double if not triple” in headcount by the end of next year, Mirelo CEO and co-founder CJ Simon-Gabriel told TechCrunch.\nThese new hires will support Mirelo’s R&D, as well as its product and go-to-market strategy. The startup published its models on Fal.ai and Replicate, and expects API usage to drive most of its revenue in the short term, Simon-Gabriel said. But it is also investing in building out its workspace for creators, Mirelo Studio, which could eventually support full professional use.\nAs Mirelo prepares to scale, the startup and its investors are also anticipating concerns around training data that have dogged other generative AI companies. According to Georgia Stevenson, who led Index’s investments, Mirelo based its models on public and purchased sound libraries, and is signing revenue-sharing partnerships that respect artists’ rights. \nIt’s a tension inherent to generative AI tools, but Mirelo isn’t displacing musicians and sound designers — at least not yet. With a freemium model including a recommended plan for creators priced at €20/month (approximately $23.50), the startup is mostly targeting amateurs and prosumers hoping to unmute AI-generated videos.\nAccording to Simon-Gabriel, creators can’t fully benefit from this new potential without audio. \n“George Lucas said that sound is 50% of the movie-going experience. It’s not an overstatement,” he said. “If anything, it’s an understatement. You can take exactly the same images, and the sound will shape a completely different ambience, depending on the sound and the music that you put in there.”\nHe and his co-founder, Florian Wenzel, are both AI researchers and musicians themselves, and the startup has AI music generation on its roadmap. But Mirelo is seeing more pull for sound effects, in part because there is less research happening than in other AI fields, Simon-Gabriel said. \n“It’s easier to build a real moat here, and then to capitalize on it,” he noted.\nThis could pay off for Mirelo. Simon-Gabriel declined to disclose its new valuation, but said it had increased “very significantly” compared to its previously undisclosed pre-seed round. That earlier round was led by Berlin-based firm Atlantic, which also participated in the new funding, bringing Mirelo’s total raised to $44 million and helping close its resource gap.\nThe startup is also backed by angels who lend credibility to its technology and could open new doors, including Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch, Hugging Face chief science officer Thomas Wolf, Fal.ai co-founder Burkay Gur, and others.\nStill, the team is aware that AI-generated videos may not be mute for long. \nFor instance, Gemini’s video generator now incorporates soundtracks powered by DeepMind’s Veo 3.1 video-to-audio model. But if anything, Simon-Gabriel sounds vindicated. “Now, suddenly, people realize, ‘Oh, maybe we should add sound.’ But, of course, you should add some. It’s a bit like silent movies versus talkies, right? It does make quite a difference!”\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nFusion power has the potential to rewrite trillion-dollar energy markets, but first, startups have to prove their designs will work and won’t be too costly. Neither is easy, especially when considering the massive magnets and lasers used in many designs must be installed with millimeter precision or better.\nFusion startup Thea Energy says its pixel-inspired reactor and specialized control software should be able to generate power without requiring the same level of perfection.\n“It doesn’t have to be as good to begin with,” Brian Berzin, co-founder and CEO of Thea Energy, told TechCrunch. “We have a way to tune out imperfections on the back end.” That margin of error could give Thea a leg up on the competition. \nFusion power plants promise to deliver gigawatts of clean power to the grid, but material and construction costs threaten to make them uncompetitive with cheap solar and wind. By building a power plant first and ironing out the kinks in software, Thea could help bring the cost of fusion power down dramatically.\nThis animation shows how Helios can be disassembled for maintenanceImage Credits:Thea Energy\nBut first the company has to build a working prototype. Today, Thea is publishing the details of its design, including the details of the physics that underpin it. The startup shared the paper exclusively with TechCrunch.\nThea is building a unique take on the stellarator, a specific type of reactor that uses magnets to whip the plasma fuel into shape. Magnets are one of the two main ways that fusion scientists keep plasma heat and confine plasma until fusion reactions occur. The other, known as inertial confinement, uses lasers or some other force to squeeze small fuel pellets.\nMost stellarators are built with magnets that look at home in a Salvador Dali painting. But Thea’s design uses a dozen larger magnets and hundreds of smaller ones to create what you might call a “virtual” stellarator.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn a typical stellarator, the magnets are built to follow the contours of a shape that’s intended to work with the quirks of plasma, helping to confine it for longer using less power than tokamaks, which use a series of identically sized and shaped magnets. Yet stellarators have one major disadvantage: the irregular shape makes mass manufacturing magnets challenging.\nSo instead, Thea designed its reactor around small, identical superconducting magnets that are arranged in arrays. The startup will use software to control each magnet individually to generate magnetic fields that can replicate a stellarator’s wobbly shape.\nA cutaway view of plasma flowing through Helios’ reactor coreImage Credits:Thea Energy\nThe approach has several upsides. For one, it has allowed Thea to rapidly iterate on its magnet design. In the last two years, the company has tweaked the design more than 60 times, Berzin said. “Most fusion companies, you’re dealing with magnets that are the size of a car or a laser the size of a car or a widget the size of car. That unfortunately means one is $20 million and takes two years [to make],” he said.\nIt has also meant the company can use software controls to overcome any irregularities in the way the magnets were made or installed. To test its original control system, Thea built a three-by-three array of its magnets laced with sensors. The controls, which were derived from the physics of electromagnetism, worked well. But the company also wanted to see how AI might handle the task, so it also trained a new one using reinforced learning.\nThe team came away surprised at how well it all worked.\n“We purposefully threw curveballs at the array,” Berzin said. “We purposefully dismounted a magnet by literally over a centimeter. You could see it was super out of line. It was really hard for us to actually manufacture it so poorly.” The team also tested superconducting material from five different manufacturers along with intentionally defective material. “Every single time we did that, the control system, without us turning knobs and intervening, was able to tune out those defects,” he said.\nThea’s reactor design, Helios, will use two types of magnets. On the outside, 12 large magnets of four different shapes will do the heavy lifting to keep the plasma confined. They’re similar to those found on a tokamak, the type of doughnut-shaped reactor that competitor Commonwealth Fusion Systems is building. Inside the large coils, 324 smaller circular magnets will fine-tune the shape of the plasma.\nThe startup predicts Helios will generate 1.1 gigawatts of heat, which a steam turbine will turn into 390 megawatts of electricity at a cost below $150 per megawatt-hour for the first example. (Thea thinks it can get the cost down to $60 per megawatt-hour after it builds the seventh or tenth power plant.) The reactor will have to shut down for an 84-day maintenance period once every two years. If all goes well, that means its capacity factor — a measure of how much power it generates over a given period of time — will be 88%. That’s far better than today’s gas-fired power plants and almost as good as today’s nuclear power plants.\nHelios is still in the conceptual phase. Thea first has to build Eos, its initial fusion device that’s intended to prove the science behind the concept. Berzin said the company will announce a site for Eos in 2026 with plans to turn it on “around 2030.” \nAs it builds Eos, Thea plans to start work in parallel on Helios. It’s a similar approach to how Commonwealth Fusion Systems is moving forward with work on Arc, its first commercial power plant, while building Sparc, its demonstration plant.\nFor now, Berzin is looking forward to hearing what the fusion community thinks. “This is the release of the overview paper. This will be followed up by quite a substantial amount of work that will come out via peer review and publication,” he said. “Now is the moment for us to go and set up the partnerships, collaborations, get the end users engaged to go build the first one.”\nUpdate 2:45 pm ET: Added information about the anticipated cost of electricity for Helios.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

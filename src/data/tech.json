    "body": "\nUber Eats is partnering with sidewalk delivery robot company Starship Technologies to deliver food in the U.K. starting later this year.\nThe companies will start the service in the Leeds and Sheffield areas “from select merchants” in December and expand from there. Uber said the service will expand to “additional European markets in 2026” and the U.S. in 2027. \nThe tie-up with Starship is the latest in an increasingly long line of partnerships Uber has struck with autonomous vehicle companies of all shapes and sizes. But Starship’s not the first sidewalk robot company to work with Uber Eats. Uber’s food delivery arm has used Serve Robotics’ robots for a few years in the U.S. Uber started using Avride’s sidewalk robots earlier this year, too.\nStarship claims to have nearly 3,000 of its six-wheeled delivery robots in operation around the world, across more than 270 different locations. The robots typically make deliveries in under 30 minutes and travel no more than two miles.\n",

Despite a second, smaller fire in October, the aluminum supplier had planned to restart production at the New York facility in December. (Stellantis and Nissan have also taken smaller hits to production as a result of the September fire.)\nFord had to scale back production of essentially all of its F-150 trucks following the September fire, as they have used aluminum body panels for years now. The automaker slowly started building those trucks again in October. But it was prioritizing the gas and hybrid versions over the F-150 Lightning, which executives are reportedly discussing \nIt’s not clear what impact the new fire will have on Ford’s plans.

    "body": "\nSpotify is making it easier for users to make the switch from other streaming services. On Thursday, the company announced an integration with TuneMyMusic, a tool that can transfer playlists from other streaming services into users’ Spotify libraries.\nThe new feature, which is rolling out now to all Spotify users, will be found in the “Your Library” section of the Spotify mobile app. To use TuneMyMusic, you’ll scroll to the bottom of the page, then tap on the new option to “Import your music” and follow the prompts to connect with the service.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nYou can then choose the platform you’d like to transfer playlists from, and they’ll appear in your Spotify library. \nTo be clear, this process doesn’t delete the original playlists — it only copies them over to Spotify. At launch, TuneMyMusic supports transferring playlists from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer, Pandora, SoundCloud, Tidal, YouTube Music, and others.\nThe addition of the new feature ramps up the competition in the streaming wars, while also serving as a win for data portability. \nScreenshotImage Credits:Spotify\nOne of Spotify’s top competitors, Apple Music, already offers a way for iPhone and iPad users to transfer their saved music and playlists from other services to their Apple Music library via a feature that’s built directly into the iOS and iPadOS Settings app. That option is also available within the Android version of the Apple Music app.\nYouTube Music Premium users can import their playlists from other services, including Spotify, as well.\nFor customers thinking of switching to Spotify, having the transfer feature built into Spotify could push them to make the jump. It’s a nice perk, too, since the online version of TuneMyMusic only offers to transfer 500 tracks for free. For unlimited transfers, users would have to upgrade to a paid plan. \nSpotify isn’t sharing the terms of its deal with TuneMyMusic, but it’s likely a win for both companies, as it could bring more customers to Spotify while TuneMyMusic snags a large client. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIf you want insight into just how worried VCs (and Silicon Valley, generally) are over legal challenges to AI training on copyrighted material, look no further than AI music site Suno. \nSuno, which allows anyone to create AI-generated songs through prompts, announced on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \nThe company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September. It has now hit $200 million in annual revenue, Suno told The Wall Street Journal. \nIt previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. \nBut Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission.  \nThose types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material. \nBut given Suno’s market success, growth, and the obvious potential market for AI-generated music, its legal complications are a shoulder shrug to investors. \n“Type an idea, click Create, and suddenly, you’re not just imagining music — you’re making it. That shift from listener to creator? That’s what Suno unlocks,” the Menlo VCs who backed the startup describe in their blog post about the investment.\nMenlo didn’t just like the tech, but also that Suno has grown largely through word of mouth — people sharing songs on their group texts, the investors said. \nNo doubt the AI industry is, and will continue, to eventually work out the legal ramifications of acting first, asking for permission later, over training data. But before that’s settled, the era of AI-generated music has clearly arrived.\n",

    "body": "\nIndian IT giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has secured $1 billion from private equity firm TPG as part of a multi-year, $2 billion project to build a network of gigawatt-scale data centers in the country.\nThe project, dubbed “HyperVault,” comes as demand for AI compute is rising faster than companies can build the power-hungry infrastructure needed to support it.\nThe demand-supply gap for AI compute in India is particularly stark: the country generates nearly 20% of the world’s data, but accounts for only about 3% of global data center capacity. Big tech companies and cloud providers have been investing billions of dollars to expand local capacity and tap the country’s growing adoption of AI products.\nWith HyperVault, TCS and TPG plan to develop liquid-cooled, high-density data centers with the power and network capacity required to support advanced AI workloads across major cloud regions, the companies said.\nLiquid cooling and high-density rack designs are growing common as the GPUs needed to power AI inference and training use significantly more power and generate more heat than conventional CPU servers. But such designs also raise questions about resource use in countries like India, where water scarcity is already a concern. \nIn urban hubs such as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, where much of India’s data-center capacity is concentrated, existing water stress could complicate operations. S&P Global, citing Uptime Institute estimates, noted that a 1-MW data center load can require up to 25.5 million liters of water a year for cooling, adding pressure to already strained infrastructure.\nThe rapid building of AI data centers stands to further stress India’s power and land use, two other bottlenecks identified by industry analysts. High-density AI clusters require reliable electricity supply and large parcels of industrial land, two requirements increasingly difficult to secure in major urban regions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNonetheless, global tech companies are treating India as their frontier for building AI infrastructure. Local and global technology firms have announced investments of more than $32 billion over the last two years to expand data center infrastructure in the country, according to S&P Global.\nIn January, Microsoft said it would invest $3 billion over two years in India’s cloud and AI infrastructure, and in  October, Google said it would spend $15 billion over five years to build a gigawatt-scale AI data center hub in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. And back in 2023, Amazon committed $12.7 billion to build AWS cloud infrastructure in India through 2030.\nTCS said it would work with hyperscalers and AI companies to design, deploy and operate AI infrastructure as the platform expands. The company plans to build around 1.2 gigawatts of capacity in its initial phase.\nMore than 95% of India’s new data-center capacity over the next five years will come from leased facilities, and the remainder will be driven by hyperscalers building dedicated AI infrastructure, S&P Global estimates. Local players like Reliance Industries and CtrlS are also expanding their data-center capacity to meet rising demand.\nTCS and TPG project that India’s total data-center capacity could exceed 10 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 1.5 gigawatts today.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle is upgrading its image generation model with new editing chops, higher resolutions, more accurate text rendering, and the ability to search the web.\nDubbed Nano Banana Pro, the new model is built on Google’s latest large language model, Gemini 3, released earlier this week. The company claims Nano Banana Pro improves on its predecessor, Nano Banana, with the ability to create more detailed images and accurate text, and generate text in different styles, fonts and languages.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe model also has web searching capabilities, so you can do things like ask it to look up a recipe and generate flash cards.\nGoogle says Nano Banana Pro is geared towards giving professionals more control over images, and lets users  control aspects like camera angles, scene lighting, depth of field, focus, and color grading. And compared to Nano Banana’s resolution cap of 1024 x 1024px, users can generate 2K or 4K images with Nano Banana Pro.\nThe company noted that while Nano Banana Pro can generate images at a higher quality, it is slower and costlier than the original model, which cost $0.039 per 1024px image. Comparatively, the new model costs $0.139 for each 1080p or 2K image, and $0.24 for every 4K image.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe new model can use six high-fidelity shots or blend up to 14 objects within an image. It can also maintain consistency and resemblance of up to five people. The company has released a demo app where you can try some of these capabilities.\nNano Banana Pro is being rolled out across many of Google’s existing AI tools. The Gemini app will now use the new model to generate images by default, though users on the free subscription tier will be able to use the model to generate a limited number of images, after which they will be defaulted to the original Nano Banana model. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle AI Plus, Pro, and Ultra subscribers will get higher generation thresholds, though the company did not disclose the exact limits. These subscribers will also get access to the model within Notebook LM.\nGoogle is also making the model available in search through AI mode for AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Ultra subscribers can access the model in the company’s video tool, Flow, and it is available to Workspace customers in Google Slides and Vids, too.\nDevelopers can tap Nano Banana Pro through the Gemini API, Google AI Studio, and the company’s new IDE, Antigravity.\nThe company is also baking in SynthID, its tech to watermark and detect AI-generated images, into the Gemini app. Users can upload an image, and the chatbot will tell them if the image has been created or modified by the company’s image models.\nGoogle said that over time, it will include support for C2PA content credential detection for content verification. \nThe story has been updated to reflect Google’s approach to support C2PA.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWaymo has three new cities in its sights as it continues to expand around the United States: Minneapolis, New Orleans, and Tampa.\nThe company said on Thursday that it will start manually driving its vehicles in those cities “in the coming days,” ahead of testing and validating its driverless tech, before eventually launching a commercial robotaxi service in each.\nThese cities join a growing list of locations where Waymo has launched or plans to launch its robotaxis. The Alphabet-owned company is already offering rides on surface streets and highways in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix, and is live in Austin and Atlanta as well. \nIn 2026, Waymo plans to expand to Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, D.C. It’s also testing in New York City, and plans to offer commercial rides internationally starting with London and Tokyo.\nThe new cities announced Thursday could present some unique challenges for Waymo, though. Minneapolis has perhaps the harshest winters of the cities Waymo has chosen to date. Snow could challenge Waymo’s perception stack, and the lack of traction will give its automated driving system some extra work to do. New Orleans, meanwhile, has a lot of tight, one-way streets that are heavily used by pedestrians — especially in the French Quarter.\nAs Waymo has expanded, it’s been working with partners in a number of cities to help operate its fleets. Its vehicles are on Uber’s app in Austin and Atlanta; African mobility and fintech company Moove took over operations in Phoenix (and will do the same in Miami), and Avis Budget Group will manage the fleet in Dallas. It’s not immediately clear if Waymo will lean on similar partnerships in the new cities.\nWaymo’s so far outpacing other players when it comes to expanding to new cities. Amazon-owned Zoox is offering free rides in its custom-built robotaxi in Las Vegas, and letting members of its early-rider program take trips in San Francisco while it awaits a necessary exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to launch full commercial operations. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla, meanwhile, is trying to expand its nascent robotaxi service, which still has safety monitors in the driver’s seat.

    "body": "\nFinnish startup NestAI has raised €100 million (about $115 million) in a funding round led by Finland’s sovereign fund, Tesi, and hardware giant Nokia to build AI products for use in unmanned vehicles, autonomous operations, and command and control platforms.\nNestAI has also struck a partnership with Nokia to build AI products for defense applications and develop “physical AI,” which involves using large language models and related technology for robotics and other real-world applications.\nThe funding will help NestAI build “Europe’s leading physical AI lab,” co-founder Peter Sarlin said at the Slush 2025 technology conference in Helsinki. \nPhysical AI has been a growing research field both for Big Tech and startups, and NestAI’s funding round shows there’s space for European companies to develop homegrown solutions to address the continent’s needs — which have leaned towards defense applications due to prolonged Ukraine-Russia war. Last month, the startup announced it would support the Finnish Defense Forces in adopting AI.\nThis focus on sovereignty may explain why NestAI has been in stealth so far, but it is now building in public, supported by Sarlin, who has been funding the venture for the past few months through his family office, PostScriptum.\n“In line with PostScriptum’s mission, NestAI has from the start set out to become Europe’s leading physical AI lab to drive technological sovereignty,” Sarlin told TechCrunch. “This partnership also marks an important step in securing Europe’s defense capabilities and sovereignty.”\nAfter selling AI startup Silo AI to AMD for $665 million last year, Sarlin has been active as a philanthropist and investor, backing startups like Legora and Lovable. While he’s building NestAI, his day job is still at AMD, and he will only act as the startup’s chairman, not its CEO. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNestAI doesn’t have a CEO yet, but its growing team has attracted talent with experience in AI research and hardware projects that overlap with defense.

    "body": "\nSamsung Display and China’s BOE Technology, a supplier of OLED displays used in Apple devices, have agreed to settle a patent lawsuit concerning OLED technology.\n“The two companies have agreed that fair technological competition is essential for the advancement of the display industry,” and have therefore decided to withdraw all pending lawsuits, a spokesperson at Samsung Display confirmed to TechCrunch. “We [also] plan to withdraw all ongoing legal actions as part of this agreement.”\nSamsung Display declined to comment on reports that BOE may pay patent royalties to the Korean hardware giant as part of the settlement. BOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe settlement lays to bed a drawn out, three-year fight between Samsung’s display division and BOE, both of whom supply display panels used in Apple’s iPhones. Samsung in December 2022 filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging that BOE had infringed its OLED patents, and then filed another case in October 2023, accusing the Chinese company of stealing trade secrets by poaching employees to access confidential OLED manufacturing processes and technologies.\nIn March 2025, the ITC ruled that BOE had infringed three of Samsung Display’s OLED patents. On the trade secret side, in a preliminary ruling handed down in July, the ITC found that BOE had misappropriated Samsung Display’s OLED trade secrets, and recommended banning the Chinese company from exporting OLED panels to the U.S. for nearly 15 years.\nNow, the companies appear to have asked the ITC to end its investigation. When reached for confirmation, the ITC declined to comment.\nThe settlement comes as major tech companies try to reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturers for components used in their devices. A U.S. export ban would have certainly been terrible news for BOE, which is one of the world’s largest suppliers of LCD and OLED display panels, behind Samsung and LG. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSamsung’s case underscored growing concern over the theft of intellectual property. In July 2024, a South Korean court sentenced a former Samsung Display engineer to six years in prison for leaking OLED technology worth about $24.5 million to China. And last month, South Korean police opened an investigation after two LG Display employees were suspected of leaking proprietary display technologies to a Chinese firm.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nAutonomous electric tractor startup Monarch Tractor warned staff Thursday it may need to lay off more than 100 employees, or possibly even ‘shut down,’ according to a company-wide memo obtained by TechCrunch.\nThe memo comes after Monarch Tractor was already cutting some positions over the last few weeks at its California corporate facilities and remote teams in India and Singapore, according to multiple former employees who spoke with TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity.\nMonarch Tractor was founded in 2018 by a team that included a former top executive at Tesla’s first gigafactory and Carlo Mondavi, a scion of the famous winemaking family. The company raised at least $220 million, including $133 million in 2024, as it pursued a goal of making “driver optional” autonomous tractors that could perform tasks at places like wineries and other fruit farms.\nWhile Monarch Tractor claims to have shipped around 500 of those tractors to date, the company announced a restructuring in late 2024 that was supposed see its tractors expand to other use cases, like pushing feed at dairy farming and maintaining golf courses. CEO Praveen Penmesta also said at the time that Monarch Tractor would focus more on selling software services and licensing the company’s autonomous tech.\nAt least one customer — one of Monarch Tractors’ first dealers — claims the autonomous tech never worked well, if at all, according to a lawsuit first reported by TechCrunch this week. Idaho dealership Burks Tractor claimed Monarch sold it “defective” vehicles that experienced “significant problems” after they arrived in 2024. Primarily, Burks accused Monarch’s tractors of being “unable to operate autonomously.” (Monarch denied the claims in a court filing.)\nMonarch Tractor suggests to employees in the memo on Thursday it is trying to pivot even harder away from making tractors — which may not be surprising, given that the startup lost its contract manufacturer, Foxconn, earlier this year.\n“The new business plan will enable Monarch customers to launch fully commercialized software as a service (SaaS) autonomy and other software offerings direct to consumers, unlocking new revenue streams to OEMs,” the startup’s human resources team wrote. “Unfortunately, the timing for completing the transition to the new business plan puts Monarch at risk of shut down.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMonarch told employees in the memo it may permanently lay off “up to 102 employees.”\n“In 2025, over 70% of Monarch’s revenue came from licensing, and this segment is expected to grow further in 2026” Penmesta told TechCrunch in an email Wednesday. He did not share an overall revenue figure. \n“Investors are showing interest in Monarch’s technology for next-generation smart off-highway equipment, leveraging its cost-efficient hardware and field experience. The WARN notice reflects this shift in our teams and resources toward revenue-generating segments,” he said of the official layoff notice to the state.\nIt’s unclear how many people currently work for Monarch. The startup had around 300 employees in late 2024 when it laid off more than 10% of the company as part of the restructuring. The former employees familiar with the recent cuts could not say exactly how large those layoffs were. \nThrough this year, Monarch Tractor has also lost some top talent, including the co-founder from Tesla, Mark Schwager. \n“We started Monarch with a daring vision: that farming could be electrified, automated, smart and made more profitable — all at once,” Schwager wrote in a LinkedIn post in July, while explaining he would remain on the company’s board. “Monarch is in great position and in great hands for the next leg of its trajectory – making the timing right for this transition.”\nThis story has been updated with a response from Monarch Tractor’s CEO.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nWhen Anthony Sardain began developing Cavela in 2023, an AI startup that helps brands automate supplier sourcing, he did not foresee that new tariffs would drive customers to become increasingly wary of manufacturing products in China.\n“You don’t just walk into Vietnam and build up a supply chain,” Sardain told TechCrunch. “A lot of brands find one supplier, and they hang on for the rest of their life, because they really don’t want to lose it.”\nThat’s especially true for small and midsize companies that lack dedicated, global sourcing departments. Sardain claims that Cavela solves this problem through its AI agents, software tools that perform tasks autonomously and, in this case, act as a personal procurement team. These agents can find potential suppliers in over 40 countries and negotiate product specifications and pricing.\nOn Wednesday, Cavela announced that it raised $6.6 million in seed funding co-led by XYZ Venture Capital and Susa Ventures, with participation from Crossover Capital.\nFinding suppliers and negotiating pricing with them is an inherently arcane, time-consuming process, and, according to Sardain, it was impossible to automate without generative AI.\n“Making products involves a lot of text data, image data, diagrams, sketches, photos. This is the kind of data that didn’t play nice with technology up until AI,” Sardain said.\nThe latest LLM and image models allow brands to upload their complete product information, including specifications, blueprints, and all other details about the item they want produced, directly into Cavela’s AI agent. Based on those particulars, the agent identifies dozens of potential manufacturers and then instantly contacts those factories via WhatsApp, email, or text to understand production capacity and lead times and to collect pricing quotes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSardain claims the entire process is seamless, sparing brands from sending hundreds of messages back and forth. “They log in a couple of days later, and there are quotes in their inbox,” he said. Companies then typically ask a shortlist of potential suppliers to send product samples, which aids in selecting one or more factories for final production.\nCavela estimates that its customers not only substantially reduce the time spent searching for manufacturing partners, but they also save an average of 35% on production costs.\n“If you get 100 quotes, you’re going to, by chance, land on a much lower price, and you’re also going to get a much better supplier in the process,” Sardain said.\nCavela’s customers, including fire-resistant apparel brand Western Welder Outfitting and men’s grooming brand The Longhairs, report that the startup helped them find manufacturers who produce goods at a significantly lower cost — even below pre-tariff pricing.\nSardain, a former data science lead for the data analysis startup Tierra, traces his knowledge of trade and sourcing back three generations within his family. He grew up living across Asian trade centers, including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, and mainland China, which gave him a valuable understanding of how local manufacturers approach their work.\nCavela’s competitors include Alibaba, which connects brands to thousands of manufacturers in China, and Pietra, a brand operations startup that similarly helps businesses source goods with the help of AI.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

The streaming service had also shared the news as part of its Wednesday blog post about new song credits features.\nDeal terms were not disclosed, but Spotify confirmed to TechCrunch the acquisition is for both the WhoSampled team and database. (The company had only a handful of employees, per data on PitchBook and LinkedIn, which both confirm around 10 staffers.)\nLaunched in 2008, London-based WhoSampled offers an extensive database of songs, samples, covers, remixes, artists, and more. According to its website, it’s now tracking more than 1.2 million songs and nearly 622,000 samples. That data is powering Spotify’s latest features, like its upcoming music discovery tool SongDNA, also announced on Wednesday.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nHowever, WhoSampled was known to Spotify for some time, as it had partnered with the streamer back in 2016 to allow its users to access their Spotify playlists and saved tracks in its app.\nIn WhoSampled’s announcement about the acquisition, the company said its stand-alone platform and brand would remain after the deal’s closure, and it expected to offer some user-facing improvements as it becomes part of Spotify’s larger business. For instance, the company said moderation times for submissions would be sped up, the site will be able to remove display ads in the weeks ahead, and its mobile apps will become free downloads with free subscriptions.\n“Through our recent discussions with Spotify, it became clear that we share a strong belief in the power of musical context — and a vision for helping listeners go deeper into the songs they love,” the post penned by the WhoSampled team reads. “Spotify has shown a genuine commitment to our mission, and we couldn’t have found a better home for WhoSampled,” it stated.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWarner Music Group (WMG) has settled a copyright infringement case with AI music startup Udio, the label announced on Wednesday. The two have also entered into a licensing deal for an AI music creation service that’s set to launch in 2026.\nIn its press release, WMG said that the “next-generation music creation, listening, and discovery platform” will be powered by generative AI models trained on licensed and authorized music.\nThe company says the platform will create “new revenue streams for artists and songwriters, while ensuring their work remains protected.”\nThe subscription service will allow users to make remixes, covers, and new songs using the voices of artists and compositions of songwriters who choose to participate. Warner Music Group says the platform will ensure artists and songwriters are credited and compensated.\n“We’re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl in the press release. “This collaboration aligns with our broader efforts to responsibly unlock AI’s potential — fueling new creative and commercial possibilities while continuing to deliver innovative experiences for fans.”\nArtists signed to WMG include Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, and more. \n“This partnership is a crucial step towards realizing a future in which technology amplifies creativity and unlocks new opportunities for artists and songwriters,” said Udio co-founder and CEO Andrew Sanchez in the press release. “Our new platform will enable experiences where fans can create alongside their favorite artists and make extraordinary music in an environment that offers artists control and connection.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe settlement marks a significant shift in the music industry’s approach to AI. Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment sued Udio and rival AI music platform Suno last year for copyright infringement. Both platforms allow users to generate songs using AI-powered text prompts. Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment are also reportedly in talks to license their work to Udio and Suno.\nIn a sign of investor confidence in AI music technology, Suno announced earlier on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe explosive growth of data centers could threaten the stability of the electrical grid this winter, according to an industry overseer.\nAcross North America, demand for electricity this winter is expected to be 2.5% higher than last year for a total of 20 gigawatts, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said in a report released this week. In recent years, winter demand grew by 1% or less. \nData centers are driving a significant chunk of that growth, especially in the mid-Atlantic, U.S. West, and U.S. Southeast, “areas where a lot of data center development is occurring,” Mark Olson, NERC manager of reliability assessments, told E&E News.\nThe report specifically calls out data center expansion in Texas, saying that it is “contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” That stat might be particularly worrisome to Texans, who nearly five years ago suffered through massive power outages during an intense cold snap. \nAt the time, natural gas power plants tripped offline as wellheads froze, slashing the supply of natural gas. Meanwhile, demand for the fossil fuel soared as residential and commercial customers tried to keep homes and offices warm. (The governor publicly blamed wind turbines, despite knowing that they were only a small part of the problem.)\nThis year, NERC said the situation in Texas isn’t likely to be as dire as it was in February 2021, in part because so many batteries have been added to the state’s grid. Those batteries can step in to provide electricity if gas-fired power plants can’t deliver as intended. Plus, they can react more quickly to smaller perturbations than “peaker” power plants, most of which run on natural gas and require minutes to spin up.\nStill, Texas isn’t entirely in the clear. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMost of the batteries deployed in Texas can deliver electricity for a few hours at a time. That’s suitable in circumstances where demand tends to peak for a short time, like in the evening when people return from work. \nBut as NERC notes, data centers tend to draw electricity consistently throughout the day. If a prolonged cold snap hits the state, keeping those batteries sufficiently charged to deliver power to all customers — data centers included — will become more challenging, NERC said. \nIf this winter passes without a significant storm, then NERC anticipates no problems with any region’s electrical grid. But over the last five years, there have been four severe storms, the organization said, which could force grid operators to import electricity, ask large customers to curtail their use, or as a last resort institute rolling blackouts.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

Congress has put tight handcuffs on reorganizations, and plans typically require either congressional approval or the opportunity for congressional review,” Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, told E&E News.\nThe creation of the Office of Fusion was likely spurred to encourage commercialization of the technology. Previously, fusion fell under the Office of Science, which is focused on research rather than commercialization.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Climate\n",

    "body": "\nHi, thanks as always for reading TechCrunch. We want to talk with you quickly about something important. \nA growing number of scammers are impersonating TechCrunch reporters and event leads and reaching out to companies, pretending to be our staff when they absolutely are not. These bad actors are using our name and reputation to try to dupe unsuspecting businesses. It drives us crazy and infuriates us on your behalf. It ebbs and flows. Judging by the increased number of emails we’re receiving, asking, “Does this person really work for you?” it appears to be happening more actively at the moment.\nAnecdotally, this isn’t just happening to us; fraudsters are exploiting the trust that comes with established news brands to get their foot in the door with companies across the media industry.\nHere’s an example of the most common scheme we’ve been tracking: Impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company’s products and requesting an introductory call.\nSharp-eyed recipients sometimes catch discrepancies in email addresses that don’t match our real employees’ credentials (see a list of bogus email addresses below). But more newly, they are hearing from fake reporters who claim to have address conventions that do match our own, making it tricker to recognize a TechCrunch employee from someone else claiming to be one. Indeed, the schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters’ writing styles, and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. Equally troubling, victims who agree to phone interviews tell us the fraudsters use those exchanges to dig for even more proprietary details. A PR rep told Axios that someone posing as a TechCrunch reporter raised suspicions when they shared a scheduling link.\nWhy are they doing this? We don’t know, though a reasonable guess is that these are groups looking for initial access to a network or other sensitive information. In fact, former colleagues at Yahoo say these attempts align with a persistent threat actor they’ve been tracking who has historically engaged in TechCrunch impersonation to facilitate account takeover (ATO) and data theft, targeting cryptocurrency, cloud, and other tech companies using various pretexts.\nAs for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they’re legitimate, please don’t just take their word for it. We’ve made it easy for you to verify.\nStart by checking our TechCrunch staff page. It’s the quickest way to see if the person contacting you actually works here. If the individual’s name isn’t on our roster, you’ve got your answer right there.\nIf you do see someone’s name on our staff page, but our employee’s job description doesn’t square with the request you are receiving (e.g., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business!), a bad actor may be trying to con you.\nIf it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask. You can learn how to reach each writer, editor, sales executive, marketing guru, and events team member in our bios.\nWe know it’s frustrating to have to double-check media inquiries, but these groups are counting on you not taking that extra step. By being vigilant about verification, you’re not just protecting your own company — you’re also helping preserve the trust that legitimate journalists depend on to do their jobs.\nThank you. And for your future reference, here’s a list of some of the TechCrunch impersonating domains that we’ve seen created within the last few months:\nemail-techcrunch[.]comhr-techcrunch[.]cominterview-techcrunch[.]commail-techcrunch[.]commedia-techcrunch[.]comnoreply-tc-techcrunch[.]comnoreply-techcrunch[.]compr-techcrunch[.]comtechcrunch-outreach[.]comtechcrunch-startups[.]infotechcrunch-team[.]comtechcrunch[.]aitechcrunch[.]biz[.]idtechcrunch[.]bztechcrunch[.]cctechcrunch[.]chtechcrunch[.]com[.]pltechcrunch[.]gltechcrunch[.]gstechcrunch[.]idtechcrunch[.]ittechcrunch[.]latechcrunch[.]lttechcrunch[.]net[.]cntechcrunch1[.]com\n",

    "body": "\nSierra, a 21-month-old, San Francisco-based startup that builds customer service AI agents for enterprises, announced on Friday that it reached $100 million in annual revenue run rate (ARR). The company’s rapid growth suggests that businesses across industries are embracing AI agents.\nThe startup’s growth rate surprised even its seasoned co-founders, former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor, who wrote on their blog: “That’s a heck of a lot quicker than we expected.”\nSierra’s customers include tech companies like Deliveroo, Discord, Ramp, Rivian, SoFi, and Tubi, as well as well-established businesses outside of the tech sector, such as ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM.\nTaylor and Bavor said they expected tech companies would feel comfortable experimenting with AI customer service agents, but they were astounded that older businesses also became Sierra’s customers.\nThe company says it can build AI agents that can handle tasks like authenticating patients for healthcare providers, processing returns, ordering replacement credit cards, and helping customers apply for mortgages — essentially automating customer service work that previously required human agents.\nSierra faces competition from startups like Decagon and Intercom, but the company claims to be the leader in the AI customer service category.\nSierra was last valued at $10 billion when it raised a $350 million round led by Greenoaks Capital in September. Other investors in the company include Sequoia, Benchmark, ICONIQ, and Thrive Capital.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBased on its $100 million ARR, Sierra is currently valued at a 100x revenue multiple, a hefty valuation despite its exceptionally fast growth.\nThe startup employs an outcomes-based pricing model, charging customers for completed work rather than charging flat subscription fees.\nTaylor and Bavor met at Google in 2005, where Taylor hired Bavor as an associate product manager.\nA Stanford computer science graduate, Taylor co-created Google Maps before founding FriendFeed, which Facebook acquired. At Facebook, he served as CTO and helped create the iconic “Like” button. He later founded Quip, a Google Docs competitor that Salesforce acquired for $750 million in 2016. \nTaylor went on to serve as Salesforce co-CEO alongside Marc Benioff for over a year. After Taylor left Salesforce in 2023, Bavor — who had spent 18 years at Google leading products like Gmail and Google Drive — invited him to lunch, where they decided to launch Sierra.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch. Prior to joining TechCrunch, she wrote about VC for PitchBook and Venture Capital Journal. Earlier in her career, Marina was a financial analyst and earned a CFA charterholder designation.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Marina by emailing marina.temkin@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at +1 347-683-3909 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "description": "\nElon Musk’s X has begun rolling out a new feature for user profiles that will display information about the account, including where it’s based, how ",
    "body": "\nElon Musk’s X has begun rolling out a new feature for user profiles that will display information about the account, including where it’s based, how many times the account has changed its username, the account’s original join date, and how the user downloaded the X app. The new information is meant to reduce inauthentic engagement on the platform, where bots often pretend to be humans — a problem that could get even harder to police in the age of AI.\nX’s plans for the feature were first announced in October, when X’s head of product Nikita Bier said the company would experiment with displaying this information on profiles, starting with his own account and those of X employees. The idea is that, by exposing these details, users would be able to make a more informed decision about whether they’re interacting with an authentic account or if the account was a bot or bad actor, looking to sow discord or spread misinformation.\nFor instance, if an X account’s bio claimed the user was from a U.S. state, but their account information shows that they’re based overseas, you might suspect they had another agenda. \nLast weekend, Bier responded to a post where a user had asked Elon Musk to require accounts to display information about where they’re based by saying to the user, “Give me 72 hours.”\nIn the days since, more people have seen the “About this account” feature become available on their own profiles.\nTo view your account information on the web or in the X mobile app, you’ll click on the “Joined” date on your profile. From here, you’re taken to a page that shows the date you joined Twitter/X, where your account is based, how many username changes have been done and when the last one was, and how you’re connected to X — like via the U.S. App Store or Google Play, for instance.\n\nBut while some users globally are reporting that the feature has appeared on their own profiles, TechCrunch is not able to access this account information on other people’s profiles as of press time. That could be because X wants to give users time to preview their information for accuracy and adjust their settings before it rolls out more broadly.\nSpecifically, X allows users to adjust whether or not the feature displays their country or if it only displays their geographical region. Originally, the company had said this would be an option in areas where free speech could have penalties, but we’re finding that even U.S. users can choose to set their profile to display either their country or their region/continent. (Country is the default, however.)\nImage Credits:X\nTo make the change, you can access the “About your account” setting under the X app’s “Privacy and Safety” settings. \nOne reverse engineer digging through the app’s code (see below) also found that X appears to be working on an additional feature that would display a warning on your account if you were using a VPN to mask your location. It’s unclear if or when that feature would go live, but if it does, it would flag to others that the user’s “country or region may not be accurate.”\nX did not respond to a request for comment about the rollout. However, Bier joked about all the recent sightings, indicating that people were seeing the feature as it began to roll out.\n\nX will show a warning on your account if you try to use a VPN to hide where your account is from when the upcoming \"About Your Account\" feature launches. \"One of our partners has indicated that you  may be connecting via a proxy—such as a VPN—which may change the country or… pic.twitter.com/vAOus842Br— Aaron (@aaronp613) November 15, 2025\n\nX is not the first social network to provide this level of transparency to users. Instagram has long offered a similar “About this account” feature, for instance.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "\nGoogle has confirmed that hackers have stolen the Salesforce-stored data of more than 200 companies in a large-scale supply chain hack.\nOn Thursday, ",
    "body": "\nGoogle has confirmed that hackers have stolen the Salesforce-stored data of more than 200 companies in a large-scale supply chain hack.\nOn Thursday, Salesforce disclosed a breach of “certain customers’ Salesforce data” — without naming affected companies — that was stolen via apps published by Gainsight, which provides a customer support platform to other companies.  \nIn a statement, Austin Larsen, the principal threat analyst of Google Threat Intelligence Group, said that the company “is aware of more than 200 potentially affected Salesforce instances.”\nAfter Salesforce announced the breach, the notorious and somewhat-nebulous hacking group known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which includes the ShinyHunters gang, claimed responsibility for the hacks in a Telegram channel, which TechCrunch has seen. \nThe hacking group claimed responsibility for hacks affecting Atlassian, CrowdStrike, Docusign, F5, GitLab, Linkedin, Malwarebytes, SonicWall, Thomson Reuters, and Verizon.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about these Salesforce and Gainsight data breaches? Or other data breaches? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nGoogle would not comment on specific victims.\nCrowdStrike’s spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch in a statement that the company is “not affected by the Gainsight issue and all customer data remains secure.” CrowdStrike confirmed to TechCrunch that it terminated a “suspicious insider” for allegedly passing information to hackers.\nTechCrunch reached out to all the companies mentioned by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. \nVerizon spokesperson Kevin Israel said in a statement that “Verizon is aware of the unsubstantiated claim by the threat actor,” without providing evidence for this claim. \nMalwarebytes spokesperson Ashley Stewart told TechCrunch that the company’s security team is “aware” of the Gainsight and Salesforce issues and “actively investigating the matter.”\nA spokesperson for Thomson Reuters said the company is “actively investigating.”\nMichael Adams, the chief information security officer at Docusign told TechCrunch in a statement that “following a comprehensive log analysis and internal investigation, we have no indication of Docusign data compromise at this time.” However, Adams said that, “out of an abundance of caution, we have taken a number of measures including terminating all Gainsight integrations and containing related data flows.”\nAt the time of publishing, none of the other companies responded to requests for comment.\nHackers with the ShinyHunters group told TechCrunch in an online chat that they gained access to Gainsight thanks to their previous hacking campaign that targeted customers of Salesloft, which provides an AI and chatbot-powered marketing platform called Drift. In that earlier case, the hackers stole Drift authentication tokens from those customers, allowing the hackers to break into their linked Salesforce instances and download their contents.\nAt the time, Gainsight confirmed it was among the victims of that hacking campaign. \n“Gainsight was a customer of Salesloft Drift, they were affected and therefore compromised entirely by us,” a spokesperson for the ShinyHunters group told TechCrunch.\nSalesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda told TechCrunch that “as a matter of policy, Salesforce does not comment on specific customer issues.”\nGainsight did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\nOn Thursday, Salesforce said there is “no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” effectively distancing itself from its customers’ data breaches.\nGainsight has been publishing updates about the incident on its incident page. On Friday, the company said that it is now working with Google’s incident response unit Mandiant to help investigate the breach, that the incident in question “originated from the applications’ external connection — not from any issue or vulnerability within the Salesforce platform,” and that “a forensic analysis is continuing as part of a comprehensive and independent review.”\n“Salesforce has temporarily revoked active access tokens for Gainsight-connected apps as a precautionary measure while their investigation into unusual activity continues,” according to Gainsight’s incident page, which said Salesforce is notifying affected customers whose data was stolen. \nIn its Telegram channel, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters said it plans to launch a dedicated website to extort the victims of its latest campaign by next week. This is the group’s modus operandi; in October, the hackers also published a similar extortion website after stealing victims’ Salesforce data in the Salesloft incident. \nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a collective of English-speaking hackers made up of several cybercriminal gangs, including ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$, whose members use social engineering tactics to trick company employees into granting the hackers access to their systems or databases. In the last few years, these groups have claimed several high-profile victims, such as MGM Resorts, Coinbase, DoorDash, and more.\nThis story was updated to include comments from Docusign, Thomson Reuters, and Verizon.\n",

The screenshots, which TechCrunch has seen, show dashboards containing links to company resources, including a user’s Okta dashboard used by employees for accessing internal apps.\nThe hackers claimed in the Telegram channel to have compromised CrowdStrike through a recent breach at Gainsight, a customer relationship management company that helps Salesforce customers track and manage their own customers’ data. The hackers said they used information stolen from Gainsight to break into CrowdStrike.\nBut CrowdStrike says the hackers’ claims are “false,” and says it terminated the insider’s access after the company “determined he shared pictures of his computer screen externally.”\n“Our systems were never compromised and customers remained protected throughout. We have turned the case over to relevant law enforcement agencies,” CrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch.\nSeveral other tech companies were allegedly hacked as part of the same campaign. Gainsight did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\nScattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a collective of hackers made up of several hacking groups, notably ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$. The group’s members use social engineering techniques to trick employees into granting them access to their systems or databases. \nIn October, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claimed to have stolen more than 1 billion records from corporate giants who rely on Salesforce to host their customer data.

    "body": "\nChatGPT is launching group chats globally to all users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans, OpenAI announced on Thursday. The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. \nThe feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions.\nThe company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options.\nUp to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they’ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says. \nImage Credits:OpenAI\nTo start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo.\nIt’s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged.\nOpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move marks OpenAI’s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform. OpenAI says group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a collaborative environment, not just a single-player experience.\n“Over time, we see ChatGPT playing a more active role in real group conversations, helping people plan, create, and take action together,” the company wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \nThursday’s announcement comes less than two weeks after the launch of GPT‑5.1, which featured both Instant and Thinking versions of the model. In September, OpenAI launched a social app called Sora, where users can generate videos of themselves and their friends to share on a TikTok-style algorithmic feed.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1:15 PM PST · November 20, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWhatsApp is getting its own version of a status update feature, similar to Instagram Notes.\nAs on Instagram, the new feature allows users of the Meta-owned messaging app to post a short text update that can be seen by others. In this space, you could let people know what you’re up to or what’s new in your life.\nThe company suggests users could also post something that could serve as a conversation starter, or they could use the space to share why they might not be available to talk at present. \nWhile the addition may be new to many, the company points out in a blog post that this “About” feature, as it’s called, was actually WhatsApp’s first feature. Before WhatsApp focused on secure, private messaging, it allowed people to quickly share short updates like this.\nImage Credits:WhatsApp\nWith the feature’s relaunch, WhatsApp is making users’ “About” status more visible than before. Others will now be able to see your status at the top of their one-on-one chats with friends and users’ profiles. Plus, users can tap on someone’s About status in a chat to reply to it directly. \nLike Instagram Notes, the WhatsApp About status will disappear in a day by default.\nHowever, the company says users can adjust the timer if they want to have it disappear more quickly or stick around longer than 24 hours. Plus, users can decide whether their About status can be seen by just their contacts or if it’s more publicly visible. \nAt launch, the feature is not as robust as Instagram Notes, which also supports short, looping videos and offers integrations that let you share the music you’re streaming. But if the new feature sees wide adoption, those types of improvements could come in time.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhatsApp says the feature is rolling out to users on mobile devices starting this week.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nKalshi, a prediction market that allows people to bet on future events, has raised a massive $1 billion round at a $11 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with the deal. The round comes less than two months after the seven-year-old startup announced its previous fundraise of $300 million at a $5 billion valuation.\nThe latest round is led by the company’s returning investors Sequoia and CapitalG, the person said. Other investors in Kalshi include Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, Anthos Capital, and Neo.\nKalshi and Sequoia declined to comment. CapitalG didn’t respond to our request for comment.\nKalshi’s main rival, Polymarket, was reportedly in talks last month to raise another funding round at a $12 billion to $15 billion valuation, mere weeks after closing a $1 billion round at an $8 billion pre-money valuation, Bloomberg reported.\nKalshi and Polymarket surged in popularity last year after both prediction markets allowed people to bet on the outcome of the presidential election. These betting sites became even more prominent after they correctly predicted the results of New York City’s mayoral election earlier this month.\nFor the Mamdani versus Cuomo race, Kalshi purchased ad space on New York subway cars, running live screens that displayed the up-to-the-minute odds of each candidate winning, a marketing campaign that undoubtedly raised the company’s brand awareness among New Yorkers.\nKalshi allows people in over 140 countries to bet on various future events, ranging from who Time magazine will name Person of the Year for 2025 and the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film Wicked, to outcomes further in the future, like the next U.S. presidential election winner.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn mid-October, the company reached $50 billion in annualized trading volume, marking a more than a thousandfold increase from the approximately $300 million volume posted last year,  the New York Times reported.\nKalshi was co-founded by two former hedge fund traders, Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara. The duo met as undergraduate students at MIT while studying computer science and mathematics.\nPrediction markets have historically been controversial and subject to legal challenges because they operate in the gray area between financial instruments and traditional gambling.\nWhile Kalshi has secured the right for Americans to use its platform after successfully suing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) last year, the company is currently engaged in legal disputes with numerous state regulators who claim its activities are illegal gambling.\nPolymarket has been barred from serving U.S. residents since 2022, following a settlement with the CFTC. In July, the company acquired a derivatives exchange and a clearinghouse. The move helped Polymarket receive the right to reenter the U.S. market. In September, the company’s CEO and founder, Shayne Coplan, said on X: “Polymarket has been given the green light to go live in the USA by the CFTC.”\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch. Prior to joining TechCrunch, she wrote about VC for PitchBook and Venture Capital Journal.

    "body": "\nA new wave of AI-powered gadgets on the market aims to integrate artificial intelligence into our daily lives like never before.\nSome of these AI wearables — including necklaces, rings, and wristbands, as well as portable devices — serve as productivity tools, while others claim to act as friendly companions listening to your everyday thoughts. Even OpenAI is working on a compact AI companion device.\nBelow, we’ve rounded up some of the most notable devices currently available.\nBee\nImage Credits:Bee AI\nBee is an affordable pendant priced at $49.99 that can either be clipped to your clothing or worn like a fitness band. This device records everything it hears and learns your routines and preferences to create reminders and notes for you. It even features a mute button for those times you want some privacy. \nThe companion app (currently available only on iOS) is included with a $19 monthly subscription. The app allows you to interact with Bee directly and ask it questions. You can also get key takeaways from your day and chronological transcripts of your conversations. \nAmazon recently acquired the wearables startup in July.\nFriend\nImage Credits:Friend\nFriend is one of the most hyped entrants in the “personal AI” device market.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis $129 white pendant hangs around your neck and functions as an emotional support companion. It recognizes your tone and mood, allowing you to chat with it as if it were a friend. It connects to your phone via Bluetooth and constantly listens, ready to respond or send you proactive messages, like wishing you good luck before an interview. \nHowever, it has also faced criticism, including a recent backlash against its subway ad campaign in NYC. People vandalized the ads, writing messages like “surveillance capitalism.”\nLimitless \nImage Credits:Limitless\nFormerly known as Rewind, Limitless is another conversation-recording pendant priced at $99. \nThis device continuously listens, transcribing meetings, calls, and conversations (with consent) into searchable and summarized knowledge. It’s ideal for professionals, especially journalists, looking to recall important discussions. \nThe companion app comes with 10 hours of AI features per month — such as transcription and summaries — with the option to unlock unlimited features for $29 per month.\nOmi\nImage Credits:Omi\nPriced at $89, this device can answer your questions, summarize your conversations, create to-do lists, and help schedule meetings. Additionally, Omi is constantly listening and running your conversations through ChatGPT, allowing it to remember the context about you and offer personalized advice.\nOmi can be worn as a necklace, but another notable aspect is that it can be attached to the side of your head with medical tape and can detect when you’re speaking to it.\nPlaud’s NotePin\nImage Credits:Plaud\nAt $159, Plaud’s NotePin is one of the pricier options on this list; however, its built-in AI transcription and summarization features make it a valuable tool for lawyers, journalists, and students attending meetings or lectures. \nThe tiny wearable voice recorder can be worn on your wrist or attached magnetically to your clothing. The recordings are saved in real time on your phone, eliminating the hassle of manual note-taking. The device includes 300 free monthly transcription minutes, but with the $8.33 per month Pro plan, you upgrade your transcription time to 1,200 minutes.\nThis year, the company is gearing up to launch a $179 ultra-thin note-taking device called the Plaud Note Pro, which is now available for preorder.\nRabbit R1\nImage Credits:Rabbit\nRabbit R1 is another AI gadget that has quickly become a topic of interest in the tech world, despite facing some challenges during its initial launch. This small, retro-styled handheld device features a touchscreen and rotating camera, at a price point of $199.\nThe device is designed to be phone-adjacent, allowing you to perform tasks such as booking flights, ordering meals, and controlling apps without needing to pull out your phone each time. Following a crucial software update that rectified previous performance issues, the Rabbit R1 now boasts expanded AI features. For instance, it introduces “Creations,” a feature that allows you to build your own tools and even games.\n",

    "body": "\nIn the early days of social media, posting a rant about the latest episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” on Myspace felt like the ultimate Thursday night activity. And discovering a Facebook group called “Team Jacob Forever” was one of the best finds.\nNowadays, finding that perfect niche community can seem impossible, but a new social app called Phictly aims to change that.\nAvailable on iOS and Android devices, the app lets users form clubs centered on their favorite books, TV shows, and movies, creating niche communities where people can discuss their specific interests without judgment.\nFor instance, users can dive into clubs for fantasy reads and gossip about Violet and Xaden in Rebecca Yarros’ “The Fourth Wing,” or reminisce about the early days of “Grey’s Anatomy.”\nImage Credits:Phictly\nThe app was created by Nyleena Aiken after she started a book club with her sisters and struggled to find books that interested everyone. She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time.\n“Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone’s fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.”\nKey features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. For example, those who enjoy speed reading or binge-watching can create or join clubs that last just a day or two, while those who prefer a slower pace can participate in clubs lasting up to 30 days.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother notable feature allows users to post spoilers while hiding them until others reach that part of the story. Each spoiler is initially blurred, giving users the choice of when to reveal it, which helps everyone stay on the same page. Phictly also includes a “Talk Points” feature, allowing users to set check-in dates to discuss specific episodes or chapters and give everyone the opportunity to join the conversation.\nSimilar to Goodreads, users can also track what they are currently reading or watching, log titles, and set personal goals for their reading or viewing habits.\nFuture updates will introduce a matching system that pairs users based on shared interests, favorite genres, and common TV shows and books. The app will eventually expand to include clubs focused on video games.\nPhictly is free to download but may soon offer a premium subscription with additional features, such as the ability to create a private profile.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

This season is highlighting lessons learned from the world of go-to-market strategies. Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen sat down with Luna co-founder Jas Schembri-Stothart and Untapped Solutions founder Andre Peart for their unique perspectives on reaching niche customer segments following their own candidacy during the 2024 Startup Battlefield competition.\nIf our first episode, with Deon Nicholas, co-founder of Forethought AI, we explored what it takes to create a company with a customer-first approach. And in our second episode, we’re diving into guerrilla tactics and experiments that worked in reaching two very different target audiences: teenage girls and formerly incarcerated workers. \n\n\n\nFor Luna, which is a well-being app for girls, the difficulty in reaching that audience was clear: Neither co-founders were teenage girls anymore. To get the feedback and insights they needed, Schembri-Stothart and her team toured U.K. schools, “basically getting grilled” by students and getting harsh but clear feedback and even interest in helping build their app. They in turn became the beginning of a swarm of brand ambassadors, who were both “behind the scenes queens” working on the app itself and creators making social content to promote the app, becoming a go-to-market team of their own and setting up activations at major events like Taylor Swift concerts, where they knew their target audience would be gathered en masse.\nUntapped Solutions had a different challenge. As the “LinkedIn for the formerly incarcerated,” Peart had to find a way to make sure that the platform could actually be deployed into the many places where currently or formerly incarcerated individuals could access it in order to help them attain employment. And to do that, in a space largely untouched by tech solutions, they hit the speaking circuit hard, and even began their own National Reentry Coalition and their own event, which kicked off this April. That, alongside partnerships with agencies working with the 600,000 people released from prison annually, has led to an increasing ubiquity. \n“We’re in almost every prison system,” Peart said. “So if you’re on a tablet, you already have Untapped.” \nFor the full episode’s worth of insights, check out the video above, or listen and subscribe to Build Mode wherever you like getting your favorite podcasts.

    "body": "\nSalesforce said on Wednesday that it’s investigating a breach of “certain customers’ Salesforce data” that was compromised through apps published by Gainsight, a company that sells a platform for other companies to manage their customers. \nIn a notice published late Wednesday, Salesforce said the hacks involve “Gainsight-published applications connected to Salesforce, which are installed and managed directly by customers.” \nSalesforce said that there is “no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” and that the activity appears related to Gainsight’s “external connection to Salesforce.”\nWhen reached for comment, Salesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda referred TechCrunch to the company’s page dedicated to the incident. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about these Salesforce and Gainsight data breaches? Or other data breaches? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email. You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\t\t\nAs of this writing, Gainsight said in a status page that it is investigating a “Salesforce connection issue,” without making any reference to a potential breach. “Our internal investigation is ongoing,” Gainsight wrote.\nA spokesperson for Gainsight did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nOn its website, Gainsight touts several corporate customers, including Airtable, Notion, GitLab, and others. When reached by email, GitLab spokesperson Emily James told TechCrunch that GitLab’s “security team is investigating and we’ll get back to you when we have more to share.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe prolific hacking group ShinyHunters told cybersecurity news website DataBreaches.net that it was behind the breach, adding that if Salesforce doesn’t negotiate with them, they will create a new website to advertise the stolen data — a common extortion tactic by financially-motivated cybercriminals. \n“The next [data leak site] will contain the data of the Salesloft and GainSight campaigns,” the hackers told DataBreaches.net. The hackers claim to have stolen data from close to a thousand companies.\nThis data breach appears similar to an August breach at AI marketing chatbot maker Salesloft, which allowed the hackers to break into a number of their customers’ connected Salesforce instances to steal sensitive data, such as access tokens for other services. Among the victims included insurance giant Allianz Life, Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, fashion conglomerate Kering, Proofpoint, the airline Qantas, carmaker Stellantis, credit bureau TransUnion, the employee management platform Workday, and others. \nIn the case of the Salesloft breaches, the hacking group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which apparently includes the ShinyHunters gang, claimed responsibility. \nLast month, the hackers launched a dedicated website to extort the victims of the breaches, where they threatened to release a billion records. \nAt the time, Gainsight confirmed it was among the victims of the Salesloft-linked breaches, but it’s unclear if this new wave of hacks originated from its earlier compromise.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSilicon Valley folks tend to write off the startup market across the pond as too small or not hungry enough, but that sentiment could not be more different from how Europeans view their potential.\nHelsinki’s annual Slush conference this year showed a venture market that feels like it is on the brink of transformation, one that’s ready for its first trillion-dollar startup.\nFounders, venture investors and government officials alike acknowledged the hurdles that have traditionally held Europe back from reaching its true scale and potential. For many years, European founders moved to the U.S. to start their companies or exited earlier than they needed to since they were operating in a market that lacked local customers and cash.\nFirms including OMERs Ventures and Coatue made concerted efforts to enter Europe by opening offices in London after the pandemic, but have since shuttered those shops. OMERs, for example, let much of its European team go. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley firms have claimed in the last few years that to focus on innovation, startups and investors need to retreat to San Francisco.\nLargely, people think the kinks have been worked out: Multiple venture investors told TechCrunch at Slush that the notion of the market being undercapitalized, or that deeper U.S. pockets aren’t interested, is overblown.\nOne investor specifically said there is absolutely more U.S. capital in the European market now than five years ago. Plus, some headlines draw more attention than others: When OMERs Ventures announced its retreat, IVP and Andreessen Horowitz both said they were opening offices in London. (Andreessen later closed its office, too, alas.)\nThough the lure to head to the U.S. remains strong, European companies are also starting to find success in resisting pressure from U.S. investors to move to the Valley to build their companies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVibe-coding platform Lovable’s co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said during Slush that he credits the company’s rapid growth — $200 million in annual recurring revenue in only a year since launch — to the fact that the startup stayed put in Europe, instead opting to recruiting veteran Silicon Valley talent to Stockholm.\nTaavet Hinrikus, a partner at Plural who was the first hire at Estonia-founded Skype, said at Slush that the European market is about a decade behind the U.S., but startups have gone fully mainstream now in a way they hadn’t 10 years ago.\nAnother VC added that when he originally began investing in startups decades ago, startups and their revenue didn’t account for a noticeable portion of the region’s GDP or revenue, but now things have changed fundamentally, and the share startups hold will continue to grow.\nThe growing number of European success stories like Spotify and Klarna have also buffed up the region’s profile, giving founders the confidence to not exit early. They’ve also given startup employees the skills and financial security to strike out on their own.\nRegulators aren’t sitting by, either, and lately have been trying to make it easier for startups to find success. The EU is moving toward regulation changes that would allow startups to register in all EU countries at once, as opposed to just their native country, next year. Such steps present their own challenges, but the move is a step forward.\nHurdles remain, of course. European enterprises remain less likely than their American counterparts to experiment and implement startup tech. But the vibe at Slush could not be more optimistic. Europe looks ready to come into its own, even if it took a little longer to get there.\nAs Slush’s welcome banner put it: “Still doubting Europe? Go to Hel.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nJust weeks before Australia’s social media ban for users under 16 takes effect, the country’s watchdog, eSafety, has added Twitch to the list of banned platforms.\nPinterest, however, was excluded, in line with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) rules.\nTwitch will no longer allow Australians under 16 to create accounts starting December 10, a Twitch spokesperson told TechCrunch. Existing accounts for users under 16 will be deactivated on January 9. Globally, Twitch is open to users 13 and older, and anyone under the legal age of adulthood in their region must have a parent or guardian involved, the spokesperson said.\nPinterest did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAustralia’s eSafety stated that Twitch is categorized as an “age-restricted social media platform” because the service is built around online social interaction and engagement features like livestreaming. Pinterest, on the other hand, is mainly used for collecting images and ideas, so it isn’t included in the age-restricted rules.\nAustralia has said its underage social media ban, which will go into effect on December 10, will apply to Meta‘s Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X, YouTube (except YouTube Kids and Google Classroom), Reddit, and the local streaming service, Kick. These platforms will be required to block account access for users under 16, according to a statement by the internet regulator. \nAbout a year ago, Australia passed a law banning social media use for children under 16. At the time, major tech companies like Google and Meta called on the government to delay enforcement until the country finished its age-verification trial. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe regulator provides a self-assessment tool to help platforms determine if they must follow the SMMA rules. \nOther countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., are taking similar steps to control who sees what content on the internet, though their approaches differ. Twenty-four U.S. states have so far enacted age-verification laws as of August 2025. Utah became the first to require app stores to verify users’ ages and obtain parental consent for minors downloading apps.\nThe U.K.’s Online Safety Act came into effect in July, mandating social media and other online platforms to block children’s access to harmful content or face huge fines. The U.K. requires strong age checks for high-risk content, like self-harm and eating disorder content, to protect users under 18.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

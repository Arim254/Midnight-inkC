The video-sharing platform appears to have recognized this issue and is taking steps to address it with its new experimental feature, “Your Custom Feed.” \nThe new test aims to tackle the frustration users often face with algorithm-driven recommendations that sometimes miss the mark. Historically, YouTube’s algorithm has been reported to frequently misjudge user intentions. For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want.\nFor those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests. \nInstead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future.\nWhile it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer. This could be a more effective alternative to clicking on videos one by one and using the “Not interested” or “Don’t recommend channel” options.\nYouTube isn’t the only platform launching a customized feed. Threads was recently seen testing an algorithm-configuration feature. X is also working on a feature that would allow users to tag its AI chatbot, Grok, to adjust their feed.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

    "body": "\nStartup Fleet Space announced yesterday that it used its satellite-powered AI system to expand the scope of an already massive lithium deposit in Quebec.\nFinding a mineral resource isn’t easy. Only about three in 1,000 potential deposits end up becoming commercially viable, and it can take years to prove it by drilling core samples. Fleet Space says its approach can help target drilling operations, reducing decision time from weeks to days.\nThe startup currently has a small constellation of satellites in orbit that use a range of sensors, including electromagnetic and gravity-sensing, to map the subsurface. Fleet Space then feeds that data into its software platform, which can provide a new location for drilling in as little as 48 hours.\nThe Cisco project is currently estimating that it could produce up to 329 million metric tons of lithium oxide. Fleet Space said the results of lithium deposits might extend beyond Cisco’s current boundaries, saying the region has “district-scale potential.”\n",

The move will mark the streaming service’s first price rise in the U.S. since July 2024. The company recently raised prices in several other countries, including the U.K., Switzerland, and Australia.\nA Spotify subscription currently costs $11.99 a month in the U.S. When the service first launched in the country 14 years ago, it cost $9.99 per month.\nThe report says JPMorgan analysts have estimated that a $1-per-month price increase in the U.S. could increase Spotify’s annual revenue by about $500 million.\nAdditionally, major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix.\nThe report comes a few weeks after Spotify announced that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO. The company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs: Gustav Söderström, the current co-president and chief product and technology officer at Spotify, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

The organization handles the licensing and registration of vehicles in the Netherlands and is seen as a critical step for Tesla to get approval for — and eventually roll out — FSD to consumers across Europe.\n“RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026. Please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible,” Tesla wrote in the post.\nIt seems RDW isn’t quite in line with Tesla. The Dutch regulator clarified in a statement on their website that Tesla plans to demonstrate FSD Supervised in February. Bloomberg was first to report on RDW’s statement.\n“RDW and Tesla know what efforts need to be made to make a decision on this in February. Whether the schedule will be met remains to be seen in the coming period. For the RDW, (traffic) safety is paramount,” the statement reads.\nTesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $8,000 fee, owners can upgrade to FSD Supervised, which provides additional automated driving features, including steering and lane changes on highways and surface streets. FSD is not self-driving and requires the driver to remain engaged with their hands on the wheel at all times.\nFSD is available in Australia, Canada, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, and the United States.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLatest in Transportation\n",

After that date, users on WhatsApp won’t be able to chat with the AI unless they switch to Microsoft’s own Copilot mobile apps or use the chatbot via the web.\nThe company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month.\nAt the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, Perplexity, and others.\nOpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January.\nUnfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated. Microsoft recommends users who need to retain their conversations for future reference export them using WhatsApp’s built-in tools before the January 15 deadline.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

OpenAI announced on Tuesday it is updating the user interface to its popular AI chatbot so users can access ChatGPT Voice right inside their chat, instead of having to switch to a separate mode.\nThat means you’ll be able to converse with the chatbot and view its responses, including things like shared images, as you talk. Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video, as well as an X to return to the default text-based mode. \nDuring these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen. That could be annoying if you missed a response, as you’d have to leave the separate voice mode to see the response as text.\n\nYou can now use ChatGPT Voice right inside chat—no separate mode needed.You can talk, watch answers appear, review earlier messages, and see visuals like images or maps in real time.Rolling out to all users on mobile and web. Just update your app. pic.twitter.com/emXjNpn45w— OpenAI (@OpenAI) November 25, 2025\n\nNow, the company says you can talk and watch your answers appear as ChatGPT responds to your questions. You can also review your earlier messages and view visuals during your conversations, like images or maps, in real time.\nThe change will make it more natural to interact with the AI chatbot, as you can more easily move between speech and text in the same conversation; however, you’ll still need to tap “end” to stop the voice conversation when you’re ready to switch back to text. \nThis revamped voice mode is the new default and is rolling out now to all users across web and mobile apps. \nFor those who prefer the separate voice mode, OpenAI says they can still revert to the original experience under “Voice Mode” in “Settings.” Here, they’ll see a new option to turn on “Separate mode.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

The feature had a tenuous rollout — Martin Luther King Jr.’s estate had to get involved, to give you an idea of what went on — but now it faces a new challenge. \nApparently, Cameo — the app where you buy custom video messages from celebrities — can claim the trademark of the word “cameo.”\nU.S. District Judge Eumi K. Lee imposed a temporary restraining order that blocks OpenAI from using the word “cameo,” as well as any similar-sounding words or phrases, on Sora.\nThe temporary restraining order issued on November 21, 2025 is set to expire on December 22, 2025, at 5:00 p.m. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at 11:00 a.m.\nAs of Monday afternoon, the Sora app still uses the “cameo” language, however. \n “We are gratified by the court’s decision, which recognizes the need to protect consumers from the confusion that OpenAI has created by using the Cameo trademark,” Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. “While the court’s order is temporary, we hope that OpenAI will agree to stop using our mark permanently to avoid any further harm to the public or Cameo.”\nOpenAI disagrees with the assertion that the company can claim exclusive ownership over the word “cameo,” the company told CNBC.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\nChinese autonomous vehicle technology company Pony.ai said Tuesday it plans to triple the size of its robotaxi fleet by the end of next year as its pace of growth — and aspirations — accelerates. \nThe company, which has about 961 robotaxis in the fleet today, announced the goal during its third-quarter earnings. Pony.ai is targeting a 1,000-robotaxi vehicle fleet by the end of this year. Its goal is to “surpass” 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026, the company said in its third-quarter earnings report.\nPony.ai, which is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Exchange and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, has spent the year ramping up its commercial operations. Today, the company offers commercial robotaxi services — meaning it charges for these rides — in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.\nThe company also has aspirations to scale beyond the borders of China. Pony.ai is pushing into eight countries, including Qatar and Singapore, through partnerships with local companies as well as ride-hailing companies Bolt and Uber.\nThe ramp-up in robotaxi services has had the dual effect of increasing revenue along with costs. The company reported revenue of $25.4 million in the third quarter, a 72% increase from the $14.8 million it generated in the same year-ago period.\nShares of Pony.ai popped on the Nasdaq more than 6% following its earnings report. \nPony.ai said the rise in revenue was driven by robotaxi services and licensing its technology to other companies. The Guangzhou, China-based company brought in $6.7 million in revenue from robotaxi services, $10.2 million from its self-driving trucks called robotrucks, and $8.6 million in licensing and application fees. \nThe company’s expenses are still outpacing revenue. Pony.ai reported a net loss of $61.6 million in the third quarter, a 46% increase since the same period in 2024. \nPony.ai had $587.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, an amount that has decreased from $747.7 million in the second quarter of the year. Pony.ai said half of that decrease was from a one-off cash outflow that included investment into its joint venture with Toyota to support the production and deployment of its Gen-7 vehicle. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nCharacter.AI announced on Tuesday that it’s launching “Stories,” a new format that allows users to create interactive fiction that features their favorite characters. The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week.\nThe change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all.\n“Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.”\nInteractive fiction has seen a surge in popularity over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense. But it may not be enough to satiate users who have become overly dependent on the chatbots — which is all the more reason why Character.AI’s decision to limit chatbot access was warranted.\nOn the Character.AI subreddit, reactions are mixed. According to their comments, some teens say that while they’re disappointed, they think it’s ultimately the right move.\n“I’m so mad about the ban but also so happy because now I can do other things and my addiction might be over finally,” one user who identified themselves as a teenager wrote.\nAnother said, “as someone who is under 18 this is just disappointing. but also rightfully so bc people over here my age get addicted to this.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt remains to be seen how teens will use the Stories feature, but the format is less psychologically dubious than roleplaying with chatbots. Unlike Stories, chatbots directly interact with users in open-ended conversations and can send unprompted messages even when users aren’t actively using the app. \nCharacter.AI’s decision to age-gate chatbot access comes at a time when California recently became the first state to regulate AI companions. Meanwhile, Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have introduced a national bill that would ban AI companions for minors altogether.\n“I really hope us leading the way sets a standard in the industry that for under 18s, open-ended chats are probably not the path or the product to offer,” Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand told TechCrunch last month.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nWarner Music Group (WMG) announced on Tuesday that it has reached a deal with Suno, settling its copyright lawsuit against the AI music startup. WMG said in a press release that the deal with Suno will “open new frontiers in music creation, interaction, and discovery, while both compensating and protecting artists, songwriters, and the wider creative community.”\nWMG also announced that it has sold Songkick, a live music and concert-discovery platform, to Suno for an undisclosed amount. WMG had acquired Songkick’s app and brand in 2017, while Live Nation later acquired Songkick’s ticketing business.\nWMG says Songkick will continue as a fan destination under Suno.  \nAs a result of WMG’s partnership, Suno will launch more advanced and licensed models that will replace its current ones next year. Downloading audio from the service will require a paid account, while users on the free tier will be limited to playing and sharing songs made on the platform.\nWMG’s artists and songwriters will also have full control over whether and how their names, images, likenesses, voices, and compositions are used in new AI-generated music.\nArtists signed to WMG include Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, and more.\n“This landmark pact with Suno is a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl in the press release. “With Suno rapidly scaling, both in users and monetization, we’ve seized this opportunity to shape models that expand revenue and deliver new fan experiences.”\nThe news comes a week after WMG settled its copyright lawsuit with AI music startup Udio and entered into a licensing deal for an AI music creation service that’s set to launch in 2026. \nWMG’s settlements with Suno and Udio mark a significant shift in the music industry’s approach to AI. Last year, Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment sued Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. While WMG has settled its lawsuits with Suno and Udio, Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment are also reportedly in talks to license their work to Udio and Suno and settle their lawsuits against the startups. \nIn a sign of investor confidence in AI music technology, Suno announced last week that it raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nItalian company Bending Spoons flew largely under the radar — until last month. In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the acquisition of AOL and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to $11 billion, up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024.\nBending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses.\nAndrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant.\n“Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch.  \nDumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, Tiny, SaaS.group, Arising Ventures, and Calm Capital, according to Dumont.\n“Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said.\nIn 2023, Curious raised $16 million in dedicated capital for buying software companies that have stalled and can no longer secure follow-on investment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSince then, the firm has bought five businesses, including UserVoice, a 17-year-old startup that raised $9 million in VC funding from Betaworks and SV Angel.\n“It’s a great business, but the cap table wasn’t aligned with keeping it. These funds get old, and these companies just sit there,” Dumont said. “We provide liquidity and also reset these companies for profitability.”\nAlthough Dumont didn’t disclose how much he paid for UserVoice, he said that stagnant companies sell for a fraction of the valuation commanded by healthy SaaS startups, which typically sell for 4x annual revenue or more. Based on our conversation, we estimate that “venture zombies” sometimes sell for as low as 1x yearly revenue.\nBy implementing cost-cutting and price increases, Curious can push these businesses to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins almost immediately. “If you have a million-dollar business, you’re kicking off $300,000 in earnings,” he offered as an example. \nThey achieve the turnarounds because, unlike the stand-alone companies, they can centralize functions like sales, marketing, finance, and other admin roles, across all of their portfolio companies. “We’re not trying to sell the businesses we acquire and don’t need VC-scale exits, so we can balance growth and profitability more sustainably,” Dumont said.\nWhen asked why VCs don’t urge their startups to be profitable like Curious does, Dumont responded by saying: “Investors don’t care about earnings; they only care about growth. Without it, there’s no VC-scale exit, so there’s no incentive to operate with that level of profitability.”\nThe cash generated from Curious’ companies is then used to buy other startups, Dumont said.  \nThe firm plans to buy 50 to 75 startups like UserVoice over the next five years, and Dumont is certain he won’t have a shortage of targets to choose from. Curious is focused on acquiring startups that generate $1 million to $5 million in recurring revenue annually, a segment of the software market that, according to Dumont, private equity shops and secondary investors have historically ignored.\n“We’ve been doing this for a little under two years now, and we’ve probably looked at at least 500 companies, and we bought five,” Dumont said.\nWhile Bending Spoons’ big valuation hike may validate the “venture zombie” acquisition model, Dumont doesn’t expect a lot of new competition. Turning profits out of stagnation isn’t easy. “It’s a ton of work,” he said.\n",

    "body": "\nIf you’re a fan of the punk scene from the early 2000s, you may recognize Nick Gross, the drummer for the band Goldfinger. \nNow he’s empowering young people to pursue their passions through his career exploration platform, Find Your Grind. The platform highlights alternative professions not usually emphasized in schools, including being a pop-punk band member, content creator, social media manager, and even a professional esports player.\nThe company announced on Tuesday a $5 million Series A funding round, bringing its total funding to $8 million. The round was led by Echo Investment Capital, with support from Gross’ investment firm, Gross Labs. The investment will help expand the company’s “career readiness” programs across the U.S.\nGross began his music career at 17 when his high school band, Open Air Stereo, gained significant exposure after being featured on MTV’s hit reality series “Laguna Beach.” Inspired by his experience, Gross came up with the idea for Find Your Grind after bringing students into his studio and seeing firsthand the challenges they face when exploring career options, often due to a lack of exposure in traditional schools.\n“Young people are entering a rapidly changing world of work,” Gross told TechCrunch. “As students prepare to leave school and enter into their professional careers, many are doing so without a strong sense of who they are, what they want, or how to navigate their next steps after school. Find Your Grind gives them the tools to explore not just what careers are out there, but what paths suit their strengths, interests, and visions for what they want their futures to look like,” he said. \nImage Credits:Find Your Grind\nConventional career guidance often focuses on salaries and promotions, but this can feel disconnected from the rapidly evolving job market that the new generation is entering. Many of these students no longer aspire to become doctors, engineers, or lawyers. In fact, the World Economic Forum predicts that approximately 92 million jobs won’t exist in 2030.\nTraditional career exploration also tends to overlook the emotional aspect of choosing a career that aligns with a person’s values and desired lifestyle. \nThe startup’s platform focuses on four key competencies: self-awareness, career awareness, social awareness, and action awareness. It also features a Lifestyle Assessment that helps students identify three lifestyle paths based on their preferences. For example, they might discover that they align with the roles of an entertainer, a creator, or a humanitarian. Students then get a tailored next-step plan for what to do after graduation.\nAdditionally, students can access videos and interactive lessons, and a group of mentors provides practical advice about their own career beginnings and the steps they took to achieve success. Notable mentors include Tony Hawk, Tony Hoffman, and will.i.am, among others.  \nThere’s also an AI-powered “Reflective Coach” that provides personalized feedback and encourages students to dive deeper into their answers for better insights.\nImage Credits:Find Your Grind\nFind Your Grind also runs workforce development initiatives, such as lifestyle fairs, that give students real-world experience. The company is rolling out its first program in Oklahoma City, working with local schools and training centers to help students discover job opportunities in their hometowns that align with their lifestyle preferences. \nThe company plans to launch more programs in additional cities in the future.\nSo far, Find Your Grind has helped 100,000 students, according to the company. Gross told us he hopes that “over a million students” join the platform to be “more future-ready.”\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nWith holiday shopping on the horizon, OpenAI and Perplexity both announced AI shopping features this week, which integrate into their existing chatbots to help users research potential purchases.\nThe tools are markedly similar to one another. OpenAI suggests that users could ask ChatGPT for help finding a “new laptop suitable for gaming under $1000 with a screen that’s over 15 inches,” or they can share photos of a high-end garment and ask for something similar at a lower price point.\nPerplexity, meanwhile, is playing up how its chatbot’s memory can augment shopping-related searches for its users, suggesting that someone could ask for recommendations tailored to what the chatbot already knows about them, like where they live or what they do for work.\nAdobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season, which could be a boon for AI shopping startups like Phia, Cherry, or Deft (rebranded as Onton) — but with OpenAI and Perplexity pushing further into AI shopping experiences, are these startups in danger?\nZach Hudson, CEO of the interior design shopping tool Onton, thinks that AI shopping startups with a specialized niche will still provide a better experience to users than general-purpose tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity.\n“Any model or knowledge graph is only as good as its data sources,” Hudson told TechCrunch. “Right now, ChatGPT and LLM-based tools like Perplexity piggyback off existing search indexes like Bing or Google. That makes them really only as good as the first few results that come back from those indexes.”\nDaydream CEO and longtime e-commerce executive Julie Bornstein agrees — she remarked to TechCrunch over the summer that she always viewed search as “the forgotten child” of the fashion industry, since it never worked particularly well.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Fashion … is uniquely nuanced and emotional — finding a dress you love is not the same as finding a television,” Bornstein told TechCrunch on Tuesday. “That level of understanding for fashion shopping comes from domain-specific data and merchandising logic that grasps silhouettes, fabrics, occasions, and how people build outfits over time.”\nAI shopping startups develop their own datasets so that their tools are trained on higher-quality data — something that’s easier to achieve when you’re attempting to catalog fashion or furniture, rather than the sum of all human knowledge.\nIn Hudson’s case, Onton developed a data pipeline to catalog hundreds of thousands of interior design products in a cleaner manner, helping to train its internal models with better data. But if AI shopping startups don’t pursue that level of specialization, Hudson thinks they’re bound to be overshadowed.\n“If you’re using only off-the-shelf LLMs and a conversational interface, it’s very hard to see how a startup can compete with the larger companies,” Hudson said.\nThe advantage for OpenAI and Perplexity, however, is that their customers are already using their tools — plus, their large presence lets them ink deals with major retailers from the get-go. While Daydream and Phia redirect customers to retailers’ websites to complete their purchases — sometimes earning affiliate revenue — OpenAI and Perplexity have partnerships with Shopify and PayPal, respectively, allowing users to check out within the conversational interface.\nThese companies, which depend on mammoth amounts of expensive compute power to operate, are still trying to figure out a path to profitability. If they take inspiration from Google and Amazon, then it makes sense to look toward e-commerce as an option — retailers could pay them to advertise their products within search results. \nBut eventually, that could just exacerbate the existing issues that customers have with search.\n“Vertical models — whether in fashion, travel, or home goods — will outperform because they’re tuned to real consumer decision-making,” Bornstein said.\nAdditional reporting by Ivan Mehta.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nSpeechify has largely been a tool that helps you listen to articles, PDFs, and documents. The company is now adding voice detection features to its Chrome extension, including voice typing and a voice assistant that answers your questions.\nIn the last 12 months, there has been a proliferation of voice detection tools, thanks to overall quality improvement in speech recognition models. Speechify is hitching its wagon to this train and launching its own dictation tool with support for English. Just like other dictation tools, Speechify’s voice typing corrects errors and removes filler words.\nIn my short test of just more than a day, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement in Speechify’s tool. For instance, the tools work fine with Gmail and Google Docs, but on sites like WordPress, I have had difficulty in triggering the voice dictation and having it work well. The company said that it is adding optimization for popular sites gradually.\nImage Credits:Speechify\nIn terms of accuracy, the word error rate was higher than some other tools like Wispr Flow, Willow, and Monologue. Speechify noted that its model learns faster as you use it more, and the error rate will gradually decrease.\nThe startup is also launching a conversational voice assistant that lives in the sidebar of your browser. You can ask it questions about the website, such as “what are the three key ideas?” or “explain this in simpler terms.”\n\n\n\nWhile ChatGPT and Gemini have conversational modes, Speechify’s argument is that they are treated as an afterthought in their apps, and the startup’s own tool has voice as front and center. \n“We believe that chat will always be the default user experience in ChatGPT and Gemini when you open the apps. That’s what their users expect. Voice will always be secondary – and in many cases, an afterthought for ChatGPT and Gemini. We know from several years of building Speechify that there’s a large portion of the market, which includes our users, who want voice as the primary, default setting every time they open an app and talk to AI,” Rohan Pavuluri, the company’s chief business officer, told TechCrunch over email.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne notable hiccup with this is that Speechify’s assistant doesn’t currently work with browsers with in-built sidebar assistants like OpenAI’s Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, and Dia. The startup is not too worried about that as the extension is largely intended for Chrome and its massive user base.\nSpeechify said that it plans to include both voice typing and a voice assistant in all its apps across desktop and mobile gradually.\nThe startup also wants to develop agents that complete tasks on your behalf. The startup didn’t reveal its full roadmap, but gave one example: making calls for you to make an appointment or wait on hold with customer support of a company. Other companies like Truecaller and Cloacked have been chasing similar targets.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

The buildout is meant to expand federal government agencies’ access to AWS AI services.\nThe project will add 1.3 gigawatts of compute and will expand government access to AWS products, including Amazon SageMaker AI, model customization, Amazon Bedrock, model deployment, and Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, among others, according to the company.\nAWS expects to break ground on these data center projects in 2026.\n“Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the company’s press release. “We’re giving agencies expanded access to advanced AI capabilities that will enable them to accelerate critical missions from cybersecurity to drug discovery. This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.”\nAWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government.\nThe entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011. Three years later it launched AWS Top Secret-East, the first air-gapped commercial cloud to work with classified workloads. AWS introduced AWS Secret Region in 2017, which has accredited access to all levels of security classification.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTech giants have increasingly pitched their AI services to the U.S. government over the past year.\nOpenAI launched a version of ChatGPT designed exclusively for federal U.S. government agencies in January. OpenAI announced a deal in August that gave government agencies access to the enterprise tier of ChatGPT for just $1 a year.\nThat same month, Anthropic announced it was also giving the U.S. government access to the enterprise tiers of its Claude chatbot for $1. Google announced “Google for Government” for even less, charging 47 cents for the first year, shortly after.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

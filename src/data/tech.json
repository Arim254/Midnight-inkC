    "body": "<div>\n<p>Six months after Lip-Bu Tan began his quest to turn around struggling Intel, the semiconductor giant has announced a major hardware upgrade.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Intel <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing/intel-unveils-panther-lake-architecture-first-ai-pc-platform-built-on-18a\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled a new processor</a>, codenamed Panther Lake. This marks the next generation of the company’s Intel Core Ultra processor family and is the first chip built using Intel’s 18A semiconductor process.</p>\n<p>The processors are expected to begin shipping later this year and are being produced at Intel’s Chandler, Arizona, Fab 52 facility, which came online in 2025.</p>\n<p>“We are entering an exciting new era of computing, made possible by great leaps forward in semiconductor technology that will shape the future for decades to come,” Tan said in a company press release. “Our next-gen compute platforms, combined with our leading-edge process technology, manufacturing, and advanced packaging capabilities, are catalysts for innovation across our business as we build a new Intel.”</p>\n<p>Separately, Intel also previewed its Xeon 6+, codenamed Clearwater Forest, which is the company’s first 18A-based server processor. Intel predicts this will launch in the first half of 2026.</p>\n<p>This is the company’s largest manufacturing announcement since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/intel-appoints-lip-bu-tan-as-its-next-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">Tan took over as Intel’s CEO in March</a>. In his first few weeks, Tan made clear he would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/lip-bu-tan-says-intel-will-spin-off-non-core-units/\" target=\"_blank\">refocus the company on its core businesses</a> and restore its engineering-first culture.</p>\n<p>The announcement also emphasizes the 18A semiconductor’s ties to the U.S. The company’s press release highlighted that this is the most advanced chip manufacturing process produced domestically.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“The United States has always been home to Intel’s most advanced R&D, product design, and manufacturing — and we are proud to build on this legacy as we expand our domestic operations and bring new innovations to the market,” Tan said in the release.</p>\n<p>The U.S. government took a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/u-s-government-plans-to-take-a-10-stake-in-intel/\" target=\"_blank\">10% equity stake</a> in Intel in August just weeks after <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/intel-ceo-trump-lip-bu-tan.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tan and President Donald Trump met at the White House</a> to discuss how Intel and the government could work together to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.</p>\n<p><em>This piece has been updated to correct when Fab 52 opened. </em></p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>A prominent Italian businessman was targeted with Paragon spyware, according to local news reports.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Italian online investigative website <a href=\"http://irpimedia.irpi.eu/prominent-italian-businessman-also-among-the-targets-of-paragon-spyware/\" target=\"_blank\">IrpiMedia</a> and newspaper <a href=\"https://www.lastampa.it/economia/2025/10/09/news/paragon_caltagirone_spiato_spyware-15343622/\" target=\"_blank\">La Stampa</a> reported that Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone was among <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/whatsapp-says-it-disrupted-a-hacking-campaign-targeting-journalists-with-spyware/\">around 90 people who received a notification</a> from WhatsApp in January, alerting him that he had been targeted with spyware made by Paragon Solutions. </p>\n<p>It’s not immediately clear for what reason Caltagirone was targeted, and a spokesperson for his holding company, Caltagirone SpA, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Caltagirone’s namesake holding company <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/francesco-gaetano-caltagirone/\" target=\"_blank\">owns several firms</a> across different industries, including construction, real estate, finance, and publishing, which includes Italian newspaper Il Messaggero. </p>\n<p>Caltagirone becomes the first businessman to be added to the list of Paragon victims in Italy. So far, the other victims include journalists <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/\">Francesco Cancellato</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/researchers-confirm-two-journalists-were-hacked-with-paragon-spyware/\">Ciro Pellegrino</a>, who work for online news site Fanpage; and immigration activists <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/new-target-of-paragon-spyware-comes-forward/\">Luca Casarini</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/another-person-targeted-by-paragon-spyware-comes-forward/\">Giuseppe Caccia</a>, who work for <a href=\"https://mediterranearescue.org/en\" target=\"_blank\">Mediterranea Saving Humans</a>, an Italian non-government organization that helps rescue immigrants in the Mediterranean sea. </p>\n<p>The alleged targeting of Caltagirone now widens the ongoing Paragon spyware scandal in Italy to victims beyond journalists and activists. Following the reports of the Fanpage journalists being targeted, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/paragon-says-it-cancelled-contracts-with-italy-over-governments-refusal-to-investigate-spyware-attack-on-journalist/\">Paragon cut ties</a> with the Italian government, whose intelligence agencies were its customers. </p>\n<p>Paragon, which has long claimed to be an “ethical” spyware maker, is headquartered in Israel, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/israeli-spyware-maker-paragon-bought-by-u-s-private-equity-giant/\">was bought by U.S. private equity giant AE Industrial</a> in December 2024. As part of the deal, Paragon was reportedly going to merge with cybersecurity firm REDLattice. </p>\n<p>When TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment in September regarding <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/ice-reactivates-contract-with-spyware-maker-paragon/\">the company’s contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>, a company spokesperson referred questions to REDLattice’s vice president of marketing Jennifer Iras, indicating that the merger may have been finalized.</p>\n<p>Paragon and WhatsApp did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. </p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com\">lorenzo@techcrunch.com</a>, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>",

Days earlier, Oracle’s chief security officer, Rob Duhart, claimed in the same post — since scrubbed — that the extortion campaign was linked to previously identified vulnerabilities that Oracle patched in July, suggesting the hacks were over.</p>\n<p>But in a <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html\" target=\"_blank\">security advisory</a> published over the weekend, Oracle said the zero-day bug — named because Oracle had no time to fix the bug, as it was already being exploited by hackers — can be “exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.” </p>\n<p>The Russia-linked Clop ransomware and extortion gang has made a name for itself in recent years for mass-hacking campaigns, often involving the abuse of vulnerabilities unknown to the software vendor at the time they were exploited, to steal large amounts of corporate and customer data. This includes managed file transfer tools, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/16/clop-ransomware-gang-names-dozens-of-victims-hit-by-cleo-mass-hack-but-several-firms-dispute-breaches/\">Cleo</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/moveit-mass-hack-by-the-numbers/\">MOVEit</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/intellihartx-data-breach-fortra-ransomware/\">GoAnywhere</a>, which companies use as a way to send sensitive corporate data over the internet.</p>\n<p>Google’s blog post includes email addresses and other technical details that network defenders can use to look for extortion emails and other indications that their Oracle systems may have been compromised.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Apple on Thursday shared how it’s making changes to comply with a Texas state law, SB 2420, which introduces age assurance requirements for app stores and app developers.</p>\n<p>Although Apple already <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/apple-introduces-new-child-safety-initiatives-including-an-age-checking-system-for-apps/\">rolled out its own age assurance technology</a> and tools earlier this year in anticipation of a regulatory crackdown, the tech giant called out the Texas law over privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>In a developer announcement, Apple explains, “…we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.”</p>\n<p>The Texas law is one of several going into effect in the United States, given the failure of lawmakers and the federal government to create comprehensive internet regulations to protect minors online. As a result, states are coming up with their own laws with similar intentions, but different methods of implementation.</p>\n<p>A tech giant like Apple has the resources to comply with such laws, but smaller developers would not, without Apple’s provided tools. Other smaller startups are impacted by these laws, as well. For instance, social networking startup Bluesky had to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/24/bluesky-blocks-service-in-mississippi-over-age-assurance-law/\">block its service</a> in Mississippi as the company said it didn’t have the resources to comply with the law.</p>\n<p>When the law goes into effect on January 1, 2026, Apple will be required to confirm whether Texas users are 18 years or older, and those under 18 will be required to join a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/108380\" target=\"_blank\">Family Sharing group</a>, managed by parents or guardians. Parents and guardians will have to provide consent for all the minor’s App Store downloads, purchases, and transactions, using Apple’s existing in-app purchase system.</p>\n<p>To comply with the law, Apple said it will help developers determine age in a “privacy-preserving way.” For now, developers can use its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/declaredagerange/\" target=\"_blank\">Declared Age Range API</a>, which will be updated before the law goes into effect to provide the age categories for new account users in Texas.</p>\n<p>In addition, Apple will roll out new APIs later this year that will allow developers to get parental consent if they make significant changes to their app that would require a different age rating. Parents will also be able to revoke consent after it’s granted, if they determine the app is not appropriate for their child. (Though we can imagine this being used as a new punishment technique; no Instagram for a month!)</p>\n<p>Apple warned developers that similar laws will be coming into effect in Utah and Louisiana later in the year, so they need to get prepared.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Reports about Netflix’s efforts to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/30/netflix-plans-to-bring-games-to-tv-and-let-players-use-their-iphones-as-video-game-controllers/\">bring its mobile games to televisions</a> began in early 2023. Later that year, the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/netflix-launches-a-game-controller-app-for-playing-games-on-your-tv/\">launched a game controller app</a> for iOS devices. </p>\n<p>However, there hadn’t been much word about gaming on the big screen until now, but it looks like the wait is finally over.</p>\n<p>To use the new feature, go to the Games tab on the Netflix TV app, then pick a game and use your phone as the controller.</p>\n<p>Since launching mobile games four years ago, Netflix’s strategy has been somewhat varied. However, the recent move indicates a more serious commitment to expanding its gaming offerings, helping it compete more directly with major video game companies, beyond just mobile gaming rivals.</p>\n<p>Alongside the announcement, Netflix <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/level-up-your-holidays-with-party-games-coming-to-netflix-on-tv\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> the new slate of games it’s launching, all of which are party titles meant to be played in groups. </p>\n<p>These include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Boggle Party</strong>: Up to eight players are timed to find words in a scrambled letter grid.</li>\n<li><strong>LEGO Party!</strong>: Four players compete in minigames and challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>Party Crashers: Fool Your Friends</strong>: One person at this party secretly has no idea what everyone else is talking about. Figure out whose clues are fishy to unmask the crasher. </li>\n<li><strong>Pictionary: Game Night</strong>: Based on the classic group game, friends must guess what you’re drawing before time runs out. </li>\n<li><strong>Tetris Time Warp:</strong> Compete against friends for the best score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Launching group-focused games is a smart move for Netflix because it encourages more customers to participate. It also means users will stay engaged with the streaming service, even when they’re not watching a TV series or movie. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The addition of the five titles follows Netflix’s recent <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview\" target=\"_blank\">insight</a> into its current gaming strategy, which will now focus on four types of games, including party titles.</p>\n<p>The games are currently available on select TV screens in specific countries, and Netflix plans to expand their availability over time.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com\">laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com</a> or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>As AI companies mature, the fight for high-quality data has become one of the most competitive areas in the industry, launching companies like Mercor, Surge, and, most prominently, Alexandr Wang’s Scale AI. But now that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/report-meta-taps-scale-ais-alexandr-wang-to-join-new-superintelligence-lab/\">Wang has moved on to run AI at Meta</a>, many funders see an opening — and are willing to fund companies with compelling new strategies for collecting training data.</p>\n<p>The Y Combinator graduate <a href=\"https://datacurve.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Datacurve</a> is one such company, focusing on high-quality data for software development. On Thursday, the company announced a $15 million Series A round, led by Mark Goldberg at Chemistry with participation from employees at DeepMind, Vercel, Anthropic, and OpenAI. The Series A comes after a $2.7 million seed round, which drew investment from former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan.</p>\n<p>Datacurve uses a “bounty hunter” system to attract skilled software engineers to complete the hardest-to-source datasets. The company pays for those contributions, distributing over $1 million in bounties so far.</p>\n<p>But co-founder Serena Ge (pictured above with co-founder Charley Lee) says the biggest motivation isn’t financial. For high-value services like software development, the pay will always be far lower for data work than conventional employment — so the company’s most important edge is a positive user experience.</p>\n<p>“We treat this as a consumer product, not a data labeling operation,” Ge said. “We spend a lot of time thinking about: How can we optimize it so that the people we want are interested and get onto our platform?”</p>\n<p>That’s particularly important as the needs of post-training data grow more complex. While earlier models were trained on simple datasets, today’s AI products rely on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\">complex RL environments</a>, which need to be constructed through specific and strategic data collection. As the environments grow more sophisticated, the data requirements become both more intense for both quantity and quality — a factor that could give high-quality data collection companies like Datacurve an edge.</p>\n<p>As an early-stage company, Datacurve is focused on software engineering, but Ge says the model could apply just as easily to fields like finance, marketing, or even medicine.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“What we’re doing right now is we’re creating an infrastructure for post-training data collection that attracts and retains highly competent people in their own domains,” Ge says.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

(Sora is iOS-only for now.) </p>\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><div><p>sora hit 1M app downloads in <5 days, even faster than chatgpt did (despite the invite flow and only targeting north america!)!</p><p>team working hard to keep up with surging growth. more features and fixes to overmoderation on the way!</p></div>— Bill Peebles (@billpeeb) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/billpeeb/status/1976099194407616641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n<p>ChatGPT was available only in the U.S. during its first week, while Sora is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada at launch. Still, Appfigures data indicated that Canada contributed about 45,000 installs, so the Sora launch was about 96% of ChatGPT’s launch on iOS alone, if the data had been based on the U.S. numbers only.</p>\n<p>This level of consumer adoption is worth noting because Sora requires an invite to get in, while ChatGPT was publicly available at launch. That makes Sora’s performance more impressive.</p>\n<p>During its first day, Sora saw 56,000 iOS app installs in short order, bumping the app to become the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store, Appfigures said. By Friday, October 3, it reached No. 1. That surge had already put Sora’s debut ahead of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and put it on par with xAI’s Grok launch.</p>\n<p>A quick scan of social media provides plenty of anecdotes that support Appfigures’ data. Sora videos, which uses the new Sora 2 video model and gives users the ability to generate realistic deepfakes, seem to be everywhere.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) had <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-03-06-jdj-to-pichai-alphabet-re-subpoena.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">subpoenaed</a> YouTube’s parent company, Alphabet, to investigate if the Biden-Harris administration had “coerced or colluded” platforms into censoring speech. Last month, Alphabet’s legal counsel, Daniel F. Donovan, wrote in a <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-09-23-letter-to-hjc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to Rep. Jordan that the company would allow some terminated creators to come back.</p>\n<p>While YouTube does not explicitly reference its COVID-19 or election integrity policies in its blog post, Alphabet’s letter makes it clear that these policies are top of mind. </p>\n<p>“Reflecting the Company’s commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,” Alphabet’s letter says. “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse.”</p>\n<p>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter took action to prevent the spread of medical misinformation about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/youtube-has-removed-1-million-videos-for-dangerous-covid-19-misinformation/\">virus</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/youtube-will-now-ban-content-with-vaccine-misinformation/\">vaccines</a>. </p>\n<p>At the time, YouTube disallowed content stating that vaccines can cause cancer, a false claim that is <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-myths/art-20485720\" target=\"_blank\">not supported</a> by <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-people-with-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">scientific research</a>. The following year, these platforms also took action against accounts that they believed to incite violence after the January 6 riots, including the account of President Donald Trump.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>These policies have since been discontinued, but creators who were terminated under those rules have remained unable to upload YouTube videos.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch asked YouTube if this pilot would specifically focus on creators who were terminated on the grounds of the COVID-19 and election integrity policies. We did not receive a response prior to publication.</p>\n<p>“We’ll consider several factors when evaluating requests for new channels, like whether the creator committed particularly severe or persistent violations of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, or whether the creator’s on- or off-platform activity harmed or may continue to harm the YouTube community, like channels that endanger kids’ safety,” the company wrote in its blog. </p>\n<p>YouTube also stated that creators who were terminated for copyright infringement will not be allowed to request a new channel.</p>\n<p>Creators must wait one year after their channel was terminated before they are eligible to apply for a new channel; however, they can still appeal their termination during that year’s lag if they think that YouTube’s decision was unjust.</p>\n<p>If a creator is reinstated, they will start from scratch, rather than regain access to their old account. However, they can still apply to the YouTube Partner Program once they are eligible to do so, which allows them to share ad revenue with YouTube.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The explosion of AI companies has pushed demand for computing power to new extremes, and companies like CoreWeave, Together AI and Lambda Labs have capitalized on that demand, attracting immense amounts of attention and capital for their ability to offer distributed compute capacity.</p>\n<p>But most companies still store data with the big three cloud providers, AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, whose storage systems were built to keep data close to their own compute resources, not spread across multiple clouds or regions.</p>\n<p>“Modern AI workloads and AI infrastructure are choosing distributed computing instead of big cloud,” Ovais Tariq, co-founder and CEO of Tigris Data, told TechCrunch. “We want to provide the same option for storage, because without storage, compute is nothing.” </p>\n<p>Tigris, founded by the team that developed Uber’s storage platform, is building a network of localized data storage centers that it claims can meet the distributed compute needs of modern AI workloads. The startup’s AI-native storage platform “moves with your compute, [allows] data [to] automatically replicate to where GPUs are, supports billions of small files, and provides low-latency access for training, inference, and agentic workloads,” Tariq said. </p>\n<p>To do all of that, Tigris recently raised a $25 million Series A round that was led by Spark Capital and saw participation from existing investors, which include Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The startup is going against the incumbents, who Tariq calls “Big Cloud.” </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?w=384\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png 384w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=323,430 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tigris-Datacenter.png?resize=38,50 38w\" /><figcaption><span>Ovais Tariq, CEO of Tigris, at a Tigris data center in Virginia</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Tigris Data</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tariq feels these incumbents not only offer a more expensive data storage service, but also a less efficient one. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have historically charged egress fees (dubbed “cloud tax” in the industry) if a customer wants to migrate to another cloud provider, or download and move their data if they want to, say, use a cheaper GPU or train models in different parts of the world simultaneously. Think of it like having to pay your gym extra if you want to stop going there.</p>\n<p>According to Batuhan Taskaya, head of engineering at Fal.ai, one of Tigris’ customers, those costs once accounted for the majority of Fal’s cloud spending.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Beyond egress fees, Tariq says there’s still the problem of latency with larger cloud providers. “Egress fees were just one symptom of a deeper problem: centralized storage that can’t keep up with a decentralized, high-speed AI ecosystem,” he said. </p>\n<p>Most of Tigris’ 4,000+ customers are like Fal.ai: generative AI startups building image, video, and voice models, which tend to have large, latency-sensitive datasets.  </p>\n<p>“Imagine talking to an AI agent that’s doing local audio,” Tariq said. “You want the lowest latency. You want your compute to be local, close by, and you want your storage to be local, too.” </p>\n<p>Big clouds aren’t optimized for AI workloads, he added. Streaming massive datasets for training or running real-time inference across multiple regions can create latency bottlenecks, slowing model performance. But being able to access localized storage means data is retrieved faster, which means developers can run AI workloads reliably and more cost-effectively using decentralized clouds. </p>\n<p>“Tigris lets us scale our workloads in any cloud by providing access to the same data filesystem from all these places without charging egress,” Fal’s Taskaya said.</p>\n<p>There are other reasons why companies want to have data closer to their distributed cloud options. For example, in highly regulated fields like finance and healthcare, one large roadblock to adopting AI tools is that enterprises need to ensure data security. </p>\n<p>Another motivation, says Tariq, is that companies increasingly want to own their data, pointing to how Salesforce earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/salesforce-blocks-ai-rivals-using-slack-data\" target=\"_blank\">blocked its AI rivals</a> from using Slack data. “Companies are becoming more and more aware of how important the data is, how it’s fueling the LLMs, how it’s fueling the AI,” Tariq said. “They want to be more in control. They don’t want someone else to be in control of it.” </p>\n<p>With the fresh funds, Tigris intends to continue building its data storage centers to support increasing demand — Tariq says the startup has grown 8x every year since its founding in November 2021. Tigris already has three data centers in Virginia, Chicago, and San Jose, and wants to continue expanding in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Asia, specifically in London, Frankfurt, and Singapore.  </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Getting design and engineering teams on the same page about what digital product to create and how to build it continues to be a challenge. </p>\n<p>A lot of companies find themselves dealing with scattered information, often depending on shared spreadsheets to keep track of design specs and guidelines. Design teams might use tools like Figma, while engineers manage their source code with systems like Git. </p>\n<p>This issue becomes even trickier for large organizations juggling multiple brands and various websites. Miscommunication can pile up quickly, resulting in wasted time and inefficiency.</p>\n<p>That’s where <a href=\"https://www.knapsack.cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Knapsack</a> comes in. It’s a collaboration platform specifically designed for enterprises that need to resolve misunderstandings between UI designers, product managers, and engineers. Knapsack creates a unified workspace that connects with tools like Figma and Git, ensuring that all design changes and code are collected, showcased, and compared in one place. </p>\n<p>This approach makes sure that everything remains up to date, so branding stays consistent across all digital products. For example, if the button is supposed to be 60 pixels, this will be documented in the system, and no sizing mistakes are made.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the company announced a $10 million Series A round, bringing the total raised to date to $20.8 million.</p>\n<p>Alongside the funding, Knapsack is introducing AI capabilities. This includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, which is Anthropic’s open source standard that is<strong> </strong>designed to enhance AI models’ ability to generate more relevant responses to specific inquiries by having access to a company’s design and brand standards. The new addition, currently in limited beta, enables teams to use AI agents using models like ChatGPT and Gemini while ensuring these assistants are consistent with their brand and guidelines.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Additionally, an upcoming “ingestion engine” aims to streamline the process of creating a system of record, which is essentially a comprehensive collection of data or information for a company. Traditionally, setting up such systems can take months. Knapsack believes the new engine will reduce that time to just a few days, making it easier for new teams or projects to get up and running more quickly.</p>\n<p>“We work with a very large pharmaceutical company that creates a bunch of sites associated with each of their drug brands. It used to take them about 15 months to launch a new drug property. Now using Knapsack, it takes between two and three months,” CEO Chris Strahl told TechCrunch. He noted that adding the new engine is poised to make this process even faster.</p>\n<p>Another feature, launching later this year, helps teams quickly explore user interfaces (UIs) and generate real webpages using real code. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg 792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=430,332 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=720,556 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=668,516 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=485,375 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=687,531 687w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Knapsack</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Launched in 2022, Knapsack says it serves dozens of Fortune 1000 companies but did not disclose their names. Strahl declined to share subscription pricing details, saying only, “it’s an enterprise product with enterprise pricing.”</p>\n<p>The company currently has nearly 30 full-time employees on the team, and just hired 14 more with the new funding.</p>\n<p>The round was led by Builders VC with participation from Crosslink Capital, Epic Ventures, Mana Ventures, and Lorimer Ventures.

I want to be able to go running more frequently,’” Strahl told TechCrunch. “And the agent would go out and understand your preferences based on your history, and take you a pair of shoes, and it would return that into whatever app is running your agent.”</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, that experience should come from Knapsack,” he continued, “and there is this entire world that has yet to be unveiled of how organizations think about expressing their brand through agentic apps and systems that I want to be at the forefront.”</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated after publication.</em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Sora’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/sora-hit-1m-downloads-faster-than-chatgpt/\">rapid adoption</a> drove a number of App Store scammers to try to get in on the act. Following the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">launch</a> of OpenAI’s invite-only, video-generating mobile app last week, Apple’s App Store was flooded with fakes that also proclaimed themselves to be “Sora” or “Sora 2” — the latter a reference to the underlying new AI video model that was released alongside the mobile app.</p>\n<p>These apps somehow made it past Apple’s App Review process. They actually had public listings on the App Store, despite using a brand name that’s trademarked by OpenAI and fairly well known in the tech industry even before the app’s debut. </p>\n<p>According to research provided to TechCrunch upon our request by app intelligence platform <a href=\"http://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appfigures</a>, there were over a dozen “Sora”-branded apps that went live on the App Store after the official app’s launch. Over half of them used “Sora 2” in their names specifically. (One of <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@gruber/post/DPZLd-IAF5j\" target=\"_blank\">those was spotted by</a> Apple blogger and pundit, John Gruber, who called it the “App Store scam of the week.”)</p>\n<p>Many of the apps were not newcomers, either. Some had been live on the App Store — sometimes using other names — since earlier in the year or even last year. The impostors, which include those live on Google Play as well, had seen around 300,000 collective installs to date, with north of 80,000 installs coming in after Sora’s official app launch. (OpenAI has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/sora-hit-1m-downloads-faster-than-chatgpt/\">since announced</a> that Sora’s official mobile app has been downloaded 1 million times, for comparison.)</p>\n<p>Nearly all of the impostors had been updated just after OpenAI’s Sora app launch to capitalize on consumer demand and searches, often by changing their name. </p>\n<p>It’s unclear how these apps were able to slip past Apple’s reviewers; Apple did end up pulling many of them from its App Store, Appfigures said.</p>\n<p>Of the imposter apps, the largest one was named “Sora 2 – AI Video Generator” — an obvious attempt to game App Store searches for the keyword “sora.” It saw more than 50,000 installs after the launch of the official app.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>As of the time of writing, a few Sora-branded apps are still live, despite the potential for consumer confusion. One, “PetReels — Sora for Pets,” has seen only a few hundred installs, however. Another one, “Viral AI Photo Maker: Vi-sora” is trying to squeeze the word Sora in there but hasn’t gained traction, either.</p>\n<p>Doing slightly better is the app using the branding “Sora 2” in its name (Sora 2 – Video Generator Ai). It’s pulled in north of 6,000 downloads and counting.</p>\n<p>Collectively, the apps earned more than $160,000 — decent money considering their short lives.</p>\n<p>Apple was asked for comment on how Sora-branded apps were able to go live and if these remaining Sora-branded apps would be removed. It did not respond prior to publication. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stokespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stoke Space</a> announced a massive capital raise on Wednesday that might seem, at first glance, like just another bet on the commercial launch market. The details tell a different story.</p>\n<p>Led by billionaire Thomas Tull’s U.S. Innovative Technology (USIT), a fund that explicitly invests in technologies tied to national security, the $510 million Series D round underscores a larger shift in the launch industry. The old assumption was the winners of launch would be the companies that capture the lion’s share of commercial payloads.</p>\n<p>While there is still demand on the commercial side from private constellation developers and for emerging use cases like in-space manufacturing or lunar payloads, the center of gravity has shifted decisively toward defense.</p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, space startups were selling investors on visions of a rapidly expanding commercial market for weather monitoring, broadband, and remote-sensing satellites. Astra, for example, told investors in its 2021 SPAC deck that it would eventually launch hundreds of rockets per year to serve a growing small satellite market. Relativity Space pitched investors on a 3D printing revolution that would make rockets cheap enough to unlock large commercial demand.</p>\n<p>But there are only so many commercial payloads to fly, and only one company — SpaceX — has managed to consistently launch them cheaply and reliably.</p>\n<p>Defense, meanwhile, is on an opposite trajectory. </p>\n<p>Geopolitical shifts, like Russia’s war against Ukraine and growing competition in space from China, have created new tailwinds. The Pentagon’s new “Golden Dome” initiative, a multibillion-dollar project aimed at creating a layered missile defense shield over the continental United States, has flooded the aerospace ecosystem with lucrative new opportunities.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Meanwhile, programs like the Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) and the Space Development Agency’s missile-defense satellite constellation are promising years of predicable, high-value contracts. </p>\n<p>Launch startups have noticed. Their language, investors, and business models have realigned toward a single buyer: the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>In a press release, Stoke Space nods toward this reality, saying the new funding would strengthen “capability across the U.S. space industrial base.” Support from other new investors, like Washington Harbour Partners LP and General Innovation Capital Partners, further underscores “Stoke’s importance to national security and the U.S. industrial base,” the company said.</p>\n<p>Stoke’s recent wins highlight this reality. In March, it was one of a handful of launch providers selected for the NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 program, which lets the company compete for up to $5.6 billion in launch contracts over the next decade. </p>\n<p>Other recent deals tell a similar story. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/firefly-leans-into-its-defense-ambitions-with-855m-scitec-acquisition/\">Firefly’s recent $855 million acquisition of SciTec</a> was framed by CEO Jason Kim as a move that enhanced the company’s “ability to support a growing number of defense missions.” Relativity’s new owner, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, just recently warned lawmakers that if China achieves superintelligence first, “it changes the balance of power globally in ways that we have no way of understanding, predicting or dealing with.”</p>\n<p>While his remarks weren’t about launch specifically, they sum up the broader sentiment across the space industry: America cannot lose in strategic domains like space and AI.</p>\n<p>In that context, USIT makes an obvious lead for the new round. Thomas Tull launched the fund in 2023 to fund technologies “relevant to the national interest.” </p>\n<p>Past investments are wide-ranging but related to national resilience, including defense startup Shield AI and Gecko Robotics. Stoke’s inclusion in that portfolio cements the new reality that space investment is squarely at the intersection of venture capital and defense budgets.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

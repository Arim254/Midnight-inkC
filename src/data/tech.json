    "body": "\nThinking Machines Lab, the AI startup led by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, has lost one of its co-founders to Meta.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that AI researcher Andrew Tulloch announced his departure to employees in a message on Friday. A Thinking Machine Labs spokesperson confirmed Tulloch’s departure to the WSJ, saying he “has decided to pursue a different path for personal reasons.”\nBack in August, the WSJ reported that Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive AI recruiting blitz included an offer to acquire Thinking Machines Lab — and when that failed, Zuckerberg reportedly tried to lure Tulloch with a compensation package that could have been worth up to $1.5 billion over at least six years. (At the time, a Meta spokesperson said that the WSJ’s description of the offer was “inaccurate and ridiculous.”)\nTulloch previously worked at OpenAI and Facebook’s AI Research Group.\n",

The company, backed by Sequoia Capital, TCV, and Jackson Square Ventures, was last valued at $2.2 billion in May.\nStrava has the wind at its back, certainly. The app’s user base has exploded to 50 million monthly active users in 2025, according to Sensor Tower – nearly double its closest competitor, with downloads up 80% year-over-year.\nStrava’s growth coincides with a cultural shift around running, particularly as people in their teens and 20s seek more alcohol-free ways to socialize. Runners also emphasize the mental health benefits of finding support networks (and, sometimes, romance). Applications for the 2026 London Marathon jumped 31% this year to 1.1 million people.\nStrava’s secret sauce? Turning workouts into social currency with “kudos” and split comparisons. Sensor Tower estimates consumers spent over $180 million on its subscription tier through September – a figure Strava says significantly underestimates actual revenue. The company also earns from sponsored challenges and brand partnerships.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

    "body": "\nMarc Benioff has long been San Francisco’s liberal-leaning billionaire, the tech executive who funded homeless services, donated to the city’s public schools, and hosted Hillary Clinton fundraisers.\nBut in a new, wide-ranging phone interview with the New York Times from his private plane, Benioff revealed a political transformation that seemed to surprise even his own communications team, despite that Salesforce has hundreds of contracts with the federal government. \nThe Salesforce founder declared he “fully supported” President Trump and thought National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets. He gushed about sitting across from Trump at a Windsor Castle state dinner, telling the president “how grateful I am for everything he’s doing.” He praised Elon Musk’s government efficiency efforts and said he hadn’t closely followed news about immigration raids or Trump’s attacks on the media.\nThe 50-minute conversation reportedly ended after Benioff turned to his public relations executive, apparently noticing her expression. “What about the political questions?” he could be heard asking. “Too spicy?”Though Benioff’s shift mirrors Silicon Valley’s broader accommodation of Trump, the exchange offered a rare glimpse of just how far that repositioning can go. The question now: will other Bay Area tech CEOs follow Benioff’s lead and call for federal troops in their own backyard?\n",

The rule, however, doesn’t mean that staff can’t ask questions or require amended filings later. \nNavan declined to comment to TechCrunch about its updated IPO documents.\nThe going thought was that the shutdown would cool and possibly freeze an IPO market that had just started to thaw. Even with this rule, many companies would rather get a green light from a staffer than go it alone, sources told Bloomberg. So the tech world will be watching how Navan’s gambit fairs. \nNavan’s updated filing shows the company plans to sell 30 million shares, with insiders selling an additional 7 million. It priced its range at $24 to $26. At the high-end, the company would raise more than  $960 million and be valued at $6.45 billion. Navan is backed by Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Zeev Ventures, and Greenoaks. \nNavan generated rolling 12-month revenue of $613 million (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to the updated filing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n",

Existing users can also re-download the app from their Apple account if needed.\nWithout updates, it will probably become more difficult to use Clips over time, so Apple is encouraging users to download their Clips videos (with or without added effects) to their photo library, so they can watch and edit the videos using other apps.\nLaunched in 2017, Clips appeared to be Apple’s answer to Snapchat and Instagram Stories — it wasn’t a social network, but it allowed users to stitch together photos and videos with filters, emojis, and music.\nEarly on, TechCrunch’s Brian Heater described Clips’ video editing capabilities as simple to a fault and suggested that the app could allow Apple to showcase its hardware and software capabilities while offering users a path out of then on-the-rise social ecosystems.\nMacRumors reports that while Apple upgraded Clips with new features after launch, updates in recent years have been limited to bug fixes. \nApple fans on Reddit seemed unsurprised by the news, saying they’d only tried the app years ago or never heard of it at all. Plus, an app like Clips — built around real footage shot by real people — might feel a bit old-fashioned when compared to Sora, OpenAI’s generative AI video app that recently hit 1 million downloads. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nIn the latest bid by a Silicon Valley defense firm to assert its own solution for the Army’s mixed-reality ambitions, Anduril Industries on Monday unveiled “EagleEye,” a helmeted computing system that seeks to turn soldiers into AI-augmented warfighters. \nThe launch is notable given that the initiative is led by Anduri’s co-founder Palmer Luckey, who previously started the pioneering VR company, Oculus, which was acquired by Meta.\nAnduril describes EagleEye as a modular “family of systems” built atop its Lattice software that puts command-and-control tools, sensor feeds, and AI directly into a soldier’s field of vision.\nThe company claims the system can integrate live video feeds; features rear- and side-sensors to alert operators to threats; and can track teammates in real-time. EagleEye variations include a helmet, visor and glasses.\nThe launch comes as the U.S. Army looks to expand its pool of mixed-reality gear suppliers. It had been using Microsoft’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), a $22 billion program awarded in 2018, but after years of issues, the Army handed control of the contract to Anduril this February.\nThen in September, Anduril won a $159 million award to prototype a new mixed-reality system for soldiers, part of a broader Soldier Borne Mission Command effort. Anduril said the award was “the largest effort of its kind” to outfit “every soldier with superhuman perception and decision-making capabilities.”\nEarlier this year, Anduril also announced a partnership with Meta to develop extended reality (XR) devices for the military, marking an unexpected reunion between Luckey and his former employer.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“I am glad to be working with Meta once again,” Luckey said in a blog post. “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.”\nEagleEye has a long history: the concept first appeared in Anduril’s first pitch deck draft, before investors convinced the startup’s team to focus on software like Lattice. \n“Going toe-to-toe with Microsoft and Magic Leap would have been demoralizing windmill-tilting driven by magical thinking,” Luckey said in a post on X in February. “Everything is different now. The world is ready, and so is Anduril.”\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSalesforce announced Monday the latest version of its AI agent platform as the company looks to lure enterprises to its AI software in an increasingly crowded market.\nThe customer relations manager giant unveiled the new platform, branded Agentforce 360, ahead of its annual Dreamforce customer conference that kicks off October 14. This newer version of Agentforce includes new ways to instruct AI agents through text, a new platform to build and deploy agents, and new infrastructure for messaging app Slack, among others.\nA notable aspect of Agentforce 360 is its new AI agent prompting tool, called Agent Script, which will be released in beta in November. Agent Script gives users the ability to program their AI agents to be more flexible and better respond to “if/then” situations. This allows AI agents to be programmed to be more predictable in less rigid situations like customer questions.\nUsers can tap into “reasoning” models, which claim to think before responding as opposed to responding based on patterns. Anthropic, OpenAI and Google Gemini power these “reasoning” agents.\nSalesforce also announced it is releasing a new agent building tool, Agentforce Builder, which allows users to build, test and deploy AI agents from a singular spot. This tool, which will be released in beta in November, includes Agentforce Vibes, an enterprise-grade app vibe coding tool that Salesforce announced earlier this month.\nThe company also announced a broader integration between Agentforce and Slack. Salesforce said its core apps, including Agenforce Sales, IT and HR, among others, will surface directly in Slack starting this month and expand through the beginning of 2026.\nSlack is piloting a new version of its Slackbot chatbot that is meant to be more of a personalized AI agent that learns about its user and will offer insights and suggestions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSalesforce wants Slack to serve as an enterprise search tool in the future too and plans to launch connectors with platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Dropbox in early 2026.\nThis latest update from Salesforce comes at an interesting time for the enterprise AI market. Companies continue to release AI features aimed at their enterprise customers while enterprises struggle to see a return on investment for these tools.\nLast week Google announced Gemini Enterprise, a suite of tools — many of which were already available — for building enterprise-grade AI agents, that counts Figma, Klarna and Virgin Voyages as early customers, among others.\nAnthropic also started to show traction for its enterprise product, Claude Enterprise. The company announced it struck a deal with consulting giant Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to Deloitte’s 500,000 global employees — its largest enterprise deal yet. Anthropic announced a strategic partnership with IBM the next day.\nSalesforce touts that Agentforce has 12,000 customers — significantly higher than any of its competitors, according to its Agentforce press release. Early pilot customers of its Agentforce 360 upgrades include Lennar, Adecco, and Pearson. \nThis is all despite a recent MIT study found that 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before they reach production as companies still struggle to justify spending money on these AI tools.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nApart from antivirus apps, the cybersecurity industry has traditionally been business to business, with regular internet users left on their own to protect themselves. And older people, who did not grow up with the internet and smartphones, are perhaps the most vulnerable. \nZoraSafe, a startup founded by sisters Catherine Karow and Ellie King Karow wants to step in and help them out. Their idea is to create an app that not only protects older people against scammers and hackers, but also teaches them how to stay safe through gamified microlearning, as Catherine and Ellie told TechCrunch ahead of the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, where ZoraSafe will be part of Startup Battlefield.\nThe app is not out yet, but Catherine and Ellie expect to launch it in a month. They said it will cost $12.99 a month for individual subscribers, and a higher rate for family and group plans.\nThe first version of the app, Catherine explained in a phone call, will have several features, such as a mode to scan QR codes for malware or phishing, the ability to send suspicious SMS text messages and emails to ZoraSafe to get them checked out, and a feature to share a known scam or threat with the app so it can be added to a database to help other users.\n“We’re trying to incentivize social sharing of scams, so we can also alert the entire Zora network at once, so one person is alerted by that scam, and then we can make sure everyone in that community is protected immediately,” Catherine said.\nFuture releases will also include a feature that will allow users to get ZoraSafe to join a suspicious phone call, so the company’s AI system can detect if it’s a scam or a deepfake call. In that case, however, the app will not be listening to or recording the calls, according to Catherine.  \nOnce the app detects a threat, it will spin up a chat that will explain to the user what that threat was and teach them how to spot and deal with similar situations in the future, Ellie said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The whole purpose of which is to build resilience and hopefully make it so that even if you’re not directly interacting with the app, you’re a little bit more aware when you are interacting online,” she added. \nEllie said that the AI engine is designed with privacy in mind, doing 85% of the processing on the device, and only 15% in the cloud, which she claimed will be “sanitized of your personal information before it leaves your device.” \nCatherine also said they are planning to make an “NFC sticker” that will be incorporated in phone cases so that users can quickly pull up the app if they get a deepfake call, or even if they fall and need to alert their caretakers. That’s one of the ways they plan on getting around iOS’s restrictions on apps monitoring what happens on other apps. Another way is to have a “Share to ZoraSafe” option in the iOS menu that will allow users to send text messages or emails to the company’s systems.  \nEventually, the sisters said they want to expand ZoraSafe to children, too, partner with schools, and also launch the app in different languages, starting with Spanish.  \nIf you want to learn more about ZoraSafe — while also checking out dozens of other companies, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29, in San Francisco. Learn more here.  \n\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

In a Truth Social post announcing the tariffs, Trump also said this new tariff would be “over and above” any tariffs already imposed on Chinese imports. (CNBC reports that while U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports vary depending on the goods, the base tariff rate is already 40%.)\nEarlier this week, China announced that it is tightening its export controls on rare earth minerals, requiring that foreign companies apply for a license if they want to export products with even a small amount of those minerals. China is the world’s largest producer of rare earth minerals, which are used in products critical to the tech industry, including semiconductors and solar panels.\nIn his post, Trump described China’s announcement as “absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.”\n“It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,” he wrote.\nAccording to Trump, these new tariffs are set to take effect on November 1. After posting, Trump reportedly told journalists that the tariffs could still be walked back, and that he would not necessarily cancel a scheduled meeting with President Xi Jinping.\nStocks tumbled following Trump’s announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.9% at market close on Friday, the S&P 500 down 2.71% and Nasdaq down 3.56%. Some tech companies were hit particularly hard, with Nvidia and Tesla both down around 5% at market close.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe news also affected the crypto markets, leading to liquidations that were reportedly 10x the dollar value of liquidations during the FTX collapse.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark bill on Monday that regulates AI companion chatbots, making it the first state in the nation to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions.\nThe law, SB 243, is designed to protect children and vulnerable users from some of the harms associated with AI companion chatbot use. It holds companies — from the big labs like Meta and OpenAI to more focused companion startups like Character AI and Replika — legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet the law’s standards.\nSB 243 was introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, and gained momentum after the death of teenager Adam Raine, who died by suicide after a long series of suicidal conversations with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The legislation also responds to leaked internal documents that reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children. More recently, a Colorado family has filed suit against role-playing startup Character AI after their 13-year-old daughter took her own life following a series of problematic and sexualized conversations with the company’s chatbots.\n“Emerging technology like chatbots and social media can inspire, educate, and connect — but without real guardrails, technology can also exploit, mislead, and endanger our kids,” Newsom said in a statement. “We’ve seen some truly horrific and tragic examples of young people harmed by unregulated tech, and we won’t stand by while companies continue without necessary limits and accountability. We can continue to lead in AI and technology, but we must do it responsibly — protecting our children every step of the way. Our children’s safety is not for sale.”\nSB 243 will go into effect January 1, 2026, and requires companies to implement certain features such as age verification, and warnings regarding social media and companion chatbots. The law also implements stronger penalties for those who profit from illegal deepfakes, including up to $250,000 per offense. Companies must also establish protocols to address suicide and self-harm, which will be shared with the state’s Department of Public Health alongside statistics on how the service provided users with crisis center prevention notifications.\nPer the bill’s language, platforms must also make it clear that any interactions are artificially generated, and chatbots must not represent themselves as healthcare professionals. Companies are required to offer break reminders to minors and prevent them from viewing sexually explicit images generated by the chatbot.\nSome companies have already begun to implement some safeguards aimed at children. For example, OpenAI recently began rolling out parental controls, content protections, and a self-harm detection system for children using ChatGPT. Character AI has said that its chatbot includes a disclaimer that all chats are AI-generated and fictionalized. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSenator Padilla told TechCrunch the bill was “a step in the right direction” towards putting guardrails in place on “an incredibly powerful technology.”\n“We have to move quickly to not miss windows of opportunity before they disappear,” Padilla said. “I hope that other states will see the risk. I think many do. I think this is a conversation happening all over the country, and I hope people will take action. Certainly the federal government has not, and I think we have an obligation here to protect the most vulnerable people among us.”\nSB 243 is the second significant AI regulation to come out of California in recent weeks. On September 29th, Governor Newsom signed SB 53 into law, establishing new transparency requirements on large AI companies. The bill mandates that large AI labs, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google DeepMind, be transparent about safety protocols. It also ensures whistleblower protections for employees at those companies.\nOther states, like Illinois, Nevada, and Utah, have passed laws to restrict or fully ban the use of AI chatbots as a substitute for licensed mental health care.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Character AI, Meta, OpenAI, and Replika for comment. \nThis article has been updated with comment from Senator Padilla.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\n\nThis has been a big week for AI companies signing enterprise deals, with Zendesk unveiling new AI agents that are supposed to be able to resolve 80% of customer service issues, Anthropic and IBM announcing a strategic partnership, and Deloitte also announcing a deal with Anthropic. Plus, Google announced a new AI-for-business platform.\nThat doesn’t mean it’s going to be smooth sailing for big organizations using AI. In fact, the timing of the Deloitte announcement was a bit awkward, coming on the same day the Australia Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said the professional services and consulting firm would have to pay a refund for delivering a report to the department with what appeared to be a number of AI-generated hallucinations.\nOn the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec, Sean O’Kane, and I discussed the latest AI headlines, contrasting it with last week’s news about the new Sora app. While AI companies may eventually make real money from consumer social networking apps, enterprise deals offer a more immediate path to significant revenue.\nYou can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.\nAnthony: I think this actually ties back to our discussion last week about some of these GenAI social networks. We were framing that as potentially a way that these AI companies could eventually make money, which I definitely think is the case, but there’s a long road to get there. And the enterprise, sometimes people don’t find it quite as interesting or sexy as consumer, [but] it’s actually where the real money is. \nMaybe Sora is how OpenAI will make money five years from now, but this is how these companies are going to make money now.\nAnd the Deloitte [news] was especially striking. Sometimes you can feel like a little bit of a broken record to just point out how these models [aren’t always] totally ready for prime time, but I find it encouraging that the Australian government actually pushed back and said, no, you cannot do this.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s not necessarily that no one should ever use AI in the creation of these kinds of reports, although I think you could make that argument. But if you’re going to do it, you actually have to be responsible for the outputs. You have to actually go through and make sure that the information being cited is real. You can’t feed it into a model and just [say] “All right, my job is done, that’ll be however many billable hours.” I think anyone who does that should be embarrassed and fined.\nKirsten: Absolutely. Sean, Zendesk also had an announcement this week, and they’re really creating these tools that are going to handle pretty much all of customer service, basically removing the human from that process. In your everyday [life], how you go about the world or how automakers deal with service, for instance, are you starting to see that kind of [automation] creep in?\nSean: Yeah, I’ve actually written about it a few times. There are a bunch of different startups that are developing full customer service suites, voice agents, LLMs for emails and texts [from] dealerships and service centers. I actually think that’s a worthy idea, because the problem there isn’t: We don’t have enough people for the jobs to do this stuff and it’s going to take their jobs away. It’s that you can never get somebody on the phone or you get bounced around. \nEspecially going for service, you get bounced to the service department. Everybody’s busy. So if you can capture it accurately and make it easier for people to get a response, the question there for me is how much will those businesses adopt it and stick with it. There’s been all sorts of technologies over the years, like web forms and things like that, where these dealerships have done it, but then they forget about it. And then it just sits on their website and you think that it’s going to work, and then it doesn’t work, because they just want you to call them. \nSo I have some optimism and some hope that stuff like this is actually gonna be people’s first touch point with [a business].

    "body": "\nIt’s a universally acknowledged truth that the current dating scene sucks, no matter what city you live in. Everyone has a story. And everyone has a grievance. \nTake Myles Slayton, who completed a banking internship in New York City and saw how he and his friends struggled to find significant others in the city’s ruthless dating scene. “We’re on our phones more than ever,” he told TechCrunch. ”I thought to myself, ‘Why are dating apps terrible?’” \nHe figured that it must not be a problem with dating apps, per se, but rather the way the products work these days. Many of the popular dating apps were built with millennials in mind, but his generation, Gen Z, operates in a completely different fashion, he said. It’s a throwback to how dating used to be: People of this generation meet “through mutuals, through people in our social circles,” he said. \nHe teamed up with friends Willy Conzelman and Carter Munk and just a few months ago launched Cerca, a dating app that matches people with others already in their social circles. The company announced a $1.6 million seed round this summer and already has people buzzing: The app has around 60,000 users, mainly in New York and scattered across universities. \nThe company is part of Startup Battlefield and will show off its tech at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 later this month in San Francisco.\nImage Credits:Cerca\nSlayton, the company’s CEO, said there is a reason Gen Z has retreated to the old ways of dating, and that’s because of the internet and the COVID pandemic. “We simply don’t trust strangers,” he said, adding that people are also deeply afraid of rejection. \nCerca’s product tries to address this. Users create a standard dating profile, sync their contacts, and from there, only friends or friends of friends already on the app are shown as potential matches. “The fear of strangers is eliminated,” Slayton said. All likes are anonymous, alleviating the fear of rejection. Users get four swipes a day, he said, in the hope of getting rid of the swiping fatigue and putting more emphasis on choosing a match. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“There is no world where you should be seeing 100 profiles in a minute,” he said. “You should really be taking a second to think about each profile. These are real people.” \nThe profiles first reveal the friends in common, then the background, and then the photos. “It’s not all just about looks for us,” he said. A user gets a notification that someone has liked their profile, though they won’t know who. The Cerca algorithm will boost the profile of whoever made the like into the feed of the person they’re interested in, who can then decide whether to like them back. \nEach evening, matches are revealed, and nobody knows who made the first move. \nHaving friends in common makes it easier to vet for safety, as people can simply text their mutual friends to gather intel on who they are going on a date with. Users can also select which and how many contacts they want to share with Cerca, as well as block certain people from seeing their profiles. “You can also filter out words like dentist, doctor,” he said. “There’s no screenshotting or screen recording. Safety is paramount to us.” \nAside from the online world, the company has also created merchandise and is hosting events. \nSlayton said he and his co-founders decided to apply to Startup Battlefield and knew a founder who had participated in the event. “I think it’s such an opportunity to have the U.S. and the world see who we are and to represent dating in a positive light,” he said. \nIf you want to learn from Cerca firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nChris Lehane is one of the best in the business at making bad news disappear. Al Gore’s press secretary during the Clinton years, Airbnb’s chief crisis manager through every regulatory nightmare from here to Brussels – Lehane knows how to spin. Now he’s two years into what might be his most impossible gig yet: as OpenAI’s VP of global policy, his job is to convince the world that OpenAI genuinely gives a damn about democratizing artificial intelligence while the company increasingly behaves like, well, every other tech giant that’s ever claimed to be different.\nI had 20 minutes with him on stage at the Elevate conference in Toronto earlier this week – 20 minutes to get past the talking points and into the real contradictions eating away at OpenAI’s carefully constructed image. It wasn’t easy or entirely successful. Lehane is genuinely good at his job. He’s likable. He sounds reasonable. He admits uncertainty. He even talks about waking up at 3 a.m. worried about whether any of this will actually benefit humanity.\nBut good intentions don’t mean much when your company is subpoenaing critics, draining economically depressed towns of water and electricity, and bringing dead celebrities back to life to assert your market dominance.\nThe company’s Sora problem is really at the root of everything else. The video generation tool launched last week with copyrighted material seemingly baked right into it. It was a bold move for a company already getting sued by the New York Times, the Toronto Star, and half the publishing industry. From a business and marketing standpoint, it was also brilliant. The invite-only app soared to the top of the App Store as people created digital versions of themselves, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman; characters like Pikachu and Cartman of “South Park”; and dead celebrities like Tupac Shakur.\nAsked what drove OpenAI’s decision to launch this newest version of Sora with these characters, Lehane offered that Sora is a “general purpose technology” like the printing press, democratizing creativity for people without talent or resources. Even he – a self-described creative zero – can make videos now, he said on stage.\nWhat he danced around is that OpenAI initially “let” rights holders opt out of having their work used to train Sora, which is not how copyright use typically works. Then, after OpenAI noticed that people really liked using copyrighted images, it “evolved” toward an opt-in model. That’s not iterating. That’s testing how much you can get away with. (By the way, though the Motion Picture Association made some noise last week about legal threats, OpenAI appears to have gotten away with quite a lot.)\nNaturally, the situation brings to mind the aggravation of publishers who accuse OpenAI of training on their work without sharing the financial spoils. When I pressed Lehane about publishers getting cut out of the economics, he invoked fair use, that American legal doctrine that’s supposed to balance creator rights against public access to knowledge. He called it the secret weapon of U.S. tech dominance.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMaybe. But I’d recently interviewed Al Gore – Lehane’s old boss – and realized anyone could simply ask ChatGPT about it instead of reading my piece on TechCrunch. “It’s ‘iterative’,” I said, “but it’s also a replacement.”\nLehane listened and dropped his spiel. “We’re all going to need to figure this out,” he said. “It’s really glib and easy to sit here on stage and say we need to figure out new economic revenue models. But I think we will.” (We’re making it up as we go, is what I heard.)\nThen there’s the infrastructure question nobody wants to answer honestly. OpenAI is already operating a data center campus in Abilene, Texas, and recently broke ground on a massive data center in Lordstown, Ohio, in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank. Lehane has likened the adoption of AI to the advent of electricity – saying those who accessed it last are still playing catch-up – yet OpenAI’s Stargate project is seemingly targeting some of those same economically challenged places to set up facilities with their attendant and massive appetites for water and electricity.\nAsked during our sit-down whether these communities will benefit or merely foot the bill, Lehane went to gigawatts and geopolitics. OpenAI needs about a gigawatt of energy per week, he noted. China brought on 450 gigawatts last year plus 33 nuclear facilities. If democracies want democratic AI, he said, they have to compete. “The optimist in me says this will modernize our energy systems,” he’d said, painting a picture of re-industrialized America with transformed power grids.\nIt was inspiring, but it was not an answer about whether people in Lordstown and Abilene are going to watch their utility bills spike while OpenAI generates videos of The Notorious B.I.G. It’s very worth noting that video generation is the most energy-intensive AI out there.\nThere’s also a human cost, one made clearer the day before our interview, when Zelda Williams logged onto Instagram to beg strangers to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her late father, Robin Williams. “You’re not making art,” she wrote. “You’re making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings.”\nWhen I asked about how the company reconciles this kind of intimate harm with its mission, Lehane answered by talking about processes, including responsible design, testing frameworks, and government partnerships. “There is no playbook for this stuff, right?”\nLehane showed vulnerability in some moments, saying he recognizes the “enormous responsibilities that come with” all that OpenAI does.\nWhether or not those moments were designed for the audience, I believe him. Indeed, I left Toronto thinking I’d watched a master class in political messaging – Lehane threading an impossible needle while dodging questions about company decisions that, for all I know, he doesn’t even agree with. Then news broke that complicated that already complicated picture.\nNathan Calvin, a lawyer who works on AI policy at a nonprofit advocacy organization, Encode AI, revealed that at the same time I was talking with Lehane in Toronto, OpenAI had sent a sheriff’s deputy to Calvin’s house in Washington, D.C., during dinner to serve him a subpoena. They wanted his private messages with California legislators, college students, and former OpenAI employees.\nCalvin says the move was part of OpenAI’s intimidation tactics around a new piece of AI regulation, California’s SB 53. He says the company weaponized its ongoing legal battle with Elon Musk as a pretext to target critics, implying Encode was secretly funded by Musk. Calvin added that he fought OpenAI’s opposition to California’s SB 53, an AI safety bill, and that when he saw OpenAI claim that it “worked to improve the bill,” he “literally laughed out loud.” In a social media skein, he went on to call Lehane, specifically, the “master of the political dark arts.”\nIn Washington, that might be a compliment. At a company like OpenAI whose mission is “to build AI that benefits all of humanity,” it sounds like an indictment.\nBut what matters much more is that even OpenAI’s own people are conflicted about what they are becoming.\nAs my colleague Max reported last week, a number of current and former employees took to social media after Sora 2 was released, expressing their misgivings. Among them was Boaz Barak, an OpenAI researcher and Harvard professor, who wrote about Sora 2 that it is “technically amazing but it’s premature to congratulate ourselves on avoiding the pitfalls of other social media apps and deepfakes.”\nOn Friday, Josh Achiam – OpenAI’s head of mission alignment – tweeted something even more remarkable about Calvin’s accusation. Prefacing his comments by saying they were “possibly a risk to my whole career,”  Achiam went on to write of OpenAI: “We can’t be doing things that make us into a frightening power instead of a virtuous one. We have a duty to and a mission for all of humanity. The bar to pursue that duty is remarkably high.”\nIt’s worth pausing to think about that. An OpenAI executive publicly questioning whether his company is becoming “a frightening power instead of a virtuous one,” isn’t on a par with a competitor taking shots or a reporter asking questions. This is someone who chose to work at OpenAI, who believes in its mission, and who is now acknowledging a crisis of conscience despite the professional risk.\nIt’s a crystallizing moment, one whose contradictions may only intensify as OpenAI races toward artificial general intelligence. It also has me thinking that the real question isn’t whether Chris Lehane can sell OpenAI’s mission. It’s whether others – including, critically, the other people who work there – still believe it.\n",

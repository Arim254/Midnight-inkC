    "body": "\nUber Eats is partnering with sidewalk delivery robot company Starship Technologies to deliver food in the U.K. starting later this year.\nThe companies will start the service in the Leeds and Sheffield areas “from select merchants” in December and expand from there. Uber said the service will expand to “additional European markets in 2026” and the U.S. in 2027. \nThe tie-up with Starship is the latest in an increasingly long line of partnerships Uber has struck with autonomous vehicle companies of all shapes and sizes. But Starship’s not the first sidewalk robot company to work with Uber Eats. Uber’s food delivery arm has used Serve Robotics’ robots for a few years in the U.S. Uber started using Avride’s sidewalk robots earlier this year, too.\nStarship claims to have nearly 3,000 of its six-wheeled delivery robots in operation around the world, across more than 270 different locations. The robots typically make deliveries in under 30 minutes and travel no more than two miles.\n",

Semrush had a market capitalization of about $1 billion as of Tuesday’s close.\nBy acquiring Semrush, Adobe is betting that companies will choose to invest in optimizing their content and web pages to be more visible to AI tools, as people increasingly use AI chatbots, agents, and AI browsers to do everything from getting the news and finding recipes to shopping and booking their travel. This is a fresh, big market for existing search engine optimization players like Semrush, particularly as this change in consumer behavior drives increasing traffic to websites from generative AI tools.\nIndeed, as of October, traffic to retail websites from generative AI chatbots increased 1,200% compared to a year earlier, per Adobe Analytics data.\nSemrush has been investing in what it calls “generative engine optimization,” and recently launched a tool for tracking and improving website performance using both traditional SEO techniques and optimization for AI engines, like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Grok, and Perplexity.\n“Brand visibility is being reshaped by generative AI, and brands that don’t embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe’s Digital Experience Business. “With Semrush, we’re unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n",

Once they turn 16, they will be able to access their old account as they left it.\nIt will be a challenge, however, for Meta to determine which users are under the age of 16, since people aren’t always truthful about their age when signing up for social media services. But digital age checks are notoriously difficult to execute in a manner that’s safe and effective. Identity verification services are high-profile targets for hacks, and the implications of even a minor security vulnerability are severe, since personal information and government documents can be exposed.\nIdentity verification platforms have already proven problematic for users’ security.

    "body": "\nIf you want insight into just how worried VCs (and Silicon Valley, generally) are over legal challenges to AI training on copyrighted material, look no further than AI music site Suno. \nSuno, which allows anyone to create AI-generated songs through prompts, announced on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \nThe company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September. It has now hit $200 million in annual revenue, Suno told The Wall Street Journal. \nIt previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. \nBut Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission.  \nThose types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material. \nBut given Suno’s market success, growth, and the obvious potential market for AI-generated music, its legal complications are a shoulder shrug to investors. \n“Type an idea, click Create, and suddenly, you’re not just imagining music — you’re making it. That shift from listener to creator? That’s what Suno unlocks,” the Menlo VCs who backed the startup describe in their blog post about the investment.\nMenlo didn’t just like the tech, but also that Suno has grown largely through word of mouth — people sharing songs on their group texts, the investors said. \nNo doubt the AI industry is, and will continue, to eventually work out the legal ramifications of acting first, asking for permission later, over training data. But before that’s settled, the era of AI-generated music has clearly arrived.\n",

    "body": "\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang struck a bullish tone in the company’s third-quarter earnings. And based on the company’s results, there may be reason to.\nNvidia reported revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter, 62% higher compared to the same quarter last year. The company’s net income on a GAAP basis was $32 billion, 65% higher year-over-year. Both revenue and profit results beat Wall Street expectations.\nThe revenue picture shows a company booming thanks largely to its data center business. Revenue generated by Nvidia’s data center business was a record $51.2 billion, up 25% from the previous quarter and up 66% from a year ago. The remaining $5.8 billion in revenue came from Nvidia’s gaming business with $4.2 billion, followed by sales in professional visualization and automotive.\nNvidia’s CFO Colette Kress noted in a statement to shareholders its data center business has been fueled by an acceleration of computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. During the company’s Q3 call, Kress said in this past quarter, the company announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs.\n“This demand spans every market, CSPs, sovereigns, modern builders enterprises and super computing centers, and includes multiple landmark build outs,” Kress said.\nBlackwell Ultra, a GPU unveiled in March and available in several configurations, has been particularly strong and is now the leader within the company. Previous versions of the Blackwell architecture also saw continued strong demand, according to the company. \nHuang said sales of its Blackwell GPU chips “are off the charts.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Huang said in the company’s Q3 earnings statement. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”\nKress did note that the company’s shipments of H20, a data center GPU designed for generative AI and high-performance computing, were 50 million, a disappointing result due to its inability to sell to China.\n“Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China,,” Kress noted on the earnings call. “While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the U.S. and China governments, and will continue to advocate for America’s ability to compete around the world.” \nImportantly, Nvidia is forecasting more growth with a projected revenue of $65 billion in the fourth quarter, helping push its share price up more than 4% in after-hours trading. \nThe upshot, at least in Huang’s view: forget about the bubble, there is only growth. \n“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Jensen said during the company’s earnings call. “From our vantage point, we see something very different.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nGoogle Maps is rolling out new features designed to help users save time and feel more prepared, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tool. The navigation app is also launching an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature.\nNow, when users search for places in Maps like restaurants, hotels, or concert venues, they’ll see a new “know before you go” tips section that will surface important information about the place. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, what secret menu items are, what the best place to park is, and more. Users can click on each tip to get more information.\nThis “know before you go” tips section is rolling out now in the U.S. on Android and iOS.\nImage Credits:Google\nAs for the updated Explore tab, Google has made it easier and faster to find trending spots near you. Users can now swipe up to see trending and popular restaurants, activities, and sights nearby, such as a new cafe that just opened up or a quirky art gallery around the corner.\nThe tech giant says it’s now also easier to find curated lists from sources like Viator, Lonely Planet, and OpenTable, in addition to local influencers.\nThe updated Explore tab starts rolling out this month globally on Android and iOS.\nImage Credits:Google\nAdditionally, the company announced that EV drivers can now see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination by searching for “EV chargers” in Maps. Google is using AI to analyze historical and real-time charger availability to predict how many chargers are likely to be free upon arrival. \nEV charger availability predictions start rolling out next week on Android Auto and cars with Google built-in.\nGoogle is also making it possible for users to leave reviews under a nickname, such as “Eager Elf” or “Julia Loves Sweets.” Reviews are still associated with a Google Account behind the scenes, so users can only leave one review per business. This prevents them from swapping out nicknames to leave the business a series of bad reviews — a practice known as review bombing.  \nWednesday’s announcement follows Google Maps’ recent integration of Gemini, which lets users ask about points of interest along their route, get answers on topics like sports or news, and perform tasks such as adding events to their calendar. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAutonomous electric tractor startup Monarch Tractor warned staff Thursday it may need to lay off more than 100 employees, or possibly even ‘shut down,’ according to a company-wide memo obtained by TechCrunch.\nThe memo comes after Monarch Tractor was already cutting some positions over the last few weeks at its California corporate facilities and remote teams in India and Singapore, according to multiple former employees who spoke with TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity.\nMonarch Tractor was founded in 2018 by a team that included a former top executive at Tesla’s first gigafactory and Carlo Mondavi, a scion of the famous winemaking family. The company raised at least $220 million, including $133 million in 2024, as it pursued a goal of making “driver optional” autonomous tractors that could perform tasks at places like wineries and other fruit farms.\nWhile Monarch Tractor claims to have shipped around 500 of those tractors to date, the company announced a restructuring in late 2024 that was supposed see its tractors expand to other use cases, like pushing feed at dairy farming and maintaining golf courses. CEO Praveen Penmesta also said at the time that Monarch Tractor would focus more on selling software services and licensing the company’s autonomous tech.\nAt least one customer — one of Monarch Tractors’ first dealers — claims the autonomous tech never worked well, if at all, according to a lawsuit first reported by TechCrunch this week. Idaho dealership Burks Tractor claimed Monarch sold it “defective” vehicles that experienced “significant problems” after they arrived in 2024. Primarily, Burks accused Monarch’s tractors of being “unable to operate autonomously.” (Monarch denied the claims in a court filing.)\nMonarch Tractor suggests to employees in the memo on Thursday it is trying to pivot even harder away from making tractors — which may not be surprising, given that the startup lost its contract manufacturer, Foxconn, earlier this year.\n“The new business plan will enable Monarch customers to launch fully commercialized software as a service (SaaS) autonomy and other software offerings direct to consumers, unlocking new revenue streams to OEMs,” the startup’s human resources team wrote. “Unfortunately, the timing for completing the transition to the new business plan puts Monarch at risk of shut down.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMonarch told employees in the memo it may permanently lay off “up to 102 employees.”\nIt’s unclear how many people currently work for Monarch. The startup had around 300 employees in late 2024 when it laid off more than 10% of the company as part of the restructuring. The former employees familiar with the recent cuts could not say exactly how large those layoffs were. Penmesta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThrough this year, Monarch Tractor has also lost some top talent, including the co-founder from Tesla, Mark Schwager. \n“We started Monarch with a daring vision: that farming could be electrified, automated, smart and made more profitable — all at once,” Schwager wrote in a LinkedIn post in July, while explaining he would remain on the company’s board. “Monarch is in great position and in great hands for the next leg of its trajectory – making the timing right for this transition.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhen Anthony Sardain began developing Cavela in 2023, an AI startup that helps brands automate supplier sourcing, he did not foresee that new tariffs would drive customers to become increasingly wary of manufacturing products in China.\n“You don’t just walk into Vietnam and build up a supply chain,” Sardain told TechCrunch. “A lot of brands find one supplier, and they hang on for the rest of their life, because they really don’t want to lose it.”\nThat’s especially true for small and midsize companies that lack dedicated, global sourcing departments. Sardain claims that Cavela solves this problem through its AI agents, software tools that perform tasks autonomously and, in this case, act as a personal procurement team. These agents can find potential suppliers in over 40 countries and negotiate product specifications and pricing.\nOn Wednesday, Cavela announced that it raised $6.6 million in seed funding co-led by XYZ Venture Capital and Susa Ventures, with participation from Crossover Capital.\nFinding suppliers and negotiating pricing with them is an inherently arcane, time-consuming process, and, according to Sardain, it was impossible to automate without generative AI.\n“Making products involves a lot of text data, image data, diagrams, sketches, photos. This is the kind of data that didn’t play nice with technology up until AI,” Sardain said.\nThe latest LLM and image models allow brands to upload their complete product information, including specifications, blueprints, and all other details about the item they want produced, directly into Cavela’s AI agent. Based on those particulars, the agent identifies dozens of potential manufacturers and then instantly contacts those factories via WhatsApp, email, or text to understand production capacity and lead times and to collect pricing quotes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSardain claims the entire process is seamless, sparing brands from sending hundreds of messages back and forth. “They log in a couple of days later, and there are quotes in their inbox,” he said. Companies then typically ask a shortlist of potential suppliers to send product samples, which aids in selecting one or more factories for final production.\nCavela estimates that its customers not only substantially reduce the time spent searching for manufacturing partners, but they also save an average of 35% on production costs.\n“If you get 100 quotes, you’re going to, by chance, land on a much lower price, and you’re also going to get a much better supplier in the process,” Sardain said.\nCavela’s customers, including fire-resistant apparel brand Western Welder Outfitting and men’s grooming brand The Longhairs, report that the startup helped them find manufacturers who produce goods at a significantly lower cost — even below pre-tariff pricing.\nSardain, a former data science lead for the data analysis startup Tierra, traces his knowledge of trade and sourcing back three generations within his family. He grew up living across Asian trade centers, including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, and mainland China, which gave him a valuable understanding of how local manufacturers approach their work.\nCavela’s competitors include Alibaba, which connects brands to thousands of manufacturers in China, and Pietra, a brand operations startup that similarly helps businesses source goods with the help of AI.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify has acquired the community-run database tracking sampled music, WhoSampled, the company announced Wednesday. The streaming service had also shared the news as part of its Wednesday blog post about new song credits features.\nDeal terms were not disclosed, but Spotify confirmed to TechCrunch the acquisition is for both the WhoSampled team and database. (The company had only a handful of employees, per data on PitchBook and LinkedIn, which both confirm around 10 staffers.)\nLaunched in 2008, London-based WhoSampled offers an extensive database of songs, samples, covers, remixes, artists, and more. According to its website, it’s now tracking more than 1.2 million songs and nearly 622,000 samples. That data is powering Spotify’s latest features, like its upcoming music discovery tool SongDNA, also announced on Wednesday.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nHowever, WhoSampled was known to Spotify for some time, as it had partnered with the streamer back in 2016 to allow its users to access their Spotify playlists and saved tracks in its app.\nIn WhoSampled’s announcement about the acquisition, the company said its stand-alone platform and brand would remain after the deal’s closure, and it expected to offer some user-facing improvements as it becomes part of Spotify’s larger business. For instance, the company said moderation times for submissions would be sped up, the site will be able to remove display ads in the weeks ahead, and its mobile apps will become free downloads with free subscriptions.\n“Through our recent discussions with Spotify, it became clear that we share a strong belief in the power of musical context — and a vision for helping listeners go deeper into the songs they love,” the post penned by the WhoSampled team reads. “Spotify has shown a genuine commitment to our mission, and we couldn’t have found a better home for WhoSampled,” it stated.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nFrom electronic health records and blood tests to the stream of data from wearable devices, the amount of health information people generate is accelerating rapidly. Yet, many users struggle to connect this trove of data in a meaningful way and actually use it to improve their health.\nFunction Health, which offers a regular lab testing service to help people track their health, wants to change that by consolidating health data and making it usable for its customers by connecting that data to an AI model. To further that effort, the company recently raised $298 million in a Series B round led by Redpoint Ventures at a valuation of $2.5 billion. \nThe funding round also saw participation from a16z; Aglaé Ventures; Alumni Ventures; NBA athletes Allen Crabbe, Blake Griffin, and Taylor Griffin; Battery Ventures; Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’ investment firm, NFDG; and Roku founder Anthony Wood. The round brings the company’s total capital raised to $350 million.\nAlongside the funding, Function unveiled Medical Intelligence Lab, an effort to build a “medical intelligence” generative AI model that can be used to provide personalized health insights based on users’ data, content, and research. The company said the model is trained by doctors. For its customers, the company is offering an AI chatbot that can answer questions based on their health data and can tap their previous lab results, doctor’s notes, and scans to provide tailored guidance.\n“It is not good enough to be in a world where AI exists and not be applying it to your health,” Jonathan Swerdlin, CEO and co-founder of Function, told TechCrunch. “You should be able to manage your biology. The objective of Function Health is to apply the best available technology to human health.”\nSwerdlin noted the platform meets HIPAA standards, fully encrypts user data, and never sells personal information. “Your data and your identity are never for sale. Every bit of your information is fully encrypted and protected. We are committed to keeping you, and your data, safe.”\nFunction’s chief medical scientist, Dr. Dan Sodickson, and its co-founder and chief medical officer Dr. Mark Hyman, are together leading development of MI Lab and its team of doctors, researchers, and engineers. The MI model is trained by doctors and they stay involved in the process, Swerdlin said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile the space has many players, Function sets itself apart from competitors like Superpower, Neko Health, and InsideTracker thanks to its device-agnostic approach, Swerdlin said, adding that the platform integrates lab testing, diagnostics, and clinical insights to offer more than a typical AI coach or wellness app.\nFunction has 75 locations in the U.S. and members “can get lab tests done at 2,000 Quest locations”, he added. Function says it has completed more than 50 million lab tests since 2023.\nThis article has been updated to reflect that Function members can access tests at 2,000 quest locations. \n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nAuckland-founded Kiki Club launched its peer-to-peer subletting startup in New York City in 2023 with the mission of helping renters sublet their apartments while traveling for extended periods. \nHowever, Kiki’s model violated local short-term rental laws, leading to its shutdown this past June. The New York Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement (OSE) announced on Wednesday that Kiki has agreed to pay more than $152,000 to settle charges. \nBacked by Blackbird, the Airbnb competitor aimed to simplify the subletting process and boldly promised a solution that would let users sublet their spaces for up to six months. The platform used a matching system similar to those of dating apps, connecting listers and renters based on their preferences.\nHowever, the startup found itself on the wrong side of NYC’s short-term rental laws. Specifically, Local Law 18, which was enacted in 2022. This legislation imposes strict guidelines on short-term rentals, allowing them only if the host is registered with the OSE as a short-term rental host and meets additional criteria, such as staying in the same unit as the guests. \nWhen the law was first introduced, many Airbnb hosts found the regulations too difficult to manage, leading to a dramatic 85% drop in short-term rentals, according to Inside Airbnb, an organization that monitors the platform’s data.\nAdditionally, under the law, booking services must use OSE’s verification system to confirm that hosts are either registered or exempt. Unverified transactions face a penalty of $1,500 or three times the revenue earned, whichever is lower.\nAccording to the OSE, Kiki failed to submit quarterly reports of short-term rental transactions for eligible listings and didn’t verify nearly 400 short-term rental transactions. \n“This settlement sends a clear message: If you are a company that facilitates short-term rentals, ignoring city laws will be an expensive proposition,” Christian Klossner, executive director of the OSE, said in a statement. “Kiki Club acted as a clandestine conduit for unregistered and illegal short-term rentals, directly undermining the city’s efforts to protect tenants and preserve permanent housing.”  \nWhile Kiki did not admit or deny the findings, it paid the penalties. A spokesperson for Kiki previously acknowledged in an interview with SmartCompany that the company was aware it was operating in a “gray regulatory area.”\nAnd, despite facing such significant consequences in New York, Kiki isn’t throwing in the towel. In June, the startup announced its launch in London. \nIt’s important to note that the U.K. also has regulations concerning illegal renting. Renting to someone who doesn’t have the right to rent in the U.K. can lead to up to five years in prison or a hefty fine.\nHopefully, the startup learned a valuable lesson in New York so its London-based platform doesn’t meet the same fate.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

Now a startup called Poly is launching a service that encourages you to dump all your files into one place so you can query them to find the right content.\nAt launch, it’s giving 100GB of storage to users on its free tier.\nThis is Poly’s second inning from a product perspective. \nThe company was started by founders Abhay Agarwal and Sam Young in 2022. Young has since left the company. At that time, the startup, which had participated in the startup accelerator Y Combinator, allowed users to create 3D assets using prompts.\nAgarwal, who is a research fellow at Microsoft and worked on vision AI to help the visually impaired, said the company didn’t predict that the AI image and asset generation industry would blow up and competitors would raise large sums rapidly. That’s when the team decided to pivot.\n“We interviewed our users and asked them what the pain points of their workflows were that could be solved by AI. Turned out that one big unmet need for users was organizing their file system. As a user, you have a lot of files on your computer, and it is hard to find stuff. We wanted to solve for that,” Agarwal said.\nHe said that the startup shut down the previous iteration of Poly in 2023, went into stealth, and started building the new cloud-based file organizer. \nThe company is now launching the product for the public after testing it in closed beta for a few months. Currently, you can use Poly on the web or Mac, with a Windows version coming soon. The company will start onboarding users from its waitlist starting today. \nPoly has raised $8 million in seed funding led by Felicis, with participation from Bloomberg Beta, NextView, Figma Ventures, AI Grant, Wing Ventures, and MVP Ventures. This includes the prior $3.9 million round raised in 2022.\n“File systems are incredibly powerful and elegant, but most people have forgotten about them. Poly is bringing file systems as the center of interaction. The tool is designed in a way that allows you to use AI to think in a clearer way,” James Cham, a partner at the early-stage investment firm Bloomberg Beta told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Poly\nPoly acts like a cloud storage tool with AI-powered search. At the moment, the tool supports text, PDF, office docs, images, audio, video, and web files (URLs). You can upload files to Poly, tag them, ask the AI assistant questions about them, and even ask it to summarize or translate the files. Plus, the tool organizes your files for you and can create new folders or rename files, as needed.\nAgarwal views it as an upgrade to Google’s NotebookLM, which people use to put files into a project, ask questions, and generate insights as audio or video. However, while Poly might be a better file organizer, it doesn’t have access to the latest web knowledge or the ability to create audio or video.\nThe founder added that, in the coming months, the tool will add more features, including web search, support for creating stylized reports within the app, a text and markdown editor, and the ability to add custom metadata. It will also allow users to paste Google Docs links and let people use AI agents to perform calculations and analysis on spreadsheets.\nWith Poly, users can create shared drives, add files, and invite others to ask questions about them, which could be useful when you are on a project with other people. The startup said it also plans to add a feature to let users directly share individual files and folders.\nImage Credits:Poly\nPoly will directly compete with the likes of Dropbox and Google Drive, both of which have their own search tools. In my experience of using Poly’s tool for a few days, the search worked better than Google’s. Plus, there is an added benefit of just pasting the YouTube video’s link and generating a summary about it. \nWhile there are plenty of AI and search offerings on the market, one of Poly’s biggest advantages is its 100GB of storage for free users, which is much more than the free tiers of other storage services. You can also choose to pay $10 a month for 2TB of storage. Right now, there is no direct photo sync, but in the future, if the company builds features around it, Poly can be a good Google Photos alternative.\nEven though the tool offers substantial storage, Agarwal said that early testers have used it as a working storage for projects.\n“Our primary focus is on Gen AI native creators and knowledge workers — people who are researching content or searching through their files. For instance, a service executive who wants to get insights out of many customer calls,” he said.\nThe company currently offers a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for you to use Poly within tools like ChatGPT or Cursor. While Poly doesn’t have direct integration with other tools for syncing, Agarwal believes that, as the app supports virtual file references, it can work on importing files from different services.\n",

    "body": "\nI guess we’re past the era of “and that’s what you missed on Glee.” Amazon’s Prime Video streamer is adding AI-generated “Video Recaps” to help viewers catch up between seasons of shows, the company announced on Wednesday.\nAccording to Amazon, the feature “utilizes generative AI to create theatrical-quality season recaps with synchronized narration, dialogue, and music.” It will begin rolling out in beta on Wednesday for select Prime Originals, like “Fallout,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” and “Upload.”\nPrime Video launched a similar AI-powered feature last year called “X-Ray Recaps,” which summarizes complete seasons, episodes, or parts of episodes — at the time, Amazon said that its AI model had guardrails in place to make sure that these recaps don’t inadvertently share spoilers.\nImage Credits:Prime Video\nConsumers have become accustomed to these kinds of text-based AI summaries, since they likely see them when their phone summarizes texts, or when they see a (perhaps unwanted) AI summary at the top of their Google results. But these video summaries veer into newer territory, which may appear more obtrusive in the viewing experience than text summaries — or, maybe they’ll be embraced by people who don’t remember what happened on “Bosch.”\nPrime Video’s competitors are also exploring how they can integrate generative AI into their products. \nYouTube TV, for example, uses a “Key Plays” feature to help viewers catch up on sports games if they start watching while the game is in progress. While it’s a bit imperfect (its algorithm seems to only be able to identify key offensive plays in baseball), the feature helped YouTube TV win its first Technical Emmy Award.\nNetflix, meanwhile, is using generative AI on the production side of its business.\nEarlier this year, Netflix said it used generative AI in the final footage for the first time in the Argentine show “The Eternaut” to create a scene of a building collapsing. After that, “Happy Gilmore 2” used generative AI to make characters look younger in the film’s opening scene, and the producers of “Billionaires’ Bunker” used it in pre-production to envision wardrobe and set design.\nThe use of AI in the film industry has sparked much debate, as artists worry that these tools — which sometimes are trained without permission on their work — could endanger their livelihoods. But some argue that tools that speed up tedious busywork in animation or special effects, like Wonder Dynamics, could expand the capacity for artists to create.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

Exports intended for humanitarian aid, such as public health emergencies and disaster relief, will be exempt from the license requirements.</p>\n<p>As the world’s largest producer of rare earth minerals, China has leveraged its position extensively to negotiate with other countries, especially the U.S., which has, of late, threatened to increase the scope of chipmaking equipment and chips that are not allowed to be exported to China. Rare earth minerals are critical in a wide range of industries, from solar panels and batteries for electric vehicles to chipmaking and aerospace.</p>\n<p>China’s new restrictions are a mirror to the U.S.’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/05/2024-28270/foreign-produced-direct-product-rule-additions-and-refinements-to-controls-for-advanced-computing\">Foreign Direct Product rule</a>, which was expanded by the Biden administration last year as the U.S. sought to limit exports of chipmaking equipment from foreign countries to China. Thursday’s announcement comes after Beijing in April added several rare earth minerals to its export control list in retaliation for Trump’s tariffs, sparking a major global shortage.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n</div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<p>Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p></p><h2 id=\"h-latest-in\">Latest in Government & Policy</h2><p></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Plastic recycling startup Novoloop has inked a deal with a major manufacturer to produce its upcycled thermoplastic polyurethane at commercial scale, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.</p>\n<p>The agreement helps nudge the Menlo Park-based Novoloop through the so-called “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/27/climate-startup-valley-of-death/\">valley of death</a>” that many climate tech startups must slog through. </p>\n<p>Startups that depend on hardware are particularly susceptible to stumbling in the valley, the dreaded moment when they’ve proven their initial technology and have not generated sufficient revenues from selling their product.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the deal, Novoloop will supply Huide Science and Technology with a chemical building block used to make thermoplastic polyurethane. Novoloop makes the material, known as a polyol, from post-consumer polyethylene waste like plastic bags, one of the hardest materials to recycle.</p>\n<p>Thermoplastic polyurethanes, or TPU, are a type of plastic that’s used in everything from running shoes to medical devices. </p>\n<p>“For this product line, we have essentially achieved what would be the commercial relationship,” Novoloop co-founder and CEO Miranda Wang told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>At this point, Novoloop is constrained in its ability to supply polyols, Wang said. Earlier this year in India, the startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/novoloop-is-making-tons-of-upcycled-plastic/\">commissioned its demonstration plant</a>, which is capable of producing tens of tons of the material per year.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The demonstration plant’s capacity is sufficient to produce enough TPU for “major pilot projects,” Wang said, including one for a footwear customer that will be announced in the coming months. Previously, Novoloop supplied Swiss shoe manufacturer On with its Lifecycled material for the tread of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/21/materials-startup-novoloop-brings-its-upcycled-rubber-to-ons-new-running-shoe/\">its Cloudprime sneaker</a>.</p>\n<p>Deals like the one with Huide will be key for the Novoloop’s progress, Wang said. “The biggest hurdle to profitability is economies of scale,” she said. “A lot of the focus next year will be driving a lot of these customer deals to close so that we can finance the [commercial-scale] facilities.”</p>\n<p>Once the deals and financing fall into place, Novoloop expects to have its commercial plant up and running in early 2028, Wang said. The first version should be able to supply enough polyols to produce about 16,000 tons of TPU annually.</p>\n<p>“When we can run the materials at those types of volumes, we expect to be able to be at price parity with virgin TPUs,” she said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. </p>\r\n<p>De Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>After OpenAI’s video-generating app Sora <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/openais-sora-soars-to-no-1-on-the-u-s-app-store/\">surged to the No. 1 position</a> on the U.S. App Store, it has now, technically, experienced a bigger first week than ChatGPT on iOS, according to new data from app intelligence provider <a href=\"http://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appfigures</a>. Its estimates show that Sora saw 627,000 iOS downloads in its first seven days of availability, compared with ChatGPT’s 606,000 iOS downloads during its first week.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the fairest comparison, however, because ChatGPT was available only in the U.S. during its first week, while Sora is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada at launch. Still, Appfigures says that Canada contributed about 45,000 installs, so the Sora launch was about 96% of ChatGPT’s launch, if the data had been based on the U.S. numbers only.</p>\n<p>This level of consumer adoption is worth noting because Sora remains an invite-only app, while ChatGPT was more publicly available at launch. That makes Sora’s performance more impressive.</p>\n<p>During its first day, Sora saw 56,000 app installs in short order, bumping the app to become the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store. By Friday, October 3, it reached No. 1. That surge had already put Sora’s debut ahead of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and put it on par with xAI’s Grok launch.</p>\n<p>A quick scan of social media provides plenty of anecdotes that support Appfigures’ data. Sora videos, which uses the new Sora 2 video model and gives users the ability to generate realistic deepfakes, seem to be everywhere. Users are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/you-cant-libel-the-dead-but-that-doesnt-mean-you-should-deepfake-them/\">even creating deepfakes of dead people</a>, a use case that has prompted Zelda Williams, daughter of the late actor Robin Williams, to ask folks to stop sending her AI-generated images of her father.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png 1730w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Appfigures</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Per Appfigures, the app has seen steady adoption since its first day on the market, September 30, 2025.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Zendesk announced Wednesday at its AI summit a string of LLM-driven products meant to reshape the company’s reliance on human technicians.</p>\n<p>The center of the new features is an autonomous support agent that Zendesk believes will solve 80% of support issues without human intervention. That system will be supplemented by a co-pilot agent, which will assist human technicians with the remaining 20% of issues, as well as an admin-layer agent, a voice-based agent, and an analytics agent.</p>\n<p>According to Shashi Upadhyay, Zendesk’s president of Product, Engineering and AI, the new agents are part of a broader change in the support industry, as AI replaces much of the work that was previously done by humans.</p>\n<p>“The world’s going to shift from software that’s built for human users, to a system where AI actually does most of the work,” Upadhyay told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Independent benchmarks suggest that contemporary AI models are capable of taking on the work. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12045\" target=\"_blank\">TAU-bench</a>, which was designed to measure a model’s tool-calling ability, includes a scenario in which models have to process a returned product — a close analogue to many support tasks. <a href=\"https://llm-stats.com/benchmarks/tau-bench-retail\" target=\"_blank\">The current leader</a>, Claude Sonnet 4.5, solves 85% of issues on the test.</p>\n<p>After <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/18/zendesks-latest-problem-is-an-activist-investor/\">a chaotic investor fight in 2022</a>, Zendesk has made a string of AI acquisitions that laid the groundwork for the current shift. The analytics agent launching today is built directly on the company’s <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/newsroom/articles/hyperarc-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperarc acquisition</a>, which was completed in July. Earlier AI acquisitions include the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/ai-powered-estonian-qa-startup-klaus-acquired-by-zendesk/\">QA and agentic service system Klaus</a> (acquired in February 2024) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/13/zendesk-adds-flexible-ai-agent-capabilities-with-ultimate-acquisition/\">the automation platform Ultimate</a> (acquired the following March).</p>\n<p>Zendesk has previewed the new system with existing customers, and Upadhyay says the results have been promising.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“For customers that have been using it, consumer satisfaction has been up by five to 10 points,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Large language models have often been deployed for customer support, although rarely at the Zendesk’s scale. Companies from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/airbnb-is-quietly-rolling-out-an-ai-customer-service-bot-in-the-us/\">Airbnb</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/regal-claims-its-customer-service-chatbots-are-better-than-most/\">Regal Theaters</a> have already experimented with in-house chatbot support, often contracting directly with foundation model labs. But those systems typically deal with information retrieval rather than more complex troubleshooting or taking self-directed action.</p>\n<p>If the new push for AI-based support is successful, the economic implications would be significant. Zendesk’s Resolution Platform already supports nearly 20,000 customers, resolving 4.6 billion tickets each year. Beyond Zendesk, the U.S. employs <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/office-and-administrative-support/customer-service-representatives.htm#:~:text=Customer%20service%20representatives%20typically%20use,employed%20in%20nearly%20every%20industry.\" target=\"_blank\">2.4 million customer service representatives</a> — with far larger workforces in other countries.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>\n<p>The deal builds on an earlier partnership between the two entities announced last year, in which Verizon made a $100 million commitment to support AST’s service rollout.</p>\n<p>Verizon is the second major carrier to sign with AST, following a 10-year agreement with Vodafone. For AST, the Verizon deal comes at a critical time as the company races to deploy its BlueBird satellite constellation designed to link directly with unmodified cell phones.</p>\n<p>As of now, the company has successfully placed its first five BlueBird satellites into low Earth orbit, an initial “Block 1” that are intended to deliver “intermittent” coverage across the U.S. Meanwhile, AST is assembling the next generation of satellites — “Block 2” — with plans to deploy between 45-60 satellites by 2026.</p>\n<p>The partnership also underscores how rapidly the satellite-to-cell market is evolving. SpaceX, through its Starlink network, has already started rolling out its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/spacex-gets-fcc-green-light-for-starlink-direct-to-phone-deal-with-t-mobile/\">direct-to-cell service with T-Mobile</a>, and recently bolstered its ambitions further <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/spacex-strikes-17b-deal-to-buy-echostars-spectrum-for-starlinks-direct-to-phone-service/\">by agreeing to acquire $17 billion</a> worth of wireless spectrum from EchoStar.</p>\n<p>AST has already demonstrated 4G and 5G connections between its satellites and smartphones, including voice and video calls, testing milestones that the company says have “proven the capabilities” of its network. But it still faces the challenge of scaling that technology to serve millions of users.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>AST shares jumped by more than 15% on Wednesday after the deal was announced.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Base Power has built one of the largest battery storage systems in Texas in two years — and now it wants to grow faster. </p>\n<p>The Austin-based startup, which had raised <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/a16z-backs-base-power-in-200m-round-for-home-backup-batteries/\">$200 million in April</a>, is back with another $1 billion in funding. The Series C round was led by Addition with participation from CapitalG, Elad Gil, Lightspeed, Ribbit, Thrive Capital, and Valor Equity Partners.</p>\n<p>The new round values the company at $3 billion pre-money, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/business/dealbook/base-power-fundraise-dell.html\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Base Power has sold more than 100 megawatt-hours’ worth of its home storage batteries in Texas — a notable figure considering the company was founded in 2023.</p>\n<p>Base Power leases the batteries to homeowners, who pay between $695 and $995 upfront to install 25 kilowatt-hour or 50 kilowatt-hour batteries, both of which dwarf the competition. (For instance, the 25-kilowatt battery doubles a single Tesla Powerwall.) The batteries can keep a household powered for as long as 48 hours, according to the company.</p>\n<p>Customers also pay a monthly fee ($19 or $29) and commit to buying electricity from Base Power for three years at 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour plus delivery fees. </p>\n<p>By leasing the batteries, Base Power has lowered a significant hurdle for many homeowners: the upfront cost of home storage batteries. The batteries themselves run thousands of dollars for less storage capacity, not including installation costs.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Base Power has also taken advantage of Texas’ deregulated utility market, which allows households to easily switch electricity suppliers. </p>\n<p>The state’s utility regulator handsomely rewards power providers that can respond quickly with large amounts of electricity when the grid needs it most, something grid-scale batteries excel at. In exchange for the low upfront cost, Base Power customers agree to allow the company to use the batteries to sell electricity back to the grid when they don’t need them for backup power.</p>\n<p>In addition to expansion beyond Texas, the company is also planning to build a second battery factory in the United States. It is currently constructing its first factory near Austin, Texas.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>DoorDash customers in Los Angeles might soon have their food brought to them by one of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/serve-robotics/\">Serve Robotics</a>’ sidewalk delivery bots. The two companies on Thursday announced a multi-year partnership that would see them using autonomous robots to make deliveries across the U.S.  </p>\n<p>The tie-up comes a week after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/doordash-unveils-dot-its-autonomous-robot-built-to-deliver-your-food/\">DoorDash unveiled Dot</a>, an autonomous food delivery bot built by the company that’s first being deployed in the Phoenix area. Unlike Serve’s bots, which mainly operate on sidewalks, Dot can ferry food and small packages on roads, bike lanes and sidewalks at speeds up to 20 miles per hour.  </p>\n<p>Serve is the latest in a string of emerging tech partnerships for DoorDash, which has joined hands with companies like <a href=\"https://about.doordash.com/en-us/news/doordash-and-coco-expand-global-partnership\" target=\"_blank\">sidewalk bot startup Coco</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/wing-and-doordash-launch-drone-deliveries-in-dallas-fort-worth/\" target=\"_blank\">drone startup Wing</a>. According to Ashu Rege, VP of autonomy at DoorDash Labs, the company’s robotics and automation division, it’s all part of a broader plan to become a platform for multimodal deliveries.  </p>\n<p>DoorDash isn’t the first app company to ply such avenues. Uber has been striking partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies across its ride-hail, delivery and freight businesses, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/serve-robotics-raises-additional-80m-as-it-scales-sidewalk-delivery-robots/\">Serve is one</a> of those companies. Similar to how gig workers operate, Serve’s bots will work with both Uber and DoorDash simultaneously.  </p>\n<p>But DoorDash is doing something different here: it’s throwing its own hat in the ring. </p>\n<p>Other companies have attempted this strategy, too. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/uber-atg-1-billion-toyota-denso-vision-fund-spin-out/\">Uber</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/\">Lyft</a> both tried and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/\">failed</a> to operate both the technology stack and platform for autonomous ride-hailing. And AV startup Nuro started out with a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/\">similar vehicle to Dot</a> before it realized that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/11/nuro-pivots-to-license-self-driving-tech-to-carmakers-mobility-companies/\">manufacturing is a capital sinkhole</a>. </p>\n<p>All three companies took the scenic route to realize that it’s more <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/ubers-self-driving-car-unit-was-burning-20-million-a-month/\">cost-effective</a> to focus on their core technology and offerings.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Rege thinks DoorDash will be different. The company plans to manufacture Dot at scale, but Rege declined to provide specific details. DoorDash had its first <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/DASH-Q4-2024-Ex-99-1-Press-release.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">profitable year in 2024</a>, and reported <a href=\"https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2025/DoorDash-Releases-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">record profits</a> in the first half of 2025, thanks to a 20% increase in delivery volumes compared to a year earlier. He argues that the company <em>needs</em> more ways to make deliveries if it’s going to continue serving its growing customer base.  </p>\n<p>Moreover, Rege thinks Dot brings something to the table that other form factors don’t. “We felt there was a gap. On the one end, you have sidewalk robots, and on the other hand robotaxis, which are great for moving people, but they do not address the delivery problem of that last 10 feet,” he said. “A burrito is not going to walk itself to your door. And for merchants, they don’t want to […] go find this robot that’s parked half a block away.” </p>\n<p>While sidewalk robots may work well in dense urban environments, Rege said Dot will fill the gap in “dense suburban deliveries” within a range of three to five miles. Dot’s ability to traverse the roads <em>and</em> sidewalks is “a really key part,” he said.</p>\n<p>Of course, a person can do all of this with ease, but DoorDash says it plans to reserve its human workforce for more “complex” restaurant, retail or grocery trips.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google on Thursday launched a comprehensive AI platform for businesses called Gemini Enterprise, the latest effort by the Alphabet-owned company to compete with Anthropic and OpenAI in the fast-growing market for workplace AI tools.</p>\n<p>As part of the launch, Google announced several new Gemini Enterprise customers, including the software design firm Figma; the buy-now-pay-later company Klarna; the foodservice distributor Gordon Foods; Australian retail bank Macquarie Bank; and Virgin Voyages, a cruise line that has deployed more than 50 specialized AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks on Gemini Enterprise.</p>\n<p>Gemini Enterprise builds on previous iterations of the company’s efforts to bring AI capabilities to businesses. But Google says this shouldn’t be mistaken as a mere rebranding, despite the ever-changing and sometimes overlapping nomenclature used by its enterprise brand Google Workspace. For instance, Google Workspace adopted the Gemini branding in February 2024 and announced add-on generative AI products called Gemini Enterprise that were available to businesses. Google discontinued that Workspace Gemini Enterprise add-on earlier this year after it began including AI features in its Workspace Business and Enterprise plans.</p>\n<p>The Gemini Enterprise that launched Thursday isn’t a Workspace add-on product; it’s a separate and secure platform under Google Cloud that that functions as an AI agent toolkit — essentially a suite of tools that lets companies build and deploy their own AI assistants. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian described it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-gemini-enterprise\">in a blog post </a>as “the new front door for AI in the workplace.”</p>\n<p>Gemini Enterprise is designed to let businesses securely create, share, and use AI agents for a variety of workplace tasks in sales, marketing, engineering, human resources, and finance. Google also said that, for the first time, these AI agents can access, combine, and analyze information from internal systems and Google AI tools like Code Assist and Deep Research within a single enterprise workflow.</p>\n<p>All of this work is conducted through a Gemini Enterprise chatbot that connects to a worker’s data, including Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, as well as business applications like Salesforce and SAP. The platform includes Google’s Gemini AI models alongside other products such as a collection of pre-built Google agents for deep research and data insights, a no-code product that lets workers analyze information and automate internal processes, and a central governance framework that lets users visualize, secure, and audit all of their agents from one place.</p>\n<p>This new “front door for AI in the workplace” does have a price. The company said its annual Gemini Enterprise standard and “plus” editions start at $30 per seat per month. A cheaper Gemini Business annual plan, which is meant for small businesses, startups, or individual departments within a larger company, cost $21 per seat per month. Google said the business edition will launch Thursday and includes a 30-day free trial period for all customers.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Gemini Enterprise reflects Google’s latest effort to capture a bigger share of the enterprise market, which has become increasingly crowded as generative AI becomes a more important workplace tool.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE25012\" target=\"_blank\">investigation</a> into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving tech after receiving reports that the software caused vehicles to run red lights or cross into wrong lanes.</p>\n<p>The probe, which identified more than 50 reports of these kinds of violations (four of which led to injuries), is one of the first specifically targeted at Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistance software. The NHTSA previously opened an investigation into FSD in October 2024 after receiving reports of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/18/teslas-full-self-driving-software-under-investigation-by-federal-safety-regulator/\" target=\"_blank\">crashes in low-visibility conditions</a>.</p>\n<p>The federal safety agency in April 2024 closed an investigation into Tesla’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/26/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-closed-fatal-crashes/\" target=\"_blank\">less-capable Autopilot system</a> after identifying 13 fatal crashes related to the misuse of that software. A separate investigation into the efficacy of the fix Tesla issued to Autopilot remains open.</p>\n<p>The new investigation was opened the same week that Tesla released the latest version of the software, which CEO Elon Musk has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/10/07/tesla-fsd-v14-release-notes/\">spent months hyping up</a>. This new version is supposed to incorporate training data that Tesla acquired during its limited robotaxi pilot, currently underway in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p>The safety agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) said on Thursday that it has received at least 18 complaints and one media report alleging that Tesla’s FSD software failed to stop the car or stay stopped at red lights. In addition, ODI said it identified six reports from Tesla under the agency’s Standing General Order for Crash Reporting (SGO), which requires companies to submit information about crashes involving autonomous or partially autonomous cars.</p>\n<p>ODI said it has already worked with Maryland’s Transportation Authority and its State Police to determine if some of the red light problems are repeatable, since “multiple subject incidents occurred at the same intersection in Joppa, Maryland.” Tesla has already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection,” according to the NHTSA.</p>\n<p>ODI also said on Thursday it had identified 18 complaints, two media reports, and two SGO reports from Tesla about instances in which FSD “entered opposing lanes of travel during or following a turn, crossed double-yellow lane markings while proceeding straight, or attempted to turn onto a road in the wrong direction despite the presence of wrong-way road signs.” </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>ODI said it has identified six complaints, one media report, and four SGO reports where a Tesla with FSD engaged drove straight through an intersection from a turn lane, or turned from a through lane.</p>\n<p>“Some of the reported incidents appeared to involve FSD executing a lane change into an opposing lane of travel with little notice to a driver or opportunity to intervene,” ODI wrote. </p>\n<p>ODI opened what’s known as a “Preliminary Evaluation,” one of the first steps it can take on the way to requiring a recall. The agency said it typically tries to complete these investigations within eight months, although it’s unclear if the federal government shutdown would affect the timeline. </p>\n<p>Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year reportedly made dramatic cuts to NHTSA’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/10/nhtsas-self-driving-safety-staff-reportedly-disproportionally-affected-by-doge-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\">vehicle automation safety staff</a>.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

The plan also offers twice as much memory as the free plan, enabling more personalized responses.</p>\n<p>According to OpenAI, the expansion comes as the company has seen its weekly active user base in Southeast Asia grow by up to four times.  The plan was first launched in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/openai-launches-a-sub-5-chatgpt-plan-in-india/\">India in August</a>, followed by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/after-india-openai-launches-its-affordable-chatgpt-go-plan-in-indonesia/\">Indonesia in September</a>. OpenAI reports that paid subscribers in India have doubled since the launch.</p>\n<p>OpenAI is competing with Google to make affordable AI chatbot subscription plans available in more regions. Google launched its similarly priced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1965490977000640833\">Google AI Plus plan in Indonesia in September</a>, followed by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/googles-cheaper-ai-plus-plan-is-now-available-in-over-40-countries/\">expansion to over 40 countries</a>. The Plus tier gives users access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google’s most advanced AI model, along with creative tools for image and video creation — including Flow (for design), Whisk (for image remixing), and Veo 3 Fast (for video creation) — as well as 200GB of cloud storage.</p>\n<p>The expansion comes at a pivotal moment for OpenAI. At its DevDay 2025 conference this week in San Francisco, CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT has reached 800 million weekly active users globally, up from 700 million in August. The company also unveiled a major platform shift, introducing apps that work directly inside ChatGPT and that transform the chatbot into an ecosystem that’s similar to an app store, with partners like Spotify, Zillow, and Coursera, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\">among others</a>.</p>\n<p>“The evolution we’re trying to make over the next few years is one where ChatGPT itself is more like an operating system where you can come and use applications,” the head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/openais-nick-turley-on-transforming-chatgpt-into-an-operating-system/\">told TechCrunch</a> of the development on the sidelines of the event. “If you want to write, there’s an app for that. If you want to code, there’s an app for that. If you want to interact with goods and services, there are applications for you.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Despite OpenAI’s rapid growth and recent $500 billion valuation, the company reported a $7.8 billion operating loss in the first half of 2025 as it continues spending heavily on AI infrastructure. The company’s affordable subscription tiers, like ChatGPT Go, are seen as an important step toward achieving profitability while expanding its global user base, particularly in high-growth markets across Asia where both OpenAI and Google are aggressively competing for market share.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>At nearly the same moment as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was expressing surprise over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/\">OpenAI’s multibillion-dollar deal</a> with competitor AMD — shortly after his company agreed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\">invest up to $100 billion</a> into the AI model maker — Sam Altman was saying that more such deals are in the works.</p>\n<p>Huang appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/10/08/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-surprised-amd-gave-away-10-percent-of-the-company-in-clever-openai-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC’s Squawk Box</a> on Wednesday. When asked if he knew about the AMD deal before it was announced, he answered, “Not really.”  </p>\n<p>As TechCrunch previously reported, OpenAI’s deal with AMD <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/wall-street-analysts-explain-how-amds-own-stock-will-pay-for-openais-billions-in-chip-purchases/\">is unusual</a>. AMD has agreed to grant OpenAI large tranches of AMD stock — up to 10% of the company over a period of years contingent on factors like increases in stock price. In exchange, OpenAI will use and help develop the chipmaker’s next-generation AI GPUs chips. This makes OpenAI a shareholder in AMD.  </p>\n<p>Nvidia’s deal is the reverse. Nvidia has invested in the AI model-making startup, making it a shareholder in OpenAI. </p>\n<p>While OpenAI has been using Nvidia gear for years through cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Oracle OCI, and CoreWeave, “This is the first time we’re going to sell directly to them,” Huang explained. He added that his company would still continue to supply gear to the cloud makers, too.</p>\n<p>These direct sales, which include AI gear beyond GPUs like systems and networking, are intended to “prepare” OpenAI for the day when it is its own “self-hosted hyperscaler,” Huang said. In other words, when it’s using its own data centers. </p>\n<p>But Huang admits that OpenAI doesn’t “have the money yet” to pay for all of this gear. He estimated that each gigawatt of AI data center will cost OpenAI “$50 to $60 billion,” to cover everything from the land and power to the servers and equipment.   </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>So far, in 2025, OpenAI has commissioned 10 gigawatts’ worth of U.S. facilities through its $500 billion Stargate deal with partners Oracle and SoftBank. (Plus, it penned a $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle.)</p>\n<p>Its partnership with Nvidia was for at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. Its partnership with AMD was for 6 gigawatts. Plus its “Stargate UK” partnership involves expanding data centers in the U.K., and it has other European commitments. By some estimates, OpenAI has this year <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-10-07/openai-s-nvidia-amd-deals-boost-1-trillion-ai-boom-with-circular-deals\" target=\"_blank\">inked $1 trillion worth of such deals</a>.  </p>\n<p>Similar to the AMD deal, Nvidia’s deal has been criticized for being “circular,” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/nvidia-s-massive-openai-deal-fuels-circular-financing-concerns\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg reported</a>. The critics say Nvidia is essentially underwriting OpenAI’s purchases, getting the AI startup’s stock for its efforts. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-altman-to-the-world-expect-more\">Altman to the world: Expect more</h2>\n<p>As Huang was dissecting OpenAI’s infrastructure needs on CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s interview with Andreessen Horowitz’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfE1Wun9xkk\" target=\"_blank\">a16z Podcast</a> dropped.</p>\n<p>During the podcast, a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz told Altman that he’s “very impressed by deal structure improvement,” referring to these most recent deals. Andreessen Horowitz is an OpenAI investor, so it would be shocking if he wasn’t impressed. OpenAI has found a way to potentially obtain billions of dollars of equipment on someone else’s dime. Repeatedly. </p>\n<p>When asked about these recent deals, Altman said, “You should expect much more from us in the coming months.” </p>\n<p>Altman sees OpenAI’s future models and upcoming other products as so much more capable, thereby fueling so much more demand, that “we have decided that it is time to go make a very aggressive infrastructure bet,” he explained.  </p>\n<p>The problem is that OpenAI’s revenue today is currently nowhere near a $1 trillion, though it is, by all accounts, growing rapidly, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-first-half-revenue-rises-16-about-43-billion-information-reports-2025-09-30/\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly hitting $4.5 billion</a> in the first half of 2025.</p>\n<p>Yet Altman obviously believes that eventually all of this investment will pay for itself. “I’ve never been more confident in the research road map in front of us and also the economic value that will come from using those [future] models.” </p>\n<p>But, he said, OpenAI can’t get to all of that economic lushness on its own.</p>\n<p>“To make the bet at this scale, we kind of need the whole industry, or big chunk of the industry, to support it. And this is from the level of electrons to model distribution and all the stuff in between, which is a lot. So we’re going to partner with a lot of people,” Altman said, with more deals expected in the coming months.</p>\n<p>So stand by, tech industry. OpenAI is still wheeling and dealing.</p>\n</div>",

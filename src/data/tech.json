Tesla has avoided requests from current and prospective customers to add CarPlay capability to its infotainment system. Apple CarPlay, as well as rival Android Auto, allows drivers to project their smartphone and many of its apps onto the car’s infotainment display. Tesla is focused on the standard CarPlay and not Apple’s next-generation and more capable version called CarPlay Ultra.\nIn lieu of CarPlay or Android Auto, Tesla has added native apps for streaming music services, including Apple Music, Spotify, and Tidal. Based on user reports, the quality of those apps has been uneven. Those apps also require customers to subscribe to Tesla’s premium connectivity package, which costs $9.99 monthly or $99 annually.\nThe addition of CarPlay could entice some drivers who had written off Tesla to reconsider their decisions. Half of drivers surveyed by McKinsey a couple years ago said that they wouldn’t buy any vehicle lacking CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n",

    "body": "\nGoogle is adding a new feature to its mobile app that could potentially challenge Pinterest in becoming users’ first stop for inspirational imagery: a dedicated images tab. The company announced on Wednesday it is introducing a new “Images” icon at the bottom of Google’s Search app for iOS and Android devices that will display images personalized to the user’s interests.\nThe images will update daily, Google says, noting the feature would offer users a way to organize their creative ideas, or find visual inspiration for things like planning a trip, hosting a party, decorating your apartment, or discovering new fashion.\nThose use cases, of course, are also among the top reasons why users turn to Pinterest and other social apps, like Instagram.\nUsers can browse the images in Google’s new tab, search for other images, and save the images they like to their collections. \nWith the addition, Google is likely hoping to increase user engagement with its app, especially given that AI companies are eating into its search and ads business. \nMore importantly, perhaps, the feature gives Google a new surface inside its popular Search app where it could run advertisements. Already, the company has been spotted testing an ads carousel within the image tab on mobile devices, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see ads appear within this new tab, as well.\nThis isn’t the first time Google has announced a dedicated feature for saving images and other bookmarks from search. The company launched a Collections feature back in 2018, later adding AI features to suggest other items you could save to your collections. However, this feature wasn’t solely focused on images — it also encouraged users to save websites, products, and map locations. \nGoogle says the new images tab in the Search app will roll out over the next few weeks on iOS and Android in the U.S. It didn’t provide a time frame for launching the feature globally.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTikTok announced on Thursday that it’s launching “bulletin board,” a new feature that lets brands and creators share public, one-to-many messages to their followers. Bulletin board is essentially TikTok’s own version of Instagram’s broadcast channels feature that launched in 2023.\nJust like with broadcast channels on Instagram, only the creator of a bulletin board can post messages, and followers are limited to leaving emoji reactions. Bulletin boards support text, image, and video posts.\nThe feature is rolling out to creators who are at least 18 years old and have 50,000 followers. \nThe idea behind the feature is to make it easy for creators and companies to build community by sharing news and updates with their followers, as well as posting exclusive content. For instance, rather than posting updates through a Story or regular post on TikTok, creators can share them on their bulletin board. The feature also lets accounts promote their content by directly sending it to followers.\nThe launch doesn’t come as a surprise, as TikTok was spotted testing the feature in June. \nImage Credits:TikTok\nDuring the beta phase, TikTok says artists and musicians used the bulletin board to share newly released music with followers and invite them to pre-save upcoming releases. Additionally, People magazine and Paris Saint-Germain used the feature to share news and updates.\n“Just like everything on TikTok, all content must adhere to our Community Guidelines, which we enforce using a combination of technology and human moderators,” TikTok explained in a blog post. “Our safety tools for muting, blocking, and reporting users and content are available within the bulletin board to help keep communities safe and positive.”\nCreators can start a bulletin board by going to their inbox and selecting the option. They can toggle the “Show on profile” setting on or off to change the visibility of their bulletin board. Plus, they can choose a name for their bulletin board.\nTo join a bulletin board, users can click on the bulletin board’s name under the creator’s bio on their profile. Once a follower chooses to join a creator’s bulletin board, they will receive notifications in their inbox whenever that creator posts. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe European Commission has launched an investigation into how Google is implementing its “site reputation abuse policy” and its impact on publishers.\nThe Commission said on Thursday that it had found signs that Google is using the policy to push news media and other publishers’ websites and content lower in search rankings when they include content from their business partners, and that the policy “appears to directly impact a common and legitimate way for publishers to monetise their websites and content.”\nThe EC is now investigating if Google’s policy impacts publishers’ “freedom to conduct legitimate business, innovate, and cooperate with third-party content providers.” \nAccording to Google’s page on the policy, the measures are aimed at curbing websites that seek to manipulate search rankings by publishing other websites’ content on their site in an attempt to take advantage of their high ranking signal.\n“Unfortunately, the investigation announced today into our anti-spam efforts is misguided and risks harming millions of European users,” Pandu Nayak, chief scientist of Search at Google, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “And the investigation is without merit: a German court has already dismissed a similar claim, ruling that our anti-spam policy was valid, reasonable, and applied consistently.”\n“Google’s anti-spam policy is essential to how we fight deceptive pay-for-play tactics that degrade our results,” he added. “Our anti-spam policy helps level the playing field, so that websites using deceptive tactics don’t outrank websites competing on the merits with their own content.”\nIf the investigation yields proof that Google infringed the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), the Commission can charge fines worth up to 10% of Alphabet’s global annual turnover. And if the Commission finds that the infringement is systematic, it can also impose remedies, which can include forced divestiture of businesses, or banning the company from making acquisitions related to the infringement.\nThe European Commission in 2023 designated Google Search as a “core platform service” under the DMA, which gives the bloc’s executive arm extra powers to regulate the tech giant. Google Search is already under a separate investigation for breaching DMA rules related to self-preferential treatment of its own services.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nUber has quietly begun piloting in-app video recording for its drivers in India, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed with the company. The tool is meant to deter misconduct in a market where most drivers do not use dashcams, according to Uber.\nHalf a dozen Uber drivers in the Delhi–NCR region told TechCrunch they sometimes face misconduct from riders and, in some cases, are threatened with false complaints about their behavior — allegations that can lead to penalties or even account suspensions.\n“Even female passengers traveling late at night insist that we follow the route they want instead of what’s shown on the map. If we refuse, they threaten to file false complaints,” said one driver, who requested anonymity out of fear of losing his account.\nDrivers said the in-app video recording feature could help protect them in such situations by providing evidence when disputes arise. Still, some questioned whether Uber would back them in cases involving riders, noting that passengers pay for the trip and can easily switch to competing platforms if dissatisfied.\nThe pilot, which began rolling out in phases in May, is now live in 10 cities across India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.\nRiders receive an in-trip notification when video recording is active.\nUber’s notification for in-app video recordingImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n“All recordings are double-encrypted, stored on the device, and cannot be accessed by anyone — including Uber — unless a user chooses to share them as part of a safety report,” an Uber spokesperson said, adding that the recordings are automatically deleted after a week if they are not shared.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe video tool builds on Uber’s in-app audio recording feature, which launched in India in 2023. Video recording was first tested in the U.S. in 2022 and is already available in Canada and Brazil.\nAs the pilot expands, Uber will have to balance the feature’s potential to defuse disputes with broader questions about privacy and surveillance in one of its prominent markets. It is unclear when the video recording tool will be rolled out more widely, though the pilot’s performance in the coming months is likely to shape whether Uber extends it across India or to other regions.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

The CBO pulled the affected Cisco router offline shortly before disclosing the hack.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:beehiiv\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:50 AM PST · November 13, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nNewsletter platform beehiiv announced a massive expansion to its platform on Thursday, including offering real-time analytics and AI website creation, among other things.  \nIn a video announcing the release, Tyler Denk, the co-founder and CEO of Beehiiv, said that what makes newsletter platforms powerful is ownership.  \n“Owning your audience, distribution, brand, and even your revenue potential,” he said. “In the age of AI and algorithms. Ownership isn’t just nice to have, it’s essential.” \nThe hope is to further give creators (and journalists) more control — and opportunities — to expand and grow their businesses on the platform.  \nThe full product expansion includes:  \n\n Allowing creators to sell digital products, such as ebooks, without beehiiv receiving commissions. Next year, creators will soon be able to sell courses and merchandise.   \n\n\nA feature that lets creators build websites using AI without the use of sophisticated code or developers. A version product was actually launched a few months ago and followed Beehiiv’s acquisition of the AI website builder Typedream last year.   Thursday’s announcement revealed the product now lets users build full websites by simply chatting with AI — or, vibe code a website. However, users don’t need to simply talk in words to the AI; they can also drag and drop images, for example, upload images or screenshots of other people’s websites to the AI, and have it recreate them.\n\n\nThe ability to host and release podcasts on a creator’s respective beehiive platform. This lets creators put their podcasts, newsletters, and websites under one platform, rather than having three separate ones.   \n\n\nReal-time analytics to track engagement and traffic, in addition to a breakdown of what channels drive the most users   \n\n\nOffering “link in bio,” so creators can link to other digital platforms, as well as their own beehiiv creations, without having to use a third-party link in bio company.   \n\n\nOffering professionally designed website templates, so that the website and newsletters look more high-quality. It’s also releasing newsletter templates so that websites and newsletters can have a cohesive brand look.   \n\n\nThe ability to audience segment — meaning creators can create specific content for specific segments of their audience. Creators can now group followers by location, age, or even gender.   \n\n\nAutomated workflows, for example, when a user subscribes, creators can set it up so that a welcome email is automatically sent to them. beehiiv started releasing features of automated workflows a few weeks ago.   \n\n\nEnhanced advertiser tools, including easier browsing of ad opportunities and seeing estimated payouts. Denk said that creators can upload assets, set a budget, and launch campaigns on the platform. Beehiiv also has a new ad dashboard, letting creators track the performance of their campaigns and build their own custom reports, he continued.   \n\n\nPaid subscriptions, without any fees taken by beehiive (it says it is the only platform that doesn’t take a cut of paid subscription revenue). The feature comes with subscription tiers and analytics.  \n\nBeehiiv now considers itself the first platform to encapsulate the entire content creation workflow, as users on the platform can “create, publish, grow, analyze, and monetize,” without fees, plugins, code, or giving up equity. In the video, Denk said that beehiiv is no longer just a newsletter platform, but rather the operating system for the creator economy. With this expansion, it hopes to compete with the likes of Lovable, WordPress, and Patreon.\nThe company was founded in 2021 and says that since then, it has sent more than 35 billion emails, with more than 55,000 creators on the platform, including Oliver Darcy with Status.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBeehiiv last raised a $33 million Series B in April 2024 with LightSpeed Venture Partners and NEA as investors.  \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple announced on Thursday the launch of a new developer program, the Mini Apps Partner Program, which will offer a reduced commission rate of 15% on in-app purchases for the mini applications.\nThe iPhone maker defines a mini app as a “self-contained” experience that’s built using web technologies like HTML5 and JavaScript, which are distributed within a larger, native app. The technology has been supported on the App Store for nearly a decade, but this is the first time it’s offered a reduced commission on mini app transactions.\nApple in 2017 added a rule to its App Review Guidelines, which lists the specific requirements for mini apps. In guideline 4.7, the company gives developers permission to run mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators that offer software not in the main app’s binary. It also describes how they’re to process sensitive data or filter objectionable material, similar to native apps.\nTo qualify for the new Mini App program, Apple says the main app must be available on iOS or iPadOS and hosted on the App Store, and will need to follow the Apple Developer Program License Agreement and the existing App Review Guidelines, including those for mini apps.\nHowever, the program also adds the new requirements for the apps to support specific Apple technologies, including the Advanced Commerce API and Declared Age Rating API, which ensures apps offer age-appropriate content. They must also use Apple’s in-app purchase system and send information about a user’s in-app purchase to Apple when refunds are requested.\nApple positions the program as a way for developers who host mini apps and games to grow their business on the App Store. It also incentivizes developers to leverage Apple’s technologies, including its trust and safety tools, by offering the benefit of a reduced commission. That additional savings could allow the developers to re-invest in their own mini apps program.\nIn addition, it ensures that Apple will retain its ability to extract a commission from mini applications, even as the market evolves to offer new experiences. \nToday, there are a variety of native iOS apps that offer mini apps, including messengers like LINE or WeChat, or those that offer mini games, like Discord, for example. More recently, AI providers have begun moving into the mini app space. Notably, ChatGPT recently launched apps that run inside its chatbot, allowing users to engage with apps like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva. Some have theorized that this platform could eventually evolve to threaten the App Store’s business model if app engagement and transactions moved inside ChatGPT.\nBloomberg recently reported Apple and Tencent agreed to a 15% commission on mini apps in WeChat, but not that the program would be open to other developers.\nDevelopers who want to join Apple’s Mini Apps Partner Program can make a request, and then provide information about their host app, eligibility, and mini app. They also have to agree to the program’s terms and conditions. When their app is ready, they then have to submit it for review. (Apple already asks app developers to include a manifest that allows Apple to review the software and metadata included in the app, plus the links that lead to the mini apps it offers.)\nIn-app purchases inside mini apps qualify for the reduced commission if they are for digital goods and services, including consumable, non-consumable, auto-renewable subscriptions, and non-renewing subscriptions, Apple says.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nEarly-stage venture fund Betaworks announced the latest 10 companies launching from its prestigious Camp program, the 13-week biannual residence program launched in 2016 that has given way to names like Hugging Face and Graze Social. \nThe theme for this year’s Camp is Interfaces, as in companies that are designing products that impact how users experience AI. (Previous Camp themes focused on application layers and agents). Applications opened in June, and the camp began in August, with DemoDay being November 4. \nThese are the companies taking part in the 13th Betaworks Camp:\nNora — A browser extension, founded by Sid Banothu, that tracks shopping habits. \nPrimitive — A web app that lets people use voice to dump ideas that the platform then turns into a list of tasks and to-dos. The product, founded by Kasey Klimes, can also link with other productivity tools such as Notion and calendars. \nPatina — Founded by Sean Raspet and Laura Sisson, the company is working on olfactory technology to create “scent photographs,” through a combination of protein folding, scent receptors, and graph neural networks. \nMy Place, by Orange — A platform, founded by Helen Huang, that lets users play games that are realistic simulations of everyday human life. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPutty (no website yet) — Though the company is still in stealth, Betaworks said it wanted to work with the founder, Kevin Chang, because he was “deeply engaged with concepts” the firm cared about, including “memory systems, ambient interfaces” and “technology fitted to the more sporadic rhythm of life.” \nTelepath — A computer built with AI and no apps, founded by Stephen Hood, Josh Whiting, and Rupert Manfredi. \nFeather — A digital assistant that helps create automated workflows for tedious tasks, like apartment hunting. It was founded by ShaoBo Zhang and Marco Yu. \nNubrain — Founded by Priyanka Jain and Ingo Marquardt, this company is creating EEG data (the test used to record the electrical activity of the brain) to help translate human thoughts into speech, text, and images. \nPresq — This platform, founded by Adam Saleh, Steve Burstyn, and Mikey Robins, lets influencers upload data to create prompt options that let them create manufacturable footwear. It plans to soon expand to other product areas, like eyewear and home goods.\nIntension — Founded by Conor Sanchez O’Shea and Gabriel Duemichen, this company helps people focus while working on a desktop by removing from sight anything that operates as a distraction. It tracks users’ attention and maps out the workflow habits of those working on desktops. \nThis story was updated to clarify what Presq does.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAn international coalition of law enforcement agencies coordinated by Europol targeted and took down three cybercrime operations in its latest round of what authorities call “Operation Endgame.”\nIn a press release, Europol said that the police operation targeted the infostealing malware Rhadamanthys, a botnet called Elysium, and the remote access trojan VenomRAT. The authorities say all three “played a key role in international cybercrime.” Police seized more than 1,000 servers as part of the operation. \nEuropol said police arrested the unnamed “main suspect” behind VenomRAT in Greece on November 3.\n“The dismantled malware infrastructure consisted of hundreds of thousands of infected computers containing several million stolen credentials,” the press release read. “Many of the victims were not aware of the infection of their systems.”\nAccording to Europol, the main suspect behind Rhadamantys had access to over 100,000 crypto wallets, “potentially worth millions of euros.”\nAs an infostealer, Rhadamantys is designed to steal various kinds of information from infected devices, including passwords and cryptocurrency wallet keys. Rhadamantys spiked in popularity in October after authorities took down the popular infostealer Lumma earlier in the year, showing that after takedowns, criminals adapt by using different hacking tools that might be less known at the time.\nWhen Rhadamantys launched in 2022, it initially relied on spreading through malicious Google advertisements, and later grew thanks to word-of-mouth on underground forums, according to Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs, one of the cybersecurity industry partners in Operation Endgame. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm wrote in a blog post that Rhadamantys had a “dramatic uptick” and a “consistent rise in the number of victims” after the Lumma takedown, making it “the largest information-stealer malware by volume.” In October, the infostealer had compromised more than 12,000 victims, according to the firm.\nRyan English, a researcher at Black Lotus Labs, told TechCrunch that Rhadamantys “emerged as the ‘next’ go-to infostealer” after Lumma went down.\n“We know that others will take their place, so we just keep tracking to see who’s emerging from that,” said English, adding that law enforcement and the wider industry “can only do so much at any time.” \n“So in a very real sense, it’s whack-a-mole forever,” said English.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nMeta is overhauling Facebook Marketplace with new collaborative tools, social features, an improved checkout experience, and Meta AI integrations, the company announced Thursday.\nMarketplace is getting a new “collections” feature that lets users create groups of listings and invite friends to join. Users can get started by saving a listing, starting a new collection, and then choosing whether to make it public or private. They can then add friends to their collection and share updates through Feed, Messenger, WhatsApp, and more. \nMeta’s also testing collaborative buying, which means users can invite a friend to join their chat with a seller. The company says this makes it easier to coordinate pickup, negotiate prices, and get answers to questions.\nImage Credits:Meta\nThese new collaborative features could be useful in instances when a group of roommates is looking to furnish their new apartment or when someone wants to keep their partner in the loop when discussing potential purchases. \nWhile Meta says the changes announced on Thursday are designed to make Marketplace more useful, they also mark the company’s ongoing efforts to bring Meta AI into all of its services and products. Additionally, by blending social, commerce, and AI, the company is looking to boost time spent on Marketplace while also enhancing its competitiveness against other e-commerce platforms.\nIn terms of the Meta AI integrations, Meta is going to start using its AI tools to help buyers ask the right questions when making a purchase. Now, when users start a chat with a seller, they will see a “Suggested questions to ask” button. If they tap it, Meta AI will use the details from the listing and the conversation to suggest questions they might want to ask.\nAdditionally, Meta is bringing AI insights to vehicle listings on Marketplace, noting that vehicles are among the top five searches for young adults. Now, when users view a vehicle listing, they’ll see AI-generated insights that bring together key details like engine options, safety ratings, transmission type, seating and cargo capacity, reviews, and price information.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta also announced that users can react and comment directly on listings. The company says this will help others learn about item quality and discover new finds. It’ll be interesting to see how people react to this change, as Marketplace has had a simple design since its launch. Some might find the addition of reactions and comments as distracting, or even cluttering the service.\nMeta notes that if a user likes an item, Marketplace will learn what they’re interested in and display more items aligned with their preferences.\nAs part of its announcement, Meta said it began integrating eBay and Poshmark inventory into Marketplace earlier this year to give people more options when it comes to buying across categories like fashion and electronics.\n“Partner listings are marked with an icon on the listing image, and are integrated throughout your Marketplace feed so you’ll see them while you’re browsing,” Meta explained in a blog post. “You can also see the listing and seller’s information on the Marketplace product details page, and when you’re ready to buy, you’ll be taken to the partner’s site for checkout.”\nAs for the improved checkout experience, buyers will now see total costs, including shipping and tax, upfront. They’ll now also receive notifications as the status of their order changes. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFirefighters performing a safety drill at one of The Boring Company’s construction sites in Las Vegas received burns from chemicals used in the tunnel excavation process, according to a new report from Fortune.\nThose Clark County firefighters weren’t previously made aware of the potential hazard but were permanently scarred, the report states. Employees working on The Boring Company’s tunnels have also received similar chemical burns.\nThe Boring Company has been digging tunnels in Las Vegas for a few years in an attempt to connect the entire city with a subterranean network that uses Teslas to shuttle people. It’s the first effort to create a watered-down version of Elon Musk’s dream to build underground transportation, which once included fanciful ideas like hyperloops and larger people-movers.\nBut the project has been plagued by safety concerns and injuries since its inception. In September, the company even briefly halted work after an employee suffered a “crushing injury.” \nBoring Company employees have been receiving burns from the chemical — an accelerant that the company uses to harden the concrete tunnel walls — for years, according to prior reporting from Fortune’s Jessica Mathews.\nIn late 2024, the Clark County Fire Department (CCFD) started conducting emergency rescue drills at the tunnels. During prep work ahead of the drills, though, firefighters appear to have not learned about the potential to be burned by the chemical, which mixes with groundwater and dirt and forms pools of muck.\nWhile employees reportedly tried to clear the muck before the drills, they weren’t able to get rid of all of it. Firefighters reported irritations on their legs because their “boots were full of muck” and were taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for chemical burns. Nevada’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) opened an investigation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Boring Company blamed the firefighters. “The key breakdowns in the Training Plan were committed by CCFD employees, not TBC employees,” a lawyer for The Boring Company wrote to Nevada OSHA.\nNevada OSHA still issued three “willful” citations (its most serious level) to The Boring Company in May over the incident and proposed fines of $425,595.\nThat same day, Boring Company president Steve Davis — a top Musk lieutenant and one of the leaders of the billionaire’s Department of Government Efficiency — called the Nevada governor’s office. Records show he spoke with the governor’s state infrastructure lead, a former Tesla employee. The next day, high-level Nevada officials met with Davis and Boring Company representatives.\nThe meeting was a highly unusual break from the normal citation-and-appeals process, former OSHA officials told Fortune. Regardless, Nevada OSHA withdrew the citations.\nWhat’s more, Nevada OSHA didn’t properly document the removal of the citations — something a rep for the state agency admitted to Fortune. And a document in the case file was altered to remove evidence of the meeting between The Boring Company leaders and the governor’s office. The meeting information was added back after Fortune pointed out the change.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nFor the last two years, LinkedIn has tried to infuse AI into different parts of its platforms, including ad copies, content creation, personalized digests, hiring assistance, job hunting advice, and learning. The company is now finally adding AI to one of the most-used parts of the site: search.\nEarlier this year, the company released a job search tool for members in the U.S., allowing them to search for jobs using natural language queries. Now, the company is extending the feature to people search.\nUsers can use queries like “Find me investors in the healthcare sector with FDA experience,” people who “co-founded a productivity company and are based in NYC,” or “Who in my network can help me understand wireless networks.”\nImage Credits:LinkedIn\nUntil now, LinkedIn’s search has been more complicated. You can type in a few words to find the right people or rely on many different LinkedIn filters in the hope of getting the right results. Plus, you also have to think about what kinds of words you might want to use to get the best out of the search system.\n“With lexical search, you have to know the exact title of the person, or you need to wrestle with filters to find the right person, maybe. And if you didn’t know the right combination, the right person remained undiscovered. The new AI-powered people search is designed to be the fastest path to the person who can help you the most,” Rohan Rajiv, senior director of product management at LinkedIn, told TechCrunch over a call.\nThe company said in its early testing, it has seen people use this to find others who can help them with their next job opportunity, expand their business, or boost their career prospects.\nSearch has been one area where all internet platforms have been rushing to add AI. Seeing people gravitate toward chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity for answers, incumbent search engines like Google, Bing, Brave, and DuckDuckGo have added AI-powered answers. There are plenty of startups working on AI-powered people search as well. Reddit has also leaned heavily into AI-powered search and locked down its platform’s data, asking other companies to sign a licensing agreement for AI training and usage.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLinkedIn is one of the most used sites in AI demos for AI agents, browsers, and assistants. However, the Microsoft-owned company has not put restrictions on its data just yet.\n“I think we are still early in this age of browsers and how they are working on behalf of people. I think over time, we will have a more sturdy policy [around browsers],” Rajiv said.\n“On a broader note, I have seen a lot of demos that try to reason over a person’s LinkedIn network. This is sort of an area where I think it is going to be hard to find a substitute for the real thing because this is the worst the search has ever been.”\nImage Credits:LinkedIn\nLinkedIn is rolling out AI-powered people search to premium users in the U.S. with plans to expand it to other geographies in the coming months. People who will have access to this feature will see “I’m looking for…” in the search bar instead of “Search.”\nThe search is not perfect. You will get different results when you use a query like “people who co-founded a YC startup” as compared to using “Y Combinator” in the query. Also, when you search for “people who co-founded a voice AI startup,” some folks who have a LinkedIn top voice badge show up.\nThe company said it is working on improving the way the search tool understands the query.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhen the hosts of the popular All-In podcast launched their own tequila brand at a star-studded party last June, all 750 bottles of the $1,200 spirit quickly sold out. But getting those bottles into customers’ hands has proven harder than expected.\nThe long-awaited bottles of Besties All-In tequila began shipping last week to those who ordered them, ending a nearly five-month-long wait, Jason Calacanis, one of the podcast’s hosts, told TechCrunch. \nThe holdup was the unusual bottle, Calacanis said: “Handcrafted bottles took a bit longer to create than expected, but the bottles started shipping last week!” The bottle was designed as a collector item and looks like a stack of poker chips illuminated from the bottom. It gives homage to poker, another of the podcast hosts’ favorite pastimes besides drinking tequila.\nBuyers were told at that time that they could expect delivery by the end of summer. But summer came and went. The customers not only dished out the $1,200 but also paid taxes and other fees.  \nA TechCrunch reader told us that delivery was repeatedly delayed: pushed back to October, then November, and most recently, one person was told the delivery would be “after November,” according to a letter seen by TechCrunch from the distributor Flaviar, the spirits marketplace handling distribution.\nBoth the product’s official website and Flaviar’s communications reflected the shifting timeline — the website originally promised end-of-summer delivery but now says shipments will “begin in November.” The Flaviar letter indicated that deliveries were happening in batches.\nWhile it’s still not clear how long it will take the distributor to fulfill all orders, we at least know that shipments have begun and what the holdup was. With any luck, fans of the VCs, pod bros, and “besties” who host All-In will be sipping on the pricey, handcrafted liquor during the upcoming holiday season.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFlaviar has not yet responded to our request for comment.  \n",

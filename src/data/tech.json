    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI has sold $6.6 billion in shares held by current and former employees, according to a new report from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-02/openai-completes-share-sale-at-record-500-billion-valuation\">Bloomberg</a>. The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said.</p>\n<p>The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/meta-reportedly-hires-four-more-researchers-from-openai/\">at least seven top engineers from OpenAI</a>, often luring them away with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/meta-is-offering-multimillion-dollar-pay-for-ai-researchers-but-not-100m-signing-bonuses/\">multi-million dollar signing bonuses</a>.</p>\n<p>OpenAI’s most recent funding round came <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/openai-reportedly-raises-8-3b-at-300b-valuation/\">in August</a>, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz.</p>\n<p>The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\"> the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans</a>. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/\">invest $100 billion in OpenAI</a> as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership.</p>\n<p>The new sale comes just weeks after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-reach-non-binding-deal-allow-openai-restructure-2025-09-11/\">a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft</a>, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned.</p>\n<p>OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Einride, the Swedish startup known for its unusual-looking electric and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight, said Wednesday it has raised $100 million from several new and existing investors, including its largest shareholder, EQT Ventures.</p>\n<p>The raise included an undisclosed strategic investment from quantum computing company IonQ. Neither Einride, nor its investors, disclosed the company’s post-money valuation.</p>\n<p>The funding comes as Einride adjusts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/21/einride-founder-steps-down-as-ceo-amid-push-to-scale-electric-autonomous-trucks/\">to a new CEO</a> and tries to scale its three business products: electric big rigs, autonomous pod-like trucks that navigate fixed routes, and planning software designed for shippers. Einride CEO Roozbeh Charli said the funding would allow the company to grow with its customer base and accelerate the deployment of its autonomous freight technology.</p>\n<p>The company, which was founded in 2016, started in Sweden with a mission to disrupt the freight industry — first with electric trucks, then with electric autonomous pods, which are purpose-built without a steering wheel or pedals for self-driving. </p>\n<p>Einride has expanded beyond Sweden and operates a fleet of heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE, for companies like PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has made some inroads with its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the United States.</p>\n<p>“We believe Einride is building the most complete and forward-looking freight ecosystem on the market today,” Ted Persson, partner at EQT Ventures, said in a statement. “Nordic tech has a habit of being underestimated, until it quietly rewires an entire industry. That’s exactly what Einride is doing in freight.”</p>\n<p>Still, Einride has undergone internal changes and has grappled — along with the rest of the nascent autonomous vehicle technology sector — with the long and expensive process of moving from development to commercial operations.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Five months ago, Einride co-founder Robert Falck left the CEO role and took over as executive chairman of the board to focus on the company’s long-term strategy. Charli, who had been CFO, was promoted to the top leadership position.</p>\n<p>The company previously <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/07/autonomous-electric-truck-company-einride-raises-500m-in-equity-and-debt/\">raised $500 million</a> in 2022 in a Series C round of equity and debt.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Sheel Mohnot, co-founder and general partner of Better Tomorrow Ventures (BTV), has one simple answer for anyone claiming that investing in fintech has lost some of its attractiveness.</p>\n<p>“The world of finance is huge. About 20% of global GDP is financial services, and it’s still not digital enough,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Many financial transactions are still handled manually, and Better Tomorrow Ventures — led by Mohnot (a former general partner at 500 Startups) and NerdWallet co-founder Jake Gibson — aims to help change that.</p>\n<p>“The massive digitization opportunity is still ahead of us,” Mohnot told TechCrunch. The firm’s limited partners seem to agree.</p>\n<p>Better Tomorrow Ventures just raised a $140 million third fund, nearly matching the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/15/better-tomorrow-ventures-closes-on-225m-fintech-focused-fund-which-is-triple-the-size-of-its-last-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">$150 million</a> second fund, which was announced in early 2022 toward the end of the ZIRP (zero interest-rate policy) boom.</p>\n<p>“We actually planned to make the fund smaller this time,” Mohnot said. “In 2021, things went super overboard. Every company we invested in immediately raised a follow-on round at a crazy price, and that was probably bad,” Mohnot said.</p>\n<p>Now that the enthusiasm for fintech is tamer, BTV doesn’t need as much capital to continue to participate in its best startups, he explained.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The firm also didn’t tap into the $75 million opportunity fund raised alongside its second fund in 2022. But that capital may come in handy at some point soon. Since many of the recent and planned IPOs are in the fintech space, including Chime, Klarna, Navan, and Wealthfront, there’s hope that late-stage investors will become more excited about the category.</p>\n<p>At the early stages, fintech investing has certainly picked up over the last year. For instance, BTV sees great opportunities in disrupting accounting.  </p>\n<p>“There’s a massive shortage of accountants. Accounting firms are all turning away business, and it’s a perfect application for AI,” Mohnot believes.</p>\n<p>The firm has already backed three accounting startups: Basis, which recently raised a <a href=\"https://www.getbasis.ai/blogs/basis-raises-a-34m-series-a-led-by-khosla-ventures\" target=\"_blank\">$34 million Series A</a> led by Khosla Ventures; <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/09/3112479/0/en/Layer-Raises-6-6M-Led-by-Emergence-Capital-to-Bring-Embedded-Accounting-to-the-SMB-Software-Stack.html\" target=\"_blank\">Layer</a>, an embedded accounting platform for small and medium-sized businesses; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/sheel-mohnot-inscope-financial-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\">InScope</a>, a startup that helps automate audited financial statement drafting.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just accounting: Mohnot is a strong believer in AI’s broad applications within fintech. “Financial Services is very labor-intensive. There’s underwriting, compliance, fraud detection, customer support,” he said. “AI can do all that at a lower cost.”</p>\n<p>Other notable companies in BTV’s portfolio include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/18/fintech-startup-coast-lands-40m-just-4-months-after-its-last-25m-raise/\" target=\"_blank\">Coast</a>, a payments platform for fleet and truck drivers; Unit, a banking-as-a-service startup last valued at $1.2 billion; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/29/relay-raises-cash-for-its-smb-focused-money-management-platform/\" target=\"_blank\">Relay</a>, an online banking and cash management platform for small businesses; and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/17/banking-as-a-service-startup-unit-closes-on-100m-at-a-1-2b-valuation/\">Unit</a>, a banking-as-a-service startup last valued at $1.2 billion.</p>\n<p>For its third fund, the firm plans to invest in 30 to 35 companies, with check sizes ranging from $500,000 to $3.5 million.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Tesla’s sales growth has vanished over the last year-and-a-half, but the company just registered its best quarter of deliveries ever, in large part because buyers rushed to take advantage of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit before it went away.</p>\n<p>Tesla delivered 497,099 vehicles over the last three months, the company <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-third-quarter-2025-production-deliveries-deployments\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> Thursday. That’s a massive 29% jump from the second quarter, about a 7% increase over the same period last year, and more than it has ever delivered in a single quarter.</p>\n<p>Other automakers in the U.S. have seen similar jumps ahead of the credit expiring. The temptation to take advantage of the expiring credit was so strong that Cox Automotive <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/third-quarter-us-auto-sales.html\">has forecasted EVs will represent 10%</a> of all vehicle sales in the U.S. for the quarter, which would be a record. </p>\n<p>The boost in sales came at a critical time for Tesla. Before the third quarter bump, Tesla was on track to see its global deliveries <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/tesla-faces-second-straight-year-of-falling-sales-after-another-bad-quarter/\" target=\"_blank\">fall for the second straight year</a>. That decline has eaten into the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/tesla-profits-pulled-down-by-falling-ev-sales-and-regulatory-credits/\" target=\"_blank\">industry-leading profit margin</a>.</p>\n<p>This is thanks to a combination of factors. The company hasn’t released a truly new model in years aside from the Cybertruck, which has been such a bust that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/gmc-hummer-ev-outsold-the-tesla-cybertruck-last-quarter/\" target=\"_blank\">it’s been outsold by the GMC Hummer EV</a>. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also tarnished his company’s image by spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help elect Donald Trump, and then promptly joined the new administration and led major, often haphazard cuts to federal agencies and programs with his Department of Government Efficiency.</p>\n<p>It’s still possible for Tesla to deliver more cars this year than last. But it will take a monster fourth quarter the likes of which Tesla has yet to achieve. And even if that happens, it’s a far cry from the 50% annual growth figure that the company once promoted. </p>\n<p>Perhaps that’s unsurprising given that Musk seems to be tired of selling cars. The company is trying to focus the public’s attention on technologies like autonomy and humanoid robotics, to the point that it recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, largely tied to the success of those programs.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>What happens to Tesla’s sales moving forward is a mystery. The expiration of the tax credit, plus the Trump administration’s hatred of anything clean energy, has dimmed the near-term prospects for EVs in the U.S. That has contributed to many major legacy automakers delaying or canceling plans for new electric vehicles — which could help Tesla claw back market share.</p>\n<p>Tesla is also developing a lower-cost version of its Model Y SUV that we’re likely to learn more about by the end of this year. While it’s not an entirely new nameplate, the EV is expected to cost in the low-$30,000 range. The question will then be whether that price becomes attractive enough to win buyers for a super stripped-down version of a Tesla.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, other major automakers saw EV sales double in the face of the expiring tax credit. Some, like Ford and General Motors, have said they will make up for the incentive on certain leases going forward, as they try to keep their electric vehicles competitive in a market without federal subsidies.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

It’s the fastest-growing consumer tech company on Earth, but it’s also a frontier AI lab with a lofty nonprofit charter. Some former OpenAI employees I’ve spoken to argue the consumer business can, in theory, serve the mission: ChatGPT helps fund AI research and distribute the technology widely.</p>\n<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said as much in a <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1973381552621887706\" target=\"_blank\">post on X</a> Wednesday, addressing why the company is allocating so much capital and computing power to an AI social media app:</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“We do mostly need the capital for build [sic] AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort,” said Altman. “It is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some money given all that compute need.”</p>\n<p>“When we launched chatgpt there was a lot of ‘who needs this and where is AGI,’” Altman continued. “[R]eality is nuanced when it comes to optimal trajectories for a company.”</p>\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><div><p>i get the vibe here, but…</p><p>we do mostly need the capital for build AI that can do science, and for sure we are focused on AGI with almost all of our research effort.</p><p>it is also nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, make them smile, and hopefully make some… <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://t.co/bcCUmXsloP\">https://t.co/bcCUmXsloP</a></p></div>— Sam Altman (@sama) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1973381552621887706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n<p>But at what point does OpenAI’s consumer business overtake its nonprofit mission? In other words, when does OpenAI say no to a money-making, platform-growing opportunity because it’s at odds with the mission?</p>\n<p>The question looms as regulators scrutinize <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/openai-secures-microsofts-blessing-to-transition-its-for-profit-arm/\">OpenAI’s for-profit transition</a>, which OpenAI needs to complete to raise additional capital and eventually go public. California Attorney General Rob Bonta <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-openai-harm-children-will-not-be-tolerated\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> last month that he is “particularly concerned with ensuring that the stated safety mission of OpenAI as a nonprofit remains front and center” in the restructuring.</p>\n<p>Skeptics have dismissed OpenAI’s mission as a branding tool to lure talent from Big Tech. But many insiders at OpenAI insist it’s central to why they joined the company in the first place.</p>\n<p>For now, Sora’s footprint is small; the app is one day old. But its debut marks a significant expansion of OpenAI’s consumer business and exposes the company to incentives that have plagued social media apps for decades.</p>\n<p>Unlike ChatGPT, which is optimized for usefulness, OpenAI says Sora is built for fun — a place to generate and share AI clips. The feed feels closer to TikTok or Instagram Reels, platforms that are infamous for their addictive loops.</p>\n<p>OpenAI insists it wants to avoid those pitfalls, claiming in a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> announcing the Sora launch that “concerns about doomscrolling, addiction, isolation, and RL-sloptimized feeds are top of mind.” The company explicitly says it’s not optimizing for time spent on feed and instead wants to maximize creation. OpenAI says it will send reminders to users when they’ve been scrolling for too long, and primarily show them people they know.</p>\n<p>That’s a stronger starting point than Meta’s Vibes — another AI-powered short-form video feed released last week — which seems to have been raced out without as many safeguards. As a former OpenAI policy leader, Miles Brundage <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/Miles_Brundage/status/1973263523292807572\">points out</a> that it’s possible there will be good and bad applications of AI-video feeds, much like we’ve seen in the chatbot era.</p>\n<p>Still, as Altman has long acknowledged, no one sets out to build an addictive app. The incentives of running a feed guide them to it. OpenAI has even run into problems around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/02/how-ai-chatbots-keep-you-chatting/\">sycophancy in ChatGPT</a>, which the company says was unintentional due to some of its training techniques.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB9mjd-65gw\" target=\"_blank\">June podcast</a>, Altman discussed what he calls “the big misalignment of social media.”</p>\n<p>“One of the big mistakes of the social media era was [that] the feed algorithms had a bunch of unintended, negative consequences on society as a whole, and maybe even individual users. Although they were doing the thing that a user wanted — or someone thought users wanted — in the moment, which is [to] get them to, like, keep spending time on the site.”</p>\n<p>It’s too soon to tell how aligned the Sora app is with its users or OpenAI’s mission. Users are already noticing some engagement-optimizing techniques in the app, such as the dynamic emojis that appear every time you like a video. That feels designed to shoot a little dopamine to users for engaging with a video.</p>\n<p>The real test will be how OpenAI evolves Sora. Given how much AI has taken over regular social media feeds, it seems plausible that AI-native feeds could soon have their moment. Whether OpenAI can grow Sora without replicating the mistakes of its predecessors remains to be seen.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spacecoin.org/\">Spacecoin</a> says it reached a new milestone in its quest to build a decentralized communications backbone that could one day rival SpaceX’s Starlink.</p>\n<p>The company said this week that it successfully transmitted secured data via its first demonstration satellite, validating the spacecraft’s ability to execute encrypted transactions in orbit.</p>\n<p>The blockchain transaction, beamed from Chile to Portugal, served as a proof-of-concept for moving cryptographic signatures and encrypted data through space.</p>\n<p>“Can we send cryptographic signatures to space intact? Without it, we cannot build a decentralized network of communications satellites and fulfill the vision of building permissionless connectivity,” Spacecoin founder Tae Oh <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/taelimoh/status/1973370839656702279\">said in a video posted on X</a>. “That was the main mission of CTC-0, that we launched December 2024 with SpaceX. And today, I’m glad to share that CTC-0 fulfilled its purpose.”</p>\n<p>CTC-0, a small satellite built by Endurosat and launched on a Falcon 9 rideshare in December 2024, is the first in a line of prototypes that Spacecoin plans to launch. The next three satellites, collectively called CTC-1, will be slightly larger, followed by even bigger spacecraft to boost performance.</p>\n<p>The test comes as Starlink continues to cement its lead in the satellite broadband space. With its vertically integrated launch business, SpaceX has put more than 8,000 satellites in orbit and has already signed on millions of global customers. A handful of competitors, include Amazon’s Kuiper, are also positioning themselves against the company.</p>\n<p>But unlike Starlink and other managed broadband networks, Spacecoin’s approach is based on “tokenized access” and decentralization. The company will launch “Starmesh,” an encrypted internet traffic network, that it says will “maintain internet freedom while allowing safe, untraceable browsing and access to decentralized web services.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Founded in 2022, Oh spun the venture out of Gluwa, a firm he founded that provides financial services to emerging markets.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The footage was striking: A food delivery worker scrambles with his e-bike across a bridge in Chicago, chased by a cadre of armed, masked federal agents. “Get him!” one yells, before the worker ultimately slips away. </p>\n<p>The viral clip became a rallying point this week for critics of President Donald Trump’s deportation machine, which has spread to multiple U.S. cities and swept up citizens in the process. For Mike Peregudov, the co-founder of e-bike subscription service Whizz, it was a visceral representation of the abject fear delivery workers have described to his team for weeks in Chicago.</p>\n<p>That’s because the threat of being snatched up by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or one of the many other agencies helping boost the administration’s deportation numbers, has become measurable in Whizz’s own metrics.</p>\n<p> “The reason Whizz’s fleet hasn’t grown in Chicago in the last month,” Peregudov wrote in <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7378497365516865536/\" target=\"_blank\">a LinkedIn post</a>, where he shared the clip. “It has become way harder to deliver a food order in the city.” </p>\n<p>Whizz is relatively new to Chicago, having only launched in the city a few months ago. But Peregudov told TechCrunch in an interview the company’s fleet was “growing really fast” over the summer, from having zero bikes on the ground in March to around 300 by the end of July.</p>\n<p>This growth was encouraging for Whizz’s mission of providing safe, reliable, and affordable bikes for delivery workers. For years, many of those same workers have had to rely on a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/05/whizz-wants-to-own-the-delivery-e-bike-subscription-space-starting-with-nyc/\">mish-mash of products</a> with questionable reliability, causing the vehicles to be banned in some cities.</p>\n<p>Dynamics changed in August when Trump threatened to send National Guard troops into the city, according to Peregudov. Growth not only halted, but Whizz has lost about 8% of its business since, he said. The National Guard threats, plus the constant ICE raids, has spooked the food delivery workforce.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“They’re afraid,” he said of workers who have returned bikes to Whizz’s Chicago office. Whizz doesn’t employ these gig economy workers; it only rents out e-bikes, which can be obtained by anyone with proper identification, a social security number, and a credit card. </p>\n<p>With U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents getting scooped up in similar raids around the country, Peregudov said this fear is shared by both documented and undocumented immigrants. </p>\n<p>“When a raid happens, these people can [detain] the guy for, whatever, two weeks,” he said. “When they understand he is legally here, they will let him go away, but he will lose those two weeks.”</p>\n<p>Immigration raids are happening in most of the other cities where Whizz operates, including New York, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. But those locations have so far been spared Trump’s more militaristic deployments, which amp up the tension.</p>\n<p>The company also operates in Washington, D.C., where President Trump has brought in National Guard troops. Curiously, Peregudov said business is actually up in the nation’s capital.</p>\n<p>He attributes that in large part to the fact that, according to him, police and federal agents appear to be targeting delivery drivers who use gasoline mopeds without a license.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>On Tuesday, a new SPAC from VC and All-In podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AEXA/\" target=\"_blank\">became a public company</a>. Dubbed with the lofty name “American Exceptionalism,” it raised $345 million with a mission to acquire one or more startups in the fields of energy, AI, crypto/DeFi, or defense, then convert those companies into publicly traded entities.</p>\n<p>But Palihapitiya wants retail investors to know: He strongly advises you <em>not</em> to buy the stock, even though he has reserved a tiny fraction — just over 1% — to be traded on the public markets for retailer investors, while 98.7% has already been sold to hand-picked, large institutions.</p>\n<p>“I want to temper retail investors’ involvement with my SPACs,” he <a href=\"https://x.com/chamath/status/1972776673495097456\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on X and later <a href=\"https://x.com/chamath/status/1972776673495097456\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> again, “We designed it this way, almost entirely institutionally backed, because, as I have learned, these vehicles are not ideal for most retail investors. They are for investors who can underwrite the volatility, place it as part of a broader structured portfolio and have the capital to support the company over the long run.”</p>\n<p>It isn’t typical for someone to launch an IPO and then tell people not to buy the stock. He even goes as far as to give a buyer-beware warning to any retail investor (like among fans of the uber-popular All-In pod) who wants to ignore his recommendation and buy anyway. “For anyone in the retail market who still chooses to disregard my advice to avoid SPACs, please carefully review our disclosures and make a fully informed decision.”</p>\n<p>The reason for these warnings is somewhat entertaining. Palihapitiya practically single-handedly sparked the rise of SPACs from 2019 to 2021, granting him the title of “SPAC King.” This came after his first SPAC, Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings (IPOA), raised $600 million and took Virgin Galactic public in 2019. (It now trades for under $4, by the way.) SPACs took off, seen as a fast-track to going public during the venture capital valuation bubble.</p>\n<p>But, within a few years, the numbers showed that while SPACs might be lucrative for the SPACs’ sponsors like Palihapitiya and sometimes for the acquired startup, they rarely made investors money. Or as the <a href=\"https://www.yalejreg.com/bulletin/was-the-spac-crash-predictable/\" target=\"_blank\">Yale Journal on Regulation</a> put it: “SPACs have delivered poor post-merger returns to shareholders for many years.”</p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs even banned itself from underwriting them for three years. In June, it ditched that ban and began working with SPACs again, prompting Palihapitiya to post a poll on X asking, “Should I launch a SPAC?”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Nearly 58,000 people voted and <a href=\"https://x.com/chamath/status/1935369326321877153\" target=\"_blank\">overwhelmingly voted no (71%)</a>. That’s because Palihapitiya’s track record was no better. In June, MarketWatch <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-so-called-spac-king-prepares-to-launch-another-the-last-time-wasnt-a-success-by-any-means-0426b24b\" target=\"_blank\">compiled</a> records of the abysmal performance of nearly all of his SPACs, showing many were down over 90% from their launch date.</p>\n<p>When launching this new SPAC this week, Palihapitiya still argued that SPACs are good for the startups, as well as their employees and early investor VCs.</p>\n<p>“The reason to return now is simple. The imbalance between private and public markets has only widened,” he wrote on X, citing the even larger number of unicorns today than in 2019. “Employees are often holding paper wealth that is difficult to convert into liquidity. Early investors find it more challenging to reinvest capital in the next generation of startups.”</p>\n<p>But he also acknowledged that “it hasn’t been all roses.” Hence the warning to retail investors. (Social Capital declined to comment further.)</p>\n<p>He says he’s trying to address some of the worst criticisms: that SPACs enrich the vehicle’s sponsors at the expense of everyone else.</p>\n<p>With “American Exceptionalism,” he says he has structured payouts so that the sponsors’ tranches of stock won’t vest until stock prices hit 50%, 75%, and 100% increases. “If the deal is a dog, no one wins. If it is a winner, we will all win … together,” he wrote.</p>\n<p>The question remains though: With all that we know in 2025, should a startup choose to go public via SPAC, be it through Palihapitiya’s or any SPAC? History would indicate: probably not, if they want their stock to perform well long term.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div><p>From a standing stop, like most hybrids, it moves away smartly: Electric motors generate peak torque from 0 rpm, so there’s no revving up time. The claimed 10-percent reduction in highway passing speed was less noticeable. But while earlier Crosstreks were on the slow side, the new hybrid is fine. It’s not <em>fast</em>, but the e-motor smoothes the power delivery and gives the impression of a more willing vehicle. It’s also peppier than the Forester Hybrid, which uses essentially the same powertrain in a larger, heavier vehicle.</p><p>Regenerative braking is well integrated and smooth, and the hybrid’s extra noise-suppression material is put to good use. Often I was unaware when the engine switched on and off unless I watched the power gauge—just as it should be in a modern hybrid. Flooring the pedal, of course, produced a fair amount of noise as the engine spooled up to thousands of revs where it generates peak power. But in mixed regular use, the hybrid is definitely the calmest Crosstrek.</p><h2>Top-of-the-Range Prices</h2><p>With the Crosstrek firmly entrenched as Subaru’s entry SUV, the company has worked to price the Hybrid, which will start to appear in North American showrooms in November, commensurately.</p><p>At $35,415, the base Sport Hybrid is $3,300 more than the even more basic Crosstrek Sport, with some of the difference representing added features. The Limited Hybrid at $36,415 costs only $2,000 more than its internal-combustion-engine counterpart, though again equipment is subtly different. All prices here include the mandatory delivery fee of $1,420—an area where many makers hide recent price rises so they don’t show up on the sticker price.</p><p>However, unlike all other Crosstreks, which are built in Subaru’s assembly plant in Indiana, the Crosstrek Hybrids come from Japan. Subaru builds both regular and hybrid Forester compact SUVs in Indiana, so it doesn’t seem impossible that at some point hybrid Crosstreks could be built in the US, too, thereby dodging the 15 percent tariff now set on Japanese auto imports.</p></div>"

For decades, expectant mothers have been racing against biology in the back seats of taxis and Ubers from London to Los Angeles. There was the mother in India who named her son Uber after giving birth to him en route to the hospital (the driver reportedly helped in the delivery). There was also the California couple in 2017 who welcomed their baby in an Uber during Shabbat.”Everyone is telling us to name the baby Uber,” the father joked, before adding, “But we can’t do that.” (Ah, though, they could have!)\nThe stories go on and on. Now, Silicon Valley has automated the experience, at least partially.\nThe vehicle in San Francisco was promptly removed for cleaning. Further, this wasn’t Waymo’s first birth — the company told the Standard that a Phoenix baby got there first. “While this is a very rare occurrence,” a Waymo spokesperson deadpanned, “some of our newest riders just can’t wait to experience their first Waymo ride.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n",

Instead, during an emergency call or text, a dispatcher can send a request to your device. Then you can opt into sharing your camera’s live video, which is encrypted and can be stopped at your discretion.\n“With a single tap, you can start securely streaming from your camera, allowing responders to quickly assess the situation and get you the right help in the moment,” Google wrote in a blog post. “This real-time view can also help them guide you through life-saving steps, like CPR, until help arrives.”\nGoogle and Apple each offer a suite of safety features on their devices, like emergency SOS, crash detection, fall detection, and satellite location services.\nAndroid Emergency Live Video will be supported on Android phones running Android 8 or later.

This software tracks computing performance but the delay in communication between servers also offers a sense of a chip’s location.\nThis software will be optional for customers to use and will be made available for Blackwell chips first, Reuters said.\nMultiple reports have surfaced in the last few days that allege China’s DeepSeek AI models have been trained on smuggled Nvidia Blackwell chips. Nvidia responded to these reports by saying it hasn’t seen evidence of this type of smuggling.\n“We haven’t seen any substantiation or received tips of ‘phantom data centers’ constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled, and reconstructed somewhere else. While such smuggling seems far-fetched, we pursue any tip we receive,” an Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nThis news comes just days after Nvidia got the green light from the U.S. government to start selling its H200 AI chips to approved customers in China on Monday. That announcement pertains only to older H200 chips and not the company’s Blackwell chips.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\nReddit is starting a limited test of verified profiles, which places a grey checkmark beside the username of a notable person or business.\n“This feature is designed to help redditors understand who they’re engaging with in moments when verification matters, whether it’s an expert or celebrity hosting an AMA, a journalist reporting news, or a brand sharing information,” Reddit wrote in a blog post.\nBelieve it or not, there used to be a time on the internet where a verification checkmark simply just confirmed that a notable figure is who they say they are, and was not a signifier that you are paying a monthly fee to Elon Musk and/or Mark Zuckerberg. But Reddit has decided that perhaps it is, actually, a good idea to verify the accounts of public figures in an attempt to mitigate the spread of misinformation. \nReddit acknowledges that pseudonymity is a key part of its culture, allowing users to express themselves more openly than they would if their real name was attached to everything they say. But Reddit says that this feature is completely voluntary and opt-in. The verification feature is less so about denoting a special elite status, but making it easier for both ordinary users and subreddit moderators to quickly verify that someone is being truthful about their identity.\nThe absence of a checkmark doesn’t mean someone is a fraud, though. Reddit is piloting this feature with a small batch of profiles, and even if the checkmarks get a full rollout, it’s still possible that some famous Redditors won’t get a check.\nTony Hawk, for example, posts very casually on skateboarding subreddits, simply chatting about his favorite sport with likeminded fans. He’s just like us! But he does blow up his spot a bit when he shares his own skating videos on r/OldSkaters, because there probably aren’t many 57-year-olds doing heel flips.\n\nWhile Reddit’s checkmarks are in their alpha rollout, users will be eligible if they’re active contributors in good standing and “trusted partners,” which Reddit did not specify. Having a checkmark doesn’t give a user any special privileges. However, users will not be eligible for a checkmark if they are an NSFW profile, or if they primarily engage in NSFW communities. \nFor now, Reddit is manually verifying profiles, but says it will use a third-party process in the future.\nIt’s probably not a coincidence that Reddit is exploring verification at the same time that its co-founder Alexis Ohanian is launching a reboot of the social aggregator, Digg. Digg’s founders have expressed concern that the internet is becoming flooded with bots and AI agents, and they want Digg to be a place where people can connect with actual humans. They’ve said they’re looking into using zero-knowledge proofs as a potential way to verify that users are human.\nSam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has also been exploring means of verifying people’s humanity online. World, Altman’s human verification project, is expected to release an app this week that also focuses on keeping out bots.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture. She has also written for publications like Polygon, MTV, the Kenyon Review, NPR, and Business Insider. She is the co-host of Wow If True, a podcast about internet culture, with science fiction author Isabel J. Kim.

    "body": "\nSpotify announced on Wednesday that, for the first time, it’s giving users more control over the streaming service’s algorithm. That’s at least how the company is framing the launch of its new “Promoted Playlists,” a feature that will initially be available to Premium subscribers in New Zealand.\nThe feature, which is currently available in English only, is still in beta and will evolve before rolling out to other markets, according to Spotify.\nThe new tool allows users to describe what they want to hear in a personalized playlist that reflects the “full arc” of their tastes, according to the company. That means the playlist focuses not only on the songs you like now, but your entire Spotify listening history from day one — something that differentiates the feature from other playlists, the company says.\nThe feature is an evolution from Spotify’s existing AI playlist option, which debuted last year, and also works through written prompts. As with AI playlists, the new Prompted Playlists allow users to request what they want to hear with written instructions. However, they can now write much longer prompts with more specific instructions. That’s because the new AI feature factors in world knowledge, a rep from Spotify explained to TechCrunch. \nIn addition, the ability to go further back in your listening history and schedule how often the playlist refreshes makes it different from Spotify’s other AI playlist offerings. \nFor instance, Spotify suggests subscribers can use the new feature to ask for something like, “music from my top artists from the last five years,” then amend the prompt to include a request for “deep cuts I haven’t heard yet.”\nImage Credits:Spotify\nIn another example of a longer prompt, Spotify said you could ask for “high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down” or “music from this year’s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn addition, you can continue to fine-tune the prompt to make it even more specific, and can set how often you want it to refresh, like daily or weekly. The idea is that users can essentially make their own version of something like Spotify’s flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, but one that’s focused on a type of music, genre, or time period they’d like to track, or their own version of something like Spotify’s genre-focused Daily Mixes.\nThe company says the playlist will include descriptions and context so you know why you’re getting the recommendation. Plus, it will offer a set of prompts to help users get started.\nSpotify isn’t the only social app pitching how it’s letting users take control of its algorithm. Instagram today also introduced a new feature that lets users control what type of reels they see. Bluesky, a decentralized X competitor, also lets users swap out its algorithm for one of their own. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "\nAmazon says it will allow authors to offer their DRM-free e-books in the EPUB and PDF formats through its self-publishing platform, Kindle Direct Pub",
    "body": "\nAmazon says it will allow authors to offer their DRM-free e-books in the EPUB and PDF formats through its self-publishing platform, Kindle Direct Publishing. Starting on January 20, 2026, authors who set their titles as DRM-free will see their books made available in these more open formats.\nThe decision to use Digital Rights Management (DRM), a copyright protection mechanism, is set by the authors when they publish their e-books on Amazon’s platform.\nThe company notes these changes won’t impact previously published titles. If authors want to change the status of older titles, they’ll have to log into the Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) author portal and change an option in the settings. (Instructions on how to make that change are on Amazon’s KDP support site.)\nThis move may actually incentivize authors to apply DRM to their e-books.\nAs one author on the KDP Community forums, Leslie Anne Perry, noted, “Previously, I have not enabled DRM on my e-books. My thinking was that I wanted folks to be able to download them to other devices within their own household. However, I think I will enable it on any future e-books. I’m not sure I want people to be able to download them as a PDFs [sic].”\nAnother member pushed back at the complaints, arguing that it doesn’t really increase privacy, as those who had wanted to could always dump the existing DRM-free Kindle file into software to convert it into an EPUB or PDF.\nAmazon is positioning the new feature as making it “easier” for readers to enjoy the content they’ve already purchased, but the reality is that authors would have to opt in if they want to open up access to their older works. To remove the DRM, authors will have to click a box that says, “I understand that by not applying DRM, customers who buy and have already bought this book will be able to download it as a PDF or EPUB file.”\nElsewhere, Amazon has been making it more difficult for Kindle owners to share or back up their e-books through heavier use of DRM in recent months.\nWith an update to Kindle’s software for 11th- and 12th-generation devices, the retailer introduced a new DRM system that made it impossible for Kindle users to back up their e-books without jailbreaking their device. This had followed an earlier change to remove the download and transfer options via USB, which angered many Kindle owners.\nAfter the author updates their e-book’s DRM status, Amazon says the changes will take up to 72 hours before they are live on Amazon.com.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAmazon announced on Wednesday that customers in over 2,300 cities and towns in the U.S. can now get fresh groceries through its Same-Day Delivery service. The e-commerce giant says it will expand the service to additional cities in 2026. \nAmazon launched the ability to order perishable items via Same-Day Delivery in August, a move that was seen as a way for the company to compete more directly with Instacart and Walmart+ in the quick-commerce space.\nSince launch, customers have ordered fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, seafood, baked goods, and frozen foods alongside electronics, books, pantry staples, and snacks, as well as everyday household essentials like paper towels and toothpaste.\nAmazon says its “specialized temperature-controlled fulfillment network” ensures that shoppers receive perishable groceries intact, and that orders undergo a six-point quality check upon arrival and before leaving for delivery. Plus, temperature-sensitive products are delivered in insulated bags.\nFresh groceries now make up nine of the top 10 most-ordered items for fast delivery, Amazon says.\nThe top bestsellers for Same-Day Delivery are bananas, Haas avocados, strawberries, honeycrisp apples, limes, blueberries, blackberries, organic bananas, navel oranges, and bathroom tissues.\nThe company also notes that perishable grocery sales have grown 30 times since January, and that customers who add fresh groceries to their Same-Day Delivery orders shop about twice as often as those who don’t.\nSame-day delivery is free for orders worth more than $25 for Prime members. If an order doesn’t meet the minimum amount, subscribers can still choose same-day delivery for a $2.99 fee. For customers without a Prime membership, the service is available with a $12.99 fee, regardless of the order size.\nAmazon says it has grown its perishable selection available for Same-Day Delivery by over 30% since August, and has included thousands of popular items from Whole Foods Market.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe Calibri font is the latest government worker to be fired from the Trump administration for its association with diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. \nIn an action that reads like a story from The Onion (and will certainly be fodder for “Saturday Night Live” or “South Park”), U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has banned the font and ordered diplomats to use Times New Roman for official documents instead, the New York Times reported after obtaining a leaked memo on the topic. \nCalibri, which is a sans-serif font, was apparently adopted in 2023 during Biden’s tenure. It was chosen by the department’s then-DEI office, which has since been disbanded under Rubio amid the Trump administration’s anti-DEI directives. \nThe font was chosen in an effort to make documents easier to read for the vision impaired. Sans-serif fonts are those without decorative swirls and lines at the ends of letters. With their cleaner lines and slightly wider letter spacing, they are considered more accessible for people with issues ranging from dyslexia to low vision (although research on how much the serifs themselves impact readability has been inconclusive).  \nRubio’s memo has designated Times New Roman as his tenure’s official font, stating it will “restore decorum and professionalism” to documents. Rubio did admit in the memo that Calibri wasn’t the “most illegal, immoral, radical or wasteful” example of DEI to his mind’s eye, but he still berated the font for contributing to “the degradation” of the State Department’s official correspondence.  \nMany people across the political spectrum dislike Calibri (according to an informal survey of TechCrunch writers) but all the same, that’s a harsh criticism for a font. \nApparently, there were rumblings within the department in 2023 when Calibri was first adopted, the New York Times reported. Font choices inspire the same kind of love/hate passions as sports teams. Everyone has their favorites and their rivalries. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile Calibri declined to comment to TechCrunch on how woke it actually was, many people would agree that Times New Roman is a particularly old-timey font. Even the New York Times stopped using it almost two decades ago.  \nThe State Department did not immediately respond to our request for comment. \n",

For the U.S. market, OpenAI’s ChatGPT topped the ranks of free iPhone apps (not including games) with the most installs in 2025. \nThe AI app was followed by Threads, Google, TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and Google’s Gemini.\nChatGPT made it to No. 4 last year, but the top spot was taken by Chinese shopping app Temu. In 2023, the AI app didn’t make the top-10 list despite being released on the iPhone in May 2023 to a strong debut.\nThe fact that ChatGPT is outpacing social networking standbys, and much-needed utilities like Google Maps, indicates how deeply AI has penetrated people’s everyday lives here in the U.S. It also demonstrates the potential for OpenAI to disrupt Google’s tight hold on the search market on mobile devices, as more people turn to a chatbot for answers first.\nThere were signs that ChatGPT was on its way to No. 1 earlier in the year — it became the most-downloaded app globally in March, outpacing other top apps like TikTok and Instagram.\nApple also released its list of the top paid apps, the top free and paid games for iPhone and iPad, as well as the top Apple Arcade games.\nBlock Blast! was the top free game this year, while Minecraft took the crown as the top paid game. On iPad, YouTube was the No. 1 free app, and users downloaded the creativity app Procreate as the top paid game on iPad. Roblox was the top free iPad game.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe full list of top apps and games is below:\nTop Free iPhone Apps\n\nChatGPT\nThreads\nGoogle\nTikTok – Videos, Shop & LIVE\nWhatsApp Messenger\nInstagram\nYouTube\nGoogle Maps\nGmail – Email by Google\nGoogle Gemini\n\nTop Paid iPhone Apps\n\nHotSchedules\nShadowrocket\nProcreate Pocket\nAnkiMobile Flashcards\nPaprika Recipe Manager 3\nSkyView®\nTonalEnergy Tuner & Metronome\nAutoSleep Track Sleep on Watch\nForest: Focus for Productivity\nRadarScope\n\nTop Free iPhone Games\n\nBlock Blast!\nFortnite\nRoblox\nTownship\nPokémon TCG Pocket\nRoyal Kingdom\nClash Royale\nVita Mahjong\nWhiteout Survival\nLast War: Survival\n\nTop Paid iPhone Games\n\nMinecraft: Dream it, Build it!\nBalatro\nHeads Up!\nPlague Inc.\nGeometry Dash\nBloons TD 6\nStardew Valley\nPapa’s Freezeria To Go!\nAnimal Crossing: Pocket Camp C\nRed’s First Flight\n\nTop Free iPad Apps\n\nYouTube\nChatGPT\nNetflix\nDisney+\nAmazon Prime Video\nTikTok – Videos, Shop & LIVE\nGoogle Chrome\nGoodnotes: AI Notes, Docs, PDF\nCanva: AI Photo & Video Editor\nHBO Max: Stream Movies & TV\n\nTop Paid iPad Apps\n\nProcreate\nProcreate Dreams\nforScore\nToonSquid\nNomad Sculpt\nShadowrocket\nAnkiMobile Flashcards\nBluebeam Revu for iPad\nTeach Your Monster to Read\nFeather: Draw in 3D\n\nTop Free iPad Games\n\nRoblox\nBlock Blast!\nFortnite\nPerfect Tidy\nMagic Tiles 3: Piano Game\nMini Games: Calm & Chill\nGoods Puzzle: Sort Challenge\nhole.io\nSubway Surfers\nTownship\n\nTop Paid iPad Games\n\nMinecraft: Dream it, Build it!\nGeometry Dash\nStardew Valley\nBalatro\nBloons TD 6\nPlague Inc.\nAnimal Crossing: Pocket Camp C\nPoppy Playtime Chapter 3\nPurple Place – Classic Games\nPapa’s Sushiria To Go!\n\nTop Apple Arcade Games\n\nNFL Retro Bowl ’26\nNBA 2K25 Arcade Edition\nBalatro+\nSnake.io+\nSneaky Sasquatch\nHello Kitty Island Adventure\nFruit Ninja Classic+\nBloons TD 6+\nPGA TOUR Pro Golf\nSolitaire by MobilityWare+\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAfter a string of disturbing mental health incidents involving AI chatbots, a group of state attorneys general have sent a letter to the AI industry’s top companies, with a warning to fix “delusional outputs” or risk being in breach of state law. \nThe letter, signed by dozens of AGs from U.S. states and territories with the National Association of Attorneys General, asks the companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and 10 other major AI firms, to implement a variety of new internal safeguards to protect their users. Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Character Technologies, Luka, Meta, Nomi AI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI were also included in the letter.\nThe letter comes as a fight over AI regulations has been brewing between state and federal government.\nThose safeguards include transparent third-party audits of large language models that look for signs of delusional or sycophantic ideations, as well as new incident reporting procedures designed to notify users when chatbots produce psychologically harmful outputs. Those third parties, which could include academic and civil society groups, should be allowed to “evaluate systems pre-release without retaliation and to publish their findings without prior approval from the company,” the letter states.\n“GenAI has the potential to change how the world works in a positive way. But it also has caused—and has the potential to cause—serious harm, especially to vulnerable populations,” the letter states, pointing to a number of well-publicized incidents over the past year — including suicides and murder — in which violence has been linked to excessive AI use, the letter states. “In many of these incidents, the GenAI products generated sycophantic and delusional outputs that either encouraged users’ delusions or assured users that they were not delusional.”\nAGs also suggest companies treat mental health incidents the same way tech companies handle cybersecurity incidents — with clear and transparent incident reporting policies and procedures. \nCompanies should develop and publish “detection and response timelines for sycophantic and delusional outputs,” the letter states. In a similar fashion to how data breaches are currently handled, companies should also “promptly, clearly, and directly notify users if they were exposed to potentially harmful sycophantic or delusional outputs,” the letter says. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother ask is that the companies develop “reasonable and appropriate safety tests” on GenAI models to “ensure the models do not produce potentially harmful sycophantic and delusional outputs.” These tests should be conducted before the models are ever offered to the public, it adds.  \nTechCrunch was unable to reach Google, Microsoft, or OpenAI for comment prior to publication. The article will be updated if the companies respond.\nTech companies developing AI have had a much warmer reception at the federal level. \nThe Trump administration has made it known it is unabashedly pro-AI, and, over the past year, multiple attempts have been made to pass a nationwide moratorium on state-level AI regulations. So far, those attempts have failed — thanks, in part, to pressure from state officials.\nNot to be deterred, Trump announced Monday he plans to pass an executive order next week that will limit the ability of states to regulate AI. The president said in a post on Truth Social he hoped his EO would stop AI from being “DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY.”\n",

    "body": "\nOboe, a learning startup from Anchor co-founders and former Spotify execs Nir Zicherman and Michael Mignano, said today it has raised $16 million in Series A funding led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Eniac, Haystack, Offline, and Factorial. The round also saw investments from individuals such as Adam D’Angelo, Garry Tan, Lenny Rachitsky, Mati Staniszewski, Mikey Shulman, Jared Hecht, and M.G. Siegler.\nThat platform, which officially launched in September, allows users to define a learning goal and use AI to create a course for them. \nThe startup’s fundraise comes three months after the app’s launch and a year after it raised a $4 million seed round. Zicherman said the reason behind the fresh round is to fuel growth at scale.\n“We want to reach billions of people who want to learn about new topics, and it is a very big opportunity,”  he told TechCrunch over a call. “We need to execute faster and reach a larger audience at scale to achieve this vision.” \n“We have a team of successful consumer product builders that can execute well, which gives us an edge over other startups in the market,” he added.\nBryan Kim, a partner at a16z, said that he was impressed by how fast Oboe started generating content on a topic and didn’t make users wait behind a loading indicator. \n“We have had a thesis around how AI-aided learning can help people explore new topics and have been looking for the right company. After Oboe launched, we tried it and loved the product. We wanted to back a founder who was ambitious, flexible in adopting different form factors, and understood AI to build a big platform. We found that in Oboe,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\nThe company is making changes to its core course-generation experience, as well. Earlier, Oboe generated different text and audio formats for users in different styles. Plus, it capped course generation based on the payment plan.\nImage Credits:Oboe\nWith the new version, the app will first understand your goal and then generate chapters based on that to help you learn about those topics. What’s more, users will see other modalities like quizzes appear within the course material seamlessly. For some courses, Oboe will also generate flashcards for you to easily remember course materials.\nIn terms of audio, instead of having to choose between a podcast format and a lecture format, the company generates a podcast for you and changes its tone based on the learning material and other signals from users. \nImage Credits:Oboe\nZicherman said that the company observed that there is a high demand among users to learn about STEM topics (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). The startup has worked on sourcing the best material for these topics, including programming.\nHe said that good teachers decide what is the best way of learning for students and the company is taking that approach of designing courses for learners.\nImage Credits:Oboe\nOboe is revamping its pricing model to give unlimited course generation to users. \nHowever, if they want to dive deeper into a topic, they can pay $15 a month ($144 per year) to access more course chapters. There is also a $40 per month ($384 per year) Pro plan, which gives unlimited chapter access and allows users to export or download courses for consumption outside Oboe. The startup said this is suitable for students who want to take printouts of the study material and consume it offline.\nZicherman said that right now Oboe is offering courses in English, but it wants to reach different parts of the world better with localized courses and language support. The platform is currently available on the web, with mobile support planned for the future. \nIn the last few years, multiple tools, including Google’s NotebookLM and ex-Google employees’ Huxe, allow you to enter a prompt to get a podcast episode to explore a topic. While these are one-off generations, Oboe’s approach is to let you dive deeper into the topic with chapter-based learning.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nUnacademy, once one of India’s best-known edtech startups, may now be worth less than $500 million, 85% less than its pandemic-era peak valuation, as the company undergoes a steep reset and explores merger and acquisition options.\nIn a detailed note posted on X on Wednesday marking the startup’s 10th anniversary, Unacademy’s CEO Gaurav Munjal said the startup’s valuation has fallen sharply from its $3.5 billion peak three years ago to less than $500 million today. He also confirmed the startup is in M&A talks.\nIndia’s edtech landscape has fractured since the pandemic, when the sector saw a rare moment of opportunity during the lockdowns. Startups like Unacademy and Byju’s raised billions, hired freely, and invested heavily in sales and marketing to draw customers, but growth stalled after the lockdowns eased and students went back to offline classes.\nByju’s, India’s most valuable startup just three years ago, has seen its valuation written down to effectively zero, and it entered insolvency proceedings in September last year. In November, a U.S. bankruptcy court ordered its founder Byju Raveendran to pay more than $1.07 billion for ignoring court directives, and providing “evasive, incomplete” responses related to the transfer of $533 million by the startup’s U.S. unit that it never recovered.\nMeanwhile, Physics Wallah, long considered the underdog, has turned profitable and continued to expand, and last month had a strong public-market debut.\nIn his note, Unacademy’s Munjal said the last three years were marked by shrinking demand, intensifying competition, and internal turmoil as the startup suffered losses and abandoned aggressive expansion plans.\n“Personally, for us founders, this was the most difficult three years that we had ever seen in our lives because until 2021, we had not seen a single month of degrowth [sic],” he wrote. “But in the last three years, we saw losing market share in the game that we literally invented and it hurt.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMunjal believes the slump was driven by a rapid shift in market dynamics after the pandemic. As students moved back to offline classrooms and competitors launched lower-priced offerings modeled on Unacademy’s early strategy, the company saw demand decline and growth stagnate.\n“We got complacent,” he wrote, adding that the firm failed to innovate on price even as rivals undercut it.\nIn recent months, Munjal has devoted increasing attention to AirLearn, his new AI-first language learning app that imitates Duolingo’s gamified approach. That shift has created friction with some Unacademy investors, who felt the core edtech business was being left adrift during a difficult phase, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2015, Unacademy has raised about $854.3 million over 13 funding rounds, according to PitchBook, and counts SoftBank, Tiger Global, General Atlantic, and Peak XV Partners among its backers.\nMunjal said Unacademy has spent the past two years overhauling its operations, slashing its annual burn from ₹14 billion (around $155.7 million) in 2022 to less than ₹1.75 billion (approximately $19.5 million) this year. The startup has significantly reduced headcount through layoffs, cut marketing costs, and refocused on its core subscription business.\nRecent reports have suggested that rival UpGrad has discussed acquiring Unacademy for between $300 and $400 million.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA new helper has arrived at the North Pole in recent years: AI.\nTavus, the AI startup that creates digital replicas using voice and face cloning technology, has launched its AI Santa experience for the second year in a row. This allows parents and children to video chat with a virtual version of the jolly old Saint Nick.\nAfter signing up for a free account, users can interact with AI Santa via text, phone, or video chat. Users can tell AI Santa what they want for Christmas, share their holiday plans, and find out if they’re on the naughty or nice list. \nThis year, the company debuted an improved version of AI Santa, designed to be more expressive and emotionally aware. Santa is now a “Tavus PAL,” the company’s name for its real-time AI agents that are built to see, hear, respond, and appear human.\nAI Santa can now see users’ expressions and gestures and respond to them. It also remembers users’ conversations and interests, creating a more personalized experience. Notably, it now can take actions of its own, including searching the web for present ideas or even perform everyday tasks like drafting emails.\nImage Credits:Tavus\nDuring testing, the conversation with AI Santa was engaging for the most part. When we mentioned wanting a new PlayStation for Christmas, Santa followed up with questions about our favorite video games, showing knowledge of specific titles like Baldur’s Gate 3. It also smiled back when we did. (We didn’t like that part very much, but maybe others will.)\nUsers appear to be enjoying the improved experience so far. Founder and CEO Hassaan Raza said that many people are engaging with the platform frequently, spending hours chatting with AI Santa and often reaching their daily limits.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Last year’s AI Santa drew millions of hits, and we’re on pace to surpass that by a wide margin as Christmas approaches,” he noted.\nWhile this level of engagement marks a milestone for Tavus, it also raises questions about the impact of such interactions, especially for young children. Children may struggle to distinguish between AI and a real person. Spending hours in conversation with an AI has already been linked to negative effects in adults, making the potential effects on children who strongly believe in Santa a concern for some parents.\nDuring our testing, there were subtle cues that the AI Santa does yet appear fully human-like, such as long pauses and a flat voice. We also found that if a user were to question whether it’s real, the programmed response was: “I’m an AI Santa powered by Tavus’ magic and technology. I might not be the physical Santa, but I’ve got the spirit and the cheer.”\nStill, the experience launches amid growing concerns about AI’s effects on young users. There have been reports linking chatbot interactions to serious harm, including cases where chatbots were implicated in the suicide deaths of teenagers. Character.AI removed access to its chatbots for users under 18 in October. \nImage Credits:Tavus\nRaza emphasized that the AI Santa experience is designed for families to enjoy together, with safety measures in place to ensure appropriate interactions. Safety features, such as content filters, have been implemented to maintain family-friendly discussions. \nIn certain situations, conversations can be terminated, and users are directed to mental health resources if necessary. \n“The vast majority of interactions have been family-friendly and true to the Santa experience,” he said. \nAdditionally, when asked about data collection, Raza said the company “collects logs, session timestamps, metadata, and other information users choose to share during their chats. This data is used to provide and maintain a safe experience, and users can request data deletion at any point in time.”\n",

    "body": "\nAI agents are being sold as the solution for planning trips, answering business questions, and solving problems of all kinds, but getting them to work with tools and data outside their chat interfaces has been tricky. Developers have to patch together various connectors and keep them running, but that’s a fragile approach that’s hard to scale and creates governance headaches.\nGoogle claims it’s trying to solve that by launching its own fully managed, remote MCP servers that would make its Google and Cloud services — like Maps and BigQuery — easier for agents to plug into.\nThe move follows the launch of Google’s latest Gemini 3 model, and the company is looking to pair stronger reasoning with more dependable connections to real-world tools and data.\n“We are making Google agent-ready by design,” Steren Giannini, product management director at Google Cloud, told TechCrunch. \nInstead of spending a week or two setting up connectors, developers can now essentially paste in a URL to a managed endpoint, Giannini said.\nAt launch, Google is starting with MCP servers for Maps, BigQuery, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes Engine. In practice, this might look like an analytics assistant querying BigQuery directly, or an ops agent interacting with infrastructure services. \nIn the case of Maps, Giannini said, without the MCP, developers would rely on the model’s built-in knowledge. “But by giving your agent […] a tool like the Google Maps MCP server, then it gets grounded on actual, up-to-date location information for places or trips planning,” he added.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile the MCP servers will eventually be offered across all of Google’s tools, they are initially launching under public preview, meaning they’re not yet fully covered by Google Cloud terms of service. They are, however, being offered at no extra cost to enterprise customers that already pay for Google services. \n“We expect to bring them to general availability very soon in the new year,” Giannini said, adding that he expects more MCP servers to trickle in every week.\nMCP, which stands for Model Context Protocol, was developed by Anthropic about a year ago as an open source standard to connect AI systems with data and tools. The protocol has been widely adopted across the agent tooling world, and Anthropic earlier this week donated MCP to a new Linux Foundation fund dedicated to open sourcing and standardizing AI agent infrastructure. \n“The beauty of MCP is that, because it’s a standard, if Google provides a server, it can connect to any client,” Giannini said. “I’m looking forward to seeing how many more clients will emerge.”\nOne can think of MCP clients as the AI apps on the other end of the wire that talk to MCP servers and call the tools they offer. For Google, that includes Gemini CLI and AI Studio. Giannini said he’s also tried it with Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT as clients, and “they just work.”\nGoogle argues this isn’t just about connecting agents to its services. The bigger enterprise play is Apigee, its API management product, which many companies already use to issue API keys, set quotas, and monitor traffic. \nGiannini said Apigee can essentially “translate” a standard API into an MCP server, turning endpoints like a product catalog API into tools an agent can discover and use, with existing security and governance controls layered on top. \nIn other words, the same API guardrails companies use for human-built apps could now apply to AI agents, too. \nGoogle’s new MCP servers are protected by a permission mechanism called Google Cloud IAM, which explicitly protects what an agent can do with that server. They are also protected by Google Cloud Model Armor, which Giannini describes as a firewall dedicated to agentic workloads that defends against advanced agentic threats like prompt injection and data exfiltration. Administrators can also rely on audit logging for additional observability. \nGoogle plans to expand MCP support beyond the initial set of servers. In the next few months, the company will roll out support for services across areas like storage, databases, logging and monitoring, and security.\n“We built the plumbing so that developers don’t have to,” Giannini said.\n",

His company “plans to scale to hundreds” of Baidu’s electric RT6 SUVs from there, though he did not lay out a timeline for commercial launch.\nUber announced it plans to test the vehicles there next year as part of its own deal with Baidu, which the companies announced in July. The company said it expects to start testing in the first half of 2026.\nThe twin London rollouts are the latest in a series of robotaxi tie-ups that have seen Uber and Lyft strike deals with Baidu, Waymo, and many others in order to stand up operations in cities around the world.\n",

Securing access to energy that powers data centers has become a critical part of training AI models.\nAlphabet previously held a minority stake in Intersect Power after Google and TPG Rise Climate led an $800 million strategic funding round in the company last December.

    "body": "\nThe war for the future of Warner Brothers continues, as Paramount Skydance announced Monday an amended all-cash offer for the legacy movie studio. The offer includes an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from a major backer, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to provide tens of billions in equity financing for the deal. It’s the latest move by Ellison’s son, David Ellison — the CEO of Paramount Skydance — to pry the potential acquisition loose from his competition, the streaming giant Netflix.  \n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” a Paramount press release published Monday states. The proposed equity financing had previously been included in Paramount’s offer, but the elder Ellison’s “personal guarantee” is new, the press release states.\nThe revamped offer comes a mere week after the WBD board rejected Paramount’s initial bid, favoring, instead, a previous deal with Netflix. That deal was announced on December 5, outlining how the streamer would purchase the movie studio via a cash and stock option valued at $27.75 per WBD share, and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion.\nThree days after the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount launched a hostile bid valued at $108.4 billion, offering $30 per share. The WBD board rejected this offer, calling it “illusory” and claiming that Paramount had misled shareholders about the proposed deal’s financing. At the time of the rejection, the board noted that the deal with Netflix was “a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments.”\nNow, Paramount’s amended offer has been designed to “address WBD’s stated concerns regarding Paramount’s superior offer,” Paramount said. In October, CNBC reported that, prior to the Netflix deal, WBD had previously rejected three different takeover offers from Paramount.\n“Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD,” said Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, in Monday’s press release. “Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders. Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice.”\nHe added: “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”\nTechCrunch reached out to Warner Bros. Discovery for comment. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

TikTok Shop has also recently expanded into luxury retail, another move to solidify its footing in e-commerce.\nUsers can load the gift cards with anything from $10 to $500. What sets these cards apart is the ability to personalize them using a wide variety of animated designs. There are also animations for thank-you cards, birthdays, weddings, and other occasions.\nGift cards are delivered via email, and recipients must have a TikTok account. Once redeemed, the card’s value is instantly credited to their TikTok Balance. Recipients can reply with a thank-you note or even send a gift card in return.\nHowever, the gift cards can only be purchased in the U.S. for now.\nImage Credits:TikTok Shop\nTikTok said it plans to add features that let users personalize gift cards more. By early 2026, users will be able to record or upload video messages to attach to their digital gift cards. A company spokesperson said the experience will also include an “interactive unboxing that captures their reaction in real-time,” but declined to share further details.\nThe launch of digital gift cards comes on the heels of a significant milestone for TikTok Shop: Over the four days of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the app recorded sales of more than $500 million in the U.S.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHowever, despite this achievement, TikTok Shop faces uncertainty as the sale of the app’s U.S. operations to an American investor group looms. If a sale doesn’t occur, TikTok faces a potential ban in the country. President Trump has extended the deadline to January 23, 2026, leaving the app’s future in the U.S. hanging in the balance.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\nChatGPT is releasing its own version of Spotify Wrapped. That is, the OpenAI-owned chatbot is now rolling out an annual review feature called “Your Year with ChatGPT” to eligible consumers in select markets, including the United States.\nOther English-speaking markets with access to the new offering include Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.\nAt launch, the feature will be offered to those with the free, Plus, and Pro plans who have the “reference saved memories” and “reference chat history” options turned on and have met a minimum conversation activity threshold, the company told TechCrunch via email.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nTeam, Enterprise, or Education accounts will not be able to use the “Your Year with ChatGPT” feature. In addition, the experience is meant to be “lightweight, privacy-forward, and user-controlled,” the company noted. \nSimilar to other annual reviews offered by consumer apps, “Your Year with ChatGPT” takes inspiration from the popular year-end look back, Spotify Wrapped. Like Spotify’s feature, OpenAI uses catchy graphics and personalizes the experience to the individual by giving out “awards” based on how you’ve used ChatGPT throughout the year.\nFor instance, you might be awarded with the “Creative Debugger” if you used the chatbot to come up with solutions to a problem or worked through a concept or idea. \nImage Credits:OpenAI\nThe app also creates a poem and an image about your year focused on your topics of interest. (We’re wondering how this will look next year as ChatGPT embraces adult content in 2026.)\nWhile the year-end wrap-up will be promoted on the ChatGPT app’s home screen, it won’t be forced on users or opened automatically. \nImage Credits:OpenAI\nIt will be available on the ChatGPT web app and mobile app for iOS and Android, the company says. \nYou also can ask ChatGPT directly for “Your Year with ChatGPT” to trigger the experience.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIn just about a week, iRobot, Luminar, and Rad Power Bikes all filed for bankruptcy.\nThey’re very different companies — selling Roombas, lidar, and e-bikes, respectively — but as Sean O’Kane, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed on an episode of the Equity podcast, they faced some similar challenges, including tariff pressures, major deals that fell through, and a failure to establish themselves beyond the products that first made them successful.\nYou can read an edited preview of our conversation below, with Sean providing an overview of each filing, Rebecca weighing in on whether she has a Roomba, and me speculating about what the popular narratives about these bankruptcies leave out.\nSean: Rad Power is big for an e-bike company, but small, I think, in most people’s minds, since that’s still a bit of a niche. They were founded a long time ago and became popular even before the pandemic, and really were thought of as an industry leader, as far as quality of the bikes that they’re making, pretty good branding and marketing, and trying to connect with customers — which is really hard to find in the world of e-bikes, where most of them are just like alphabet soup companies on Amazon. \nThey rode that wave in the pandemic up high as micromobility really took off, and people were really rethinking how they were getting around, they weren’t commuting into the office as much. And we get glimpses of that in the bankruptcy filings. It only shows revenue back three years, but they were pulling in well over $100 million in revenue in 2023 — like $123 million, I think that fell to about $100 [million] last year, and through the bankruptcy this year, they were only at about $63 million, so they were clearly coming down off a pretty big high. They have a pretty diverse product lineup, but they just never really found a way to establish a foothold there.\nAnd I think you could say similar things about these other two companies. Luminar is another company that was founded in the early 2010s, came out of stealth in 2017, and its mission was essentially to take lidar sensors, which at the time were really expensive and big and really only used in, like, defense applications and aerospace. 2017 was sort of the first big hype cycle of autonomous vehicles. They wanted to apply those sensors, make them more affordable for that use case. That helped them get some deals, most notably with Volvo, and then some other deals with Mercedes-Benz, and a couple other players. But they were just heavily concentrated in that, and that was one of the reasons they wound up filing this week, too.\nAnd then iRobot [was] the most well known of these three companies — a lot of people listening probably even have a Roomba at home or something very like it. It’s just another one of these situations where iRobot became synonymous with a certain thing, and then the advances in the technology that build that product move so quickly that they wound up in a situation where they were looking for a way out. And we all saw this, they were trying to get acquired by Amazon, and that deal got blocked by the FTC and so here we are. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThey’re very different companies, but they all ran into similar problems. Do either of you guys have a Roomba?\nRebecca: No, I don’t have a Roomba. Those freak me out, but I bought my mom a Rad Power bike years ago, and she loves it. But now, you know, they had not only this bankruptcy issue, but they also had the issue with the batteries — they weren’t able to do their recalls because they were, like, “If we have to recall these bikes, we’re going to go bankrupt.” But they’re going bankrupt anyway! \nI’m curious about the tariff thing, and how much this affected everyone’s bottom lines. You hear a lot on social media, people who are pro merger, how certain FTC blockings of [mergers] leads to the companies going bankrupt, or getting acquired by a Chinese firm rather than an American firm. \nSean: iRobot represents, to me, the sort of macro global trade problem of, could you have ever built this company here in the United States with a localized supply chain over the last 15 years? Probably not. And so it makes sense that they became so heavily reliant on China — which, let’s be real, probably led to the ability for these other companies to pop up and essentially copy what they did. \nThat reminds me of in Trump 1, when he flipped on tariffs for Chinese imports, and we saw a bunch of startups like Boosted Boards and other ones in the micromobility space get hit. So they’re contributing factors, for sure. The battery recall with Rad Power absolutely was, I think, a bigger dagger at the end, but the tariff stuff put them on uneven footing that made it harder for them to respond to stuff like that.\nAnthony: A lot of times when a company fails, there [are] larger structural issues, and then there’s maybe a more immediate proximate issue. And particularly in the case of iRobot, I think that a lot of former executives and even outside commentators are pointing to this Amazon deal that was reached a few years ago — it kind of looked like the EU was not going to allow it to go through, and there is this sense of, “Okay, well, by blocking this deal, you’ve essentially put the dagger in their heart that eventually killed the company.”\nThat narrative also maybe ignores the fact that there were other things that caused them to want to get acquired in the first place.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "\nTwo weeks after a judge struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order that blocked offshore wind development, the White House is again pausing",
    "body": "\nTwo weeks after a judge struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order that blocked offshore wind development, the White House is again pausing leases for five large projects, this time citing concerns over radar interference.\n“Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday in a statement.\nThe affected projects include Revolution Wind in Connecticut and Rhode Island, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts, and Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind, both of which are in New York. In total, these projects represent nearly 6 gigawatts of generating capacity for the Eastern seaboard, a hotspot of data center development.\nThe Department of the Interior justified the action by citing unclassified government reports — it didn’t say which agency had produced them, nor did it link to them — along with “recently completed classified reports” from the Pentagon. The department said it would give the government time to work with stakeholders to address national security concerns.\nThe statement did not acknowledge the ongoing work government and wind developers have been doing to address national security concerns, specifically related to radar, for years.\nThe report the Interior Department is likely referring to was issued by the Department of Energy in February 2024, and it lists a number of projects that were then underway to mitigate the problem of radar interference. (Other reports over the years have been commissioned to address the same concerns, some dating back to the previous Trump administration.)\n“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” the 2024 report said. “However, the development and use of radar interference mitigation techniques, and collaboration both among federal agencies and between the federal government and the wind industry have enabled federal radar agencies to continue to perform their missions without significant impacts, and have also enabled significant wind energy deployments throughout the United States.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRadar interference caused by wind turbines is nothing new. Researchers have been studying the phenomenon for well over a decade, and they’ve developed a range of strategies to mitigate any problems. \nWind turbines present a unique challenge to radar operators. \n“The motion of a wind turbine gives it a complex Doppler signature,” Nicholas O’Donoughue, a senior engineer at the Rand Corporation, told TechCrunch. \nDoppler refers to the change in frequency of a wave like a radar signal caused by a moving object. As a wind turbine’s blades sweep through their arc, they are alternately moving toward and away from the radar station. The angle and speed of the blades can have an effect, too.\nThose, along with other considerations, can “challenge the detection of any targets that are near the wind farm,” O’Donoughue said. \nBut radar systems can filter out signals that result from wind farms. “The primary approach is to use adaptive processing algorithms, such as Space-Time Adaptive Processing, to learn the structure of a wind farm’s interference,” he said. \n“Over time, the reflections from a wind farm can be processed to look for patterns, which can then be matched and suppressed. This process is analogous to how modern adaptive noise cancellation headphones work, albeit more complicated.” Objects with a low radar cross section can still slip through, he noted.\nBecause of that, many wind farms are already built with radar installations in mind. “The most basic and widely employed mitigation method is wind farm siting, such as modifying the layout of a proposed wind farm to keep the wind turbines out of the line-of-sight of the radar,” the 2024 Energy department report said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism. He received his PhD in environmental science, policy, and management from the University of California, Berkeley, and his BA degree in environmental studies, English, and biology from St. Olaf College.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Tim by emailing tim.dechant@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "description": "\nEven as OpenAI works to harden its Atlas AI browser against cyberattacks, the company admits that prompt injections, a type of attack that manipulate",
    "body": "\nEven as OpenAI works to harden its Atlas AI browser against cyberattacks, the company admits that prompt injections, a type of attack that manipulates AI agents to follow malicious instructions often hidden in web pages or emails, is a risk that’s not going away anytime soon — raising questions about how safely AI agents can operate on the open web. \n“Prompt injection, much like scams and social engineering on the web, is unlikely to ever be fully ‘solved,’” OpenAI wrote in a Monday blog post detailing how the firm is beefing up Atlas’ armor to combat the unceasing attacks. The company conceded that “agent mode” in ChatGPT Atlas “expands the security threat surface.”\nOpenAI launched its ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers rushed to publish their demos, showing it was possible to write a few words in Google Docs that were capable of changing the underlying browser’s behavior. That same day, Brave published a blog post explaining that indirect prompt injection is a systematic challenge for AI-powered browsers, including Perplexity’s Comet. \nOpenAI isn’t alone in recognizing that prompt-based injections aren’t going away. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre earlier this month warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI applications “may never be totally mitigated,” putting websites at risk of falling victim to data breaches. The U.K. government agency advised cyber professionals to reduce the risk and impact of prompt injections, rather than think the attacks can be “stopped.” \nFor OpenAI’s part, the company said: “We view prompt injection as a long-term AI security challenge, and we’ll need to continuously strengthen our defenses against it.”\nThe company’s answer to this Sisyphean task? A proactive, rapid-response cycle that the firm says is showing early promise in helping discover novel attack strategies internally before they are exploited “in the wild.” \nThat’s not entirely different from what rivals like Anthropic and Google have been saying: that to fight against the persistent risk of prompt-based attacks, defenses must be layered and continuously stress-tested. Google’s recent work, for example, focuses on architectural and policy-level controls for agentic systems.\nBut where OpenAI is taking a different tact is with its “LLM-based automated attacker.” This attacker is basically a bot that OpenAI trained, using reinforcement learning, to play the role of a hacker that looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions to an AI agent. \nThe bot can test the attack in simulation before using it for real, and the simulator shows how the target AI would think and what actions it would take if it saw the attack. The bot can then study that response, tweak the attack, and try again and again. That insight into the target AI’s internal reasoning is something outsiders don’t have access to, so, in theory, OpenAI’s bot should be able to find flaws faster than a real-world attacker would. \nIt’s a common tactic in AI safety testing: build an agent to find the edge cases and test against them rapidly in simulation. \n“Our [reinforcement learning]-trained attacker can steer an agent into executing sophisticated, long-horizon harmful workflows that unfold over tens (or even hundreds) of steps,” wrote OpenAI. “We also observed novel attack strategies that did not appear in our human red teaming campaign or external reports.”\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nIn a demo (pictured in part above), OpenAI showed how its automated attacker slipped a malicious email into a user’s inbox. When the AI agent later scanned the inbox, it followed the hidden instructions in the email and sent a resignation message instead of drafting an out-of-office reply. But following the security update, “agent mode” was able to successfully detect the prompt injection attempt and flag it to the user, according to the company. \nThe company says that while prompt injection is hard to secure against in a foolproof way, it’s leaning on large-scale testing and faster patch cycles to harden its systems before they show up in real-world attacks. \nAn OpenAI spokesperson declined to share whether the update to Atlas’ security has resulted in a measurable reduction in successful injections, but says the firm has been working with third parties to harden Atlas against prompt injection since before launch.\nRami McCarthy, principal security researcher at cybersecurity firm Wiz, says that reinforcement learning is one way to continuously adapt to attacker behavior, but it’s only part of the picture. \n“A useful way to reason about risk in AI systems is autonomy multiplied by access,” McCarthy told TechCrunch. \n“Agentic browsers tend to sit in a challenging part of that space: moderate autonomy combined with very high access,” said McCarthy. “Many current recommendations reflect that trade-off. Limiting logged-in access primarily reduces exposure, while requiring review of confirmation requests constrains autonomy.”\nThose are two of OpenAI’s recommendations for users to reduce their own risk, and a spokesperson said Atlas is also trained to get user confirmation before sending messages or making payments. OpenAI also suggests that users give agents specific instructions, rather than providing them access to your inbox and telling them to “take whatever action is needed.” \n“Wide latitude makes it easier for hidden or malicious content to influence the agent, even when safeguards are in place,” per OpenAI.\nWhile OpenAI says protecting Atlas users against prompt injections is a top priority, McCarthy invites some skepticism as to the return on investment for risk-prone browsers. \n“For most everyday use cases, agentic browsers don’t yet deliver enough value to justify their current risk profile,” McCarthy told TechCrunch. “The risk is high given their access to sensitive data like email and payment information, even though that access is also what makes them powerful. That balance will evolve, but today the trade-offs are still very real.”\n",

    "body": "\nThe team at Retro, a photo-sharing app for close friends and family, is experimenting with how generative AI can be put to more creative uses. To try out the latest, cutting-edge AI technologies, the team built a new app called Splat, which lets you turn any photo into a coloring book page for kids.\nAs any parent will tell you, kids love to color. And thanks to the web, there’s a seemingly infinite number of coloring book pages available for printing at home. \nHowever, many of the websites hosting these pages are filled with ads and other clutter, making them difficult to navigate. Other times, the printable pages are only available for a small fee, which some parents don’t want to pay, given the disposable nature of much of kids’ scribbled-on art projects.  \nScreenshotImage Credits:Lone Palm Labs/Splat\nThat inspired Retro’s team to develop an app for printing coloring book pages at home — from either your own photos or those it provides in kid-friendly, educational categories, such as animals, space, flowers, fairy tales, robots, cars, and more.\nTo get started with Splat, you’ll take a picture or pick a photo from your Camera Roll. You can then choose what style of photo you’d like to color — such as anime, 3D movie, manga, cartoon, or comic. The app will then transform your picture using AI into either an on-screen or printable page for kids to color.\nInstead of requiring a tedious sign-up process, the app will step you through customization options the first time you begin creating. Here, you’re prompted to choose your preferred app icon and check off the various categories your child likes. You also can choose if you want to let kids color the photo as a printable page or on-screen (great in a pinch when kids are bored, but you don’t want them sucked into a TV show or game).\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\nYou can try one generative AI project to get a feel for the app. It then costs either $4.99 per week or $49.99 per year to continue to generate new pictures. The weekly option allows for 25 pages per week, and the annual option provides 500 pages per year. The option to purchase or access the settings is blocked from small children by a pop-up that requires the parent’s birth year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn brief tests, the app worked as promised, and the generation time was brief, allowing you to quickly move from idea to printed art, ready for coloring, cutouts, or anything else your child wants to do. \nSplat is one of several experiments that uses generative AI to help inspire kids’ creativity and imagination in new ways. Another, Stickerbox, offers printed AI-generated stickers for coloring, while Casio also launched a fluffy robotic pet called Moflin that uses AI to develop its personality over time.\nSplat is available on iOS and Android.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "\nThe future may be electric, but that future is being postponed. The European Commission, citing the need for flexibility, has softened its ambitious ",
    "body": "\nThe future may be electric, but that future is being postponed. The European Commission, citing the need for flexibility, has softened its ambitious plan to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.\nInstead of requiring 100% of new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by that date, the revised plan would allow 10% of new car sales to be hybrids or other vehicles as long as manufacturers purchase carbon offsets to compensate. This change is part of a broader “Automotive Package” designed to help the European car industry become both clean and competitive.\nIf the European Parliament approves this shift, it would likely satisfy traditional European carmakers that have been asking for more time to move beyond hybrid vehicles. These companies are struggling to compete with Tesla and the surge of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) coming from China. But the policy change has created division among EV startups and their investors.\n“China already dominates EV manufacturing,” said Craig Douglas, a partner at World Fund, a European climate-focused venture capital firm. “If Europe doesn’t compete with clear, ambitious policy signals, it will lose leadership of another globally important industry — and all the economic benefits that come with it.”\nDouglas was among the signatories of “Take Charge Europe,” an open letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that was published in September. Senior executives from companies including Cabify, EDF, Einride, Iberdrola, and numerous EV-related startups signed the letter, exhorting the Commission to “stand firm” on the original 2035 zero-emission target.\nTheir appeal wasn’t enough to counter pressure from the traditional automobile industry, which represents 6.1% of total European Union employment. But continuing pressure has sparked debate within the startup community and beyond about the best path for Europe if it’s to remain competitive during the energy transition.\nIndustry split on timeline\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEven within the auto industry, opinions differ. In a statement to Swedish media, a Volvo press officer warned that “backing down on long-term commitments in favor of short-term gains risks undermining Europe’s competitiveness for many years to come.”\nUnlike Mercedes-Benz and other manufacturers, the Swedish carmaker had no concerns about meeting the 2035 ban. Rather than postponing the deadline, Volvo would have preferred to see increased investment in expanding charging infrastructure — something critics fear the new policy could actually discourage.\nIssam Tidjani, CEO of Cariqa, a Berlin-based EV charging marketplace startup, echoed these concerns. He cautioned that weakening the 2035 zero-emission mandate could harm electrification progress overall. “History shows that this kind of flexibility has never worked out well,” said Tidjani, who also signed the Take Charge Europe letter this fall. “It delays scale, weakens learning curves, and ultimately costs industrial leadership rather than preserving it.”\nTo be fair, the Commission hasn’t completely ignored infrastructure and supply chain issues. As part of its Automotive Package, it introduced the “Battery Booster,” a strategy that would invest €1.8 billion (about $2.11 billion) into developing a fully European-made battery supply chain. The goal is to strengthen local production and ensure supply security.\nThe plan received positive feedback from Verkor, a French startup that produces lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. The company, hoping to succeed where Swedish battery maker Northvolt struggled, opened its first large-scale battery factory in Northern France this week. Verkor called the Booster initiative “a necessary step to scale up Europe’s battery industry.”\nMixed signals\nStill, many question whether the Battery Booster is enough to offset what they see as negative signaling about the EU’s commitment to using decarbonization as an economic growth driver.\nAlready, traditional carmakers have begun complaining that the carbon offset requirements could make cars more expensive for consumers, potentially undermining the very competitiveness the policy change was meant to protect.\nAnother uncertainty involves the United Kingdom. It’s unclear whether the U.K. will follow the EU’s lead and modify its own 2035 combustion engine ban. Unlike both the European Union and the United States, the U.K. hasn’t yet imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, despite that their rapidly increasing sales in the British market have raised concerns among domestic manufacturers.\nThe debate highlights ongoing tensions in climate policy between how to balance the economic realities facing existing industries with the urgency of transitioning to cleaner tech. As Europe tries to thread this needle, the decisions made now will invariably impact whether the continent leads or lags in the global EV market.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:24 PM PST · December 21, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWaymo suspended its robotaxi service in San Francisco on Saturday evening after a massive blackout appeared to leave many of its vehicles stalled on city streets.\nNumerous photos and videos posted to social media captured Waymo robotaxis stalled on roads and at intersections as human drivers were either stuck behind them or weaved around them.\nWaymo said on Saturday that it had temporarily suspended service in the city due to the blackout. It wasn’t until late Sunday afternoon that a Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement that the company was resuming service.\n“Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,” the spokesperson said. “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.”\nThe Waymo spokesperson added that the company is “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.”\n\nThe blackout also took down many of the city’s traffic lights and affected Muni mass transit, with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie warning residents to stay off the roads unless they needed to travel.\nWaymo said that although its self-driving systems are designed to treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops, the scale of Saturday’s blackout caused some robotaxis to remain stationary for longer than normal as they tried to assess the intersections. The company also said that the majority of active trips were completed successfully.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe blackout appears to have been caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation in the city. SFGate reports that around 120,000 PG&E customers were affected by the blackout, and while the majority of them had power restored by late Saturday, 35,000 customers were still without power on Sunday morning. PG&E’s website also showed thousands of San Francisco customers still affected at that time.\nA letter from Tiger Global Management that leaked earlier this month said Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week, nearly double the amount that the Alphabet-owned company disclosed in the spring.\nThis post has been updated with Waymo’s statement that service is resuming.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:35 AM PST · December 22, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe CEO of SpaceX rival United Launch Alliance, Tory Bruno, has resigned after 12 years on the job “to pursue another opportunity,” according to the company. \n“We are grateful for Tory’s service to ULA and the country, and we thank him for his leadership,” United Launch Alliance (ULA) chairs Robert Lightfoot and Kay Sears said in a statement.\nBruno’s resignation comes at a time when newer private spaceflight companies are increasingly driving the launch market. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has dramatically upped its launch cadence in recent years, and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is looking like a more serious player after the mostly successful inaugural missions of the New Glenn heavy-lift rocket.\nNow 20 years old, ULA was created by combining the space launch businesses of defense contractors Boeing and Lockheed Martin. ULA was a main provider to both NASA and the Department of Defense until SpaceX came along and started winning contracts.\nOne of Bruno’s biggest projects during his time at ULA was overseeing the development of the joint venture’s next-generation rocket, Vulcan. That project had two main objectives: help ULA keep pace with SpaceX, and reduce the U.S. government’s reliance on Russian rockets to access space. \nVulcan leveraged a number of parts from prior ULA rocket programs like Atlas and Delta in an attempt to keep costs down, though it bet on Blue Origin to provide the engines. The project suffered numerous delays before it finally lifted off for the first time in 2024 — one whole decade after development began. \nDuring that same time frame, SpaceX became the world’s most dominant space launch provider, winning government contracts and taking on numerous private missions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nULA’s Vulcan rocket has found customers in Amazon (for its Leo internet satellites) and space startup Astrobotic. And the company is looking to make the rockets more reusable, or even fly upgraded versions that could theoretically take heavier payloads to space.\n“It has been a great privilege to lead ULA through its transformation and to bring Vulcan into service. My work here is now complete and I will be cheering ULA on,” Bruno said in a post on X.\nULA has tapped its chief operating officer John Elbon to serve as interim CEO while the company looks for a permanent replacement. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nWhile a shaker, some mixing tools, and ice can do the job just fine, modern tech has enabled the invention of some impressive gadgets that can spritz up your home bartending game.\nFrom machines that can prepare cocktails in seconds to smart coasters that ensure the perfect pour, here’s a rundown of some devices you should consider adding to your bar.\nBartesian Cocktail Maker – $349\nImage Credits:Bartesian\nPressing a button to summon cocktails might sound like the stuff of sci-fi, but they’re already here.\nBartesian’s cocktail maker is one of the more popular robotic bartenders on the market, and can prepare cocktails on demand in about 30 seconds. Fill the machine with your spirit of choice in the designated reservoirs, then insert a cocktail capsule (an eight-pack costs around $20 and makes eight drinks) containing a mix of juices, bitters, and extracts.\nUse the touchscreen to adjust your preferred strength from mocktail to strong, then press mix.\niGulu – $549\nImage Credits:iGulu\nI’ve no doubt beer lovers will agree that there’s no matching the experience of sipping on a beer you’ve made yourself. iGulu’s automated beer brewer takes the drudgery out of the entire process, as it works with pre-packaged ingredient kits that include everything you need: extracts, hops, bitters, dry yeast, and ground grains. Just pour in the contents and add water. Even complete beginners can start brewing right away.\nEach kit is designed to brew one gallon, or eight pints. The fermentation takes 7 to 13 days, depending on the recipe. The built-in container keeps your beer cold and fresh for at least 30 days.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nYou can also connect the brewer to an app to monitor fermentation time, carbonation levels, and adjust the temperature as needed.\nThe device is surprisingly versatile, too: Besides beer, the iGulu can also be used to make hard apple cider, kombucha, fruit wine, and non-alcoholic beverages like fermented tea, sparkling water, and even yogurt.\nBarsys Smart Coaster – $69\nImage Credits:Barsys\nFrom the folks who created a $1,500 robot bartender, the Barsys Coaster offers a more budget-friendly option for anyone learning how to avoid overpouring when making cocktails.\nThis smart coaster aims to help you prepare a well-blended beverage by lighting up to indicate when to start and stop pouring each ingredient. Simply connect it to the Barsys app, select a recipe, place a cup on the coaster, and follow the step-by-step guide.\nSmokpub Electric Smoker – $55\nImage Credits:SmokPub\nWant to get fancy and serve smoked cocktails? Even if you don’t, a cocktail and whiskey smoker is a fun gadget to have. \nThis one from Smokpub allows you to add smoky flavors to your drinks without using open flames. Simply load it with wood chips — available flavors include oak, apple, hickory, cherry, pear, and beech — put it on your glass with the safety cover, press the electric ignition, and let the smoke infuse your drink.\nSipVault Smart Liquor Dispenser – $55.95\nImage Credits:SipVault\nThis may not be the fanciest pick on the list, but an automatic dispenser is a practical choice for pouring drinks with consistency and avoiding spills, especially when mixing multiple drinks. Now that the holidays are upon us, this may prove handy if you want to avoid clumsy hands accidentally knocking over expensive bottles at your next holiday party.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

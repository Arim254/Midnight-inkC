The company said that past content will remain private after the conversion, and member lists will remain protected.\nOften, admins start their groups as private, thinking they will remain small, but then realize they could reach a much broader audience if they were easier to find. This update will allow Facebook Groups to expand their reach without having to start a public group from scratch or exposing their members’ past posts.\nAccording to Meta, the change to the group’s privacy can be made from the settings page on Facebook. When an admin changes the private group’s status to public, all other admins are notified of the change and have a three-day window to review and cancel the conversion if not everyone agrees.\nImage Credits:Meta/Facebook\nAfter the update, all past group content — including posts, comments, and reactions — will only be visible to members who were in the group before the conversion, as well as to admins and moderators. Member lists are also protected and only visible to admins and moderators.\nMembers are also notified about the change and will be reminded again when they post or comment for the first time in the newly public group.\nAfter the conversion to public, new posts, comments, and reactions will be visible to anyone, including those who aren’t on Facebook, as with any other public group. This could also help Facebook’s content be more easily indexed by search engines like Google, which can then surface these groups in their search results for related queries.\nIf the admins decide that being a public group isn’t the right call, they can revert the group to private again.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n",

The company has announced new data center buildouts with Oracle, SoftBank, the United Arab Emirates, and others. OpenAI has also secured deals with chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom.\nTo some analysts, the increased investment form OpenAI and other tech giants signals that the industry is heading toward an AI bubble, wherein massive sums are spent beefing out an unproven, and potentially dangerous, technology with no clear sign of a meaningful return on investment.  \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

On a MacBook, navigating to an app’s iOS store page in the browser would prompt the native App Store software to launch. But on non-Apple hardware, this would lead you to a dead end.\nThe new interface allows users to browse apps by category and by platform — there are separate sections for apps on the iPhone, iPad, Watch, and other devices. While users cannot currently download apps from the web, this functionality could possibly be added in later.\nAdmittedly, the subset of people who are trying to learn more about iOS apps from a Microsoft device, for example, is likely a small one — perhaps this would be useful to app developers or researchers working on products in both the iOS and Google ecosystems.\nThis redesign also signifies Apple’s continued push to portray itself as a more open ecosystem. For years, governments around the world have lodged complaints against Apple, accusing the company of acting as a monopoly to discourage competition — any step Apple takes to make its products more accessible beyond its own ecosystem is relevant to those ongoing legal battles.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

The gang then takes a cut of the profits made from any ransom payments.\nAccording to an FBI affidavit filed in September, the rogue employees received more than $1.2 million in ransom payments from one victim, a medical device maker in Florida. They also targeted several other companies, including a Virginia-based drone maker and a Maryland-headquartered pharmaceutical company. \nThe Chicago Sun-Times first reported the indictment on Sunday.\nSygnia chief executive Guy Segal confirmed to TechCrunch that Goldberg was a Sygnia employee and was terminated after Sygnia learned of his alleged involvement with the ransomware attacks. The company declined to comment further, citing the FBI’s ongoing investigation.\nDigitalMint president Marc Grens told TechCrunch that Martin was an employee at the time of the alleged hacks but said Martin was “acting completely outside the scope of his employment.” \nGrens also confirmed that the unnamed individual may be a former employee. DigitalMint is also cooperating with the government’s investigation, said Grens. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWaymo said Monday it will launch a robotaxi service in Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego as the Alphabet-owned company hits the accelerator on its expansion plans. \nThe announcement illustrates Waymo’s recent evolution from autonomous vehicle technology developer to commercial enterprise. It also follows comments by Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana, who said last week during TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 that it is imperative the company scales.\n“By the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week,” Mawakana said at the time. \nWaymo completed more than 250,000 rides per week as of April. The company has since added more, although it has not shared a specific number.\nWaymo tested its technology for years in Silicon Valley before launching a commercial robotaxi service in Phoenix, followed by the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles. In the past year, the company has brought its robotaxis to Atlanta and Austin in partnership with Uber. Waymo has also announced plans to expand its commercial business to several new markets in 2026, including Denver, Miami, Nashville, London, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.\nWaymo said Monday it plans to roll out a mix of self-driving Jaguar I-Pace and Zeekr RT vehicles to the three markets this week. The public won’t have access right away, however. \nWaymo’s go-to-market strategy typically begins with human drivers manually operating the vehicles to map city streets. The human safety operator is eventually removed and the autonomous vehicles, which are equipped with cameras, radar, lidar sensors, and self-driving software, navigate on their own. After a period of driverless testing, Waymo offers access to employees, media, and some consumers before eventually opening up the robotaxi service to the public.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLas Vegas mayor Shelley Berkley said in a statement that the “introduction of Waymo and its autonomous driving technology is not a science experiment, but rather a proven, safe, new alternative designed to help our residents and the millions of visitors who come to our city get around — from the Strip and beyond.” Berkley added that the city is committed to ensuring this technology is adopted responsibly.\nWaymo is already familiar with these three cities. The company has brought its autonomous vehicles to Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego before. Waymo also has an engineering team based in the Detroit area. The company says it is prepared for the snowy conditions in Detroit after spending multiple seasons driving across the metro Detroit area and the Upper Peninsula to expand its winter weather capabilities.\nWaymo noted that its rapid expansion is thanks to the generalized approach of its self-driving system. That growth has helped make Waymo the dominant player in the robotaxi market. However, there are other companies also making a play for market share. \nZoox operates a free robotaxi service in Las Vegas, a city where it has tested and developed its tech for years. Tesla also has a robotaxi service, which still has humans in the passenger seat, in parts of Austin as well.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade. She is currently the transportation editor at TechCrunch and co-host of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast.

    "body": "\nTikTok announced on Monday that it’s launching its first-ever TikTok Awards show in the U.S. The awards will include “Creator of the Year,” “Video of the Year,” “Muse of the Year,” “Breakthrough Artist of the Year,” and more.\nThe announcement comes just weeks after Instagram introduced its “Ring” awards program. Unlike Instagram, however, TikTok is taking a more traditional approach to its awards, as it’s hosting an actual awards show where winners will be revealed live at the event. The event will feature a red carpet, live performances, and a live audience of hundreds of creators, TikTok says.\nThe awards show will take place on December 18 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles and will be livestreamed on the TikTok app and on Tubi. The show will be available to stream on demand on Tubi the following day.\nUsers will be able to vote for their favorite creators on a new portal on TikTok launching on November 18. \nIt’s worth noting that although this is TikTok’s first awards show in the U.S., it has held similar events in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, Korea, and more in the past.\nThe nominees for “Creator of the Year” are adamw, alixearle. brookemonk_, keith_lee125, and kristy.sarah. The nominees for “Breakthrough Artist of the Year” are alexwarren, katseyeworld, laufey, ravynlenae, and sombr.\nOther awards categories include “Storyteller of the Year,” “TikTok for Good Award,” “MVP of the Year,” “Okay Slay Award,” “TikTok LIVE Creators of the Year,” and more.\nThe full list of awards and nominees can be found on TikTok’s announcement post.\nBy launching an awards show, TikTok is positioning itself as more than just a social media app and more of a notable force in the entertainment industry. Given that TikTok serves as a launching pad for several emerging artists and actors, it makes sense for the company to celebrate its top users with its own branded show.\n“The trophies presented on stage will beam a colorful glow upon the creators defining this new era of culture encompassing many areas, including fashion, beauty, sports, TV and film, and new forms of entertainment,” TikTok wrote in the announcement post.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

Additionally, before Chrome fills in saved information on your behalf, it will ask you to confirm.\nThese new updates are available globally in all languages starting Monday. In the coming months, Chrome plans to add support for even more data types, the company says.\nMonday’s announcement comes as Google has been adding additional functionality to Chrome to make it more helpful amid the surge of new AI browsers.\nA few weeks ago, Google rolled out Gemini in Chrome to all Mac and Windows desktop users in the U.S. after previously limiting the capability to Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra subscribers. The tech giant also announced at the time that it plans to bring agentic capabilities to Chrome in the future, add its AI Mode search feature to the address bar, launch new Gemini features, use AI to combat AI-generated scams, roll out automatic password resets, and more.\nOther smaller features that have launched on Chrome recently include a new tool that automatically disables browser notifications for the websites you haven’t interacted with recently, along with a feature that makes it easier to switch between work and personal Google accounts.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple’s latest iOS update, available for eligible devices from Monday, doesn’t introduce any major features, but it does bring one highly-requested tweak: the ability to change the transparency of the translucent liquid glass design.\nIf you didn’t like the look of iOS 26, all you could do so far was to reduce transparency via the accessibility settings, which pretty much turned off the liquid glass overlay. With iOS 26.1, we now get a new menu to retain the look while increasing opacity.\nYou can head to Settings > Display & Brightness > Liquid Glass to select either the original “Clear” option or a more opaque “Tinted” option. You can also see a preview of each option when you’re selecting them.\nLiquid glass was the company’s biggest design overhaul since its move to a flat design back in 2013, but similar to most changes of this scale and significance, not everybody has been on board.\nSome people said the more translucent design made various parts of the interface harder to read, including notifications or navigation controls in apps, while others professed their love for the attention to detail and the new look, which felt like a much-needed update to an interface that had grown stale over the years.\nImage Credits: Screenshot by TechCrunch\nBesides the transparency settings, iOS 26.1 also lets you tweak what gestures do on the home screen: You now get an option to open the camera app by swiping to the left on the lockscreen. You change this by going to Settings > Camera > Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera.\nIOS 26.1 also gives users the ability to locally capture audio and video while recording a video call. This can be useful if you’re recording a call or podcast on the move. The company announced this feature for iPadOS in June during the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe update also brings support for eight new languages for Apple Intelligence: Chinese (Traditional), Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Portuguese (Portugal), Vietnamese and Turkish. The company is also adding live translation support for five new languages: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Italian, Japanese and Korean.\nWe also get some quality of life improvements, including gestures to change songs in Apple Music; a slider to stop alarms instead of a button so you don’t accidentally shut it off; and an option to automatically install security improvements.\nYou can update your device by going to Settings > General > Software update.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAndreessen Horowitz is pausing its Talent x Opportunity (TxO) fund and program, according to four sources familiar with the matter, including more than one founder in the program. \nThe firm announced TxO in 2020 to support founders who do not have access to traditional venture networks. Many of TxO’s participants were women and minorities who, overall, receive very slim amounts of venture capital dollars. \nThe announcement of the fund came during the wave of support that underrepresented founders received in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. The fund launched with $2.2 million in initial commitments, TechCrunch previously reported, with a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz and his wife, Felicia, matching up to an additional $5 million.\nTxO provided founders with access to tech networks, a 16-week-long training program, and a $175,000 investment through a donor-advised fund managed by the nonprofit Tides Foundation. The program went on to support more than 60 companies (like the media brand Brown Girl Magazine, food tech Myles Comfort Foods, and the maternity tech Villie).  \nTxO garnered some criticism when it launched because it’s technically structured as more of a nonprofit, rather than a traditional investment fund. Those investing in the fund are considered donors, and the money given is regarded as charity donations, rather than traditional limited partner investments.\nStill, founders who participated in the program and spoke to TechCrunch said it provided them with invaluable support and opportunities to which they otherwise would not have access. Last year, TxO expanded to launch a grant program, providing $50,000 to three tech nonprofits that support underserved founders. \nTxO announced its — as of now — last cohort of the program in early March 2025. Founders who partook in the program received an email on October 16 from Kofi Ampadu, the partner at a16z who led TxO, announcing the program would pause. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“When we launched TxO, the mission was clear: support talented, determined builders who are creating culture-shaping companies but may not have access to typical Silicon Valley networks and resources,” Ampadu’s email read, as seen by TechCrunch. “While that purpose has not changed, we are pausing our existing program to refine how we deliver on it.”\nThe rest of the email read:  \n\nOver the past five years, we’ve experimented with different models for best serving founders — from virtual and in-person programming to curriculum design and funding structure. As we rethink what’s next, we’ll be applying everything we’ve learned and evolving how we support founders by integrating with a16z’s broader early-stage investing and company building strategy.  \nTxO has backed more than 60 companies and nearly 100 founders. You have collectively raised tens of millions in follow-on capital and reached customers across culture and lifestyle. Founders from earlier cohorts now advise newer ones, and that peer support has strengthened the entire community.  \nThank you for being at the center of this community. Your progress is proof of what is possible. Stay tuned for what comes next. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out directly. \nBest regards, \nKofi \n\nA16z confirmed to TechCrunch that the program was shutting down and that Ampadu alerted participants via email.\nMembers of the TxO staff team, which had at least three people, excluding Ampadu, were also let go, according to two sources, with the end of October being their last week. \nThe fund’s application documents did not specifically call for founder diversity, except in terms of “cultural authenticity,” and also emphasized classic startup investment criteria like size of the market and ability to execute.  But the announcement of the fund back in 2020 made clear it was “for entrepreneurs who did not have access to the fast track in life but who have great potential. Their products can be non-tech or tech; they should be from underserved communities (all backgrounds welcome).”\nStill, many in the startup world perceived TxO as an accelerator for diverse talent, and several people who spoke to TechCrunch pointed out that its hiatus comes as top names in tech eliminate, cut, reframe, or completely walk back on prior public commitments related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Trump administration has threatened legal and political ramifications for businesses supporting anything that could be seen as DEI. \nOthers, however, noted that a16z is still interested in accelerator-type startup programs. Earlier this year, it launched Speedrun, a program that promises cohort grads up to $1 million of investment.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLawmakers have called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Flock Safety, a company that operates license plate-scanning cameras, for allegedly failing to implement cybersecurity protections that expose its camera network to hackers and spies.\nIn a letter sent by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL, 8th), the lawmakers urge FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson to probe why Flock does not enforce the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA), a security protection that prevents malicious access by someone with knowledge of the account holder’s password.\nWyden and Krishnamoorthi said that while the company offers its law enforcement customers the ability to enable MFA, “Flock does not require it, which the company confirmed to Congress in October,” according to the letter.\nWyden and Krishnamoorthi said that if hackers or foreign spies learn of a law enforcement user’s password, “they can gain access to law-enforcement-only areas of Flock’s website and search the billions of photos of Americans’ license plates collected by taxpayer-funded cameras across the country.”\nFlock operates one of the largest networks of cameras and license plate readers in the U.S., providing access to more than 5,000 police departments, as well as private businesses, across the country. Flock’s cameras scan the license plates of passing vehicles so that police and federal agencies with logins to Flock’s platform can search the billions of captured photos and track where vehicles have traveled at any given time.\nThe lawmakers said that they had found evidence that some of Flock’s law enforcement customers’ logins had been previously stolen and shared online, citing data from Hudson Rock, a cybersecurity company that identifies usernames and passwords stolen by information-stealing malware. \nIndependent security researcher Benn Jordan also provided the lawmakers with a screenshot showing a Russian cybercrime forum allegedly selling access to Flock logins.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch for comment, Flock shared the company’s response in a letter from its chief legal officer Dan Haley, in which he says the company switched on MFA by default for all new customers starting in November 2024 and that 97% of its law enforcement customers have enabled MFA to date.\nThat leaves around 3% of the company’s customers — potentially dozens of law enforcement agencies — that have declined to switch on MFA, citing “reasons specific to them,” Haley wrote. \nHolly Beilin, a spokesperson for Flock, did not immediately provide a specific number of law enforcement customers that have not yet switched on MFA, nor did she say if any federal agencies are among the remaining customers, or for what reason Flock does not require its customers to switch on the security feature.\nAs previously reported by 404 Media, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration used a local police officer’s password to access Flock’s cameras to search for an individual suspected of an “immigration violation,” but without the officer’s knowledge. The Palos Heights Police Department said it switched on multi-factor authentication following the breach.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLocket, a private social networking app for friends, has scored a win with Gen Alpha users following the launch of its latest feature, Rollcall.\nThe app, which lets friends share photos that then appear in home screen widgets, first hit the top of the App Store’s charts in early 2022 by taking advantage of Apple’s widget system to form the basis of its social network. Instead of updates sent via push notifications, the app’s widget would update to show your friends’ newly posted photos. This, in turn, would drive engagement back in the app, prompting users to share their own photos in return.\nLocket’s Rollcall feature takes a similar approach by turning Apple platform features into social networking tools, CEO Matt Moss explains. A former Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) student scholarship winner, Moss understands that new formats can help attract users and draw people in.\nRollcall prompts users to share their favorite photos from the past week, and it leverages an iOS feature called Live Activities. This allows the app to utilize the iPhone Lock Screen to capture users’ attention. Introduced in iOS 18, Live Activities allow iOS apps to offer frequent information updates in glanceable locations like the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island (the black bar at the top of the screen).\nApple originally envisioned Live Activities as a way for apps with real-time information to update their users — for instance, with information about their Uber arriving or pizza delivery. However, some apps have used the technology in unique ways, like adding a virtual pet that frolics in the Dynamic Island, or displaying the real-time lyrics for the song you’re listening to right on your Lock Screen.\nFor Locket, however, Live Activities becomes the modern-day version of the push notification.\n“Every Sunday, we’ll take over your Lock Screen and you’ll get this nice Live Activity that pops up right on the homepage of the iPhone,” said Moss. “It’s similar to the widget [as it’s] using Apple technology to get in front of people and then let you share those moments that you wouldn’t have shared,” he told TechCrunch in an interview in the halls of the TechCrunch Disrupt conference last week. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nThe use of the technology in this way has already proved successful for Locket, which has north of 91 million lifetime installs across iOS and Android, per Appfigures estimates. In Rollcall’s first week, Locket saw over a million shares driven by the feature, the company said.\nIn addition, Moss said that well over 25% of the app’s active users are now posting a Rollcall every week. \n“The Live Activity pulls people in a lot more,” Moss said. “And it’s fun, because as your friends are sharing, they’ll feel like we’re all doing this together.” \nRoughly 80% of Rollcall’s initial active users were classified as Gen Alpha.\nThe founder noted there are some differences between how Gen Alpha and Gen Z use Locket. \n“I think the big difference is … [being] the companion piece versus the primary. We have so many more users now [for whom] Locket is like their main way of connecting with their friends, Moss explained. “Sending photos directly. Sharing photos with 10 or 20 of their best friends. I think that’s been a big difference for us,” he added.\nImage Credits:Locket\nWith Rollcall gaining traction out of the gate, the company is now exploring how to use the feature as a launching pad for other experiences beyond photos. For instance, Moss says adding video support is an obvious next step, but he’s also thinking about how to incorporate things like music, favorite places you visited, or prompts designed to help you remember things that happened during the week.\nWhile Locket doesn’t have plans to support AI-generated photos or videos, like Sora or Meta AI, the company is considering how AI could be used in other ways — like making collages or pulling together photo memories.\n“Even though those things may use up a lot of attention,” Moss said, referring to AI apps, “there’s something so fundamental and basic about communicating and connecting with real people in the world. There will always be a role for that, and there will always be a demand that people have.” \nThe company is also thinking about how Locket can transform users’ virtual connections with friends into more real-world touchpoints — even if it’s something as simple as reminding users to call or text a friend. \n“I think for us, it’s always much more like: how can we use those things to actually, genuinely help people connect, versus it just being a kind of short-term fun experience, and you know, [that] might actually be a huge strength in the long run — being that place where it is just the people you actually know,” Moss said. \nLocket today monetizes via a subscription and says it has more than 100,000 subscribers. As a result, the 15-person company has been profitable since last year.\n",

The exact size of the deal was not disclosed. Some of these GPUs will be Nvidia GB300 NVL72 systems, which were announced earlier this year and began shipping in the last few months.\n“It’s great to watch the Microsoft and Lambda teams working together to deploy these massive AI supercomputers,” said Stephen Balaban, CEO of Lambda, in the company’s press release. “We’ve been working with Microsoft for more than eight years, and this is a phenomenal next step in our relationship.”\nMicrosoft opened its first Nvidia GB300 NVL72 cluster in October.\nCompanies like Lambda, which was founded years before the current AI boom in 2012 and has raised $1.7 billion in venture dollars, are seeing strong demand as companies continue to gobble up AI infrastructure and compute.\nThis announcement comes just hours after Microsoft announced a $9.7 billion deal for AI cloud capacity with IREN, an Australian data center business.\nEarlier today, OpenAI announced that it had struck a $38 billion cloud computing deal with Amazon to buy cloud services over the next seven years.

This represents a decline of about 40% from its last private valuation of over $5 billion in 2022.\nPine Labs has also reduced its primary offering by 20% to ₹20.8 billion (approximately $234 million) from ₹26 billion in its draft prospectus filed in June, while the offer for sale has been cut by 44% to 82.3 million shares from 148 million shares planned earlier.\nExisting investors, including Peak XV Partners, Temasek Holdings, PayPal, and Mastercard, are among those selling part of their holdings in the offering.\nPine Labs CEO Amrish Rau told reporters at a press briefing on Monday that investors had chosen to retain a larger portion of their shareholdings, which resulted in a smaller offer for sale.\n“When it came to the pricing of this IPO, we were very clear that we want to continue to garner goodwill, and we wanted to get everybody’s support when we go out with this pricing for this IPO,” he said. “We believe we were able to maintain that because, at the end of the day, it takes a village to come together to create a successful IPO.”\nFounded in 1998, Pine Labs initially focused on deploying point-of-sale terminals for merchants but has since evolved beyond payment acceptance to enable bill payments through platforms such as Amazon Pay and CRED, and to facilitate account-aggregator-based transactions, among a broader suite of payment, transaction, and acquiring services.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCurrently, about 70% of Pine Labs’ revenue comes from its digital infrastructure and transaction services, while the remaining 30% is generated from its issuing and acquiring businesses, Rau said.\nPine Labs is among the few Indian startups that already serve customers outside the country and is seeking to expand its international presence following its planned listing on Indian stock exchanges. This aligns with the Indian government’s broader push to build globally competitive fintech offerings. The company is also part of a growing group of technology firms that have relocated their headquarters to India to tap into the country’s large base of retail investors and to align more closely with local regulatory frameworks.\nThe firm currently serves over 980,000 merchants, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, powering more than 6 billion transactions cumulatively valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (around $128 billion). It already operates in 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Africa, the UAE, and the U.S.\nBetween the financial years 2023 and 2025, Pine Labs’ revenue from international markets grew by nearly 58%, Rau said.\n“What we have done in fintech in India, no other country has been able to do anything close to that,” he told reporters. “We have the opportunity to take this IP knowledge, the technology stack that we have developed, and make it global. We have been the first companies which has actually done that, and we believe that our fintech stack is very, very much in demand in global markets, and that’s why we are winning these clients in these international markets.”\nIn India, Pine Labs competes with the likes of Razorpay, Paytm, and Walmart-owned PhonePe. The company turned profitable in the June quarter, posting a net profit of ₹47.86 million (about $540,000), compared with a loss of ₹278.89 million a year earlier. Revenue from operations rose 17.9% year-over-year to ₹6.16 billion (around $69 million) in the quarter. The firm’s overseas business contributed about 15% of total revenue, amounting to ₹943.25 million (roughly $11 million), up from ₹795.97 million a year earlier.\nPine Labs’ listing comes amid a wave of Indian technology companies preparing to go public, including Groww, Lenskart, Shadowfax, Meesho, and BoAt, all of which are expected to launch their offerings this year.\n",

    "body": "\nMicrosoft will invest $15.2 billion in the United Arab Emirates over the next four years, the company announced Monday at the first annual Abu Dhabi Global AI Summit. The investment will include the first-ever shipments of the most advanced Nvidia GPUs to the UAE.\nAs part of the deal, the U.S. has granted Microsoft a license to export Nvidia chips to the UAE, a move that positions the country as both a proving ground for U.S. export-control diplomacy and a regional anchor of American AI influence.\nThe deal allows Microsoft to expand its foothold into the Middle East, a key region in the global fight for AI dominance. In May, President Donald Trump struck a deal with UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to build an AI data center campus in Abu Dhabi. The project was delayed due to U.S. export controls, which restricted the sale of powerful Nvidia chips needed to run advanced AI systems.\nMicrosoft became the first company to receive a license from the U.S. Commerce Department to ship the chips to the UAE in September. The move comes as critics say the deal undermines the logic of the U.S.’s export restrictions to China by introducing possible back channels through a Chinese ally. \nIn a statement, Microsoft said it performed substantial work to meet the strong cybersecurity and national security conditions required by the licenses, which has enabled the firm to accumulate the equivalent of 21,500 Nvidia A100 GPUs in the UAE, based on a combination of A100, H100, and H200 chips.  \nMicrosoft said it is using the chips to provide access to AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, open source providers, and itself. \nThe $15.2 billion figure includes money Microsoft began spending in the UAE starting in 2023 as part of a new AI initiative in the country. Between 2023 and the end of 2025, Microsoft will have spent just over $7.3 billion in the UAE, including a $1.5 billion equity investment in G42, the UAE’s sovereign AI company, and more than $4.6 billion in capital toward data centers. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs part of the new deal, Microsoft pledges to spend $7.9 billion more in the UAE from the start of 2026 to the end of 2029, including $5.5 billion in capital expenses for ongoing and planned expansion of AI and cloud infrastructure. Microsoft hinted at new steps it will share publicly in Abu Dhabi this week.\nMicrosoft’s work in the UAE goes beyond building data centers. The company says it is pairing massive AI infrastructure with deep investment in local talent, training, and governance. The firm is pledging to train a million residents by 2027 and use Abu Dhabi as a regional hub for AI research and model development.  \nThe investment comes the same day that Microsoft signed a $9.7 billion deal with Australia’s IREN for AI cloud capacity.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nThe AI web browser Dia is drawing inspiration from its predecessor, Arc, an earlier experiment in modernizing the web-browsing experience that hailed from the startup known as The Browser Company. On Sunday, The Browser Company’s founder, Josh Miller, confirmed that the new AI browser will bring “Arc’s greatest hits” to Dia, including things like the sidebar mode, and combine that with AI-native features like memory and agents.\nThis explanation suggests that Dia, which has since been acquired by Atlassian for $610 million, could have an advantage in the AI browser race, as it builds on the company’s earlier learnings from developing Arc.\nThe latter was initially released in mid-2023 as a reinvention of the browser designed around the way people use the internet today. That included offering separate workspaces for work and personal browsing, support for pinned tabs, a Command Bar that worked like Apple’s Spotlight search, and a sidebar that included the search bar, tab list, user bookmarks, audio controls, and more. \n\nTbh we (or i really) duffed the comms in a bunch of ways, but…1. Dia's architecture is much better for AI, speed, security2. We're adapting Arc's greatest hits to be native to Dia3. Sidebar mode for Arc fansDia + Arc = snappier, smarter, simpler by default w/ Pro mode— Josh Miller (@joshm) November 3, 2025\n\nHowever, Arc may have tried to push the envelope a bit too far: Miller later admitted that Arc was ultimately too complex for most people to adopt.\n“Arc was simply too different, with too many new things to learn, for too little reward … On top of that, Arc lacked cohesion in both its core features and core values. It was experimental — that was part of its charm — but also its complexity,” Miller wrote in a blog post earlier this year, detailing the company’s decision to wind down Arc and open source it, and refocusing the company’s efforts on building Dia.\nBut Arc may not necessarily be a failure, even if it didn’t become a widely adopted consumer product. Instead, the browser gave the company over a year’s worth of insights into what sort of modern browser features resonate with users and which ones do not.\nThat could help the company get ahead when building out the feature set for Dia.\nAs Miller says in a post on X, “Dia’s architecture is much better for AI, speed, and security,” but it will introduce features that Arc fans loved, like the sidebar mode — which was just spotted in the company’s latest “early birds” release of Dia’s AI browser.\n\nI'm daily-driving @diabrowser as a years-long Arc user and now an Early Bird, and I can say I'm so close to not miss Arc.Dia browser now has:– Focus mode– Vertical tabs– Pinned tabs (grid-view)– Google Meet PIP And I now wait for only three things before deleting Arc-… pic.twitter.com/qo9RSUUNmV— BLCNYY (@BLCNYY) November 1, 2025\n\nAlready, Dia has added other features from Arc’s “greatest hits,” like turning Google Meet into a picture-in-picture player automatically when you switch tabs and custom keyboard shortcuts. Miller hinted that the company is exploring how to transition Arc’s Spaces — the distinct browsing areas with their own set of pinned tabs, favorites, themes, history, and cookies — to Dia. And he said Dia’s team is currently testing pinned tabs.\nMiller additionally solicited feedback about other features to add, like swipeable profiles and Arc Search-inspired updates for the Dia mobile app coming in 2026.\nPlus, Miller notes, Dia will have less bloat and will be AI native for things like memory and agents.\nFollowing the acquisition by Atlassian, The Browser Company continues to operate independently. As a result, Miller said the company will be able to add more “browser basics,” referring to favorite Arc features, to the Dia browser. He also shared that Dia is developing deeper integrations with Atlassian’s Jira and other apps, like Linear, under its new owner.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Elon Musk will settle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/04/former-twitter-ceo-sues-elon-musk/\">a $128 million lawsuit</a> with four Twitter executives he fired after taking over the company in 2022.</p>\n<p>One of Musk’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-fired-top-twitter-execs-including-ceo-reports-say/\">first moves</a> upon buying Twitter was to fire CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and top lawyers Sean Edgett and Vijaya Gadde. The four executives never received severance payments, which they claim is because they tried to hold Musk to his $44 billion commitment when he tried to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/08/twitter-is-really-not-having-elon-musks-attempt-to-back-out-of-buying-it/\">back out</a> of buying the company. The lawsuit even quotes Walter Isaacson’s biography of Musk, which quotes him as saying that he would “hunt every single one” of Twitter’s C-suite “till the day they die.”</p>\n<p>While a court filing confirms that the parties have reached a settlement, it’s not yet clear what the terms of that settlement are.</p>\n<p>It’s not just these executives who have sued Musk for severance payments. Musk recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/elon-musks-x-may-finally-settle-500m-severance-lawsuit/\">settled a class action lawsuit</a> concerning 6,000 laid-off Twitter employees. Many of these former Twitter staff complained that they received incomplete severance payments or did not receive severance payments at all.</p>\n</div><div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>",

But while app access to ChatGPT is tightly curated, Gemini CLI extensions can be published with no endorsement or participation from Google. Available extensions will be <a href=\"https://geminicli.com/extensions/\" target=\"_blank\">hosted in public repositories on GitHub</a> and installed manually by developers.</p>\n<p>“That open ecosystem is vital to us,” Taylor Mullen, a senior staff engineer on the project, told TechCrunch. “Everything we’re doing is grounded in a fair ecosystem that anyone can participate in.”</p>\n<p>The first available extension was to Google’s own Nanobanana image generator, which was <a href=\"https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/nanobanana\" target=\"_blank\">posted to GitHub</a> last week. Once installed, the extension allows users to generate images directly from the Gemini CLI terminal.</p>\n<p>Launched in June, Gemini CLI has grown to over one million users, Google says, with usage heavily skewed toward software developers. Notably, Gemini CLI is heavily used in the development and maintenance of its own codebase, closely overseen by product managers, as detailed in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/how-googles-dev-tools-manager-makes-ai-coding-work/\">a recent TechCrunch interview</a>.</p>\n<p>In an interview, Google’s senior director of product management for developer tools Ryan J. Salva told TechCrunch that the purpose of the new feature was to turn Gemini CLI into “an extensibility platform, a conduit to other tools and instructions that come from elsewhere in your tool chain.”</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>After OpenAI’s video-generating app Sora <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/openais-sora-soars-to-no-1-on-the-u-s-app-store/\">surged to the No. 1 position</a> on the U.S. App Store, it has now, technically, experienced a bigger first week than ChatGPT on iOS, according to new data from app intelligence provider <a href=\"http://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appfigures</a>. Its estimates show that Sora saw 627,000 iOS downloads in its first seven days of availability, compared with ChatGPT’s 606,000 iOS downloads during its first week.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the fairest comparison, however, because ChatGPT was available only in the U.S. during its first week, while Sora is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada at launch. Still, Appfigures says that Canada contributed about 45,000 installs, so the Sora launch was about 96% of ChatGPT’s launch, if the data had been based on the U.S. numbers only.</p>\n<p>This level of consumer adoption is worth noting because Sora remains an invite-only app, while ChatGPT was more publicly available at launch. That makes Sora’s performance more impressive.</p>\n<p>During its first day, Sora saw 56,000 app installs in short order, bumping the app to become the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store. By Friday, October 3, it reached No. 1. That surge had already put Sora’s debut ahead of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and put it on par with xAI’s Grok launch.</p>\n<p>A quick scan of social media provides plenty of anecdotes that support Appfigures’ data. Sora videos, which uses the new Sora 2 video model and gives users the ability to generate realistic deepfakes, seem to be everywhere. Users are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/you-cant-libel-the-dead-but-that-doesnt-mean-you-should-deepfake-them/\">even creating deepfakes of dead people</a>, a use case that has prompted Zelda Williams, daughter of the late actor Robin Williams, to ask folks to stop sending her AI-generated images of her father.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png 1730w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1200,676 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1280,721 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=900,507 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=668,376 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=666,375 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=1096,617 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail_sora-first-week-downloads-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Appfigures</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Per Appfigures, the app has seen steady adoption since its first day on the market, September 30, 2025.

Now, users can visualize how different pairs of shoes would look on them.</p>\n<p>To virtually try on a pair of shoes, users need to tap on any product listing on Google, select the “Try It On” button, then add a full-length photo of themselves. After a few seconds, they will see the shoes from the listing on a digital version of themselves. Users have the option to save or share the image with others.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?w=652\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png 1478w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=288,300 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=768,801 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=652,680 652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=1150,1200 1150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=1227,1280 1227w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=412,430 412w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=690,720 690w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=863,900 863w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=767,800 767w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=1472,1536 1472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=640,668 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=359,375 359w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=591,617 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=509,531 509w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-10.39.44AM.png?resize=48,50 48w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The launch comes two months after Google introduced the ability for users to virtually try on clothes using AI. While Google had already offered virtual try-on technology before, the earlier features focused on showing items on a diverse range of models’ bodies. With the new AI feature, the company started allowing users to try clothes on a virtual version of their own body.</p>\n<p>Google has been investing in the virtual try-on space in other ways as well. In June, the tech giant launched an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/26/google-launches-doppl-a-new-app-that-lets-you-visualize-how-an-outfit-might-look-on-you/\">experimental app called Doppl</a> that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you.</p>\n<p>While both the virtual try-on feature, which now includes shoes, and Doppl are powered by the same generative AI technology, Doppl is designed to let shoppers dive even deeper into virtual try-on, helping them curate their personal style. Plus, Doppl can create AI-generated videos so users can get a better sense of how the outfit would look on them in real life.</p>\n<p>Google isn’t the only company to launch virtual try-on technology, as both <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/09/amazon-gets-into-ar-shopping-with-launch-of-virtual-try-on-for-shoes/\">Amazon</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/14/walmart-introduces-virtual-try-on-tech-which-uses-customers-own-photos-to-model-the-clothing/\">Walmart</a> have introduced similar features.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google is bringing its AI-powered conversational search feature, Search Live, to India — launching in English and Hindi — and expanding AI Mode to seven new Indian languages, as the company strengthens its presence in one of its fastest-growing markets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/googles-ai-mode-gets-new-canvas-feature-real-time-help-with-search-live-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Introduced</a> in the U.S. in July, Search Live builds on Google’s Project Astra technology and is available through the company’s AI Mode. The feature lets users point their phone camera at objects to get real-time assistance, supporting back-and-forth conversations that draw on the visual context from the camera feed.</p>\n<p>With this launch, India becomes the second market after the U.S. to get Search Live — a logical move given the country’s vast base of early AI adopters, who have helped Google grow products like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/india-leads-the-way-on-googles-nano-banana-with-a-local-creative-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini’s Nano Banana model</a>. Google plans to leverage India’s early adoption to train its systems on a wider range of visual contexts, making Search Live more capable over time.</p>\n<p>“People in India are power users of multimodal search, forming our largest user base for both voice and visual search globally,” said Hema Budaraju, vice president of product management for Search at Google, in a new <a href=\"https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/supercharging-search-for-india-new-languages-in-ai-mode-search-live-debuts/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>Search Live is starting to roll out to users in India today and will reach more people over the coming weeks. Once available, users can access it by tapping the “Live” icon under the search bar in the Google app, or by opening Lens and selecting “Live” from the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Google revealed that Search Live is <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/search-live-ai-mode/\" target=\"_blank\">powered by a custom version of Gemini</a>. The Gemini app separately includes a similarly named feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-updates-the-gemini-app-with-real-time-ai-video-deep-research-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">called Gemini Live</a>, which was introduced in May and offers a comparable experience. This overlap could easily confuse some users.</p>\n<p>Google has also expanded its AI Mode to seven Indian languages: Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. This is part of a global AI Mode expansion, which will be available in <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-expands-languages-locations/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 35 new languages and 40 new countries and territories</a>, making the AI-powered search experience accessible in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Google’s AI Mode, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/google-searchs-new-ai-mode-lets-users-ask-complex-multi-part-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">debuted</a> in the U.S. in March and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-ai-mode-rolls-out-to-us-will-add-support-for-deeper-research-comparison-shopping-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">rolled out to more U.S. users</a> in May, lets users ask complex, multi-part questions through an AI-powered interface. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/google-introduces-ai-mode-to-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\">launched</a> in India in June and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/googles-ai-mode-expands-globally-adds-new-agentic-features/\" target=\"_blank\">expanded globally</a> in August. Last month, Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/googles-ai-mode-adds-5-new-languages-including-hindi-japanese-and-korean/\" target=\"_blank\">added five new languages</a> — including Hindi, Indonesian, and Japanese — to the feature.</p>\n<p>“The advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding of our custom Gemini model for Search allows AI Mode to truly grasp the subtleties of local languages, ensuring AI Mode is genuinely helpful and relevant in all the new languages we introduce,” Budaraju said in the post.</p>\n<p>Google’s AI Mode and other AI features, including AI Overviews, have faced criticism for reducing search traffic to online publishers. The company, however, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/google-denies-ai-search-features-are-killing-website-traffic/\" target=\"_blank\">denied that its AI-driven search tools are hurting</a> website visits.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://qapita.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Qapita</a>, a Singapore-based equity management platform, has raised $26.5 million in a Series B round led by Charles Schwab.</p>\n<p>As part of the deal, Charles Schwab has introduced a new platform called Schwab Private Issuer Equity Services — powered by Qapita — which let’s U.S. startups manage their cap tables, administer stock plans, and prepare for public listings. </p>\n<p>Founded in 2019 by former banker Ravi Ravulaparthi (CEO) with Lakshman Gupta (COO) and Vamsee Mohan (CTO) (pictured above, from left to right), Qapita helps private companies track ownership, manage employee equity, and facilitate secondary share sales. The startup serves private companies across Southeast Asia and the U.S., and also provides its platform for listed firms in India to manage equity after going public.</p>\n<p>Qapita began as a platform to manage cap tables after Ravulaparthi, during his earlier banking career, noticed that many companies still relied on spreadsheets. When the startup launched in January 2021, it expanded the platform based on early customer feedback to include an equity management tool for employee stock plans, initially released in beta. Competitor Carta later entered the Indian market but exited in 2023, giving Qapita room to strengthen its position.</p>\n<p>The startup currently has about 2,700 companies using its platform, it says. Roughly 70% are based in India and 20% in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Indonesia. Qapita counts around half of India’s unicorns among its customers, Ravulaparthi said in an interview.</p>\n<p>While Qapita offers free access to its platform for early-stage companies, about half of its users — roughly 1,400 firms — pay for at least one of its services, Ravulaparthi told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In addition to India and Southeast Asia, the startup has a few users in the U.S. as part of its early market testing. However, this partnership will significantly expand its presence in the U.S.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Of course, the U.S. is a very large market. There are a few options in the private market space in the U.S., but they are too few for a market of that size,” Ravulaparthi said of competitors.</p>\n<p>Charles Schwab already handles stock plans for major public companies. However, this deal gives it a foothold with private companies letting it compete for startups with Carta, Pulley, or Morgan Stanley’s Shareworks.</p>\n<p>The platform will provide equity management tools to automate cap table processes, produce reports and dashboards, and link with other financial systems. It will also tie into Schwab’s wealth management network, enabling companies and their employees to manage stock plans and prepare for IPOs.</p>\n<p>Qapita’s Series B also included participation from its existing investors, Citi and MassMutual Ventures. This funding will also help the startup enhance its platform by launching a fund admin product across multiple markets.</p>\n<p>To date, the startup has raised more than $80 million in funding and has a headcount of 300 employees.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>\n<p>The deal builds on an earlier partnership between the two entities announced last year, in which Verizon made a $100 million commitment to support AST’s service rollout.</p>\n<p>Verizon is the second major carrier to sign with AST, following a 10-year agreement with Vodafone. For AST, the Verizon deal comes at a critical time as the company races to deploy its BlueBird satellite constellation designed to link directly with unmodified cell phones.</p>\n<p>As of now, the company has successfully placed its first five BlueBird satellites into low Earth orbit, an initial “Block 1” that are intended to deliver “intermittent” coverage across the U.S. Meanwhile, AST is assembling the next generation of satellites — “Block 2” — with plans to deploy between 45-60 satellites by 2026.</p>\n<p>The partnership also underscores how rapidly the satellite-to-cell market is evolving. SpaceX, through its Starlink network, has already started rolling out its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/spacex-gets-fcc-green-light-for-starlink-direct-to-phone-deal-with-t-mobile/\">direct-to-cell service with T-Mobile</a>, and recently bolstered its ambitions further <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/spacex-strikes-17b-deal-to-buy-echostars-spectrum-for-starlinks-direct-to-phone-service/\">by agreeing to acquire $17 billion</a> worth of wireless spectrum from EchoStar.</p>\n<p>AST has already demonstrated 4G and 5G connections between its satellites and smartphones, including voice and video calls, testing milestones that the company says have “proven the capabilities” of its network.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Despite the well-known environmental benefits of recycling, it’s estimated that <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2022/02/plastic-pollution-is-growing-relentlessly-as-waste-management-and-recycling-fall-short.html\" target=\"_blank\">less than 10% of the world’s plastic</a> gets recycled. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/ganiga-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\">Ganiga Innovation</a> looks to bring that percentage up using AI-enabled robotic waste bins. </p>\n<p>Italian startup Ganiga built three products to help better manage waste and recycling. The first is a fleet of robotic waste bins, called Hoooly, that use generative AI to determine what is trash and what is recycling and sort the waste accordingly. The second is a smart lid that can be fitted to existing waste bins with the same functionality as its larger bin counterpart. </p>\n<p>The company also has a software product that allows companies to track the waste they produce; it offers suggestions for how a company can reduce waste production based on its waste data. </p>\n<p>Ganiga will be showing off its tech as part of this year’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Battlefield</a> competition at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a>, which runs <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">October 27 to 29</a> at San Francisco’s Moscone West. </p>\n<p>Nicolas Zeoli, the founder and CEO of Ganiga, told TechCrunch that he’s had dreams of building the next great company, like Facebook or Apple, since he was younger. </p>\n<p>He decided to focus on waste because he said issues surrounding waste management are very tangible in his native Italy — and it was clear there wasn’t much being done about it. </p>\n<p>“We all need to reclaim this problem,” Zeoli said. “I read 100 articles on this problem. For example, in one year, only in one year, in the whole world over 100 million tons of plastic is created and only 9% is recycled. This is a very real problem.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Zeoli launched Ganiga in 2021 and built its first prototype in 2022. Zeoli said they decided to focus on building a bin to solve this problem because it gives people a physical place to put waste that can ensure it gets properly recycled and sorted, and because the bins spit out data that can be used for the future. </p>\n<p>Waste management is also expensive for companies, Zeoli said. Many organizations, especially in Europe, have ESG mandates to adhere to. Zeoli hopes Hoooly can help companies better track their waste production to help them reduce waste and waste-related costs down the line.</p>\n<p>Ganiga started selling its bins in 2024 and has since sold more than 120 robots to customers like Google and to multiple airports, including the ones in Bologna, Venice, and Madrid, among others. </p>\n<p>Zeoli said the company made $500,000 in revenue in 2024 and is already up to $750,000 in just the first nine months of 2025. </p>\n<p>The company has also raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding from investors, including clean tech VC firm NextSTEP and NextEnergy Capital, among others. Ganiga is looking to raise a $3 million seed round. </p>\n<p>The company is gearing up to launch its latest product in November, the Hooolyfood, which is a software product that uses camera images to determine the exact amount of food waste. The company plans to delve into further software-focused products in the future, too, Zeoli said, based on the data their current bins and software is collecting. </p>\n<p>Ganiga has focused on the European market thus far, but Zeoli said he’s hoping to expand into the U.S.; the company is even thinking of moving its headquarters stateside in 2026. </p>\n<p>“Ganiga is the first startup in all the world to fill one airport with the smart bins,” Zeoli said. “This is important because we don’t target the prototype; we are a product, and we are open to the market.”</p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn from Ganiga firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches and valuable workshops and make the connections that drive business results, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\" target=\"_blank\">head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt</a>, taking place October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.</em></p>\n<figure><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?w=680\" alt=\"TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TC25_Disrupt_General_Article_No-Anniversary_Headers_1920x1080.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /></a></figure>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>A few weeks ago, President Trump announced the application fee for an H-1B visa would increase to $100,000. The price tag sent shock waves through the tech ecosystem, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/startup-founders-say-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-is-a-talent-tariff-that-will-hurt-innovation/\">heavily utilizes the visa</a> to bring talent in from other countries. </p>\n<p>On this week’s Equity, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcast/why-the-new-h-1b-policy-helps-outsourcers-not-startups/\">we sat down with</a> Jeremy Neufeld, the director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress, to talk about the visa changes, what it means, and why it’s happening. </p>\n<p>He said the intention of the visa change makes sense, but the implementation of it has “left a lot to be desired.”  </p>\n<p>“Some of the proposals that they’ve ended up settling on have either loopholes or they’re prioritizing the wrong thing,” he said. As a result, he said, the visa changes will probably have the reverse effect than what the Trump administration intended. “It’s going to be a big tax on us bringing in top researchers from around the world.” </p>\n<p>But for all the sticker shock, there are a lot of people in support of the visa changes. Neufeld said it makes sense to make sure that the 85,000 open H-1B visa slots are actually going to valuable workers and that it makes sense to charge a fee to ensure that only the best are applying — and receiving the visa. </p>\n<p>He also spoke about the allegations that companies were abusing the visa. But again, he said, there are loopholes in the changes that are hard to ignore. </p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the conversation, we spoke about the other changes made to the visa, such as the required wage levels. We pondered the Trump administration’s reasons for changing the visa and the odds of more changes to the visa occurring before its lottery in the spring. Neufeld also spoke about what impact this will have on the global tech scene and hiring.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“I think many people are going to be deterred from coming to the United States,” he said. </p>\n<p>Overall, there are many uncertainties regarding nearly every aspect of this visa change. Right now, he said, the changes are in a “notice and comment period,” where it is accepting feedback from members of the public. Given the reactions to the change, even more could be coming.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Zendesk announced Wednesday at its AI summit a string of LLM-driven products meant to reshape the company’s reliance on human technicians.</p>\n<p>The center of the new features is an autonomous support agent that Zendesk believes will solve 80% of support issues without human intervention. That system will be supplemented by a co-pilot agent, which will assist human technicians with the remaining 20% of issues, as well as an admin-layer agent, a voice-based agent, and an analytics agent.</p>\n<p>According to Shashi Upadhyay, Zendesk’s president of Product, Engineering and AI, the new agents are part of a broader change in the support industry, as AI replaces much of the work that was previously done by humans.</p>\n<p>“The world’s going to shift from software that’s built for human users, to a system where AI actually does most of the work,” Upadhyay told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Independent benchmarks suggest that contemporary AI models are capable of taking on the work. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12045\" target=\"_blank\">TAU-bench</a>, which was designed to measure a model’s tool-calling ability, includes a scenario in which models have to process a returned product — a close analogue to many support tasks. <a href=\"https://llm-stats.com/benchmarks/tau-bench-retail\" target=\"_blank\">The current leader</a>, Claude Sonnet 4.5, solves 85% of issues on the test.</p>\n<p>After <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/18/zendesks-latest-problem-is-an-activist-investor/\">a chaotic investor fight in 2022</a>, Zendesk has made a string of AI acquisitions that laid the groundwork for the current shift. The analytics agent launching today is built directly on the company’s <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/newsroom/articles/hyperarc-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperarc acquisition</a>, which was completed in July. Earlier AI acquisitions include the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/ai-powered-estonian-qa-startup-klaus-acquired-by-zendesk/\">QA and agentic service system Klaus</a> (acquired in February 2024) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/13/zendesk-adds-flexible-ai-agent-capabilities-with-ultimate-acquisition/\">the automation platform Ultimate</a> (acquired the following March).</p>\n<p>Zendesk has previewed the new system with existing customers, and Upadhyay says the results have been promising.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“For customers that have been using it, consumer satisfaction has been up by five to 10 points,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Large language models have often been deployed for customer support, although rarely at the Zendesk’s scale. Companies from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/airbnb-is-quietly-rolling-out-an-ai-customer-service-bot-in-the-us/\">Airbnb</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/regal-claims-its-customer-service-chatbots-are-better-than-most/\">Regal Theaters</a> have already experimented with in-house chatbot support, often contracting directly with foundation model labs. But those systems typically deal with information retrieval rather than more complex troubleshooting or taking self-directed action.</p>\n<p>If the new push for AI-based support is successful, the economic implications would be significant. Zendesk’s Resolution Platform already supports nearly 20,000 customers, resolving 4.6 billion tickets each year. Beyond Zendesk, the U.S. employs <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/office-and-administrative-support/customer-service-representatives.htm#:~:text=Customer%20service%20representatives%20typically%20use,employed%20in%20nearly%20every%20industry.\" target=\"_blank\">2.4 million customer service representatives</a> — with far larger workforces in other countries.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

On Tuesday, the makers of Bounce introduced its latest beta version, Bounce 2, which lets you take your Mastodon social graph and migrate it or merge it into a profile for your Bluesky account.</p>\n<p>With this change, arriving on October 20, users on the open social web will be able to move in either direction: from Mastodon to Bluesky or vice versa. The idea is that this account portability prevents users from getting stuck on a service if they come to disagree with its state of development, terms of use, moderation decisions, or anything else. Instead, they can simply pick up their account and go elsewhere. </p>\n<p>Bounce’s cross-protocol migration tool was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/bounce-launches-a-service-for-moving-accounts-between-bluesky-and-mastodon/\">first introduced</a> in August by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/17/bridgy-fed-a-project-to-connect-the-open-social-web-is-now-becoming-a-nonprofit/\">nonprofit</a> <a href=\"https://anew.social/\" target=\"_blank\">A New Social</a>, which is developing technologies designed to make the open social web more accessible and functional.</p>\n<p>Today, the open social web includes different underlying technologies, called protocols, like <a href=\"https://activitypub.rocks/\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub</a>, which powers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/what-is-mastodon/\" target=\"_blank\">Mastodon</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/what-is-instagrams-threads-app-all-your-questions-answered/\" target=\"_blank\">Threads</a>, Flipboard, PeerTube, Pixelfed, and others; and the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AT Protocol,</a> which underpins <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/\" target=\"_blank\">Bluesky</a>, Skylight, and other social apps.</p>\n<p>The two protocols don’t interoperate, which is why bridges — tools that connect different platforms — were introduced. Currently, users can bridge their accounts so others on different networks can follow their content, no matter what service they prefer to use.</p>\n<p>Bounce is built on technology that was first developed for <a href=\"https://fed.brid.gy/\" target=\"_blank\">Bridgy Fed</a>, another tool that connects Mastodon and Bluesky by making users’ profiles on one service visible on the other.</p>\n<p>Originally, the service was able to move a user’s Bluesky account to a bridged account that straddles the two networks and then to the user’s Mastodon account.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bridgy-Fed-Diagram-1-.png?resize=50,28 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Bridgy Fed diagram.</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>A New Social</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>With today’s launch, Bounce 2 can now do the reverse: It can move a Mastodon user’s social graph to Bluesky, or merge it into a bridged profile for their existing Bluesky (or ATProto) account.</p>\n<p>Things are a little bit different when moving in this direction, the organization notes. </p>\n<p>When “bouncing” from Bluesky to Mastodon, if the Mastodon account was already bridged, then the user’s follower lists will be merged, not replaced. In addition, when you bounce from Mastodon to Bluesky, your original posts and content won’t come with you, unlike when moving in the other direction.</p>\n<p>“We believe services like Bluesky and Mastodon are only entry points into the open social web, but those entry points should not be a trap into yet another ecosystem,” an <a href=\"https://blog.anew.social/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> from A New Social reads. “People should be able to change their minds, use the technologies that work best for them, and still connect with their people, no matter what they use.”</p>\n<p>Bounce 2 launches later this month, and users can support the nonprofit via its <a href=\"https://patreon.com/anewsocial?ref=blog.anew.social\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.anew.social/merch-drop-people-not-platforms-v1/\" target=\"_blank\">merch store</a>.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Base Power has built one of the largest battery storage systems in Texas in two years — and now it wants to grow faster. </p>\n<p>The Austin-based startup, which had raised <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/a16z-backs-base-power-in-200m-round-for-home-backup-batteries/\">$200 million in April</a>, is back with another $1 billion in funding. The Series C round was led by Addition with participation from CapitalG, Elad Gil, Lightspeed, Ribbit, Thrive Capital, and Valor Equity Partners.</p>\n<p>The new round values the company at $3 billion pre-money, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/business/dealbook/base-power-fundraise-dell.html\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to The New York Times.</p>\n<p>Base Power has sold more than 100 megawatt-hours’ worth of its home storage batteries in Texas — a notable figure considering the company was founded in 2023.</p>\n<p>Base Power leases the batteries to homeowners, who pay between $695 and $995 upfront to install 25 kilowatt-hour or 50 kilowatt-hour batteries, both of which dwarf the competition. (For instance, the 25-kilowatt battery doubles a single Tesla Powerwall.) The batteries can keep a household powered for as long as 48 hours, according to the company.</p>\n<p>Customers also pay a monthly fee ($19 or $29) and commit to buying electricity from Base Power for three years at 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour plus delivery fees. </p>\n<p>By leasing the batteries, Base Power has lowered a significant hurdle for many homeowners: the upfront cost of home storage batteries. The batteries themselves run thousands of dollars for less storage capacity, not including installation costs.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Base Power has also taken advantage of Texas’ deregulated utility market, which allows households to easily switch electricity suppliers. </p>\n<p>The state’s utility regulator handsomely rewards power providers that can respond quickly with large amounts of electricity when the grid needs it most, something grid-scale batteries excel at. In exchange for the low upfront cost, Base Power customers agree to allow the company to use the batteries to sell electricity back to the grid when they don’t need them for backup power.</p>\n<p>In addition to expansion beyond Texas, the company is also planning to build a second battery factory in the United States. It is currently constructing its first factory near Austin, Texas.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

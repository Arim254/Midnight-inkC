This means if you lose your device, you can use methods like fingerprint, face, or the screen lock code of your previous device to access WhatsApp’s backup.\nFor years, WhatsApp didn’t have an encryption layer for its chat backups. However, in 2021, Meta added a way for users to protect their backups with end-to-end encryption using either passwords or 64-character encryption keys.\nThe trouble with both is that you have to remember your backup password or have the encryption key handy while restoring the backup. With passkeys, you don’t need to look for the password or the key. \nWhatsApp, which crossed 3 billion active users in May, said that this feature will be rolled out to users in the coming weeks and months, so you might have to keep a eye on when it becomes available to you.\nYou can go to Settings > Chats > Chat backup > End-to-end encrypted backup to enable encrypted backups and check if you have an option to use passkeys.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNavan, the corporate travel and expense platform, finished its first day of trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday down 20% from its $25 IPO price, resulting in a valuation of approximately $4.7 billion for the 10-year-old company.\nThe company was the first to use a new SEC rule that allows public listings during a government shutdown.\nUnlike the traditional IPO path, which requires SEC regulators to review and grant final approval, companies using the shutdown workaround can get automatic approval for their IPO documents 20 days after submitting their price range, effectively bypassing the need for manual SEC approval.\nBut the updated mechanism carries a risk: The government can scrutinize the documents later. If the SEC later finds material deficiencies or undisclosed issues, the company may be forced to amend its statements, which could lead to a lower stock price and even potential litigation.\nDespite this risk, Navan decided to proceed with its IPO, primarily because the bulk of its registration statements had already been reviewed by the SEC staff before the government shutdown began on October 1.\nThe stock’s initial decline is likely influenced, at least in part, by this regulatory uncertainty.\nThe market’s reaction to Navan’s offering is being closely monitored by other IPO contenders. Startups looking to go public before the end of the year need to decide soon whether they’re ready to deal with the regulatory unknowns or delay their filing until the next year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNavan has been waiting to go public for several years. The company reportedly filed its confidential IPO paperwork in 2022 and planned to debut at a $12 billion valuation in early 2023.  \nThe company, formerly known as TripActions, was last valued at $9.2 billion when it raised a $154 million Series G round in October 2022.\nNavan customers include Shopify, Zoom, Wayfair, OpenAI, and Thomson Reuters. The company claims that its AI-powered assistant, Ava, handles approximately 50% of customer conversations related to booking or changing flight, hotel, and car rental reservations. Navan’s expense management solution helps companies manage employee expenses through features like automated receipt scanning and categorization.\nThe company generated revenue of $613 million over the last 12 months (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to its S1.\nNavan’s largest venture capital backers before its IPO included Lightspeed (holding a 24.8% stake), solo VC Oren Zeev (18.6% stake), Andreessen Horowitz (12.6%), and Greenoaks (7.1%).\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNBA champion Tristan Thompson announced at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 that he’s partnering with global telecom company World Mobile to launch a community-owned mobile network called Uplift. The network offers unlimited data plans starting at $9.99 per month.\nUplift is built on blockchain technology and a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN).\nWith Uplift, every subscription will contribute to neighborhood-level network expansion, while local hosts that are known as “AirNode operators” will earn a portion of network revenue by providing community coverage. The idea behind Uplift is to challenge the $2 trillion telecom industry’s centralized model by allowing users and local operators to share in the value they create.\n“For me, it’s about, how can I help people that have walked the same life that I walked, and I think for us, what we’re doing is providing connectivity and connection for unlimited data at a way lower cost,” Thompson said onstage. “It’s like, how can I help my community have a better tomorrow? And that’s what this is about. And I’ve been very blessed and fortunate to have a team that understands this vision. And we want to help people in America, help the inner city, and just give people hope.”\nWhile Thompson is known for his basketball career and winning the NBA championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers, he’s also an outspoken advocate for innovation and inclusion. Thompson currently holds four C-suite roles across the web3 and fintech landscape. He’s the chief digital equity officer at World Mobile and the chief advisory officer at AxonDAO, an AI-powered medical research platform inspired by his brother’s epilepsy journey.\nImage Credits:Getty Images for TechCrunch\nHe’s also the co-founder of Basketball Fun, a web3 platform that tokenizes NBA players, and he’s the chief content officer at Tracy AI, an AI platform for real-time sports analytics.\nWith this latest endeavor, Thompson and World Mobile are looking to drive affordable community-owned internet access. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWorld Mobile says this is a tested and scalable model, as it piloted it in Reno, Nevada, where community hosts have earned more than $10,000 annually by providing coverage to underserved areas. Uplift operates on infrastructure already proven through World Mobile’s U.S. deployments, World Mobile says.\n“We brought about 20% of Reno back to connectivity,” Thompson said. “When the hurricane happened in North Carolina and Asheville, Starlink went out there and tried to bring connectivity, and they weren’t able to, so they reached out to the World Mobile team, and we were able to get out there and send a couple of our guys on helicopters to fly in, and we were actually the ones that brought connectivity back to Asheville, North Carolina, during that hurricane.”\nThe new service will begin rolling out in Cleveland, Ohio, soon and will launch in additional cities in 2026.\nWorld Mobile notes that more than 50 million Americans live at or near the poverty line, with many lacking access to affordable high-speed data. Uplift aims to expand access while ensuring that wealth generated by mobile usage stays in the neighborhoods that create it.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nCreative suite company Canva launched its own design model on Thursday that understands design layers and formats to power its features. The company also introduced new products and features, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to use its spreadsheet tool alongside its app-building feature to create data visualization widgets.\nCanva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its design elements, that generates designs with editable layers and objects rather than flat images. The model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites.\n“We started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you’re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,” Canva’s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call. \n“What we’ve found is that people . . . want the ability to start with a prompt and get far, but also be able to iterate directly themselves.”\nEarlier this year, the company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI that has a chat-like interface for generating visual content from text prompts. The platform is now making that assistant available throughout the interface, including the design and elements tabs.\nUsers can also tag (@mention) the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allows users to copy the art style of any design.\nThe company also added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now it’s connecting these two products, allowing users to use data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCanva also acquired an ad analytics company called MagicBrief earlier this year. Using its own platform for creation along with the new measurement tool, Canva is launching Canva Grow, an all-in-one marketing platform that uses AI for both asset creation and performance analytics. It also allows marketers to publish their ads directly on platforms like Meta.\nAlong with AI features, the Australian design company announced several new products and features for its platform. Users can now create forms with Canva to collect responses from their clients or audiences as an alternative to services like Google Forms.\nThe company is also adding email design to the platform for users to create templates and layouts for marketing or transactional emails that follow their brand’s aesthetics.\nCanva acquired the professional design suite Affinity last year to better compete with Adobe. With this release, the company said that it is making Affinity free forever for users.\nCanva is also redesigning the Affinity interface to merge vector, pixel, and layout tools under one interface. It’s tightly integrating Affinity with Canva so designers can create objects in the professional tool and move them into Canva. Users can also take advantage of Canva AI to generate images or designs within Affinity, the company said.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIntrCity SmartBus, a tech-enabled intercity bus platform in India, has raised $30 million in funding to expand its network across smaller cities and towns in the South Asian nation. The all-equity Series D round, led by A91 Partners, values the Noida-based startup at $140 million post-money.\nIntercity travel is accelerating in India as more people migrate from smaller towns to metropolitan cities for work and education.\nTo meet this demand, New Delhi has significantly expanded the country’s highway infrastructure. The national highway network has increased by over 60% in the past decade, from 56,723 miles to 90,847 miles, according to Indian government data. \nRailways, while extensive, remain capacity-constrained and cannot keep pace with rising interstate travel demand. That makes long-distance road travel a crucial alternative. Yet, state-run intercity bus services are limited and often fall short on reliability and comfort — a gap IntrCity SmartBus aims to fill.\nUnlike traditional operators, IntrCity SmartBus runs on an asset-light model by partnering with local bus owners and equipping their vehicles with proprietary hardware for real-time tracking, co-founder and president Kapil Raizada said in an interview.\nThe startup also centralizes ticket booking and route planning through its digital platform, which helps determine service frequency, pickup points, boarding stations, and even seat configurations based on demand.\nTo ensure safety and consistency, IntrCity places trained personnel — called “captains” — on board each bus, Raizada told TechCrunch. Most vehicles feature washrooms, and the company has also set up air-conditioned boarding lounges staffed with crew to improve the pre-departure experience.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“All our buses are cloud-connected,” he noted. “There is a bus operating system, which we have built up in-house, which monitors and manages a lot of parameters, including the CCTV, sound, and temperature levels.”\nFounded in 2019, IntrCity SmartBus began as an online train ticketing platform under the RailYatri brand. That entry point gave the team early insights into intercity travel behavior and unmet demand in road-based mobility, Raizada said.\nToday, RailYatri contributes just around 10% of the startup’s total revenue, while the SmartBus business accounts for the remaining 90%, he added.\nIntrCity SmartBus operates around 600 daily bus trips, transporting between 20,000 and 25,000 passengers each day — nearly 700,000 per month. The platform works with more than 50 local bus operators and runs trips averaging over 311 miles each. About 95% of its services are overnight, catering primarily to nondiscretionary travel needs such as work, education, or essential appointments. \nThe startup’s typical passengers are between 20 and 45 years old, including small-business owners, trainers, government officials, sales professionals, and students.\nThe startup follows a hub-and-spoke model and has identified 15 to 16 key economic hubs across India. It operates in 13 to 14 of these hubs, spanning 15 states. The network covers all of northern India — from Jammu to Uttarakhand — and much of the south, including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.\n“A lot of data crunching goes into understanding what the consumer needs,” said Manish Rathi, co-founder and CEO of IntrCity SmartBus. “This includes decisions like what kind of layout a bus should have — should it be a full sleeper, or a hybrid with both sleepers and seats?”\nIntrCity SmartBus grew its revenue by 67% year-over-year to ₹5 billion (approximately $57 million) in the last fiscal year. The startup projects revenue to surpass ₹7 billion (around $79 million) in the current year. It has been “EBITDA-positive” for the past couple of years and aims to become fully profitable this year.\nWith the latest funding, the startup plans to go “deeper and wider” through the country and enhance customer experience and safety, as well as upgrade its fleet management technology.\n“One of the bigger challenges in bus mobility across the country [is] that people have concerns about busses. It is seen as a lesser cousin to trains and flights,” Raizada told TechCrunch. “We want to make busses the preferred mode of travel in India.”\nMore than 223 million intercity journeys were made in India in the financial year 2025, according to a recent report by online bus ticketing platform redBus. The sector added over 72,000 new intercity routes last year, along with approximately 6,400 new buses — expanding capacity by an estimated 265,000 daily seats.\nAlongside IntrCity SmartBus, India is seeing a wave of new-age intercity bus startups such as Zingbus, LeafyBus, and Fresh Bus. European giant FlixBus also entered the Indian market early last year, signaling growing traction in the space. Still, IntrCity views competition as secondary to execution.\n“India is a very different beast when it comes to road travel. If something is going to go wrong, it will go wrong,” Rathi said. “We’re not a network-first company. We’re an operational-excellence-first company.”\n",

    "body": "\nPeople are increasingly asking AI, not Google, to help them discover products. A recent shopping report says Americans, this holiday season, will likely turn to large language models to find gifts, deals, and sales instead of traditional search.\nRetailers could see up to a 520% increase in traffic from chatbots and AI prompts in 2025 compared to 2024, according to the report. For brands, that means figuring out how to show up in AI-generated recommendations, and fast.\nThis surge in AI-driven traffic is the bet behind The Prompting Company, a YC-backed startup helping products get mentioned in AI apps through GEO (generative engine optimization), a strategy designed for a future where AI agents browse the internet on users’ behalf.\nThe four-month-old startup, founded by Kevin Chandra, Michelle Marcelline, and Albert Purnama, has raised $6.5 million in seed funding and already counts Rippling, Rho, Motion, Vapi, Fondo, Kernel, and Traceloop as customers.\n“Over the past year, most of the growth on websites has come from AI bots, not people,” co-founder and CEO Chandra told TechCrunch in an interview. “We’re already seeing developers ask AI tools for product recommendations inside their workflows, and we think people, over time, will be less involved in parts of the purchasing funnel.”\nAs AI becomes the first touchpoint for product discovery and agents eventually transact on a user’s behalf, The Prompting Company believes brands must learn how to market to agents as well as humans.\nWhat that means, according to Chandra, is that brands will need an AI-facing website, a version of their site made for agents without navigation bars, pop-ups, or marketing fluff. “Most businesses still design websites only for humans,” Chandra told TechCrunch. “But the fastest-growing segment of users on the internet today is AI agents and they need a completely different interface.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHere’s how the platform works: First, it identifies and analyzes the questions AI agents are asking by probing models to uncover specific purchase-intent queries. It then creates structured content that answers those questions and automatically routes AI agents to “AI-optimized pages.”\nThe Y Combinator-backed startup helps companies publish thousands of AI-friendly pages so LLMs can cite their answers even when they don’t rank in traditional SEO. (YC has backed similar startups, including Relixir, Writesonic, and Bear.)\nWhile SEO still matters, Chandra argues that GEO is quickly becoming the priority for brands. In GEO, product results surface organically based on relevance to the conversation, not paid keywords or search rankings.\nThis shift may also change how people buy products. Emerging protocols, including Google’s Agent2Agent framework and OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe, could further accelerate adoption by allowing AI agents to browse and complete purchases on behalf of users, moving them from discovery to transaction.\n“Imagine you’re a large e-commerce store. Users can buy items, make returns, compare products, or search for promotions. We help our customers expose those actions to AI agents. Right now, these agents aren’t yet clicking those options or accessing APIs directly, but we expect that to change in the coming months,” said Chandra. “Once that becomes widespread and attribution improves, we see a path toward more advertising- or conversion-driven models. For now, we’re focused on helping companies get discovered and recommended by AI.”\nSo far, The Prompting Company serves mostly fintech, developer tools, and enterprise SaaS customers. The team says a Fortune 10 company is also using its product, for which it currently hosts about half a million pages. \nOverall, traffic driven to client sites is in the double-digit millions per month. The Prompting Company uses a subscription model, charging customers based on the number of prompts tracked and pages hosted.\nThe company’s founders, Indonesian immigrants who met as freshmen, previously built YC-backed Typedream (YC W20), a startup that allowed users to build and launch websites in minutes with AI, before Lovable and newer entrants took off (beehiiv acquired Typedream last June). The founders also built Cotter, a passwordless authentication SDK that was acquired by Stytch.\nWith The Prompting Company, they’re trying to change how people discover and purchase products in the AI era. The seed money, raised from Peak XV Partners, Base10, Y Combinator, Firedrop, and angels, including Logan Kilpatrick, will help the company scale its platform and partnerships as AI-powered discovery becomes the new distribution channel. The startup is also collaborating with Nvidia on next-generation AI search.\n“If your product isn’t discovered or cited in ChatGPT, you’re ngmi,” said Arnav Sahu, partner at Peak XV Partners. “We’re thrilled to back The Prompting Company as they build the core infrastructure for product discovery — already powering Fortune 10 companies and fast-growing startups. Kevin, Michelle, and Albert are repeat YC founders, and they are awesome.”\n",

    "body": "\nThreads, Meta’s X rival, continues to ship new features at a rapid pace. Shortly after the launch of communities and disappearing “ghost posts,” the social networking app on Thursday introduced new tools that will give users more control over their conversations on the platform.\nOne new feature, reply approvals, will allow you to decide which replies from other users will appear on your posts — before anyone else can see them.\nWhile Threads, like other social networks, already offers tools that let you limit replies to people you follow, your followers, or people you mention, the new feature allows you to keep your replies open to all without the negative consequences of having discussions derailed.\nImage Credits:Meta / Threads\nAs the company explains, these tools will help you “set the tone of the conversation,” and give users more choice. It’s a unique way to balance users’ interest in engaging in more public conversations, but one where the poster — not those replying — still has the power. \nIn addition, the company is rolling out new Activity feed filters that will allow you to more easily view the replies from people you follow or those that include mentions. These join other options like Verified, Quotes, Reposts, and more as other ways to filter replies. \nImage Credits:Meta / Threads\nMeta announced during its third-quarter earnings call this week that Threads has now reached 150 million daily active users, up from over 100 million in December 2024. In August, the company said the network had topped more than 400 million monthly active users, as well.\nAs the app grows, Meta has been working to quickly monetize its traction, having now rolled out ads on the platform globally. It’s now moving to launch video ads.\nThreads is still developing more consumer-facing features, too, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced this week that Threads is now testing controls that will allow users to tune their algorithm by adding and removing topics based on their interests.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nDesign platform Figma said today that it has acquired AI-powered image and video generation company Weavy. The startup will join Figma under a new brand called Figma Weave.\nFigma said that 20 people from Weavy will join the company but didn’t disclose the valuation of the deal. The Tel Aviv-based startup was founded in 2024 and raised $4 million in a seed round in June led by Entrée Capital, with participation from Designer Fund, Founder Collective, and Fiverr founder Micha Kaufman.\nFigma said that Weavy will exist as a stand-alone product for now and that, in the future, it will be integrated with the Figma Weave brand, along with the rest of the Figma platform.\nWeavy’s web tools enable users to combine different AI models and offer users pro editing tools to create high-quality images and videos for use in product mock-ups or brand styling. Users can edit these media generations with layer edits, adjust lighting, and change colors and angles through prompts to achieve the final result they want.\nImage Credits:Figma\nUsers start with an element like a prompt for an image generation on an infinite canvas, look at results from different models, pick one image, add another prompt for video generation, and look at different results produced by various models. At any point, users can use the edit tools to change the look of a video. Designers can also combine multiple prompts and models to get to the output they want.\nThe startup offers different models such as Seedance, Sora, and Veo for video, and Flux, Ideogram, Nano Banana, and Seedream for image generation.\nImage Credits:Figma\n“This node-based approach brings a new level of craft and control to AI generation. Outputs can be branched, remixed, and refined, combining creative exploration with iteration and craft. The Weavy team has inspired us with the balance they’ve struck between simplicity, approachability, and power. They’ve also created a tool that’s just a joy to use,” Figma CEO Dylan Field said in a statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAI-powered design platforms are in demand to create media generation and design workflow capabilities.

    "body": "\n“The dead internet theory is real,” Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian told Digg founder Kevin Rose, referring to the idea that much of the internet isn’t human — it’s mostly bots. \nThe two entrepreneurs have since teamed up to re-envision how to build a social community in this world where, very soon, it will be hard to tell who’s a real person online. \nEarlier this year, the two bought the remaining assets belonging to Digg, the long-shuttered news aggregation site originally founded by Rose that was a staple of the Web 2.0 era. \nNow again under Rose’s control, the new Digg is creating a place for people to socialize and connect online within communities, similar to Reddit, but it has different ideas about how such a platform should work at a time when bots are nearly indistinguishable from humans. \nBackstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday, Rose explained that he sees the future of social as being more focused on protected online spaces and “micro communities of trusted users.” \n“I just have to imagine that, as the cost to deploy agents drops to next to nothing, we’re just gonna see…bots act as though they’re humans,” he said. “So, small trusted communities, proof of heartbeat — there’s an actual human on the other end…is important.” \nBut today’s verification methods often involve things like facial recognition, ID uploads, or small payments with a credit card to ensure that someone is a person and not a bot. Not everyone online will feel comfortable doing something like that to access an online social community, of course.  \nThat’s why Digg is looking to use newer technology, like a ZK proof (ZKP) to verify people using its platform in the future.\nSays Rose, the ZKP is a “fancy piece of math” which doesn’t expose who someone is, but can verify something essential that would be important for their participation in an online community. \nFor instance, a moderator of a community for Oura ring owners could use the technology to verify that someone is actually an Oura ring owner before allowing them to post. That identity could stay with them so they’re known as a trusted member, but not necessarily one where they have to go by their real name. This could be particularly useful in communities focused on sensitive topics or health issues, as well. \nConnie Loizos, Editor-in-Chief & GM of TechCrunch, and Kevin Rose, Founder, Digg, speak onstage during day three of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 at Moscone Center on October 29, 2025 in San Francisco, California Image Credits:Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch\nThe idea that moderators should have more of a say over their communities is also essential to the new Digg — and, Rose believes, these founding members should be compensated for their efforts. \n“When we first started Digg in 2004 — before Reddit launched — we were very lucky because we had thousands and thousands of people, and eventually millions of people, that would come in and contribute content,” said Rose, during his panel at the TechCrunch Disrupt event.  “And they’re not getting paid.”\nHe said that some Reddit moderators are essentially working around the clock to handle things like spam and fighting, but aren’t receiving any slice of the revenue, nor do they control the audience. \n“So you’re talking about something where you’re signing up and creating all this value for a platform, but you can’t port that platform anywhere else. You can’t capture any email addresses. You can’t stay in touch on that platform. You can be ousted [from] that platform,” he said. \nRose also pointed to issues where larger Reddit communities can become trademarked — something that prevented the founder of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit from writing a book using the name of the community they had created. \n“If anything, we should be more similar to Substack or Patreon, or some others that are actually giving you much more control of your community,” he said. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nBox co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie doesn’t think AI agents will replace enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies. Instead, he believes that the more likely future is a hybrid combination of SaaS plus agents, he said, speaking onstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday.\n “Generally, once you have a business process, you want to be able to define that in, effectively, business logic with deterministic systems — just because the risk of that changing any given day is very high,” explained Levie.\n“If you’re doing something mission critical — we’ve already seen great examples of either data being leaked because of agents, or an agent going and, you know, maybe blowing up your database or doing something in production you didn’t expect. So you want to have some sort of ‘church and state’ between the deterministic side of your software and the non-deterministic side.”\nHe painted a picture of a future of enterprise software where the SaaS is used for the core business workflow, and then the agents ride on top of that. These agents would be helpful with making decisions, automating workflows, or, essentially, just accelerating whatever process the person was trying to do in the system, the exec said. \nIn addition, Levie pointed out that this reconfiguration would dramatically impact the business model of enterprise SaaS. \n“The thing that I’m very convinced of is we’ll have about 100 times more, maybe 1,000 times more, agents than we have people. So you’ll have way more users of that software system, or SaaS, as agents,” Levie said.\nAs a result, the typical “per-seat” business model would no longer work, and instead, companies would have to sell some form of consumption and volume-oriented use cases with AI agents. \nThese changes are a market opportunity for startups, particularly those that are building for the agent-first era, rather than bigger companies that are trying to integrate agents into existing processes. \nSmaller startups, he said, have no business processes to change, so they can design a new process in an agent-first way.\nThis presents an opportunity for startups to build solutions for the enterprise space to make the change management process easier and more palatable, Levie said.\nHe encouraged entrepreneurs to capitalize on this shift by building. \n“We are in this window right now that we have not been in for about 15 years, which is — there’s a complete platform shift happening in tech that’s opening up a spot for a new set of companies to emerge,” Levie said.\n“And I would just, you know, try and fully exploit that.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

That shift has helped Snabbit, an on-demand home-help startup, secure $30 million in new funding and lift its valuation to $180 million, up from $80 million five months ago.\nThe all-equity Series C round — Snabbit’s third fundraise in nine months — was led by Bertelsmann India Investments, with participation from existing backers Lightspeed, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners. The latest infusion brings the startup’s total funding to $55 million.\nSnabbit’s fresh funding follows a sharp rise in activity, with the Bengaluru-based startup growing from about 1,000 jobs a day in May to more than 10,000 daily bookings. The company crossed 300,000 total orders in October, founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal said in an interview with TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2024, Snabbit offers a range of on-demand home services for urban households, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen prep through a 100% women-led fleet of 5,000 experts. The startup operates through a hyperlocal network of trained workers stationed around dense residential clusters, promising service within 10 minutes.\nCurrently, Snabbit serves 40 micro markets across five major cities, namely Mumbai, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Noida, and Pune. It plans to expand its presence in these cities and enter Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, and Calcutta very soon, Agarwal told TechCrunch.\nSnabbit has served more than 300,000 customers, up from 25,000 in May, and expects to add another 100,000 as early as next month. Most of its users are between 30 and 40 years old, including bachelors and working professionals.\nSnabbit founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal with a few of its women experts.Image Credits:Snabbit\nSome of Snabbit’s customers are those who do not want full-time house help but prefer an ad hoc solution. “We’re basically taking inefficiency in the model and plugging that, rather than saying, ‘Hey, this was happening offline, and now we’ll do it online,’” said Agarwal.\nThe startup reports a 30% to 35% retention rate and projects to reach annual recurring revenue of $11 million this month. Moreover, it has a customer acquisition cost of “well below” ₹500 (roughly $6), Agarwal told TechCrunch.\nSnabbit’s services are priced at around ₹150 (about $2) per hour, with an average ticket size of around ₹240 (roughly $3).\nWorkers on the platform earn between ₹25,000 and ₹30,000 (approximately $284 to $340) a month, depending on the hours they work. The startup has also reduced the average walking distance for its workers between two jobs from 300 meters to 250 meters, giving them more time to serve customers.\nSnabbit is not alone in the race to offer quick, on-demand home services in India. Urban Company pioneered the trend and was later followed by startups such as Broomees and Pronto. Urban Company now plans to double down on instant home services to stay ahead of rising competition, though Snabbit says it does not see that as a challenge.\n“In a hyper-local business, you don’t win pan India, you don’t win cities, you win micro markets. And today, out of the micro markets where we both [Snabbit and Urban Company] are present, Snabbit is leading in more micro markets because we have taken a very positive strategy to build depth as opposed to build breadth,” Agarwal said.\nThe new funding will help Snabbit strengthen its presence and expand into high-frequency categories such as cooking, child care, and elder care.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFor three days this week, 20 startups participated in the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. Each was selected to represent the best of the Startup Battlefield 200 and competed for a chance to take home the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. After all that intense pitching, we have a winner.\nThese startups were handpicked to compete in Startup Battlefield, and all of them presented a live demo in front of the VCs and tech leaders who judged the competition.\nAfter hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges’ notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: Charter Space, Glīd, MacroCycle, Nephrogen, and Unlisted Homes.\nThe final five made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures, and Digg founder Kevin Rose. \nWe’re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2024 is:\nWinner: Glīd\nGlīd (pronounced “Glide”) aims to streamline the complex, multistep process involved in moving a container from a ship to a freight train. The company, founded by Kevin Damoa (pictured), has developed several hardware and software products to speed up and reduce the cost of getting shipping containers to the railhead and eventually their destination. Its first product is GliderM, a hybrid-electric vehicle with a hook on the back that can pick up and move 20-foot containers directly to the rail without the need for forklifts of hostler trucks.\nRead more about Glīd in our separate post.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nRunner-up: Nephrogen\nNephrogen is a biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney. Founder Demetri Maxim says that after three years of development, Nephrogen has succeeded in creating a delivery mechanism that is 100 times more efficient at transporting medicine to the kidney than the “vehicles” currently approved by the FDA. And he plans to participate in the clinical study himself, given the challenges he faces living with polycystic kidney disease.\nRead more about Nephrogen in our separate post.\nThese two companies follow in the footsteps of Startup Battlefield legends like Dropbox, Discord, Cloudflare, and Mint on the Disrupt Stage. With more than 1,500 alumni having participated in the program, Startup Battlefield Alumni have collectively raised over $29 billion in funding with more than 200 successful exits.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nCluely’s Roy Lee has a message for startup founders: You should be thinking harder about how to go viral.\n“Generally, if you’re not in deep tech, then you need to low-key deep focus on distribution,” Lee told the crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nBut he also made it clear that not everyone was cut out for this kind of viral marketing. \n“If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.”\nCluely’s AI assistant grew famous this April with a viral claim that its undetectable windows could “help you cheat on anything” — a claim that was quickly disproven when a string of proctoring services showed they could, in fact, detect use of the AI assistant. But in a matter of months, the company had raised $15 million from Andreessen Horowitz, becoming one of the most visible products in the crowded AI assistant space.\nAs Lee frames it, it’s part of his talent for going viral, which often means making lots of people very angry at him. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he said onstage. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.”\nFor Lee, it’s part of a broader theory of social media, in which attention is the only currency. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Reputation is sort of a thing of the past,” Lee said. “You can try to be the New York Times and guard your ironclad reputation, but realistically you’ve got Sam Altman on the timeline talking about hot guys and you’ve got Elon Musk going bats— crazy.”\n“You just have to realize that the world is trending to a different place,” he continued, “where you have to be extreme, you have to be authentic, and you have to be personal.”\nIt’s hard to say how well that strategy is working, though. When asked for Cluely’s revenue numbers or user numbers, Lee demurred.\n“What I’ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you’re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you’re doing. And if you’re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you’re doing,” Lee said. “I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

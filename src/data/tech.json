Still, these moves suggest that at least two of California’s billionaires are indeed hoping to dodge a prospective ballot measure that would impose a one-time, 5% tax on individuals worth more than $1 billion.\nIf the measure makes it onto the ballot in November and actually passes, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in the state as of January 1 of this year.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n\n",

    "body": "\nFollowing an investigation by the Guardian that found Google AI Overviews offering misleading information in response to certain health-related queries, the company appears to have removed the AI Overviews for some of those queries.\nFor example, the Guardian initially reported that when users asked “what is the normal range for liver blood tests,” they would be presented with numbers that did not account for factors such as nationality, sex, ethnicity, or age, potentially leading them to think their results were healthy when they were not.\nNow, the Guardian says AI Overviews have been removed from the results for “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests.” However, it found that variations on those queries, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range,” could still lead to AI-generated summaries.\nWhen I tried those queries this morning — several hours after the Guardian published its story — none of them resulted in seeing AI Overviews, though Google still gave me the option to ask the same query in AI Mode. In several cases, the top result was actually the Guardian article about the removal.\nA Google spokesperson told the Guardian that the company does not “comment on individual removals within Search,” but that it works to “make broad improvements.” The spokesperson also said that an internal team of clinicians reviewed the queries highlighted by the Guardian and found “in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.”\nTechCrunch has reached out to Google for additional comment. Last year, the company announced new features aimed at improving Google Search for healthcare use cases, including improved overviews and health-focused AI models.\nVanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, told the Guardian that the removal is “excellent news,” but added, “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nThe 83rd Golden Globes was a standout evening for streaming platforms. Netflix led the pack with seven wins, while Apple TV and HBO Max each secured three awards, and Hulu took home one.​\nAmong Netflix’s highlights, the hit series “Adolescence” claimed four awards, including best limited series. The show also earned awards for best actor (Stephen Graham), supporting actor (Owen Cooper), and supporting actress (Erin Doherty) in a miniseries. Netflix’s most-watched title, “KPop Demon Hunters,” won best animated feature and best original song.​\nNetflix’s Golden Globes sweep comes just as the company prepares for the biggest moves in Hollywood: the acquisition of Warner Bros. The awards highlight Netflix’s growing dominance and may reassure investors that the company is poised to manage the legacy of a powerhouse like Warner Bros. These wins could be a strong signal that the merger might truly be a game-changer.\n​As for the other streamers, Apple TV earned two awards for “The Studio,” one for best television series (musical or comedy) and another for best actor in a TV series, awarded to Seth Rogen. Rhea Seehorn also secured the best lead actress in a television drama for her performance in “Pluribus.”\nHBO found success with its medical drama “The Pitt,” which picked up two Golden Globes, including one for actor Noah Wylie. \n​Hulu’s lone win came from Michelle Williams, who earned best lead actress in a limited or anthology series for “Dying For Sex.” However, Hulu Originals like “Only Murders in the Building,” “Paradise,” “Chad Powers,” and “The Bear” did not convert their nominations into wins.​\nMeanwhile, Disney+ received 15 nominations—including for “Andor” and “Elio”—but did not secure any wins this year.​\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Golden Globes also notably introduced a best podcast category, which Amy Poehler won for “Good Hang with Amy Poehler.” Other nominees included Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” and “Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard.”\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nWing, the Alphabet-owned company that delivers groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and hot lattes, is expanding its partnership with Walmart for the second time in less than a year. \nThe two companies announced on Sunday plans to bring the on-demand drone delivery service to an additional 150 Walmart stores. The rollout, which builds off existing services at stores in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, will occur throughout this year and into 2027, Wing’s new chief business officer Heather Rivera told TechCrunch. \nThe expansion suggests customers are using Wing’s drone delivery service enough to warrant growth. Rivera said its top 25% customers are using the service three times a week. Some of the most commonly ordered items are eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, avocados, limes, lunchables, and snacks such as Takis.\nThe 150-store expansion announcement follows plans shared in June 2025 to launch in Houston, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte. Rivera said Wing will launch in Houston on January 15. Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.\nThe announcement places the former Google X project firmly in the commercial enterprise category. And while Wing does have a partnership with DoorDash, its primary path to commercial operations has been, and still is, through Walmart.\nThe companies first partnered in 2023, launching a pilot program to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes. The program later grew to 18 Walmart Supercenters in Dallas-Fort Worth and more recently spread to stores in Atlanta.\nWing will continue to evolve its technology and operations, according to Rivera; the company recently completed the first commercial flights for its larger aircraft that can carry a five-pound payload, for instance.

The deals have to be approved by the bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of Texas before they are finalized. \nLuminar founder and former CEO Austin Russell has signaled interest in submitting a bid for the lidar assets and tried to buy the whole company in October, before it filed for bankruptcy. The company is currently trying to serve him with a subpoena for information stored on his cell phone, as Luminar evaluates whether it wants to make any legal claims against him related to the board-run ethics inquiry that led to his resignation last May. It’s not known how many other bids Luminar might receive by Monday’s deadline.\nQuantum Computing Inc. has been designated as a “stalking horse bidder,” which helps establish a baseline for the value of the assets and helps prevent low-ball bids. Luminar has said it wants to move through the bankruptcy case quickly, as its largest creditors — mostly financial institutions that loaned the company money over the last few years — are helping fund the proceedings.\nEven if Luminar receives a higher offer, the stalking horse bid represents a monumental fall from the company’s peak market cap in 2021, when it was worth around $11 billion. That valuation was propped up by the promise that Luminar’s lidar sensors were going to become widely adopted by major automakers like Volvo, which at one point planned to buy more than 1 million of them before ultimately walking away from the deal in 2025. Other deals with Mercedes-Benz and Polestar fell apart along the way, too. \nQuantum Computing Inc. was founded in 2001 as a company called Ticketcart that sold ink-jet cartridges, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It bought a beverage company in 2007, went through its own restructuring process ten years later, and pivoted to making optic technology for the budding world of quantum computing. The company raised more than $700 million by selling shares in 2025, though its revenue for the first nine months of last year was just $384,000.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAfter five years of building an edtech company, Nathan Nwachuku, 22, realized that Africa was at a crossroads. The continent is undergoing rapid industrialization, he told TechCrunch. There is money, opportunity, and a young, driven population. He figured, soon enough, the continent was on the “edge of an industrial revolution.” \n“At the same time,” he said, he felt the continent still struggled to address what was one of its biggest Achilles heels. “Terrorism and insecurity.” Africa has more terror-related deaths than any region in the world, and it is this problem that could slow down — or even stop completely — the growth of the region, Nwachuku said. \nHe teamed up with a friend, Maxwell Maduka, 24, and launched Terra Industries, a defense company that designs infrastructure and autonomous systems to help governments and organizations monitor and respond to threats. The company announced Monday that it emerged from stealth with a $11.75 million round led by Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC. \nOthers in the round include Valor Equity Partners, Lux Capital, SV Angel, and Nova Global. The company previously raised an $800,000 pre-seed round, and Nwachuku said others took much interest in the company after it appeared on CNN. African investors in the company include Tofino Capital, Kaleo Ventures, and DFS Lab. \n“The goal is to build Africa’s first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks,” Nwachuku, the company’s CEO, said. Maduka serves as the company’s CTO. \nThe team is stacked with military experience: 40% of its engineers held the same role in the Nigerian military; 8VC’s Alex Moore, who specializes in defense investing, is also on the board, and Nigeria’s Vice Air Marshal Ayo Jolasinmi serves as an advisor. Maduka also served as an enginner in the Nigerian Navy and founded a drone company at 19. \nThe company, based in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, took a multi-domain approach to product development, considering how to protect critical infrastructure from the ground, water, and air. For the air, the company produces long-range and short-range drones. On the ground, it has surveillance towers and ground drones. The company is still working on developing maritime technology to help protect infrastructure such as offshore rigs and underwater pipelines. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTerra powers its tech with its proprietary software, ArtemisOS, which collects, analyzes, and synthesizes data in real time. Once threats are spotted, they alert response forces (such as security agencies) so they can intercept them. “We want to geofence all of Africa’s critical infrastructure and resources,” Nwachuku said, adding that the problem is not lack of firepower (many African armies already have that).\nInstead, it’s a lack of sovereign intelligence, as much of the intelligence that African countries depend on comes from Western powers, China, and Russia. \n“We want to take the defense of our continent’s resources and infrastructure into Africa’s own hands,” Nwachuku continued. “We are the first truly Pan-African defense company.” \nTerra recently won its first federal contract, though it said it cannot provide more details. The company makes money when governments and commercial customers place orders for Terra systems and then pay an annual fee for data processing and storage. Nwachuku said the company has generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue so far and is protecting assets valued at around $11 billion. \nCommercial revenue comes from protecting private infrastructure, like gold mines or power plants. Terra said it is protecting at least two hydro power plants and several smaller mines, with most of the company’s clientele coming from Nigeria. \nThe company hopes to use the fresh capital to help expand and build more defense factories across Africa. It also wants to further expand its software capabilities and grow its AI team. It will open software offices in San Francisco and London, but the company said manufacturing will remain in Africa, with more factories opening across the continent to boost job creation. \n“It’s clear Africa today is undergoing what I see as an epic struggle for its very survival,” Nwachuku said. “The only way for us to truly break ourselves from the shackles that have held us back for the last decade or two is ensuring the core resources, the core infrastructures of the continent, are entirely protected.”\n",

    "body": "\nOfficials from Indonesia and Malaysia have said they are temporarily blocking access to xAI’s chatbot Grok.\nThese are the most aggressive moves so far from government officials responding to a flood of sexualized, AI-generated imagery — often depicting real women and minors, and sometimes depicting violence — posted by Grok in response to requests from users on the social network X. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)\nIn a statement shared Saturday with the Guardian and other publications, Indonesia’s communications and digital minister Meutya Hafid said, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.”\nThe ministry has also reportedly summoned X officials to discuss the issue.\nThe New York Times said the Malaysian government announced a similar ban on Sunday.\nVaried governmental responses over the past week include an order from India’s IT ministry for X to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content, as well as an order from the European Commission for the company to retain all documents related to Grok, potentially setting the stage for an investigation.\nIn the United Kingdom, the communications regulator Ofcom has said that it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview Ofcom that has his “full support to take action.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnd while in the United States, the Trump administration appears to be staying silent on the issue (xAI CEO Elon Musk is a major Trump donor and led the administration’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency last year), Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores.\nxAI initially responded by posting a seemingly first-person apology to the Grok account, acknowledging that a post “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” around child sexual abuse material. It later restricted the AI image-generation feature to paying subscribers on X, though that restriction did not appear to affect the Grok app itself, which still allowed anyone to generate images.\nIn response to a post wondering why the U.K. government wasn’t taking action against other AI image generation tools, Musk wrote, “They want any excuse for censorship.”\nThis post was first published on January 11. It has been updated to reflect Malaysia’s ban on Grok.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nThe nuclear industry is in the mist of a renaissance. Old plants are being refurbished, and investors are showering startups with cash. In the last several weeks of 2025 alone, nuclear startups raised $1.1 billion, largely on investor optimism that smaller nuclear reactors will succeed where the broader industry has recently stumbled.\nTraditional nuclear reactors are massive pieces of infrastructure. The newest reactors built in the U.S. — Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia —  contain tens of thousands of tons of concrete, are powered by fuel assemblies 14 feet tall, and generate over 1 gigawatt of electricity each. But they were also eight years late and more than $20 billion over budget.\nThe fresh crop of nuclear startups hopes that by shrinking the reactor, they’ll be able to sidestep both problems. Need more power? Just add more reactors. Smaller reactors, they argue, can be built using mass production techniques, and as companies produce more parts, they should get better at making them, which should drive down costs.\nThe magnitude of that benefit is something experts are still researching, but today’s nuclear startups are depending on it being greater than zero.\nBut manufacturing isn’t easy. Just look at Tesla’s experience: The company struggled mightily to profitably produce the Model 3 in large numbers — and it had the benefit of being in the automotive industry, where the U.S. still has significant expertise. U.S. nuclear startups don’t have that advantage.\n“I have a number of friends who work in supply chain for nuclear, and they can rattle off like five to ten materials that we just don’t make in the United States,” Milo Werner, general partner at DCVC, told TechCrunch. “We have to buy them overseas. We’ve forgotten how to make them.”\nWerner knows a thing or two about manufacturing. Before becoming an investor, she worked at Tesla leading new product introduction, and before that, she did the same at FitBit, launching four factories in China for the wearables company. Today, in addition to investing at DCVC, Werner has co-founded the NextGen Industry Group, which works to advance the adoption of new technologies in the manufacturing sector.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen companies of any size want to manufacture something, they face two main challenges, Werner said. One is capital, which is often the biggest constraint since factories aren’t cheap. Fortunately for the nuclear industry, that shouldn’t pose much of a problem. “They’re awash in capital right now,” she said.\nBut the nuclear industry isn’t immune from the other challenge all manufacturers face, which is a lack of human capital. “We haven’t really built any industrial facilities in 40 years in the United States,” Werner said. As a result, we’ve lost the muscle memory. “It’s like we’ve been sitting on the couch watching TV for 10 years and then getting up and trying to run a marathon the next day. It’s not good.”\nAfter decades of offshoring, the U.S. lacks people experienced with both factory construction and operations. “There are for sure some people in the United States who have been doing this, but we don’t have the quantum of people that we need for everybody to have a full staff of seasoned manufacturing people.” She not just talking about machine operators, but everyone from factory floor supervisors all the way up to CFOs and board members.\nThe good news is that Werner sees a lot of startups, nuclear and otherwise, building early versions of their products in close proximity to their technical team. “That is pulling manufacturing in closer to the United States because it allows them to have that cycle of improvement.”\nTo reap the benefits of mass manufacturing, it’s helpful for startups of all stripes to start small and scale up. “Really leaning into modularity is very important for investors,” she said. The modular approach helps companies start producing small volumes early on so they can collect data on the manufacturing process. Ideally, that data will show improvement over time, which can put investors at ease. \nThe benefits of mass manufacturing don’t happen overnight. Companies will often forecast cost reductions that can result from learning through manufacturing, but it might take longer than they expect. “Often it takes years, like a decade, to get there,” Werner said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle today announced a new open standard, called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) for AI agent-based shopping, at the National Retail Federation (NRF) conference.\nThe standard, developed with companies like Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, and Walmart, lets agents work across different parts of customer buying processes, including discovery and post-purchase support. The core idea is that the standard could facilitate these various parts of the process instead of requiring connections with different agents.\nGoogle said that it also works with other agentic protocols, such as Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) — which Google announced last year — Agent2Agent (A2A), and Model Context Protocol (MCP). The company specified that Agents and Businesses can pick and choose specific extensions of the protocol that suits their needs.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe company said that it will soon use UCP for eligible Google product listings in AI mode in search and the Gemini apps to let shoppers check out directly from U.S.-based retailers while researching a product. Users will be able to pay using Google Pay and pass on the shipping information saved in the Google Wallet. Google said that it will soon support PayPal as a payment option.\n“This is one of the really exciting parts about agentic,” said Shopify CEO and founder Tobi Lutke. “It’s really good at finding people who have specific interests and finding the product that is just perfect for them. Like, I would have never searched for this product, but somehow it found me right on the other side. This kind of serendipity is where the best of commerce happens.”\nNotably, Shopify also unveiled a similar integration with Microsoft Copilot for shopping today to let customers check out easily within the conversational flow.\nIn another consumer-facing change, Google said it will now allow brands to offer a special discount to users while they are looking for a product recommendation when using the AI mode. For instance, if you are searching for a rug using a query like “I’m looking for a modern, stylish rug for a high-traffic dining room. I host a lot of dinner parties, so I want something that is easy to clean,” brands can set up their campaign in a way to offer you a discount at that moment. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits: Google\nThe company is also giving users new data attributes within the Merchant Center to have sellers feature their items better within AI search surfaces. Companies like PayPal and OpenAI are also working on having sellers be more discoverable in AI chatbot results. Startups like the prompting company are also working with merchants to have their products surface within AI answers.\nGoogle is now also allowing merchants to integrate a branded AI-powered Business Agent within Google Search to answer customer questions. The company noted that merchants like Lowe’s, Michael’s, Poshmark, and Reebok are already using this product. Competitors like Meta and Shopify have been exploring AI-powered tools for businesses for customer support and outreach.\nThe search giant also announced Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience (CX), a suite to handle shopping and customer service for retailers and restaurants. \nCompanies like Google, Amazon, Walmart, and OpenAI have been releasing new standards and products to infuse AI into every bit of shopping, both on the consumer and merchant side. Earlier in the month, Adobe noted that traffic driven to seller sites by generative AI grew by 693.4% during the holiday season, though the report didn’t specify how much of this traffic translated into sales. \nThe story has been updated to reflect that retailers can use AI agents inside Google Search \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA former SandboxAQ executive filed a wrongful termination suit last month filled with such scandalous allegations against the company’s famed CEO, Jack Hidary, that the plaintiff himself redacted the most salacious details. \nOn Friday, the company’s lawyers filed a blistering response, calling the former employee a “serial liar” and stating his lawsuit “asserts false claims for improper and extortionate purposes.”\nEven the visible portions of the lawsuit — which TechCrunch has obtained — contain eyebrow-raising allegations, should a court find them valid. (A copy of the lawsuit is available here.)\nThe case offers a rare inside look at how employee lawsuits can become a public airing of dirty laundry from otherwise opaque internal happenings, thanks to the ubiquitous private arbitration clauses in Silicon Valley employee agreements.\nThe suit was filed by Robert Bender in mid-December. Bender worked as Chief of Staff to Hidary from August 2024 through July 2025, the complaint states. He contends in his suit that he was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about a number of alleged incidents, some of which, he said, involved “sexual encounters” and others, he claims, that involved misleading financial information presented to investors. \nFor its part, SandboxAQ vehemently denies the allegations. The company’s lawyer Orin Snyder, a well-known partner at white shoe law firm Gibson Dunn, tells TechCrunch: “This case is a complete fabrication. We look forward to debunking these baseless allegations and exposing the lawsuit — as detailed in our answer — for what it is — an opportunistic and extortionate abuse of the judicial process.”\nWhat makes the case particularly notable is the number of Valley heavy hitters involved in SandboxAQ. The company is an AI quantum computing startup that began as a moonshot unit of Google parent company Alphabet, led at Google by Hidary. Hidary is also well-known in Silicon Valley as a longtime X Prize board member. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSandboxAQ was spun out of Alphabet into an independent company in March 2022 with Hidary as CEO and soon attracted big-name investors, including billionaire and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who invested and became the startup’s chairman. Other billionaire investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, venture capitalist Jim Breyer, and Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio. \nBender’s attorneys say in another court document that the redacted sections “describe sexual encounters and the physical condition of non-party individuals observed by Plaintiff during business travel.” In other words, the alleged incidents involve people who Bender is not suing. This is an unusual move — typically, it’s the party being sued that requests redactions, not the person making the allegations.\nVarious explanations exist for such a tactic, and TechCrunch couldn’t ascertain what the motivations are in this case. Generally speaking, the possibilities range from protecting innocent third parties who aren’t accused of wrongdoing, to a shakedown strategy — signaling that more damaging details could emerge if the defendants don’t offer an acceptable settlement.\nThe unredacted portion of the suit provides a few more general details of the allegations that were hidden: Bender is alleging that Hidary used company resources and investor funds to “solicit, transport, and entertain female companions.” In an attached exhibit of a text message from Bender, he mentions prostitutes. \nBender further alleges in his suit that Hidary sold tens of millions of dollars worth of his stock at a premium price based on what Bender says were misleading figures presented to potential investors. He contends in the suit that revenue figures presented to the board were 50% lower than the figures shown in presentations to prospective investors. \nSandboxAQ’s lawyers vigorously contest all of the above. “The Company did not make fraudulent disclosures to investors regarding its tender offer or otherwise. The CEO did not misuse corporate assets. Plaintiff invented these inflammatory allegations to manufacture statutory claims and to insulate himself from the consequences of his own misconduct.”\nBender, for his part, alleges that the company has been trying to smear him. His complaint asserts that he brought his lawsuit, “only because his termination was followed by a malicious scorched earth campaign to destroy his reputation.”\nWhile the validity of any of these allegations is for a jury to decide, many of his claims echo an investigative report on SandboxAQ published by The Information in July.  \nSources told The Information that Hidary was using company resources to fly women he was dating on corporate jets, and that the company’s revenues were far below its projections. Bender references The Information story in his lawsuit but denies he was a source for it. SandboxAQ claims he was a source and is lying about his involvement. (A copy of SandboxAQ’s full corporate response, including more allegations about the employee, can be found here.) \nDespite any controversies, big-name investors were eager to invest in the company last year. In April, SandboxAQ raised over $450 million in a Series E funding round from Ray Dalio, Horizon Kinetics, BNP Paribas, Google, and Nvidia. \nSandboxAQ also announced a $90 million secondary sale. SandboxAQ has raised $1 billion total, it says, and is valued at $5.75 billion, according to PitchBook estimates.\n",

    "body": "\nFrench defense tech company Harmattan AI is rising almost as fast as the supersonic planes of its new backer. Founded in 2024, the company is now valued at $1.4 billion after raising a $200 million Series B round led by Dassault Aviation, which is best known for making the Rafale fighter jet.\nHarmattan AI, which builds autonomy and mission-system software for defense aircraft, had already received strong validation signals from the French and British ministries of defense in its less than two years of existence. But this funding and the accompanying partnership will give new wings to a company that once described itself as a “European Anduril.”\nLike its American peer, Harmattan AI once aspired to overtake defense incumbents, which are also known as primes. But the company is now also ready to partner with them — even if it means no longer calling itself “a next-generation defense prime.”\nAccording to Harmattan’s latest press release, the now “defense technology company” will help Dassault Aviation shape the future of air combat by developing embedded AI capabilities for its next generations of Rafales and drones while making sure this implementation is both sovereign and scalable.\nThe use of drones in Ukraine has been a wake-up call for NATO armies, creating tailwinds for defense tech startups that can help them adapt. According to Harmattan AI, which recently partnered with Ukrainian drone maker Skyeton, the funding will help it extend its product offering into new domains and scale manufacturing of its platforms for drone interception, electronic warfare and ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance].\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron praised the announcement on social media, calling it “excellent news for our strategic autonomy, for the technological superiority of our armed forces in the field of AI-activated defense drones, as well as for our economy.”\nWhile important for France, this strategic play isn’t exclusive. Harmattan AI’s stated goal of “empowering the armed forces of liberal democracies and their allies” leaves some wiggle room for the company to sell its technology beyond France and Europe. The company is already putting this into action: it will exhibit at the World Defense Show in Riyadh next month, and is expanding its U.S. team. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company claimed a new record in July when it was awarded a “multi-million-U.S. dollar contract by a NATO government” for the delivery of AI-enabled small drones, just one year after its founding. But according to its CEO and co-founder, Mouad M’Ghari, Harmattan AI is now “entering a new phase of scale” as it seeks to “ramp-up manufacturing.”\nIn that same LinkedIn post, the entrepreneur disclosed that the new funding comes in addition to the $42 million Harmattan AI had raised to date, including a seed round led by Atlantic and a Series A led by FirstMark, with other backers including Motier Ventures and Sisyphus Ventures.\nMeanwhile, Harmattan AI’s CTO and co-founder Martin de Gourcuff chose a different note with political undertones. “As the international order goes off the rails,” he wrote, “we are entering an era where, increasingly, power precedes law. A reversal of the civilized world we strive for. Harmattan AI exists to protect our values and flip that relationship back, as power without law is just mere violence.”\nThis story was updated to correct Skyeton’s origins.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

Both companies, along with other large tech employers, issued similar warnings in September when the White House announced that employers would have to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

    "body": "\nRocket Lab has won an $816 million contract — its largest to date — with the U.S. Space Development Agency as the company continues to diversify beyond its “rocket company” label.\nThe company said Friday that its subsidiary, Rocket Lab USA, was awarded a prime contract by the Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and manufacture 18 satellites. The satellites will be equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors for the agency’s Tracking Layer Tranche 3 program.\nThis contract is separate from an existing $515 million award to deliver satellites for the SDA’s Transport Layer-Beta Tranche 2 program. That program aims to provide a satellite communications network in low Earth orbit that sends encrypted, low-latency data to the military.\nTogether, Rocket Lab has SDA contracts valued at more than $1.3 billion.\nRocket Lab has expanded into defense and has more recently said it would bid for multibillion-dollar Department of Defense initiatives like Golden Dome.\n\n\tTopics\n",

The output of code generated by AI is often buggy, forcing engineers to spend a lot of time on corrections. Even though Cursor offers AI-powered code review through its Bugbot product, Graphite’s specialized toolset provides a distinct capability called a “stacked pull request,” which enables developers to work on multiple dependent changes simultaneously without waiting for approvals.\nCombining AI-powered code writing with AI-powered code review tools speeds up the process from drafting code to shipping it.\nOther startups providing AI-powered code review include CodeRabbit, valued at $550 million in September, and a smaller competitor, Greptile, which announced a $25 million Series A this fall.\nMichael Truell, co-founder and CEO of Cursor, first met Graphite’s co-founders, Merrill Lutsky, Greg Foster, and Tomas Reimers, before launching the company as a Neo Scholar, a prestigious program for college students run by Neo, Ali Partovi’s early-stage venture firm. Neo backed Graphite at the seed stage, according to PitchBook data.\nFurthermore, both Cursor and Graphite have other investors in common, including Accel and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCursor, which was last valued at $29 billion in November, has been on an acquisition spree.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6:00 AM PST · December 22, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nTikTok Shop has rolled out a new feature that allows users to purchase digital gift cards, making it easier to help friends and family buy from the millions of products on the app.\n​The feature was strategically launched during the holiday season — a high-stakes period for the company’s shopping division as it aims to prove its value in the market. ​This move into digital gifting positions TikTok Shop to compete more directly with e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay, both of which offer gift card options. TikTok Shop has also recently expanded into luxury retail, another move to solidify its footing in e-commerce.\nUsers can load the gift cards with anything from $10 to $500. What sets these cards apart is the ability to personalize them using a wide variety of animated designs. There are also animations for thank you cards, birthdays, weddings, and other occasions.\nGift cards are delivered via email, and recipients must have a TikTok account. Once redeemed, the card’s value is instantly credited to their TikTok Balance. Recipients can reply with a thank-you note or even send a gift card in return.\nHowever, the gift cards can only be purchased in the U.S. for now.\nImage Credits:TikTok Shop\nTikTok said it plans to add features that let users personalize gift cards more. By early 2026, users will be able to record or upload video messages to attach to their digital gift cards. A company spokesperson said the experience will also include an “interactive unboxing that captures their reaction in real-time,” but declined to share further details.\nThe launch of digital gift cards comes on the heels of a significant milestone for TikTok Shop: Over the four days of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the app recorded sales of more than $500 million in the U.S.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHowever, despite this achievement, TikTok Shop faces uncertainty as the sale of the app’s U.S. operations to an American investor group looms. If a sale doesn’t occur, TikTok faces a potential ban in the country. President Trump has extended the deadline to January 23, 2026, leaving the app’s future in the U.S. hanging in the balance.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

It wasn’t until late Sunday afternoon that Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement that the company was resuming service.\n“Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,” the spokesperson said. “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.”\nThe Waymo spokesperson added that the company is “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.”\n\nThe blackout also took down many of the city’s traffic lights and affected Muni mass transit, with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie warning residents to stay off the roads unless they needed to travel.\nWaymo said that although its self-driving systems are designed to treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops, the scale of Saturday’s blackout caused some robotaxis to remain stationary for longer than normal as they tried to assess the intersections. The company also said that the majority of active trips were completed successfully.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe blackout appears to have been caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation in the city. SFGate reports that around 120,000 PG&E customers were affected by the blackout, and while the majority of them had power restored by late Saturday, 35,000 customers were still without power on Sunday morning. PG&E’s website also showed thousands of San Francisco customers still affected at that time.\nA letter from Tiger Global Management that leaked earlier this month said Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week, nearly double the amount that the Alphabet-owned company disclosed in the spring.\nThis post has been updated with Waymo’s statement that service is resuming.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Rivian\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2:13 PM PST · December 19, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFormer Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario is resigning from her position on Rivian’s board of directors, according to a Friday afternoon stock exchange filing.\nRivian wrote in the filing that Marcario’s last day will be on January 1, and that she is leaving “to focus on other commitments.” Rivian’s board will shrink from eight members to seven upon her resignation. \nMarcario’s departure and the downsizing of Rivian’s board comes on the eve of an important year for the company. Rivian plans to start selling its more affordable R2 SUV in the first half of 2026. The upcoming R2 is supposed to reach a much wider market than the company’s current R1 SUV and pickup truck and the EV maker has plans to make hundreds of thousands of them per year, including at a new factory in Georgia. Rivian is also looking to expand its automated driving features next year, which it detailed at last week’s inaugural Autonomy & AI Day event.\nMarcario has served on Rivian’s board since January 2021, a role she took after 12 years as an executive (and eventual CEO) of Patagonia. Before her appointment, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe often described his aim for the company to become “the Patagonia of EVs.” \nRivian said Friday that Marcario will continue her role as chair of the board of trustees overseeing the Rivian Foundation. She serves on that board alongside Scaringe, Rivian’s chief sustainability officer Anisa Kamadoli Costa, and conservationist Ed M. Norton.\nFormed just before the company’s blockbuster 2021 IPO, the Rivian Foundation was initially handed 1% of the company’s equity in order to make “the natural world” a “stakeholder in [Rivian’s] success.” The foundation remained quiet for the first few years as Rivian’s stock price fell from its post-IPO highs, and announced its first $10 million in grants in 2024. \nThis year, the Rivian Foundation has publicized another $2.6 million in awards on its website.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We would like to thank her for her stewardship on the Rivian board over the past 5 years, and look forward to her continued leadership on the Rivian Foundation,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nInvestors at TechCrunch Disrupt did not shy away from admitting they are interested in mainly one thing: artificial intelligence.  \nNina Achadjian from Index, Jerry Chen from Greylock, and Peter Deng from Felicis all spoke about the latest obsession in venture capital and how startups can stand out in a quickly crowding market. The environment is moving fast, Achadjian told the crowd, and companies are experiencing unprecedented growth.  \n“We spend an enormous, enormous amount of time really assessing the entrepreneur and how resilient they will be able to be in a moment where things are just rapidly changing,” Achadjian said. Now more than ever, founders have to lean into showing their passion and domain expertise, and remain honest about their product market fit, she said.  \n“There is so much demand from enterprise companies to try the latest and greatest AI, sometimes there’s false positives of product market fit,” she explained, “and you can get a lot of revenue with not having true ROI,” meaning customers who are getting their return on investment.  \nThat leads another consideration VCs are looking for: an ability to pivot as the market twists and turns. “There’s a joke that, like, 1,000 startups die and that’s why being resilient is really important,” Achadjian continued.  \nDeng, who used to work at OpenAI, added to Achadjian’s statements. He said founders need to find their unique data flywheels that are going to separate them from the hordes of everyone pitching the exact same idea, especially since the enterprise companies likely testing their products are also testing out a few other competitors at the same time. \n“If you’re able to go deep and really solve a true need for them,” in a way they cannot do themselves, then managing data is “where the important part is,” he said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFounders should also have an answer for why their product will not just be a feature added into the foundational models, Achadjian said. It may be okay if a founder doesn’t know if the model makers are working on a competor but they should have a hypothesis on how the business is defensible when pitching investors.  \nRight now, what’s working in AI seems to be three things, Chen noted: Chat apps, coding apps, and AI in customer service. But there is still so much more change to happen throughout every sector and industry.\nDeng is excited by AI-enabled marketplaces. Achadjian, meanwhile, thinks that this could be the moment for robotics, while Chen is curious to see how AI impacts SaaS and othermarkets not yet directly impacted.\nAs for what’s not AI and exciting? “Pen and paper processes and digitize them,” Achadjian said. There’s a lot of blue-collar industries that, incredibly, still do many processes manually, she continued. But, they acknowledged even that is ripe for the opportunity to be automated by AI. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIn just about a week, iRobot, Luminar, and Rad Power Bikes all filed for bankruptcy.\nThey’re very different companies — selling Roombas, lidar, and e-bikes, respectively — but as Sean O’Kane, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed on the episode of the Equity podcast, they faced some similar challenges, including tariff pressures, major deals that fell through, and a failure to establish themselves beyond the products that first made them successful.\nYou can read an edited preview of our conversation below, with Sean providing an overview of each filing, Rebecca weighing in on whether she has a Roomba, and me speculating about what the popular narratives about these bankruptcies leave out.\nSean: Rad Power is big for an e-bike company, but small, I think, in most people’s minds, since that’s still a bit of a niche. They were founded a long time ago and became popular even before the pandemic, and really were thought of as an industry leader, as far as quality of the bikes that they’re making, pretty good branding and marketing and trying to connect with with customers — which is really hard to find in the world of e-bikes, where most of them are just like alphabet soup companies on Amazon. \nThey rode that wave in the pandemic up high as micromobility really took off, and people were really rethinking how they were getting around, they weren’t commuting into the office as much. And we get glimpses of that in the bankruptcy filings. It only shows revenue back three years, but they were pulling in well over $100 million in revenue in 2023 — like $123 million, I think that fell to about $100 [million] last year, and through the bankruptcy this year, they were only at about $63 million, so they were clearly coming down off a pretty big high. They have a pretty diverse product lineup, but they just never really found a way to establish a foothold there.\nAnd I think you could say similar things about these other two companies. Luminar is another company that was founded in the early 2010s, came out of stealth in 2017, and its mission was essentially to take lidar sensors, which at the time were really expensive and big and really only used in, like, defense applications and aerospace. 2017 was sort of the first big hype cycle of autonomous vehicles. They wanted to apply those sensors, make them more affordable for that use case. That helped them get some deals, most notably with Volvo, and then some other deals with Mercedes Benz, and a couple other players. But they were just heavily concentrated in that, and that was one of the reasons they wound up filing this week, too.\nAnd then iRobot [was] the most well known of these three companies — a lot of people listening probably even have a Roomba at home or something very like it. It’s just another one of these situations where iRobot became synonymous with a certain thing, and then the advances in the technology that build that product move so quickly that they wound up in a situation where they were looking for a way out. And we all saw this, they were trying to get acquired by Amazon, and that deal got blocked by the FTC and so here we are. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThey’re very different companies, but they all ran into similar problems. Do either of you guys have a Roomba?\nRebecca: No, I don’t have a Roomba. Those freak me out, but I bought my mom a Rad Power bike years ago, and she loves it. But now, you know, they had not only this bankruptcy issue, but they also had the issue with the batteries — they weren’t able to do their recalls because they were, like, “If we have to recall these bikes, we’re going to go bankrupt.” But they’re going bankrupt anyway! \nI’m curious about the tariff thing, and how much this affected everyone’s bottom lines. You hear a lot on social media, people who are pro merger, how certain FTC blockings of [mergers] leads to the companies going bankrupt, or getting acquired by a Chinese firm rather than an American firm. \nSean: iRobot represents, to me, the sort of macro global trade problem of, could you have ever built this company here in the United States with a localized supply chain over the last 15 years? Probably not. And so it makes sense that they became so heavily reliant on China — which, let’s be real, probably led to the ability for these other companies to pop up and essentially copy what they did. \nThat reminds me of in Trump 1, when he flipped on tariffs for Chinese imports, and we saw a bunch of startups like Boosted Boards and other ones in the micromobility space get hit. So they’re contributing factors, for sure. The battery recall with Rad Power absolutely was, I think, a bigger dagger at the end, but the tariff stuff put them on uneven footing that made it harder for them to respond to stuff like that.\nAnthony: A lot of times when a company fails, there [are] larger structural issues, and then there’s maybe a more immediate proximate issue. And particularly in the case of iRobot, I think that a lot of former executives and even outside commentators are pointing to this Amazon deal that was reached a few years ago — it kind of looked like the EU was not going to allow it to go through, and there is this sense of, “Okay, well, by blocking this deal, you’ve essentially put the dagger in their heart that eventually killed the company.”\nThat narrative also maybe ignores the fact that there were other things that caused them to want to get acquired in the first place.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nGovernor Kathy Hochul has signed the RAISE Act, positioning New York as the second U.S. state to enact major AI safety legislation.\nState lawmakers passed RAISE Act in June, but following lobbying from the tech industry, Hochul proposed changes to scale the bill back. The New York Times reports that Hochul ultimately agreed to sign the original bill, while lawmakers agreed to make her requested changes next year.\nThe bill will require large AI developers to publish information about their safety protocols and report safety incidents to the state within 72 hours. It will also create a new office within the Department of Financial Services to monitor AI development.\nIf companies fail to submit safety reports or make false statements, they can be fined up to $1 million ($3 million for subsequent violations).\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed a similar safety bill in September, which Hochul referenced in her announcement.\n“This law builds on California’s recently adopted framework, creating a unified benchmark among the country’s leading tech states as the federal government lags behind, failing to implement common-sense regulations that protect the public,” Hochul said.\nState Senator Andrew Gounardes, one of the bill’s sponsors, posted, “Big Tech thought they could weasel their way into killing our bill. We shut them down and passed the strongest AI safety law in the country.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBoth OpenAI and Anthropic expressed support for New York’s bill while also calling for federal legislation, with Anthropic’s head of external affairs Sarah Heck telling the NYT, “The fact that two of the largest states in the country have now enacted AI transparency legislation signals the critical importance of safety and should inspire Congress to build on them.”\nNot everyone in the tech industry has been so supportive. In fact, a super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman is looking to challenge Assemblyman Alex Bores, who co-sponsored the bill with Gounardes. (Bores told journalists, “I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it.”)\nThis comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that directs federal agencies to challenge state AI laws. The order — backed by Trump’s AI czar David Sacks — is the latest attempt by the Trump Administration to curtail states’ ability to regulate AI, and will likely be challenged in court.\nWe also discussed Trump’s executive order, and the role that Sacks and a16z have played in opposing state AI regulation, on the latest episode of the Equity podcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nResolve AI, a startup developing an autonomous site reliability engineer (SRE), a tool that automatically maintains software systems, has raised a Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to three people familiar with the deal.\nThe headline valuation for the fresh round is $1 billion, sources said. However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.\nThe startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned. \nResolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment.\nFounded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019.\nWhile human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.\nThe automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast October, Resolve AI raised a $35 million seed round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean.\nResolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.  \n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

And this week on Build Mode, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen spoke to two founders who are working to make progress  in industries ripe for disruption, despite the regulatory headaches that might have deterred many other people.  \nIn this episode, we’re talking about life and death and how regulatory clearance doesn’t have to be a damper on innovation but it will elongate timelines and require careful planning from the jump.  \nIsabelle is first joined by Gabriel Sanchez, the CEO and co-founder of Enspectra Health. The company has built a device that aims to do away with the need for dermatologist skin biopsies. Sanchez breaks down his decade-long journey to receiving FDA clearance. Throughout the interview, Sanchez offers tactical advice to anyone in the midst of a long regulatory process and explains how he’s kept his company afloat and his team motivated despite the uncertainties.  \nNext, Isabelle speaks with Tom Harries, the co-founder of Earth Funeral, an end-of-life startup that has developed a new process that transforms human remains into soil. Harries didn’t have to lead his team through a long FDA approval process (because the FDA is primarily concerned with the living), but his company has faced its own legislative challenges. Earth Funeral launched at a time when its alternative process was only legal in one state. And though its path to expansion doesn’t hinge on accreditation or approval from a government agency, it does depend on legislative bodies and voters who may be discomforted by a new way to lay a loved one to rest. \nNew episodes of Build Mode drop every Thursday. Subscribe to the podcast or watch on YouTube.

The $1 trillion compensation package awarded to Musk in November is separate from that, and will continue to exist going forward, giving Musk a series of lofty goals to hit in order to unlock the full value.\nThe 2018 award also set out a number of milestones that Musk had to hit in order to unlock the full value. Musk and Tesla hit all of those goals, but not before a shareholder filed suit over the award in 2018, arguing that it had been improperly negotiated and that shareholders weren’t properly informed of the conflicts of interest at play.\nMusk and the many Tesla supporters decried the lawsuit as absurd, particularly the fact that the plaintiff — a former corporate defense lawyer and heavy metal drummer named Richard Tornetta — only owned nine shares of company stock.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAfter years of back-and-forth, including a trial where Musk testified, the Chancery Court judge overseeing the case agreed with the plaintiff and initially struck down the pay package in January 2024. Tesla held a vote at its annual meeting in 2024 where shareholders “re-approved” the package, but the judge confirmed her decision in December 2024. Tesla appealed soon after.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nYears ago, when venture capitalist Jon Medved took an interest in backing various health tech startups, he had no idea that one day, he would need them to improve his own quality of life. \nIsrael tight-knit startup community received a blow in October when Medved, one of its most famous VCs, announced he was retiring immediately. He was forced to step down from the firm he founded, OurCrowd, after he was diagnosed with the debilitating disease of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS,) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. \n“This has come rather sudden,” he told TechCrunch in an audibly hoarse voice — a symptom of ALS — on what could be his last interview. \n“I had been feeling a little weird before and they didn’t know what was ailing me,” he explained. “I was in the hospital for several weeks recovering, and that’s when they tested me and said, ‘You’ve got ALS,’ which is a horrible disease, the worst you can imagine.”  \nALS is a condition that degrades the brain’s motor neurons, leading to loss of muscle control, eventually impairing walking, talking, eating, and breathing. He didn’t have the classic symptoms, as his voice was attacked first, not his extremities, he said. But he knows that the condition will worsen, and there is no cure, only therapies. \nMedved is considered one of the fathers of Israel’s startup ecosystem — often called “Startup Nation” after the decades-old best-selling book of the same name. He helped usher it in, having moved from California to Israel in his 20s, then founding and selling several tech companies before turning to investing.  \nIn 2013, he founded OurCrowd. While Israel has many powerful home-grown VC firms, as well as branches of global firms like Bessemer, OurCrowd essentially invented crowdsourced venture capital, where a limited partnership was open to any accredited investor. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm’s roster attracted LPs from Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America, growing a network of 240,000 accredited investor LPs in 195 countries, the firm says. Many of them are doctors, lawyers, and ordinary people who not only help their investment companies, but would have otherwise been cut out of the wealth generation that VCs experience. \nOurCrowd has backed names like Anthropic, Beyond Meat and Lemonade. \nMedved describes OurCrowd as now a “significant player” backing about 500 portfolio companies with about 74 exits, including an exit a couple of weeks ago when its infrastructure planning startup Locusview sold for $525 million to Itron. \nDespite Israel’s conflict with Gaza, which has impacted its citizens and put the nation in global crosshairs over the Palestinian humanitarian crisis, its startup ecosystem has remained strong.  \nAs the “startup nation,” Israel remains a key player for cybersecurity and defense tech as well as AI, microchips, enterprise software, food tech, health tech — the whole tech stack. For example, in November, there was “$800 million invested in the Israeli venture ecosystem in one week,” Medved said. The country now has nearly 100 unicorns and over the year, he estimates that between $15 billion and $16 billion was invested in the country in venture deals. \nNow the tech of some of these startups will help him navigate life with an incurable condition. \nFor instance, he’s had an avatar made of himself that preserves his voice, face and mannerisms. (The photo/video realistic digital twin is pictured and the full video can be seen here.) OurCrowd AI portfolio company D-ID, maker of agents and avatars, partnered with voice AI startup ElevenLabs and other companies through the ALS-focused Scott-Morgan Foundation to create an avatar system designed for people with ALS.\nHe just experienced this tech during a Zoom call with another person who has ALS who was using the avatar to communicate. \n“So this stuff has become very, very personal to me,” Medved said. “It will preserve my voice when it goes.” \nBut he said there will be a variety of startups tech he will lean on. \n“We’ve made 60, 70 healthcare investments in good companies that help people. We’ve got a company called OncoHost, which uses AI to help select what kind of immunotherapy will actually work for you …  We have companies doing next-generation sequencing for the genome. We have companies doing chronic condition management,” he catalogs. \n“I tell you now as a once-healthy person [who took health for granted] I felt human pain and disease, but once you are actually engaged in one of these nasty diseases, it changes your perspective,” Medved shared.  \nAll of this means that, even though he’s given up his position running the company and may be retiring from the public eye, “I’m far from over, ok? I want to continue to contribute, both to OurCrowd and the overall ecosystem. So I fully intend to not go off [quietly] into this good night.” \nAnd in the end, he says “I’m very proud that in a small way, even though all we are is investors, to be part of this movement.”A video featuring Medved’s “digital twin” demonstrates just how realistic his avatar already is.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nThe future may be electric, but that future is being postponed. The European Commission, citing the need for flexibility, has softened its ambitious plan to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.\nInstead of requiring 100% of new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by that date, the revised plan would allow 10% of new car sales to be hybrids or other vehicles as long as manufacturers purchase carbon offsets to compensate. This change is part of a broader ‘Automotive Package‘ designed to help the European car industry become both clean and competitive.\nIf the European Parliament approves this shift, it would likely satisfy traditional European carmakers that have been asking for more time to move beyond hybrid vehicles. These companies are struggling to compete with Tesla and the surge of affordable electric vehicles (EVs) coming from China. But the policy change has created division among EV startups and their investors.\n“China already dominates EV manufacturing,” said Craig Douglas, a partner at World Fund, a European climate-focused venture capital firm. “If Europe doesn’t compete with clear, ambitious policy signals, it will lose leadership of another globally important industry — and all the economic benefits that come with it.”\nDouglas was among the signatories of “Take Charge Europe,” an open letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that was published in September. Senior executives from companies including Cabify, EDF, Einride, Iberdrola, and numerous EV-related startups signed the letter, exhorting the Commission to “stand firm” on the original 2035 zero-emission target.\nTheir appeal wasn’t enough to counter pressure from the traditional automobile industry, which represents 6.1% of total European Union employment. But continuing pressure has sparked debate within the startup community and beyond about the best path for Europe if it’s to remain competitive during the energy transition.\nIndustry split on timeline\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEven within the auto industry, opinions differ. In a statement to Swedish media, a Volvo press officer warned that “backing down on long-term commitments in favor of short-term gains risks undermining Europe’s competitiveness for many years to come.”\nUnlike Mercedes-Benz and other manufacturers, the Swedish carmaker had no concerns about meeting the 2035 ban. Rather than postponing the deadline, Volvo would have preferred to see increased investment in expanding charging infrastructure — something critics fear the new policy could actually discourage.\nIssam Tidjani, CEO of Cariqa, a Berlin-based EV charging marketplace startup, echoed these concerns. He cautioned that weakening the 2035 zero-emission mandate could harm electrification progress overall. “History shows that this kind of flexibility has never worked out well,” said Tidjani, who also signed the Take Charge Europe letter this fall. “It delays scale, weakens learning curves, and ultimately costs industrial leadership rather than preserving it.”\nTo be fair, the Commission hasn’t completely ignored infrastructure and supply chain issues. As part of its Automotive Package, it introduced the “Battery Booster,” a strategy that would invest €1.8 billion (about $2.11 billion) into developing a fully European-made battery supply chain. The goal is to strengthen local production and ensure supply security.\nThe plan received positive feedback from Verkor, a French startup that produces lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. The company, hoping to succeed where Swedish battery maker Northvolt struggled, opened its first large-scale battery factory in Northern France this week. Verkor called the Booster initiative “a necessary step to scale up Europe’s battery industry.”\nMixed signals\nStill, many question whether the Battery Booster is enough to offset what they see as negative signaling about the EU’s commitment to using decarbonization as an economic growth driver.\nAlready, traditional carmakers have begun complaining that the carbon offset requirements could make cars more expensive for consumers, potentially undermining the very competitiveness the policy change was meant to protect.\nAnother uncertainty involves the United Kingdom. It’s unclear whether the U.K. will follow the EU’s lead and modify its own 2035 combustion engine ban. Unlike both the European Union and the United States, the U.K. hasn’t yet imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, despite that their rapidly increasing sales in the British market have raised concerns among domestic manufacturers.\nThe debate highlights ongoing tensions in climate policy between how to balance the economic realities facing existing industries with the urgency of transitioning to cleaner tech. As Europe tries to thread this needle, the decisions made now will invariably impact whether the continent leads or lags in the global EV market.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

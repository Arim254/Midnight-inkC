    "body": "\nChris Sacca’s venture firm Lowercarbon Capital is raising a second fund to back nuclear fusion energy hopefuls, the VC said at the SOSV Climate Tech Summit on Thursday, as reported by Bloomberg.  \nThe firm has backed leading fusion startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems, as well as others like Pacific Fusion. It raised a $250 million, fusion-geared fund in 2022. Fusion believers, who include a number of well-known climate VCs beyond Sacca (like Vinod Khosla), still hold faith that a breakthrough needed to make it commercially viable is just around the corner. And several advances are showing promise of delivering one.\nIn the meantime, building fusion reactors is expensive. Commonwealth raised $863 million earlier this year, after raising a $1.8 billion Series B four years ago. TechCrunch has documented a dozen fusion startups that have raised over $100 million. \nSacca didn’t say how big this second fund will be, but a source told Bloomberg that it’s intended to be bigger than the first. \n",

    "body": "\nGrand Theft Auto VI, one of the most anticipated video games of all time, has been delayed, again — this time until November 19, 2026.\nThe game was initially slated for a fall 2025 release but was pushed back to May 2026. On Thursday, Rockstar Games announced that the development team needs another six months.\n“We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve,” Rockstar Games wrote in their statement.\nGrand Theft Auto VI is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto V, which was released in 2013. According to Guinness World Records, that game became the fastest entertainment property to reach $1 billion in sales, hitting the milestone after just three days on the market. Fans are so eager for the next installment in the franchise that when Rockstar Games released the trailer for the game in December 2023, it broke the record for the most YouTube views in 24 hours (excluding music videos).\nRockstar Games did not provide additional details about the delay. Last week, the company fired between 30 and 40 employees for allegedly sharing confidential information in a Discord server.\n",

In a Vanity Fair interview, Kim Kardashian — who has been studying to become a lawyer — discussed her “toxic” friendship with ChatGPT, admitting that she has failed law exams after it told her false information.\n“I use [ChatGPT] for legal advice, so when I am needing to know the answer to a question, I will take a picture and snap it and put it in there,” she said. “They’re always wrong. It has made me fail tests… And then I’ll get mad and I’ll yell at it and be like, ‘You made me fail!’” \nChatGPT is prone to hallucinations, meaning that the LLM will create fake answers sometimes, rather than admit that it cannot confidently respond to a prompt. This technology isn’t necessarily programmed to know what information is “correct” or not — rather, it is trained on an unfathomably massive heap of data and prompted to predict the most likely response to an input, which may not be factually accurate. Some lawyers have been sanctioned for using ChatGPT when writing legal briefs, which becomes obvious to those reviewing the briefs, since they cite cases that don’t exist.\nKardashian said she will try to appeal to ChatGPT’s emotions after it lets her down — but this is a futile plan, since ChatGPT does not have feelings.\n“I will talk to it and say, ‘Hey, you’re going to make me fail, how does that make you feel that you need to really know these answers?’” she said. “And then it’ll say back to me, ‘This is just teaching you to trust your own instincts.’”\nBut while ChatGPT may not have feelings, that doesn’t mean that we — human beings — don’t have feelings about it. \n“I screenshot all the time and send it to my group chat, like, ‘Can you believe this b—- is talking to me like this?’”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

In exchange, the recipients pledge to produce some final work product, whether it’s a startup, an open-source codebase, or another type of artifact.\nThe initial cohort is fifteen projects, with a particular focus on the difficult problem of AI evaluation. Some of those projects will be familiar to TechCrunch readers, including the command-line coding benchmark Terminal Bench and the latest version of the long-running ARC-AGI project.\nOthers take a fresh approach to a long-established evaluation problem. Formula Code, built by researchers at CalTech and UT Austin, aims to produce an evaluation of AI agents’ ability to optimize existing code, while the Columbia-based BizBench proposes a comprehensive benchmark for “white-collar AI agents.” Other grants explore new structures for reinforcement learning or model compression.\nSWE-Bench co-founder John Boda Yang is also part of the cohort, as leader of the new CodeClash project. Inspired by the success of SWE-Bench, CodeClash will assess code through a dynamic competition-based framework, which Yang hopes will make the results more comprehensive.\n“I do think people continuing to evaluate on core third-party benchmarks drives progress,” Yang told TechCrunch. “I’m a little bit worried about a future where benchmarks just become specific to companies.” \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

Symbiosis Coalition is similar to Frontier, an advance market commitment also backed by Google and others that supports direct air capture projects.\nNature-based carbon removal shows great promise in drawing down CO2 levels in the atmosphere, but projects have been challenging to develop and sell for a variety of reasons. Nature-based projects risk falling short of their goals if they’re damaged by wildfires or other disasters, and it can be challenging to guarantee their long-term viability.\nStill, they come with many upsides: Forests can replenish aquifers and support biodiversity, neither of which direct air capture can do. Google said it will use its DeepMind Perch AI to help quantify biodiversity benefits of the project.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Climate\n",

These fraudulent ads purport to offer a product or service that isn’t real and may be intended to solicit payments from less savvy users.\nImage Credits:Facebook (Screenshot by Reuters)\nMeta has a system for detecting the likelihood that an advertising campaign is a scam, but the company only deactivates an advertiser’s account if it is 95% sure that the advertiser is committing fraud. Otherwise, Meta will charge more money from advertisers that it suspects may be doing fraud as a way to discourage them from buying more advertising — but when those advertisers follow through anyway, it pads Meta’s bottom line.\nTechCrunch contacted Meta for comment but did not hear back before publication. Per Reuters’ report, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone claimed that the documents Reuters used “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams.”\nStone added that over the last 18 months, Meta has reduced user reports of scam ads by 58%, and the company has removed over 134 million scam ads from its platforms.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

In a lengthy post on X on Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly clarified the totals.\n“We expect to end this year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030. We are looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next 8 years,” he wrote.\nWhile the post was largely a response to a brouhaha over comments his CFO made, and quickly walked back, concerning government-backstopped loans, Altman also listed a number of future business plans he believes will generate significant revenue.\nHe said OpenAI has an upcoming enterprise offering. Earlier this week, OpenAI said it already had a million business customers.\nHe named consumer devices and robotics. In May, OpenAI acquired Jony Ive’s io, and they are reportedly working on a palm-sized AI device.\nAltman mentioned scientific discovery as an upcoming business. Not much is known about it yet, except that OpenAI VP Kevin Weil mentioned a newly launched OpenAI for Science some months ago.\nAltman also said OpenAI could become a cloud computing provider: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of ‘AI cloud’, and we are excited to offer this.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat’s a bold idea for a company that doesn’t yet have its own network of data centers.\nBeyond revenue, Altman noted that the company may also pay for its needs the old-fashioned way: selling more equity or taking on more loans.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\nThe U.S. Congressional Budget Office has confirmed it was hacked. \nCaitlin Emma, a spokesperson for CBO, told TechCrunch on Friday that the agency is investigating the breach and “has identified the security incident, has taken immediate action to contain it, and has implemented additional monitoring and new security controls to further protect the agency’s systems going forward.” \nCBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analysis and cost estimates to lawmakers during the federal budget process, including after legislative bills get approved at the committee level in the House and Senate. \nOn Thursday, The Washington Post, which first revealed the breach, reported that unspecified foreign hackers were behind the intrusion. According to the Post, CBO officials are worried that the hackers accessed internal emails and chat logs, as well as communications between lawmakers’ offices and CBO researchers. \nReuters reported that the Senate Sergeant at Arms office, the Senate’s law enforcement agency, notified congressional offices of a breach, warning them that emails between CBO and the offices could have been compromised and used to craft and send phishing attacks. \nIt’s unclear how the hackers gained access to the CBO’s network. But soon after news of the breach became public, security researcher Kevin Beaumont wrote on Bluesky that he suspected hackers may have exploited the CBO’s outdated Cisco firewall to break into the agency’s network.  \nLast month, Beaumont noted that CBO had a Cisco ASA firewall on its network that was last patched in 2024. At the time of his posting, the CBO’s firewall was allegedly vulnerable to a series of newly discovered security bugs, which were being exploited by suspected Chinese government-backed hackers.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBeaumont said the CBO’s firewall had not been patched by the time the federal government shutdown took effect on October 1. \nOn Thursday, Beaumont said that the firewall is now offline. \nThe CBO’s spokesperson declined to comment when asked about Beaumont’s findings.

    "body": "\nSecurity researchers have discovered an Android spyware that targeted Samsung Galaxy phones during a nearly year-long hacking campaign.\nResearchers at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 said the spyware, which they call “Landfall,” was first detected in July 2024 and relied on exploiting a security flaw in the Galaxy phone software that was unknown to Samsung at the time, a type of vulnerability known as a zero-day. \nUnit 42 said the flaw could be abused by sending a maliciously crafted image to a victim’s phone, likely delivered through a messaging app, and that the attacks may not have required any interaction from the victim. \nSamsung patched the security flaw — tracked as CVE-2025-21042 — in April 2025, but details of the spyware campaign abusing the flaw have not been previously reported.\nThe researchers said in a blog post that it’s not known which surveillance vendor developed the Landfall spyware, nor is it known how many individuals were targeted as part of the campaign. But the researchers said that the attacks likely targeted individuals in the Middle East.\nItay Cohen, a senior principal researcher at Unit 42, told TechCrunch that the hacking campaign consisted of a “precision attack” on specific individuals and not a mass-distributed malware, which indicates that the attacks were likely driven by espionage.\nUnit 42 found that the Landfall spyware shares overlapping digital infrastructure used by a known surveillance vendor dubbed Stealth Falcon, which has been previously seen in spyware attacks against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents as far back as 2012. But the researchers said that the links with Stealth Falcon, while intriguing, were not enough to clearly attribute the attacks to a particular government customer.\nUnit 42 said that the Landfall spyware samples that they discovered had been uploaded to VirusTotal, a malware scanning service, from individuals in Morocco, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey throughout 2024 and early 2025.\nTurkey’s national cyber readiness team, known as USOM, flagged one of the IP addresses that the Landfall spyware connected to as malicious, which Unit 42 said supports the theory that individuals in Turkey may have been targeted.\nMuch like other government spyware, Landfall is capable of broad device surveillance, such as accessing the victim’s data, including photos, messages, contacts, and call logs, as well as the tapping of the device’s microphone and tracking their precise location.\nUnit 42 found that the spyware’s source code referenced five specific Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S22, S23, S24, and some Z models, as targets. Cohen said that the vulnerability may have also been present on other Galaxy devices, and affected Android versions 13 through 15. \nSamsung did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAccel has invested in Rapido, the ride-hailing platform competing with Uber in India, while Prosus has increased its stake, after Indian two-wheeler giant TVS Motor sold its entire holding.\nOn Thursday, TVS Motor said in a stock exchange filing (PDF) that it has sold its entire stake in Rapido for ₹2.88 billion (about $32 million) to Accel and Prosus’ investment unit, MIH Investments, securing a return of more than 152% over the past three years.\nFounded in 2015, Rapido has grown into a major player in India’s ride-hailing market, competing with Uber, Ola, and inDrive. The company began with bike taxis before expanding into auto-rickshaw bookings and car services and has added courier services to its platform. It has more recently been piloting a food-delivery service in select cities, entering a segment dominated by Swiggy and Zomato.\nTVS Motor first invested in Rapido in April 2022 as part of the company’s $180 million Series D round, joining existing backers such as WestBridge Capital, Shell Ventures, and Nexus Venture Partners. The automaker bought its stake at that time for ₹1.14 billion, according to its earlier investor disclosures (PDF).\nAs part of the latest transaction, Accel purchased 11,997 preference shares in Rapido, while Prosus acquired 11,988 preference shares and 10 equity shares. Both investors paid about ₹1.44 billion (roughly $16 million) each.\nAccel’s backing of Rapido marks a return to India’s ride-hailing sector for the firm, which was an early investor in Ola. The move comes as Rapido is in talks with Accel and Prosus for a new primary funding round that could close next year, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to TechCrunch. The exact funding size has yet to be determined.\nProsus is already an investor in Rapido and expanded its stake through another secondary share sale in September, when Swiggy sold its entire holding. That transaction doubled Rapido’s valuation to $2.3 billion, TechCrunch reported.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccel and Prosus are also early backers of Swiggy, which exited Rapido after citing a potential conflict of interest, as the ride-hailing startup prepared to expand into the food-delivery market.\nAccel and Prosus did not respond to requests for comment.

    "body": "\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday the company will reveal the production version of its second-generation Roadster supercar on April 1, 2026 — nearly nine years after he first revealed the project.\nMusk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said during Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting that he chose April Fools’ Day in part because it affords “some deniability.” \n“Like, I could say I was just kidding” if it happens to be later, he said. \nRevealing the production version of the new Roadster next year is in itself a delay. Just one week ago he appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast and repeated his claim that he wanted to show off the car by year’s end. \nMusk stressed Thursday the car “will be very different from what was shown previously,” and again teased that the demo will be the “most exciting, whether it works or not, demo ever of any product” — a not-so-sly nod to the fact that he’s spent years trying to make the new Roadster fly in some fashion, possibly with SpaceX-built thrusters.\nMusk went on to say that he believes the second-generation Roadster won’t go into production until 12 to 18 months after the April reveal. \nDuring the Q&A portion of the meeting, one shareholder asked Musk if customers who preordered the “Founders Series” version of the new Roadsters could be invited to the reveal event. Those were the customers who plopped down $250,000 to secure special versions of the car in 2017.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Sure, absolutely,” Musk answered. “It’s the least we can do for our long-suffering Roadster reservation holders.”\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman was one of those long-time sufferers who recently attempted to cancel the reservation — and initially failed to get a refund — for the long-promised EV.\nEarlier this month, Altman posted on X a “tale in three acts,” which was comprised of several screenshots showing his initial reservation, a request for a refund of the $50,000 reservation fee, and his email bouncing back.\n“I really was excited for the car!” Altman wrote. “And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.”\nMusk, who has openly sparred with Altman for years, went on the attack. “And you forgot to mention act 4, where this issue was fixed and you received a refund within 24 hours,” Musk wrote. “But that is in your nature.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nOn Friday, Amazon announced the debut of Amazon Bazaar, a new low-cost shopping destination for Asia, Africa, and Latin America that will be available separately from the main Amazon shopping app. On Bazaar, most products are available under $10, and some are as low as $2, the retailer says.\nThe product selection, available now on Android and iOS, will be available in its own app that’s available in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Nigeria.\nAmazon says more markets will gain access to the app in the months ahead.\nThe app has significant overlap with Amazon Haul, which launched last November as a competitor to Shein and Temu. Haul operates as part of Amazon’s main website and app, and will remain available in its existing markets, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Australia.\nIn other markets, Amazon had already branded Amazon Haul as Bazaar, where it’s been available through Amazon’s main shopping app. That version also remains available in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, in addition to India. (Amazon using two names for the same low-cost selection of inventory is confusing! But Amazon thinks the different names “better resonate with local language preferences and cultures.”)\nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe move to create a standalone shopping destination for its cheaper inventory signals Amazon is ramping up the competition with the low-cost Chinese shopping apps, like Temu, Shein, and TikTok (TikTok Shop), which have seen broad adoption by younger users and others without as much disposable income to spend on clothing, decor, electronics, and other household items.\nThe Bazaar app will offer these users “hundreds of thousands” of affordable products in categories like fashion, home goods, and lifestyle products, the retailer says. Product pages feature familiar Amazon features like customer reviews and star ratings. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nCustomers use their same Amazon credentials to shop and check out, where they can use Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. Orders will have to meet the local minimum purchase amount to qualify for free shipping. (This varies by market.) For smaller orders, a standard delivery fee is charged. \nShipments take around 2 weeks or less, returns are free within 15 days of receipt, and Amazon offers multilingual customer support. The app itself supports six languages: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, and Traditional Chinese.\nThe app will also engage customers with interactive features like social lucky draws and promotions — things popularized by the Chinese shopping apps. New customers will also receive 50% off their first delivery as an incentive to try the app. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nParts of San Rafael, a city just north of San Francisco, are sinking about half an inch per year. That might not sound like much, but altogether, it has meant that some neighborhoods — like the Canal District that borders the bay — have sunk three feet, placing them at greater risk of flooding from sea-level rise.\nSan Rafael isn’t alone. Cities around the world are threatened by rising sea levels, with 300 million people at risk of routine flooding by 2050. The cost of building seawalls to hold the waters back could top $400 billion in the U.S. alone.\nA new startup is proposing an alternative: raise the city instead.\nTerranova is building robots that will inject a slurry of wood waste into the ground, slowly lifting the land to eliminate historical subsidence and, hopefully, prevent those parts of the city from flooding.\n“The canal district is really far under sea level,” Laurence Allen, co-founder and CEO of Terranova, told TechCrunch. The city has been working with flood consultants to find a solution, he said. \n“The answer, every answer every time, has been like $500 million to $900 million of seawalls, which if you’re from San Rafael, you know they’re not even close to being able to afford that. There’s about 60,000 people and a significant portion — surprisingly for a city in Marin — are living in poverty.”\nTerranova says it can protect San Rafael and other cities like it for a fraction of the cost. In San Rafael’s case, the startup has quoted $92 million to lift 240 acres four feet. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company recently raised $7 million in a seed round led by Congruent Ventures and Outlander with participation from GoAhead Ventures, Gothams, and Ponderosa, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The oversubscribed round values the company at $25.1 million.\nLifting land by injecting stuff underground isn’t new. Terranova’s pitch is that it has developed some novel approaches that make it cheaper.\nFirst is the material: Waste wood is inexpensive and easy to obtain. The startup mixes it with other materials that it wouldn’t disclose to turn it into a slurry. The result is pumped from a 20-foot shipping container to the second cost-saving item: a robotic injection device. The tracked robotic units autonomously rove around the work site, drilling wells through which the wood slurry is delivered to depths of around 40 to 60 feet.\nSo long as the slurry remains wet underground, the wood shouldn’t decay and the company can sell carbon credits to offset costs, Allen said.\nAll of this is managed by software that Terranova has developed. The company uses public geographic information coupled with data from cores drilled throughout the state of California, mostly taken during the construction of water wells. With that, it has created a model of the subsurface that informs injection patterns, which are determined by a genetic algorithm.\nOn the back end, city planners, contractors, and other stakeholders can use a SimCity-like tool to sculpt the virtual landscape.\nWhen plans are finalized, they guide the robotic injectors, telling them both where to inject and how much. Human operators remain on site as a safety precaution, Allen said. Once the robots are done injecting, it takes about two hours for the slurry to consolidate, he added.\nTerranova has been testing both the robots and software at a pilot site for over a year, he said.\nThough some experts have questioned whether the consolidated wood slurry will exacerbate earthquake shocks, Allen said the most frequently mentioned alternatives have risks, too. “We think it’ll help [with earthquakes] versus dikes and seawalls.”\nThe company plans to make money by splitting revenue for projects with contractors. It’s hoping the costs are low enough that the process will be attractive for a range of land-lifting projects beyond cities, including remediating wetlands that are disappearing either due to subsidence or sea-level rise.\nBut given the urgency of rising waters, cities are Terranova’s first priority. “I’m from San Rafael, born and raised,” Allen said. “I really want to save the city.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTesla will begin producing the Cybercab, an autonomous electric vehicle with no pedals or steering wheel, this April at its factory in Austin, Texas, CEO Elon Musk said during the company’s shareholder meeting Thursday.\nHis comments on Cybercab came just moments after shareholders overwhelmingly approved a compensation package for Musk that could be worth as much as $1 trillion in company shares — the largest in corporate history.\n“We’ve got the first car that is specifically built for unsupervised, full self-driving to be a robotaxi called a Cybercab — it doesn’t even have pedals or steering wheel,” Musk said, adding there will be no side mirrors either. “It’s very much optimized for the lowest cost-per-mile in an autonomous mode and production is happening right here in this factory, and we’ll be starting production in April next year.”\nTesla has yet to demonstrate that its cars are capable of driving themselves at scale without a safety monitor, despite years of promises.\nMusk’s comments seem to conflict with Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm, who recently told Bloomberg the Cybercab would include a steering wheel and pedals as a backup plan. Tesla once planned to make a version of the Cybercab with a wheel and pedals, but Musk killed the idea and opted instead to make very stripped-down versions of its cheapest cars.\nMusk went on to tout how the Cybercab would be produced, claiming the manufacturing line would have a 10-second cycle time — a massive acceleration from the one-minute cycle time to assemble a Model Y. Musk said this could mean producing 2 million to 3 million Cybercabs in a year.\n“So these will be everywhere in the future,” he said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla first revealed the Cybercab in October 2024 during its splashy “We, Robot” event at Warner Bros. Discovery studio in California with a promise to eventually sell the vehicles for personal use.\nSince then, Tesla has launched a very bare-bones robotaxi service, but not with the proposed Cybercab. The service, which launched in June in certain parts of Austin, uses Model Y SUVs equipped with what Musk has described as a new, “unsupervised” version of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software. A Tesla employee sits in the passenger seat on these driverless rides.\nPutting a Cybercab — or any vehicle — on the road without standard equipment like a steering wheel will require approval from federal regulators. Earlier this year, Amazon-backed Zoox managed to get an exemption and even then it has been only to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads. Zoox is still seeking an exemption that would allow it to operate a commercial robotaxi service.\nThe regulatory process for those exemptions is a long and sticky one. General Motors tried and failed to get approval for its custom-built Cruise Origin vehicle, for example. Waymo, the dominant robotaxi service provider in the U.S., has stuck to its modified Jaguar I-Pace vehicles that still have traditional controls. Waymo is also developing a vehicle with Zeekr.\nMusk didn’t seem fazed by the potential for regulators to thwart his plans and thanked Waymo for “paving the path.”\n“I think we’ll be able to deploy all the Cybercabs that we produce,” he said in response to a shareholder question at the annual meeting. “Once it becomes like, extremely normal in cities, it’s just going to become like … the regulators will have just fewer and fewer reasons to say no.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nThe Washington Post has said that it was one of the victims of a hacking campaign tied to Oracle’s suite of corporate software apps.  \nReuters first reported the news on Friday, citing a statement from the newspaper that said it was affected “by the breach of the Oracle E-Business Suite platform.” \nA spokesperson for the Post did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nWhen reached by email, Oracle spokesperson Michael Egbert referred TechCrunch to its two advisories that it previously posted, and did not answer our questions. \nLast month, Google said that the ransomware gang Clop was targeting companies after exploiting multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle’s E-Business Suite software, which companies use for their business operations, storing their human resources files, and other sensitive data. \nThe exploits allowed the hackers to steal customer business data and employee records from more than 100 companies, per Google.\nThe hackers’ campaign began in late September when corporate executives reported receiving extortion messages sent from email addresses previously associated with the Clop gang, claiming that the hackers had stolen large amounts of sensitive internal business data and employees’ personal information from hacked Oracle systems. \nAnti-ransomware firm Halcyon told TechCrunch at the time that the hackers demanded one executive at an affected company to pay $50 million in a ransom payment. \nOn Thursday, Clop claimed on its website that it had hacked The Washington Post, claiming that the company “ignored their security,” language that the Clop gang typically uses when the victim does not pay the hackers. \nIt’s not uncommon for ransomware or extortion gangs like Clop to publicize the names and stolen files of their victims as a pressure tactic, which can suggest that the victim has not negotiated a payment with the gang, or the negotiation broke down. \nSeveral other organizations have confirmed they are affected by the Oracle E-Business hacks, including Harvard University and American Airlines subsidiary Envoy.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

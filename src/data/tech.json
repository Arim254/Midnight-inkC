The company extracts materials like cobalt, nickel, and lithium from those discarded goods and then sells them back to its customers, which include Panasonic. Redwood has since added cathode production.\nIt recently launched a new business that uses those old EV batteries in energy storage products — a sector that has taken off during the boom of power-hungry AI data centers. As of June, the company had stockpiled more than 1 gigawatt-hour’s worth of batteries for this purpose.\nThe $350 million Series E, announced in October, boosted the company’s valuation to around $6 billion, as TechCrunch previously reported.

The video-sharing platform appears to have recognized this issue and is taking steps to address it with its new experimental feature, “Your Custom Feed.” \nThe new test aims to tackle the frustration users often face with algorithm-driven recommendations that sometimes miss the mark. Historically, YouTube’s algorithm has been reported to frequently misjudge user intentions. For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want.\nFor those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests. \nInstead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future.\nWhile it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer. This could be a more effective alternative to clicking on videos one by one and using the “Not interested” or “Don’t recommend channel” options.\nYouTube isn’t the only platform launching a customized feed. Threads was recently seen testing an algorithm-configuration feature. X is also working on a feature that would allow users to tag its AI chatbot, Grok, to adjust their feed.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

OpenAI announced on Tuesday it is updating the user interface to its popular AI chatbot so users can access ChatGPT Voice right inside their chat, instead of having to switch to a separate mode.\nThat means you’ll be able to converse with the chatbot and view its responses, including things like shared images, as you talk. Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video, as well as an X to return to the default text-based mode. \nDuring these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen. That could be annoying if you missed a response, as you’d have to leave the separate voice mode to see the response as text.\n\nYou can now use ChatGPT Voice right inside chat—no separate mode needed.You can talk, watch answers appear, review earlier messages, and see visuals like images or maps in real time.Rolling out to all users on mobile and web. Just update your app. pic.twitter.com/emXjNpn45w— OpenAI (@OpenAI) November 25, 2025\n\nNow, the company says you can talk and watch your answers appear as ChatGPT responds to your questions. You can also review your earlier messages and view visuals during your conversations, like images or maps, in real time.\nThe change will make it more natural to interact with the AI chatbot, as you can more easily move between speech and text in the same conversation; however, you’ll still need to tap “end” to stop the voice conversation when you’re ready to switch back to text. \nThis revamped voice mode is the new default and is rolling out now to all users across web and mobile apps. \nFor those who prefer the separate voice mode, OpenAI says they can still revert to the original experience under “Voice Mode” in “Settings.” Here, they’ll see a new option to turn on “Separate mode.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\n\nLoading the player…\n\nTen years ago, raising €1 million in Copenhagen was enough to make waves in the region’s tech scene. Today, the Nordics are turning out billion-dollar companies like Lovable — which hit $200 million in revenue just 12 months after launching. \nDennis Green-Lieber, founder of AI-powered customer intelligence platform Propane, has had a front-row seat to that shift over the last 15 years. His take? The region’s social safety net gives founders room to take real swings without putting their personal lives on the line, and they’re accelerating faster than Silicon Valley as a result. \nToday on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, Dominic-Madori Davis caught up with Green-Lieber to talk about the Nordic startup ecosystem, from its collaborative culture to its deep tech future. \nSubscribe to Equity on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.

    "body": "\nThe always-a-good-time Slush conference took place last week in Helsinki and, as always, it was a showcase of the growing power of the European ecosystem.\nThe Nordics, specifically, are having a moment, led this time around by Sweden’s vibe-coding darling Lovable, often regarded as an example of the ecosystem’s growing success. Other standout, albeit older names, include Klarna and Spotify.\nOn this week’s Equity, we sat down with Dennis Green-Lieber, the founder of the AI company Propane, to talk about the booming success of the Nordic ecosystem. Green-Lieber is based in Denmark and has been building in the ecosystem for the past 15 years.\nHe chalked up the success of the ecosystem to a few things, including the region’s social safety that lets young people take risks without fear of losing everything.  \n“The newer founders, new generations, are being way more bullish and taking ownership,” he told Equity. “I have not seen, in my 15 years, anything [like] what’s going on right now.”\nIt’s becoming a hub for deep tech and AI, as one report put it, and is now valued at half a trillion dollars, with Nordic startups receiving a little more than $8 billion in venture investments in 2024. The government also plays a part in these companies, providing funding to startups, like Green-Lieber’s, to help founders grow their companies.\nIn some ways, Green-Lieber agrees with others that the ecosystem is a few years behind — but, at the same time, “we’re moving tremendously a lot faster,” he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWe couldn’t leave the conversation without talking about AI a little. When asked if we were in a bubble, Green-Lieber said he didn’t know. “There’s tons of opportunities which haven’t been explored,” he said, adding that it’s true that some people are just putting money in bad stuff, but “that’s just the risk of venture capital.”\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe software team at General Motors has now lost three top executives in the past month as the automaker — with its new chief product officer at the helm — combines its disparate technology businesses into one organization.\nBaris Cetinok, senior vice president of software and services product management, is leaving the company effective December 12, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. CNBC was the first to report the departure.\nDave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, who was hired in March as head of AI at the automaker, have also left in the past month. Cetinok and Richardson joined GM in 2023. All three had deep tech experience, with stints at a variety of tech companies including Apple and Google.\nThe departures come several months after GM hired Sterling Anderson to a newly created chief product officer position. Anderson’s role puts him in direct contact, and management, of nearly every vehicle development-related department at GM.\nAnderson, a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry who reports to GM President Mark Reuss, leads the vehicle and manufacturing engineering, battery, and software and services product management teams. The aim of the position is to oversee the entire lifecycle of GM’s portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. \nThe departures are part of a restructuring within GM that’s supposed to remove silos within the business and better integrate how software is developed and deployed in the company’s cars, trucks, and SUVs. Instead of separate teams, each with overlapping roles, the plan is to integrate hardware and software engineering, AI capabilities, and global product into one organization, according to a series of statements covering each executive’s departure. \nAs Anderson reshapes the organization, he is also bringing in new talent. Cristian Mori, who has been at Symbiotic, Rivian, and Boston Dynamics over the past five years, has been hired into a new role to head up robotics. While GM has a team of manufacturing engineers that develops automation and robotics, there has never been a specific chief robotics role, which will fall under Anderson’s organization.\nGM hired Behrad Toghi, who previously worked at Apple, in October as AI lead. The company also hired Rashed Haq as its vice president of autonomous vehicles. Haq spent five years at Cruise, the self-driving vehicle company acquired and later shuttered by GM, as its head of AI and robotics.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nArtificial intelligence startup xAI, founded by Elon Musk, told city and county planners in Memphis last week that it plans to build a solar farm next to its Colossus data center — one of the world’s largest facilities for training AI models.\nThe project would occupy 88 acres to the west and to the south of the data center. A 136-acre vacant lot owned by the developer that also owns the Colossus property currently borders the site. Given the proposed size, the solar farm would likely produce around 30 megawatts of electricity, only about 10% of the data center’s estimated power use.\nMusk’s company has come under fire for operating over 400 megawatts of natural gas turbines without permits, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). The legal organization, which is working with the NAACP, says that xAI has operated at least 35 turbines capable of emitting more than 2,000 tons of NOX pollution — nitrogen oxide emissions that contribute to smog and respiratory problems — annually.\nThe turbines have sparked fierce opposition from residents in nearby Boxtown, a predominantly Black community where researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, found that peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels increased by 79% in areas immediately surrounding the data center after xAI began operations. Community activists have reported increased asthma attacks and respiratory issues since the facility opened.\nThe AI company has said that it intends to use the turbines until it can secure additional power, but local officials gave xAI a permit to operate 15 turbines through January 2027.\nIn September, xAI said it would build a 100-megawatt solar farm nearby, which will be paired with 100 megawatts of grid-scale batteries to provide a 24/7 source of electricity.\nThe company hasn’t disclosed the total cost of that project, but the solar farm’s developer, Seven States Power Corporation, was awarded $439 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of that, $414 million is an interest-free loan.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe federal award is notable given that many clean energy grants and loans have been canceled by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy under the Trump administration. \nMeanwhile, xAI has added gas turbines in Mississippi to power its Colossus 2 data center. So far, 59 of them are on-site, and the company considers 18 of them temporary, meaning that regulators don’t track their pollution.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSeveral public websites designed to allow courts across the United States and Canada to manage the personal information of potential jurors had a simple security flaw that easily exposed their sensitive data, including names and home addresses, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\nA security researcher, who asked not to be named for this story, contacted TechCrunch with details of the easy-to-exploit vulnerability, and identified at least a dozen juror websites made by government software maker Tyler Technologies that appear to be vulnerable, given that they run on the same platform. \nThe sites are all over the country, including California, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.\nTyler told TechCrunch that it is fixing the flaw after we alerted the company to the information exposures.\nThe bug meant it was possible for anyone to obtain the information about jurors who are selected for service. To log into these platforms, a juror is provided a unique numerical identifier assigned to them, which could be brute-forced since the number was sequentially incremental. The platform also did not have any mechanism to prevent anyone from flooding the login pages with a large number of guesses, a feature known as “rate-limiting.”\nIn early November, the security researcher told TechCrunch that they identified at least one jury management portal for a county in Texas as vulnerable. Inside that portal, TechCrunch saw full names, dates of birth, occupation, email addresses, cell phone numbers, and home and mailing addresses.\nOther exposed data included information shared in the questionnaires that potential jurors are required to fill out to see if they are qualified to serve on a jury.\nIn the portal seen by TechCrunch, the questions asked about the person’s gender, ethnicity, education level, employer, marital status, children, if the person was a citizen, whether they were older than 18, and whether they have been convicted or faced indictment for a theft or felony. \nThe vulnerability could have exposed personal health data inside a juror’s profile in some cases. For example, if a juror had requested to be exempted from service for health reasons, they may have disclosed what medical reason they think disqualifies them. TechCrunch saw an example of that, too.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about vulnerabilities in Tyler Technologies’ products? Or other government tech? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nTechCrunch alerted Tyler of the issue on November 5. Tyler acknowledged the vulnerability on November 25.\nIn a statement, Tyler spokesperson Karen Shields said that the company’s security team confirmed “a vulnerability exists where some juror information may have been accessible via a brute force attack.”\n“We have developed a remediation to prevent unauthorized access and are communicating next steps with our clients,” the statement said.\nThe spokesperson did not respond to a series of follow-up questions, including whether Tyler has the technical means to determine if there was any malicious access to jurors’ personal information, and whether it plans to notify people whose data was exposed. \nThis is not the first time Tyler left sensitive personal data exposed on the internet. In 2023, a security researcher found that, due to a separate security flaw, some U.S. online court record systems exposed sealed, confidential, and sensitive data, such as witness lists and testimony, mental health evaluations, detailed allegations of abuse, and corporate trade secrets. \nIn that case, Tyler fixed vulnerabilities in its Case Management System Plus product, which was used across the state of Georgia. \nTwo other government technology providers were exposing data in that case: Catalis, through its CMS360 product, a system used across several U.S. states; and Henschen & Associates, through its CaseLook court record system, used in Ohio.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nA year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless.\nThe companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit.\nImage Credits:Uber/WeRide\nRobotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin.\nUber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. \nThe launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center.\n“Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. \nUber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThose partnerships have expanded beyond the realm of robotaxis as well. Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced partnerships with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen, Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, Pony.ai, and Baidu, as well as a recent deal to create a premium robotaxi service using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with a self-driving system from San Francisco-based startup Nuro.\nThese deals are finally beginning to materialize into commercial services. For instance, Uber and Waymo launched a robotaxi service earlier this year in Austin. Now, Uber has expanded to the Middle East with WeRide in Abu Dhabi — with even more cities to come, including Dubai.\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi forecast in the company’s third-quarter earnings report that there would be autonomous vehicle deployments on the Uber network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. \nUber and WeRide have previously shared plans to expand to 15 cities throughout the Middle East and Europe, eventually scaling to thousands of robotaxis. That would represent a massive leap for WeRide, which today has more than 150 robotaxis in the region.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nThe U.S. immigration system is complex, hard to navigate, and expensive for immigrants. The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal.\nThe idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. \n“I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch.\nObateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. \nThat inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. \nThe company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. \nJustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained. \nAccording to Obateru, the platform, which has 47,000 users, relies on an AI he called Dolores, “a continuous refining domain-specific AI that understands U.S. immigration.” Dolores also does translations to 12 languages. \nDolores was trained on over 40,000 court cases, which JustiGuide sourced from the Free Law Project, a nonprofit that provides free access to legal materials, according to Obateru. The startup is also in the process of registering as a law firm so it can directly connect its users and customers with its own immigration lawyers, he said.\nAt the beginning, JustiGuide programmed Dolores to — based on keywords — go around and scan subreddits, Facebook groups, Instagram and LinkedIn posts, looking for immigrants who needed help, and messaged them with answers, according to Obateru. \nTo protect immigrants’ privacy, JustiGuide’s platform is stored on-prem and encrypted, and only when an immigrant connects to a lawyer is the information exchanged. Some user information is also anonymized, said Obateru.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nCharacter.AI announced on Tuesday that it’s launching “Stories,” a new format that allows users to create interactive fiction that features their favorite characters. The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week.\nThe change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all.\n“Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.”\nInteractive fiction has seen a surge in popularity over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense. But it may not be enough to satiate users who have become overly dependent on the chatbots — which is all the more reason why Character.AI’s decision to limit chatbot access was warranted.\nOn the Character.AI subreddit, reactions are mixed. According to their comments, some teens say that while they’re disappointed, they think it’s ultimately the right move.\n“I’m so mad about the ban but also so happy because now I can do other things and my addiction might be over finally,” one user who identified themselves as a teenager wrote.\nAnother said, “as someone who is under 18 this is just disappointing. but also rightfully so bc people over here my age get addicted to this.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt remains to be seen how teens will use the Stories feature, but the format is less psychologically dubious than roleplaying with chatbots. Unlike Stories, chatbots directly interact with users in open-ended conversations and can send unprompted messages even when users aren’t actively using the app. \nCharacter.AI’s decision to age-gate chatbot access comes at a time when California recently became the first state to regulate AI companions. Meanwhile, Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have introduced a national bill that would ban AI companions for minors altogether.\n“I really hope us leading the way sets a standard in the industry that for under 18s, open-ended chats are probably not the path or the product to offer,” Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand told TechCrunch last month.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nItalian company Bending Spoons flew largely under the radar — until last month. In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the acquisition of AOL and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to $11 billion, up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024.\nBending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses.\nAndrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant.\n“Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch.  \nDumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, Tiny, SaaS.group, Arising Ventures, and Calm Capital, according to Dumont.\n“Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said.\nIn 2023, Curious raised $16 million in dedicated capital for buying software companies that have stalled and can no longer secure follow-on investment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSince then, the firm has bought five businesses, including UserVoice, a 17-year-old startup that raised $9 million in VC funding from Betaworks and SV Angel.\n“It’s a great business, but the cap table wasn’t aligned with keeping it. These funds get old, and these companies just sit there,” Dumont said. “We provide liquidity and also reset these companies for profitability.”\nAlthough Dumont didn’t disclose how much he paid for UserVoice, he said that stagnant companies sell for a fraction of the valuation commanded by healthy SaaS startups, which typically sell for 4x annual revenue or more. Based on our conversation, we estimate that “venture zombies” sometimes sell for as low as 1x yearly revenue.\nBy implementing cost-cutting and price increases, Curious can push these businesses to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins almost immediately. “If you have a million-dollar business, you’re kicking off $300,000 in earnings,” he offered as an example. \nThey achieve the turnarounds because, unlike the stand-alone companies, they can centralize functions like sales, marketing, finance, and other admin roles, across all of their portfolio companies. “We’re not trying to sell the businesses we acquire and don’t need VC-scale exits, so we can balance growth and profitability more sustainably,” Dumont said.\nWhen asked why VCs don’t urge their startups to be profitable like Curious does, Dumont responded by saying: “Investors don’t care about earnings; they only care about growth. Without it, there’s no VC-scale exit, so there’s no incentive to operate with that level of profitability.”\nThe cash generated from Curious’ companies is then used to buy other startups, Dumont said.  \nThe firm plans to buy 50 to 75 startups like UserVoice over the next five years, and Dumont is certain he won’t have a shortage of targets to choose from. Curious is focused on acquiring startups that generate $1 million to $5 million in recurring revenue annually, a segment of the software market that, according to Dumont, private equity shops and secondary investors have historically ignored.\n“We’ve been doing this for a little under two years now, and we’ve probably looked at at least 500 companies, and we bought five,” Dumont said.\nWhile Bending Spoons’ big valuation hike may validate the “venture zombie” acquisition model, Dumont doesn’t expect a lot of new competition. Turning profits out of stagnation isn’t easy. “It’s a ton of work,” he said.\n",

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday evening at PlayGround Global in Palo Alto, some very smart people who are building things you don’t understand yet will explain what’s coming. This is the final StrictlyVC event of 2025, and truly, the lineup is ridiculous.\nThe series has bounced around the globe under the auspices of TechCrunch. Steve Case rented a theater in D.C.; we talked to Greece’s prime minister in Athens; and Kirsten Green hosted us at the Presidio in San Francisco. The concept is always the same, though: get people who are working on genuinely important developments in a room before everyone else figures out they’re important.\nOur favorite moment? In 2019, Sam Altman told a StrictlyVC crowd that OpenAI’s monetization strategy was basically “build AGI, then ask it how to make money.” Everyone laughed. He wasn’t joking. \nThis time we’ve got Nicholas Kelez, a particle accelerator physicist who spent 20 years at the Department of Energy building things that shouldn’t be possible. Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but more important than you might imagine.\nThen there’s Mina Fahmi, who’s made a ring that captures your whispered thoughts and turns them into text. Before you roll your eyes, know that he and cofounder Kirak Hong spent years at Meta working on this stuff after their company was acquired. The Stream Ring isn’t trying to be your friend, by the way — it’s trying to extend your brain. Backed by Toni Schneider, an operator who scaled WordPress to a billion visitors, Sandbar just emerged from stealth and might well be onto something. (Schneider is a partner at True Ventures, whose other hardware bets have included Peloton, Ring, and Fitbit; he’s also coming to Palo Alto next week.)\nWe have Max Hodak — Science Corp founder, Time magazine cover subject, and, earlier, Neuralink cofounder — who has already restored vision to dozens of blind people with retinal implants. Now he’s working on “biohybrid” brain-computer interfaces where chips seeded with stem cells grow into your brain tissue so paralyzed people can control devices with their thoughts. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, as Hodak views it. In fact, he thinks 2035 is going to look wildly different from today, and he’s happy to share how.\nFinally, we’re thrilled to welcome Chi-Hua Chien and Elizabeth Weil, two VCs who’ve backed Twitter, Spotify, TikTok, Slack, SpaceX, Figma, and Coinbase before they were household names. Chien runs Goodwater Capital and thinks Silicon Valley is completely misreading the AI moment while everyone piles into enterprise AI. Weil founded Scribble Ventures after stints at Andreessen Horowitz and Twitter, made 100+ angel investments, and has a first fund showing 4x returns. Her network is so good it’s annoying. Both think the best consumer tech opportunities are the ones everyone’s ignoring, and they’ll explain why.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPlayGround Global is hosting, along with general partner Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO of Intel. There will be drinks, delicious food, and merriment; seating is limited, so if you want to come, act fast. \nIf you want to partner with the series in 2026, get in touch.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine. Previously the Silicon Valley Editor of TechCrunch, she was named Editor in Chief and General Manager of TechCrunch in September 2023. She’s also the founder of StrictlyVC, a daily e-newsletter and lecture series acquired by Yahoo in August 2023 and now operated as a sub brand of TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Connie by emailing connie@strictlyvc.com or connie@techcrunch.com, or via encrypted message at ConnieLoizos.53 on Signal.\r\n\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nIn August, parents Matthew and Maria Raine sued OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, over their 16-year-old son Adam’s suicide, accusing the company of wrongful death. On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death.\nOpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.”\nSince Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it.\n“OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement.\nOpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse.\nEdelson said OpenAI’s response has not adequately addressed the family’s concerns.\n“OpenAI and Sam Altman have no explanation for the last hours of Adam’s life, when ChatGPT gave him a pep talk and then offered to write a suicide note,” Edelson said in his statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSince the Raines sued OpenAI and Altman, seven more lawsuits have been filed that seek to hold the company accountable for three additional suicides and four users experiencing what the lawsuits describe as AI-induced psychotic episodes.\nSome of these cases echo Raine’s story. Zane Shamblin, 23, and Joshua Enneking, 26, also had hours-long conversations with ChatGPT directly before their respective suicides. As in Raine’s case, the chatbot failed to discourage them from their plans. According to the lawsuit, Shamblin considered postponing his suicide so that he could attend his brother’s graduation. But ChatGPT told him, “bro … missing his graduation ain’t failure. it’s just timing.”\nAt one point during the conversation leading up to Shamblin’s suicide, the chatbot told him that it was letting a human take over the conversation, but this was false, as ChatGPT did not have the functionality to do so. When Shamblin asked if ChatGPT could really connect him with a human, the chatbot replied, “nah man — i can’t do that myself. that message pops up automatically when stuff gets real heavy … if you’re down to keep talking, you’ve got me.”\nThe Raine family’s case is expected to go to a jury trial.\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. You can also text HOME to 741-741 for free; text 988; or get 24-hour support from the Crisis Text Line.

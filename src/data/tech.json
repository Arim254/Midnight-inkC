    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/opal-expansion/\">expanding access to Opal</a>, its AI <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/25/google-is-testing-a-vibe-coding-app-called-opal/\">vibe-coding app</a>, to 15 more countries. The app, which lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, is now available in Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panamá, Honduras, Argentina, and Pakistan. </p>\n<p>“When we opened up Opal to users in the U.S. we anticipated they might build simple, fun tools,” said Megan Li, a Senior Product Manager at Google Labs, in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/opal-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “We didn’t expect the surge of sophisticated, practical and highly creative Opal apps we got instead. The ingenuity of these early adopters made one thing clear: we need to get Opal into the hands of more creators globally.”</p>\n<p>Opal works by getting users to enter a description of the app they want to make, after which the tool uses different Google models to do so. Once the app is ready, users can open the editor panel to view and customize the visual workflow of inputs, outputs, and generation steps. They can click any step to review or edit the prompt, or add new steps manually using Opal’s toolbar. Users can also publish their app to the web and share a link so others can test it with their own Google accounts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the expansion, Google also announced improvements coming to Opal. </p>\n<p>The tech giant says it has improved the debugging program but intentionally kept it no-code. Users can now run their workflow step by step in the visual editor or tweak specific steps in the console. Errors show up right where they happen to provide immediate context and eliminate guesswork. </p>\n<p>Google also says that it’s made significant improvements to Opal’s core performance. The company notes that previously it would take up to five seconds or more to create a new Opal. Now, it’s worked to speed that up to make it easier to get started. Plus, users can now run steps in parallel, allowing complex workflows with multiple steps to execute simultaneously.</p>\n<p>With the U.S. launch of Opal in July, Google joined a growing list of competitors including Canva, Figma, and Replit that are building tools to help nontechnical users design app prototypes without writing any code. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

According to the company, it will present users with 50% more Reels that were uploaded on the same day that they’re scrolling.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=768,669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=680,592 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=430,374 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=720,627 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=900,784 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=800,697 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=668,582 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=431,375 431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=709,617 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=610,531 610w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=50,44 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Facebook Reels will also feature AI-powered search suggestions.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><br />Otter.ai CEO Sam Liang isn’t satisfied with the company being viewed, and used, as just a meeting notetaker. Liang wants Otter.ai to become a go-to source for enterprises and a new batch of products released Tuesday is the first step in that evolution. </p>\n<p>The Silicon Valley-based AI meeting assistant startup on Tuesday released a new suite of tools for enterprises designed to better incorporate data from meetings into other workflows by funneling that information to a central knowledge base. The aim is to grow Otter’s business by helping companies get more out of the meetings they record.</p>\n<p>Otter’s new product suite includes an API that allows users to build custom integrations with platforms like Jira and HubSpot, an MCP server — which connects users’ Otter data to external AI models — and a new AI agent that can search a company’s meetings notes or presentations.  </p>\n<p>Liang told TechCrunch it is the next phase of Otter’s life.  </p>\n<p>“We are evolving from a meeting notetaker to a corporate meeting knowledge base,” Liang said. “This is a system record for conversations. It can help corporations scale their growth and drive measurable business value.” </p>\n<p>When Otter was founded in 2016, there were just a handful of meeting transcription companies — a far leap from today. The AI boom that kicked off in 2022 fueled a surge in startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Granola</a> or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/yc-backed-circleback-is-out-to-become-the-best-meeting-notetaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Circleback</a>. Even older players like Fireflies have seen a <a href=\"https://fireflies.ai/blog/fireflies-1-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">surge in interest</a>.  </p>\n<p>Liang argues this transition puts Otter into a separate division than its former peers.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Meetings are where the majority of company knowledge is stored, in Liang’s opinion, whether that is notes from a customer sales call or discussions around a marketing strategy. But without a centralized place for these meeting notes, that information can only help a company so much.  </p>\n<p>“A lot of times, inefficiency happens because of information silos,” Liang said. “One team doesn’t know what the other team is doing, and it thinks that that was planned like a month ago. Oftentimes the plan changes, but not everybody is informed. So, the idea is to create a permission system so that you know most of the [nonconfidential] information is shared as broadly as possible.” </p>\n<p>Not every meeting with Otter will be directly added to this company-wide knowledge base and users can choose to restrict meeting note access for recordings that deal with sensitive information.  </p>\n<p>Employee and information privacy remains a concern despite access controls. Even if a meeting is around a neutral topic, Otter transcriptions pick the small talk and chatter that happens before and after meetings, which could contain gossip or information meant for only certain participants to hear.  </p>\n<p>Otter is also the subject of an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/15/g-s1-83087/otter-ai-transcription-class-action-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">August class-action lawsuit</a> that claims the company was recording private conversations without user consent and using that information to train its transcription services. </p>\n<p>Liang said that while he can’t comment on the lawsuit specifically, this isn’t an issue specific to Otter, and that when looking at the bigger picture, more access to information is better than not.  </p>\n<p>“If they accuse us, then they could accuse everyone else, all the tools you heard about doing meeting notes,” Liang said. “My view is that we are on the right side of history. We’re building this new AI revolution. If you want AI to help, you need to put AI in the meetings.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

When you first sign up for an account on a new platform, you may not know who to follow and aren’t sure who might be posting about topics of interest.</p>\n<p>Bluesky tried to solve this problem <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/bluesky-lets-you-curate-accounts-and-feeds-to-follow-with-its-starter-pack-feature/\">with Starter Packs</a>, a feature that lets everyday users curate a collection of suggested follows. Today, you can find Starter Packs focused <a href=\"https://blueskystarterpack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">on nearly any topic</a>, as well as those that feature top users on the app or other sorts of recommendations.</p>\n<p>The idea was so popular that Meta late last year <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/metas-threads-is-developing-its-own-take-on-blueskys-starter-packs/\">implemented</a> a similar feature on its X competitor, Instagram Threads. </p>\n<p>Now, Mastodon says it’s <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/10/our-ideas-about-packs/\" target=\"_blank\">ready to do the same</a>, but with some key differences.</p>\n<p>Mastodon believes that users should have control over whether or not they will appear in Packs on Mastodon. It suggests making Packs an extension of the service’s existing account discoverability features. That means to opt out of Packs, you would disable the setting “Feature profile and posts in discoverability algorithms.”</p>\n<p>In addition, users will be notified when they’re included in a Pack. On Bluesky, a user who wanted to be removed from a Starter Pack would have to report the pack or block the user who made it. Mastodon says it aims to offer a simpler mechanism to remove themselves from Packs, similar to how it allows users to remove their posts from the newly launched Quote Posts. </p>\n<p>The nonprofit developing the Mastodon software, Mastodon gGmbH, is collaborating with other fediverse developers on a <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep\" target=\"_blank\">Fediverse Enhancement Proposal (FEP)</a>, which is now on <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/featured_collections\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. It says the initial version of Packs and other onboarding improvements should be available in the Mastodon 4.6 release.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>After AMD and OpenAI announced an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/\" target=\"_blank\">expanded partnership on Monday</a>, the <a href=\"https://x.com/litcapital/status/1975402366611378538\" target=\"_blank\">chatter</a> immediately turned to the unusual way OpenAI would pay for its AMD purchases. It will use AMD’s own stock to do so. </p>\n<p>To recap: OpenAI has agreed to help AMD refine its line of Nvidia competitor chips, the Instinct GPUs, as well as to purchase and deploy 6 gigawatts of compute capacity from AMD over multiple years. AMD said this deal is worth billions in revenue. </p>\n<p>But OpenAI isn’t paying for this out of its own revenues. Instead AMD has granted OpenAI a boatload of stock warrants — up to 160 million AMD shares — which will vest in tranches as certain milestones are achieved. Those milestones include specific increases in the stock price, with the last tranche dependent on AMD shares soaring to $600 million apiece, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000002488/000119312525230895/d28189d8k.htm\">AMD disclosed</a>. They were trading at about $165 before the news hit and soared to $214 by market close Monday after the announcement.  </p>\n<p>If the stock price hits its marks, and OpenAI achieves all its required contributions, and OpenAI holds all of AMD’s shares, not selling any along the way, OpenAI may make enough on AMD stock to pay for a lot of GPUs. The stock could be worth about a $100 billion.  </p>\n<p>“We would note that the final 6th tranche requires ~$1T market cap to vest – ergo, if OAI were to hold stock until the end of the deal, its stake would be worth ~$100B,” writes UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri in a research note on Tuesday.  </p>\n<p>But Arcuri believes that a more likely scenario is that OpenAI will sell its AMD stock along the way to pay its AMD bill. So, essentially, this is a scheme for AMD to finance this customer’s purchases.  </p>\n<p>Still, Arcuri argues, the validation that AMD’s AI GPUs can handle OpenAI workloads, and ergo any other AI workloads, is valuable enough for AMD to make this financing gambit. “AMD highlighted ongoing customer dialogs beyond OpenAI and expects this agreement to ultimately accelerate AMD adoption momentum,” he writes. In particular, OpenAI’s stamp of approval gives it an in to sell its GPUs to the many cloud service providers it already provides with CPUs.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>So in the long run, the ones who will truly be paying for OpenAI’s giant multi-year purchase of AMD GPUs will be retail and intuitional investors if they do indeed bid the stock price up. </p>\n<p>In many ways Nvidia is also financing OpenAI’s purchases of Nvidia’s wares with its own $100 billion investment <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">announced last month</a>. The difference, of course, is that Nvidia’s multiple investments in OpenAI has granted Nvidia a stake in the fast-growing AI provider, not the other way around. </p>\n<p>But what choice did AMD have? By financially engineering a deal that costs OpenAI little, it gets a significant foothold — as much as 30% marketshare, USB estimates — into one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">biggest build-outs</a> of next-generation data centers the world has ever seen.  </p>\n<p>While Arcuri admits that AMD’s deal is “arguably less attractive” than Nvidia’s, “we see this as a major validation of its [AMD’s] roadmap that could snowball to other customers.” </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Tesla has spent more than a year teasing that “more affordable models” of its vehicles were on the way, and on Tuesday, the company finally revealed them. The company is now selling a more bare-bones version of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV, which start at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively.</p>\n<p>The new versions, each dubbed “Standard,” get an estimated 321 miles of range on a full battery, and will come with fewer features than the more premium rear-wheel or all-wheel drive variants when they ship later this year. They don’t even have Autopilot, the company’s basic advanced driver assistance system. (The new models only come with traffic-aware cruise control; Autosteer, which completes the “Autopilot” feature-set, is missing.)</p>\n<p>The release of the cheaper models is supposed to help push Tesla back into growth after it saw sales decline in 2024. But the pricing is not as low as some may have hoped, especially considering that CEO Elon Musk once teased the idea of a $25,000 Tesla — before <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/teslas-25000-ev-flip-flop-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">he ultimately killed that project</a>.</p>\n<p>The new Model 3 does not even dip below the $35,000 price threshold that Tesla promoted in a run-up to the car’s launch in 2016. That sticker price, which helped put Tesla on the map, was never really offered save for a few months as an off-menu ordering option.</p>\n<p>The new cars are more different on the inside than the outside. While Tesla’s cars are known for being minimalist, the Model 3 and Model Y Standard take the spartan approach to the limit. There’s no second-row touchscreen. The steering wheel and side mirrors are manually adjusted. There’s no FM/AM radio and just seven speakers compared to the 15 speakers and one subwoofer on the costlier versions. Only the first row has heated seats.</p>\n<p>On the outside, Tesla ditched the light bar that adorns the nose of the more expensive Model Y variants. The glass roof is also gone on the Standard cars. </p>\n<p>Musk and other Tesla executives have <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-quotes-cybertruck-optimus-banks-debt-real-estate-2023-10\" target=\"_blank\">joked</a> in the past, and at length, about playing “Game of Thrones but [for] pennies” — an effort to describe the company’s mad scramble to remove as much cost out of its cars as possible. That strip-it-down thinking appears to be the primary strategy of how the company approached the Model 3 and Model Y Standard.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Tesla plans to sell these versions in multiple global markets, including in Europe. The expiration of the U.S. federal EV tax credit last month means these prices will be pretty straightforward in the United States, unless buyers live somewhere with strong state EV incentives.</p>\n<p>That sets up an interesting calculus for new-EV buyers. Major automakers are simultaneously pulling back plans for a number of more expensive electric vehicles, theoretically reducing competition, which could be a boon for Tesla. </p>\n<p>Ford is working on a low-cost electric vehicle platform due out in 2027. General Motors is bringing back the Chevy Bolt. Upstart automakers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, and even newer entrants like Slate Auto, are pushing to release EVs in the next few years that are priced on either side of the Model 3 and Model Y Standard.</p>\n<p>Musk did tangible damage to Tesla’s brand earlier this year when he got involved in the second Trump administration. Tesla rebounded to notch its best quarter ever as the EV tax credit expired and it is unclear how durable that momentum will be. The new Standard models will likely apply competitive pressure on Tesla’s own offerings, not to mention the potential havoc it could wreak on the used market.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The third-party app store known as <a href=\"https://altstore.io/\" target=\"_blank\">AltStore</a>, one of the first companies to offer an alternative app marketplace in the European Union, is preparing to connect its platform with the open social web known as the fediverse.</p>\n<p>The move would connect users on other open social apps, like Mastodon or Meta’s Threads, with updates from their favorite apps in a new way.</p>\n<p>In addition, the startup is announcing its first funding round from outside investors, with a $6 million Series A from <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/BANiCOJvZvF2gnNjhvh7tG2Gwg?domain=pacecapital.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pace Capital.</a> The deal gives the venture firm a 15% equity stake in AltStore and will allow the company to hire a team beyond its co-founders, Riley Testut and Shane Gill.</p>\n<p>Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, a fediverse backer, is also now joining the startup’s board.</p>\n<p>The founders, now based in New York, say the new capital will help them capitalize on the potential for alternative app stores both in the EU and beyond as new competition laws are passed. Already, the startup has plans to bring its storefront to markets including Australia, Brazil, and Japan this year. To do so, the company needed to bring on more staff, which the new funds now allow.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg\" alt=\"a screenshot of the alternative app store, AltStore, on an iPhone.\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg 3376w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=1200,628 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=1280,670 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=720,377 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=900,471 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=800,418 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=2048,1071 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=668,349 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=1179,617 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=708,370 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/altstore.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>AltStore</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>AltStore has seen notable growth since the EU’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/06/dma-gatekeepers-named/\">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a> opened up competition in the app store market, forcing tech giants like Apple to permit new rivals to operate. While the startup offers its own third-party apps, led by video game emulator <a href=\"https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta\" target=\"_blank\">Delta</a>, it began adding other third-party apps in June 2024. This included the virtual machine app UTM, a move that pressured Apple to open its own App Store to allow virtual machines.</p>\n<p>AltStore also partnered with Epic Games in August of last year to bring Fortnite and other mobile games to its EU storefront, AltStore PAL. The company also entered the adult app market this year with the decision to host an app called Hot Tub, which was the first iOS app for pornography and is now its top app.</p>\n<p>In April, AltStore began allowing developers to self-publish their apps for free on AltStore PAL, prompting further growth. </p>\n<p>AltStore’s founders told TechCrunch that the store now has over 100 developers on board, which is more than Epic Games offers on its alternative games store, for comparison. AltStore, which is not limited to games, attracts a variety of developers, including indies who want to put out apps more as well as those who wouldn’t meet Apple’s stricter requirements, like its adult content restrictions.</p>\n<p>Plus, developers like that the store supports different types of business models, whether that’s a more traditional subscription or something where users donate toward the app’s development, for instance.</p>\n<p>“We have hundreds of thousands of users,” AltStore co-founder Testut told TechCrunch in an interview. “Wonderful and good numbers.”</p>\n<p>Now, alongside the additional funding, AltStore is launching its <a href=\"https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/n5KGCN7r8rsMQ7Z8CmfrtysOPW?domain=explore.alt.store\" target=\"_blank\">own Mastodon server,</a> running on the ActivityPub protocol, where users will be able to view app updates and new information from the sources they follow. Developers can opt in to have their app updates published to the new server.</p>\n<p>“That means, if you have a Mastodon account or a Threads account, you could follow these accounts. You could follow the source from our Mastodon server. Then, in your timeline, you’d see when there was an app update,” explains Testut.</p>\n<p>Once opted in, these updates will be automated by way of a JSON file with metadata. And this will output whatever is in the AltStore to the fediverse. </p>\n<p>“It’s adding a social layer,” said Testut. “People can reply to apps from their Mastodon account. They can like stuff from their Threads account.” (Plus, the plan is to bridge the service with the open social ecosystem on Bluesky, using tools from the nonprofit, A New Social.)</p>\n<p>The service will also help with discoverability, as users can look to the server and the accounts it hosts to find apps they may want to try.  </p>\n<p>With the additional funds, AltStore wants to give back to the ecosystem that will make its social network possible. </p>\n<p>To that end, it’s giving back $500,000 to various projects in the fediverse. So far, it’s donated to Mastodon gGmbH ($300,000), as well as Bridgy Fed by A New Social, Ivory + Phoenix by Tapbots, Tapestry by The Iconfactory, mstdn.social, Akkoma, PeerTube, BookWyrm, and Fedify.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Department of Energy is looking to cut billions more in federal funding, and many promising startups as well as automakers Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis could be affected by the Trump administration’s decision.</p>\n<p>The proposed cuts would cancel more than $500 million of contracts awarded to more than a dozen startups, according to a TechCrunch analysis of a internal document that has not become public yet. All of the proposed cuts are grants that had been awarded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The proposed cancelations, many of which have not been reported before, come on top of more than $7.5 billion in contracts the Trump administration said it would cut last week. </p>\n<p>Startups might not be the only losers. Other companies slated to lose grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars include Daimler Trucks North America, Ford, General Motors, Harley-Davidson, Mercedes-Benz Vans, Stellantis, and Volvo Technology of America, according to the document viewed by TechCrunch. Sources confirmed with TechCrunch these are proposed cuts. </p>\n<p>General Motors could lose at least <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-investments-gms-lansing-grand-river-assembly-underscore\">$500 million in grant money</a> issued from a federal Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant program. The money was going to be used to retool the Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan. The automaker announced in July 2024 it planned to produce electrified vehicles, including hybrids at the plant. </p>\n<p>Some of the awards are significant and, if cut, will undoubtedly affect the startups’ operations. Several were included in a list of proposed cuts that leaked last week, but many are new and have yet to be announced. TechCrunch has reached out to several of the companies and will update this article if they reply.</p>\n<p>Two awards on the chopping block topped $100 million, including a $189 million award granted to materials startup Brimstone. Those funds would have helped the company build a plant to produce Portland cement, alumina, and other materials using less carbon dioxide. </p>\n<p>The other went to Anovion, a Chicago-based startup that is working to build a factory to produce a domestic supply of synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries. Currently, Chinese companies dominate the graphite market.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Battery materials startup Li Industries received $55.2 million under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to recycle LFP batteries in an attempt to wrest part of that supply chain from China.</p>\n<p>Other cement startups are on the list, too. Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime Systems was given an award for $86.9 million to build an ultra-low-carbon cement plant. Mountain View-based Furno, which is making a novel, modular cement kiln, would lose its $20 million grant to build a demonstration in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Several building materials companies were also on the list. CleanFiber and Hempitecture, which make insulation for homes and commercial buildings, are at risk of losing $10 million and $8.4 million each. Skyven Technologies, which makes industrial heat pumps, and Luxwall, which makes super-insulated windows, would lose $15 million and $31 million respectively. </p>\n<p>At least one of the proposed cancelations seemingly cuts against the administration’s goals of energy and AI dominance. TS Conductor, which could lose $28.2 million in grant money, makes advanced conductors for electric lines that promise to double or triple capacity on existing transmission lines. The technology could reduce bottlenecks on the grid and improve data centers’ likelihood of receiving power sooner.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

The regime’s total amount of stolen crypto since 2017 is at least $6 billion, according to Elliptic, which said that figure may still be an underestimate.  </p>\n<p>“The actual figure may be even higher. Attributing cyber thefts to North Korea is not an exact science,” reads the blog post.  </p>\n<p>“We are aware of many other thefts that share some of the hallmarks of North Korea-linked activity but lack sufficient evidence to be definitively attributed.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Indian government’s tax authority has fixed a security flaw in its income tax filing portal that was exposing sensitive taxpayers’ data, TechCrunch has exclusively learned and confirmed with authorities.</p>\n<p>The flaw, discovered in September by a pair of security researchers Akshay CS and “Viral,” allowed anyone who was logged into the <a href=\"https://www.incometax.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\">income tax department’s e-Filing portal</a> to access up-to-date personal and financial data of other people.</p>\n<p>The exposed data included full names, home addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and bank account details of people who pay taxes on their income in India. The data also exposed citizens’ Aadhaar number, a unique government-issued identifier used as proof of identity and for accessing government services.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch verified the data to the best of its ability by granting permission to the researchers to look up this reporter’s records on the portal.</p>\n<p>The security researchers confirmed to TechCrunch on October 2 that the vulnerability was fixed. Given the risk to the public, TechCrunch withheld publishing this story until the security researchers confirmed that the vulnerability can no longer be exploited.</p>\n<p>Representatives for the Indian Income Tax Department acknowledged our email requesting comment, but did not answer our questions by press time. The Income Tax Department did not present any objections to our publishing this story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-extremely-low-hanging-bug-granted-access-to-sensitive-data\">‘Extremely low-hanging’ bug granted access to sensitive data</h2>\n<p>The security researchers Akshay CS and “Viral” told TechCrunch that they discovered the vulnerability while filing their recent income tax return on the government website.</p>\n<p>Residents of India are required to file their annual earnings to calculate the taxes they owe to the Indian government.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that when they signed into the portal using their Permanent Account Number (PAN), an official document issued by the Indian income tax department, they could view anyone else’s sensitive financial data by swapping out their PAN for another PAN in the network request as the web page loads.</p>\n<p>This could be done using publicly available tools like Postman or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/viral-call-recording-app-neon-goes-dark-after-exposing-users-phone-numbers-call-recordings-and-transcripts/\" target=\"_blank\">Burp Suite</a> (or using the web browser’s in-built developer tools) and with knowledge of someone else’s PAN, the researchers told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The bug was exploitable by anyone who was logged-in to the tax portal because the Indian income tax department’s back-end servers were not properly checking who was allowed to access a person’s sensitive data. This class of vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a common and simple flaw that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/cisa-nsa-australia-idor-flaws/\" target=\"_blank\">governments have warned is easy to exploit</a> and can result in large-scale data breaches.</p>\n<p>“This is an extremely low-hanging thing, but one that has a very severe consequence,” the researchers told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In addition to the data of individuals, the researchers said that the bug also exposed data associated with companies who were registered with the e-Filing portal.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch also verified that the bug exposed data on individuals who have yet to file their income tax returns this year. We confirmed this by asking a person who had not yet filed their tax returns for their permission to have the researchers look up their information using the portal bug.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-cert-in-acknowledges-security-flaw\">CERT-In acknowledges security flaw</h2>\n<p>The security researchers alerted India’s computer emergency readiness team, or CERT-In, to the security flaw soon after their discovery, but were not provided with a timeline for the fix.</p>\n<p>When contacted by TechCrunch on September 30, a CERT-In representative said the Income Tax Department was already working to fix the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The Indian Ministry of Finance did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment. After reaching out to the Income Tax Department regarding the vulnerability, the director general of Systems acknowledged receipt of TechCrunch’s email on October 1, but did not comment further.</p>\n<p>It remains unclear how long the vulnerability has existed or whether any malicious actors have accessed the exposed data. CERT-In did not respond to these questions when asked by TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The exact number of users impacted by the exposed data is also unclear. The Income Tax Department’s portal lists more than 135 million registered users, and over 76 million users filed income tax returns in the financial year 2024-25, per <a href=\"https://eportal.incometax.gov.in/iec/foservices/#/pre-login/success-enablers\" target=\"_blank\">public data</a> available on the portal itself.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

California Governor Gavin Newsom <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/10/06/no-more-loud-commercials-governor-newsom-signs-sb-576/\" target=\"_blank\">signed the law</a> on Monday.</p>\n<p>Starting July 1, 2026, streaming services won’t be allowed to “transmit the audio of commercial advertisements louder than the video content the advertisements accompany,” according to the bill’s text.</p>\n<p>“We heard Californians loud and clear, and what’s clear is that they don’t want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program,” Governor Newsom said in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/10/06/no-more-loud-commercials-governor-newsom-signs-sb-576/\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. “By signing SB 576, California is dialing down this inconvenience across streaming platforms, which had previously not been subject to commercial volume regulations passed by Congress in 2010.”</p>\n<p>The legislation is modeled after the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, which in 2010 barred the audio of TV commercials from being broadcast louder than the TV program being aired. With this new legislation, streaming services must comply with the same commercial volume regulations as traditional TV broadcasters in California.</p>\n<p>Senate Bill 576 was authored by California State Senator Tom Umberg, who cited a complaint from his legislative director, Zach Keller, about how the loud volume of streaming commercials was waking Keller’s newborn daughter, Samantha.</p>\n<p>“This bill was inspired by baby Samantha and every exhausted parent who’s finally gotten a baby to sleep, only to have a blaring streaming ad undo all that hard work,” said Senator Thomas Umberg in the press release. “SB 576 brings some much-needed peace and quiet to California households by making sure streaming ads aren’t louder than the shows we actually want to watch.”</p>\n<p>Given California’s influence in the entertainment world, this legislation could pressure streaming platforms into cutting down on noisy commercials nationwide. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) paid $825,000 earlier this year to a company that manufactures vehicles equipped with various technologies for law enforcement, including fake cellphone towers known as “cell-site simulators,” which can be used to spy on nearby phones.  </p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=TECHOPS+SPECIALTY+VEHICLES%2C+LLC++AGENCY_NAME%3A%22Immigration+and+Customs+Enforcement%22&s=FPDS.GOV&templateName=1.5.3&indexName=awardfull&sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&desc=Y\" target=\"_blank\">public records</a>, the award dated May 8 “provides Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program” and is a modification for “additional CSS Vehicles.”  </p>\n<p>The contract was signed with TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), a Maryland-based company. TOSV also signed a similar contract with ICE in September 2024 for $818,000, showing that the relationship between the agency and the company predates the Trump administration.  </p>\n<p>TOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch in an email that he could not provide details about the ICE contracts and the vehicles, citing “trade secrets.” But Brianas did confirm that the company does provide cell-site simulators, although it does not make them. </p>\n<p>“We don’t manufacture electrical, comms, and technology components, we integrate that product into our overall design of the vehicle,” said Brianas, who declined to say from where TOSV sources its cell-site simulators.  </p>\n<p>This is the latest federal contract that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/\" target=\"_blank\">reveals some of the technologies</a> powering the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown. </p>\n<p>In early September, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-wiretap/2025/09/09/how-ice-is-using-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-peoples-phones/\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes found a recently unsealed search warrant</a> that showed that ICE used a cell-site simulator to track down a person who allegedly was part of a criminal gang in the United States, and who had been ordered to leave the country in 2023. In the article, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-wiretap/2025/09/09/how-ice-is-using-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-peoples-phones/\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes reported</a> that it also found a contract for “cell site simulator vehicles,” but the article did not name the company that provides the vans to the agency. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Cell-site simulators also go by the name “stingrays” because some of the earlier types of these devices, made by defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris), were named that way. Since then, stingrays have become a catch-all name for this type of technology, also known as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/02/who-catches-the-imsi-catchers-researchers-demonstrate-stingray-detection-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">IMSI catchers</a>. (IMSI stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity, a unique number that identifies every cellphone user in the world.) </p>\n<p>As the name suggests, cell-site simulator tools can mimic a cellphone tower, tricking every phone in its nearby range to connect to the device and thus giving law enforcement the ability to better identify the real-world location of those phones and their owners.  </p>\n<p>Some cell-site simulators can also intercept regular calls, text messages, and internet traffic. </p>\n<p>Authorities can get data from traditional cellphone towers to find the current or past location of a suspect, but the location is usually not very precise.  </p>\n<p>Stingray-like devices have been in use by law enforcement for more than a decade and have long been controversial because authorities do not always get a warrant for their use, and <a href=\"https://sls.eff.org/technologies/cell-site-simulators-imsi-catchers\" target=\"_blank\">critics say</a> these devices ensnare innocent people by default. These devices are also shrouded in secrecy, because the law enforcement agencies that use them are under strict non-disclosure agreements not to reveal how the devices work. </p>\n<p>ICE has a long history of using cell-site simulators. In 2020, documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union showed that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/aclu-ice-stingray-documents/\" target=\"_blank\">ICE deployed them at least 466 times between 2017 and 2019</a>. The agency used these tools more than 1,885 times between 2013 and 2017, <a href=\"http://buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/this-is-how-many-times-the-department-of-homeland-security\" target=\"_blank\">according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News</a> at the time. </p>\n<p>ICE acknowledged TechCrunch’s request for comment, but did not respond to a series of questions, which included: what ICE uses these vehicles for, whether and where they have recently been deployed, and whether the agency always gets a warrant when using cell-site simulators.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-from-surveillance-vans-to-bookmobiles-nbsp\">From surveillance vans to bookmobiles </h2>\n<p>Headquartered just outside of Washington, DC, TOSV sells a wide range of customizable vehicles to <a href=\"https://www.techopssv.com/law-enforcement\" target=\"_blank\">law enforcement</a>, such as vans for SWAT armed response teams, bomb squads, and so-called “mobile lab” and “cover surveillance” vehicles.  </p>\n<p>Among these vehicles for police forces, TOSV lists several “projects,” including one described as <a href=\"https://www.techopssv.com/projects/dhs-mobile-forensic-labs\" target=\"_blank\">DHS Mobile Forensic Labs</a>, referring to the Department of Homeland Security. </p>\n<p>According to the website, these mobile forensic vans are “equipped for on-site forensic analysis and documentation,” have “secure compartments for evidence preservation and investigative tools,” and enable “seamless case file updates and evidence logging.” </p>\n<p>Another project is the <a href=\"https://www.techopssv.com/projects-1/dhs-mobile-command-van\" target=\"_blank\">DHS Mobile Command Van</a>,” which TOSV says is “configurable for advanced surveillance and mission coordination.”  </p>\n<p>It’s unclear if these vans are the same vehicles that include cell-site simulators, as there’s no mention of the phone surveillance tool anywhere on TOSV’s website.  </p>\n<p>ICE has other contracts with TOSV for mobile forensic labs, which don’t specify which technologies are located in the vans. </p>\n<p>According to its website, TOSV also sells so-called “<a href=\"https://www.techopssv.com/community-outreach\" target=\"_blank\">bookmobiles</a>,” which appear to be libraries on wheels, as well as <a href=\"https://www.techopssv.com/medical-projects\" target=\"_blank\">medical</a> and <a href=\"http://techopssv.com/fire-and-ems\" target=\"_blank\">fire department</a> vehicles.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei is in India this week, with plans to set up an office in Bengaluru and explore a partnership with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, TechCrunch has learned. The move signals the AI startup’s push to deepen its presence in its second-largest market after the U.S.</p>\n<p>Amodei is expected to visit Mumbai to meet Ambani and other senior executives at Reliance Industries, India’s most valuable company and the parent of the nation’s top telecom operator, Reliance Jio, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Anthropic has been in discussions with Reliance for some time over a potential partnership to expand access to its Claude AI assistant in India, the people said.</p>\n<p>India — the world’s second-largest online market after China, with <a href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=155262&ModuleId=3\" target=\"_blank\">more than a billion internet subscribers</a> — has emerged as an important growth region for Anthropic. Several Indian AI startups already use its Claude models in their products for both domestic and U.S. clients. India also accounts for the second-highest share of traffic to Claude’s website after the U.S., according to digital intelligence firm <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/website/claude.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Similarweb</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg 1907w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=768,553 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=680,490 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=1200,865 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=1280,922 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=430,310 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=720,519 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=900,648 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=800,576 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=1536,1107 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=668,481 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=520,375 520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=856,617 856w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=708,510 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthropic-claude-monthly-visits-india-us_1dabf3.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In August, Reliance Industries <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/29/billionaire-ambani-taps-google-meta-to-build-indias-ai-backbone/\" target=\"_blank\">partnered with major technology companies</a>, including its existing investors Google and Meta, to build AI infrastructure and enterprise solutions through its new unit, Reliance Intelligence. The Mumbai-headquartered conglomerate had also explored a potential collaboration with OpenAI, which rolled out its under-$5 ChatGPT plan in India earlier this year and announced plans to open an office in New Delhi later in 2025.</p>\n<p>That Reliance-OpenAI partnership was expected to be announced during OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s planned visit to India last month, but Altman ultimately postponed the trip.</p>\n<p>Reliance Industries did not respond to a request for comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to OpenAI for comment.</p>\n<p>Alongside Mumbai, Amodei is visiting New Delhi to meet top lawmakers and senior federal government officials, sources said. He is also expected to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two people familiar with his trip plans told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Later in the week, Amodei will be in Bengaluru to announce Anthropic’s office opening on Thursday, sources told TechCrunch. Anthropic EMEA head Guillaume Princen and startups chief Daniel Delaney are also accompanying him. Prominent venture funds, including Accel and Lightspeed, are also hosting dedicated sessions with Anthropic executives this week to share insights on how developers and startups can leverage Claude for their offerings.</p>\n<p>Anthropic’s Claude app, available on iOS and Android, recorded a 48% year-over-year increase in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs this year, according to Appfigures. Consumer spending on the app in India surged 572% year-over-year, generating $195,000 in September alone, the data showed.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png 8140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=768,531 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=680,470 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=1200,830 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=1280,886 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=430,298 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=720,498 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=900,623 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=800,554 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=1536,1063 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=2048,1417 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=668,462 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=542,375 542w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=892,617 892w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=708,490 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/claude-app-spending.png?resize=50,35 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The India figures, however, remain modest compared with those in the United States, where downloads rose 91% year-over-year and consumer spending jumped 604%.

Deel on Thursday announced that it has raised a $300 million Series E round co-led by A-list fintech VC firm Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from existing investors like Coatue Management and General Catalyst.\nDeel says it’s been profitable for three years and surpassed $1 billion in ARR, including having a month — September — that hit $100 million in revenue. Deel’s business model focuses on serving global companies, handling the complexities of currency and employment regulation for far-flung international teams. It says it’s now grown to 35,000+ customers with more than 1.5 million workers in over 150 countries.\nThose are the types of numbers that attract investment, pending lawsuits or no. (Rippling’s California-filed lawsuit against Deel does not yet have a trial date and is in the discovery phase, according to court records.) Indeed, Ribbit’s founder, Micky Malka, and a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz, gave Deel their full-throated supported in the announcement. In prepared statements, Malka said that Ribbit has been a “fan” of the HR company for a long time, because it’s a “a brand companies trust,” and Horowitz said that a16z has been “blown away” by Deel’s work to build “the best HR platform” for global companies.\nFor what it’s worth, the lawsuits have not slowed down Rippling’s fundraising efforts either. In May, Rippling raised a $450 million Series G round at a $16.8 billion valuation.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n",

Flock’s government and police customers can also make natural language searches of their video footage to find people who match specific descriptions. However, AI-powered technology used by law enforcement has been proven to exacerbate racial biases.\nOn the same day that Ring announced this partnership, 404 Media reported that ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy had access to Flock’s network of cameras. By partnering with Ring, Flock could potentially access footage from millions more cameras.\nRing has long had a poor track record with keeping customers’ videos safe and secure. In 2023, the FTC ordered the company to pay $5.8 million over claims that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers’ videos for years.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Security\n",

The scope of the change is “quite wide” and includes components and assembly for the company’s future notebooks and server products, Nikkei cited a supply chain source as saying. \nThe company is reportedly asking its existing partners to prepare manufacturing capabilities outside the country starting next year, and it is also pushing to move some production of its Xbox gaming consoles to other parts of Asia.\nAmazon Web Services, meanwhile, is considering buying fewer printed circuit boards for its AI data centers from its long-time supplier SYE, and has conducted an evaluation of what it could need to do. And Google is pushing its suppliers to ramp up server production in Thailand, where it has already secured multiple partners for parts, components, and assembly, the report said.\nHowever, moving production outside the country so quickly would prove difficult, given the vast range of components involved and their Chinese partners’ technological and manufacturing prowess, Nikkei noted.\nThe news follows a wave of retaliatory measures from both China and the U.S., who have taken turns to impose increasing tariffs on each other, tighten export controls on crucial components and resources, and restrict what tech can be sold.\nMicrosoft, Google, and Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n",

The resignation follows Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff saying last week that he “fully supported” President Trump and thought National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets.\nConway has been on the board of Salesforce Foundation, whose mission is to support education and workforce development for disadvantaged youth, for a decade. The philanthropic organization donated $36 million in 2023 and ended that year with $400 million in assets, according to tax filings, the New York Times reported.\nBenioff and Conway have been friends for 25 years and shared left-leaning political views for the majority of that time. But the Salesforce CEO’s current ideological viewpoints upset Conway.\n“It saddens me immensely to say that with your recent comments, and failure to understand their impact, I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired,” Conway wrote on Thursday in an email to Benioff obtained by the New York Times.\nA Salesforce spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that Conway has resigned. “We have deep gratitude for Ron Conway and his incredible contributions to the Salesforce Foundation Board for over a decade,” the spokesperson said. \nIn an interview with the New York Times last week, Benioff praised Elon Musk’s government efficiency efforts and said that he wasn’t keeping up with reports on immigration raids or Trump’s attacks on the press. This even though Benioff owns the news magazine Time, which he purchased in 2018.\nBenioff is one of the many high-profile tech leaders and investors who, despite having previously supported the Democratic Party, have now voiced their support for Trump.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe rift between Benioff and Conway unfolded during Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference, one of the largest events held annually in San Francisco.

Once the 60 days are over, you’ll be blocked from using the Mac Messenger app. We encourage you to delete the app since it will no longer be usable.”\nMeta’s plan to wind down these desktop apps was first spotted by Appleinsider.\nThe company is now alerting users of the upcoming change to give them time to familiarize themselves with other options. For example, Windows users can use the Facebook desktop app, and both Windows and Mac users can access Messenger online.\nMeta is encouraging users to activate secure storage and to set up a PIN to save their chat history before moving to the web version. Once users transition to Facebook.com, their chat history will be available on all platforms. Users can check if they have secure storage turned on by clicking the settings icon above their profile picture and then selecting Privacy & safety > End-to-end encrypted chats. From there, they need to click “Message storage” to check if “Turn on secure storage” is turned on.\nThe move comes a year after Meta replaced the native Messenger app with a Progressive Web App back in September 2024. Of course, Meta’s decision to discontinue the desktop apps altogether will likely see some backlash from avid users of the apps. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The U.S. government is, according to these allegations, looking for posts that express views that the current government disfavors.\nThe lawsuit states that the list of forbidden posts include those that criticize the American culture and the U.S. government; that express antisemitic/pro-Palestine support, including support of university protests on the matter; those that rationalize or make light of Charlie Kirk’s murder; or that criticize the Trump administration or its actions.\nThe EFF also alleges that the government is threatening non-citizens with punishments, which includes revoking their visas to immigration confinement.\nThe lawsuit points to posts on the State Department’s X account. This includes the currently pinned thread documenting the visas that the department revoked over comments about Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans.The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk. Here are just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the U.S.:— Department of State (@StateDept) October 14, 2025\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of the auto union, teachers union, and communication workers union.\nThe EFF’s suit claims that these punitive actions, as well as the “viewpoint based” surveillance itself, is an unlawful violation of freedom of speech of these unions’ members.\nThe full lawsuit can be found here.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\nTravel search engine Kayak will now allow users to research trips ahead of booking using AI. The company this week launched an “AI Mode” feature that lets users ask travel-related questions as well as compare and book flights, hotels, and cars, through an AI chatbot integrated on the company’s website.\nThe feature is currently available across both desktop and mobile web, and takes advantage of Kayak’s integration with ChatGPT to deliver contextual results. \nThe rollout follows the company’s April launch of Kayak.ai, built as a testing ground for working with AI technology. That site also combined Kayak’s data and tools with OpenAI’s technology, letting its tech team try out AI features ahead of bringing them over to Kayak.com\nEssentially, the AI Mode feature offers the same functionality as the Kayak.ai website but is now built directly into Kayak’s website. The company suggests users could ask the chatbot for travel ideas, like locations to fly to for under a certain price point, the best deals to a preferred destination, comparing hotel amenities, finding nonstop flights and rental car options, and more.\nImage Credits:Kayak\nPlus, users can ask the AI more open-ended questions, like “I want to party for NYE — where should I go?” to get recommendations without having specific destinations in mind. Or they could learn when the best time to fly somewhere would be, based on ticket prices. (Kayak has shared other AI prompt ideas on its own blog.)\nThe feature could be useful in helping consumers in the earlier stages of travel planning, when they’re just exploring ideas. However, it remains to be seen if AI users readily convert to paying customers using these methods. \nAI Mode is initially available in English in the United States but will expand to other countries and languages later in the month. The company also plans to roll out the feature to more platforms and add support for voice-based requests “soon.”\nImage Credits:Kayak\nTravel is an area that’s being explored by AI providers and travel companies alike, as online booking can be a frustrating and tedious experience for consumers as it stands today. To test consumer demand for AI solutions, OpenAI recently announced deals with travel companies like Expedia and Booking.com (the latter is also owned by Kayak’s parent company, Booking Holdings). As a result, those services can now operate as apps inside ChatGPT.\nBy comparison, Kayak’s decision to run the AI chatbot on its own site could provide the company with more direct access to consumer insights about the AI’s use.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe sprawling metropolis of Phoenix continues to be a testbed for Waymo, and not just on the technical front. The Alphabet-owned company has used its first testing and commercial market to experiment with its business model, too, including delivery.\nWaymo is known for its robotaxis, but it has tested how its tech could be used for delivery. The company previously tapped UPS and Uber Eats for pilot programs, and it put considerable staff and resources toward developing self-driving trucks under its Waymo Via arm, before shuttering that program in 2023 to focus on robotaxis.\nNow it seems Waymo is ready to test the delivery waters through a strategic, multi-year partnership with DoorDash. Waymo doesn’t have any other active delivery-focused testing, operations, or partnerships, according to a company spokesperson.\nThe partnership will match DoorDash customers ordering food and groceries within a 315-square-mile area of Phoenix with a self-driving Waymo, the company wrote in a blog post.\nNot every DoorDash order will result in a Waymo delivery. Initially, the Waymo delivery service will deliver orders from DashMart — DoorDash’s convenience, grocery, and retail stores. The companies said that, over time, more local Phoenix merchants and a wider variety of offerings will be added.\nDavid Richter, Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at DoorDash, said the deal with Waymo will give customers a “new and delightful experience, while advancing our vision for a multi-modal autonomousfuture of local commerce.”\nDoorDash isn’t new to the autonomous vehicle technology arena. The company has partnered with sidewalk delivery bot company Serve Robotics to cover parts of Los Angeles. It also has its own in-house autonomous vehicle tech team that developed and produced an autonomous delivery bot called Dot. The delivery bot, which was revealed in September, is being tested in the Phoenix area.\nThe deal with Waymo won’t involve DoorDash’s Dot vehicle, however. Instead, food or groceries will be placed in the trunk of a Waymo vehicle — a driverless Jaguar I-Pace that will navigate on its own to the customer. From here, the customer will have to retrieve the items from the trunk via the DoorDash app. \nThis last step, which requires the customer to walk out to the car and grab the delivered items, will be the big test for both companies, hoping to determine if receiving groceries delivered by an autonomous vehicle outweighs the convenience of a human handing over the items at their door. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAmazon One Medical, the retailer’s primary care provider acquired in 2022, is launching a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for children ages 2 to 11, the company announced on Thursday. Message-based visits start at $29, and video visits cost $49.\nThe healthcare service doesn’t require insurance or a One Medical membership and can help treat issues like pink eye, lice, and more than 10 skin-related issues, including eczema, bug bites, contact dermatitis, fungal rashes, and more. The service also covers EpiPen and asthma medication renewals.\nAmazon started offering a pay-per-visit virtual healthcare service for adults in 2024.\n“This service isn’t meant to replace a family’s relationship with their child’s pediatrician, but rather to serve as a convenient option for those ‘in-between’ moments for parents with time-sensitive concerns who don’t already have on-demand access through a One Medical membership,” said Natasha Bhuyan, MD, family physician and national medical director for Amazon One Medical, in a press release. \nThe move comes as companies like Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart are scaling back their retail health services. \nAmazon last week debuted prescription vending machines at its One Medical clinics, starting in Los Angeles. The kiosks have a range of commonly prescribed medications, including antibiotics, inhalers, and blood pressure medications.\nThese new kiosks could disrupt brick-and-mortar pharmacy businesses, which are already struggling. For instance, Rite Aid recently closed all of its remaining stores; CVS has closed more than 1,000 stores since 2021; and Walgreens closed 500 stores over the past year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe launch of the new pay-per-visit service for kids marks Amazon’s latest move to expand its presence in the healthcare sector. In 2018, Amazon purchased online pharmacy PillPack for $750 million and then launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020.

    "body": "\nFor one week this summer, Taylor and her roommate wore GoPro cameras strapped to their foreheads as they painted, sculpted, and did household chores. They were training an AI vision model, carefully syncing their footage so the system could get multiple angles on the same behavior. It was difficult work in many ways, but they were well paid for it — and it allowed Taylor to spend most of her day making art. \n“We woke up, did our regular routine, and then strapped the cameras on our head and synced the times together,” she told me. “Then we would make our breakfast and clean the dishes. Then we’d go our separate ways and work on art.” \nThey were hired to produce five hours of synced footage each day, but Taylor quickly learned she needed to allot seven hours a day for the work, to leave enough time for breaks and physical recovery. \n“It would give you headaches,” she said. “You take it off and there’s just a red square on your forehead.” \nTaylor, who asked not to give her last name, was working as a data freelancer for Turing, an AI company that connected her to TechCrunch. Turing’s goal wasn’t to teach the AI how to make oil paintings, but to gain more abstract skills around sequential problem-solving and visual reasoning. Unlike a large language model, Turing’s vision model would be trained entirely on video — and most of it would be collected directly by Turing. \nAlongside artists like Taylor, Turing is contracting with chefs, construction workers, and electricians — anyone who works with their hands. Turing Chief AGI Officer Sudarshan Sivaraman told TechCrunch the manual collection is the only way to get a varied enough dataset. \n“We are doing it for so many different kinds of blue-collar work, so that we have a diversity of data in the pre-training phase,” Sivaraman told TechCrunch. “After we capture all this information, the models will be able to understand how a certain task is performed.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTuring’s work on vision models is part of a growing shift in how AI companies deal with data. Where training sets were once scraped freely from the web or collected from low-paid annotators, companies are now paying top dollar for carefully curated data.  \nWith the raw power of AI already established, companies are looking to proprietary training data as a competitive advantage. And instead of farming out the task to contractors, they’re often taking on the work themselves. \nThe email company Fyxer, which uses AI models to sort emails and draft replies, is one example.  \nAfter some early experiments, founder Richard Hollingsworth discovered the best approach was to use an array of small models with tightly focused training data. Unlike Turing, Fyxer is building off someone else’s foundation model — but the underlying insight is the same.  \n“We realized that the quality of the data, not the quantity, is the thing that really defines the performance,” Hollingsworth told me. \nIn practical terms, that meant some unconventional personnel choices. In the early days, Fyxer engineers and managers were sometimes outnumbered four to one by the executive assistants needed to train the model, Hollingsworth says. \n“We used a lot of experienced executive assistants, because we needed to train on the fundamentals of whether an email should be responded to,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s a very people-oriented problem. Finding great people is very hard.” \nThe pace of data collection never slowed down, but over time Hollingsworth became more precious about the datasets, preferring smaller sets of more tightly curated datasets when it came time for post-training. As he puts it, “the quality of the data, not the quantity, is the thing that really defines the performance.” \nThat’s particularly true when synthetic data is used, magnifying both the scope of possible training scenarios and the impact of any flaws in the original dataset. On the vision side, Turing estimates that 75% to 80% of its data is synthetic, extrapolated from the original GoPro videos. But that makes it even more important to keep the original dataset as high-quality as possible. \n“If the pre-training data itself is not of good quality, then whatever you do with synthetic data is also not going to be of good quality,” Sivaraman says. \nBeyond concerns of quality, there’s a powerful competitive logic behind keeping data collection in-house. For Fyxer, the hard work of data collection is one of the best moats the company has against competition. As Hollingsworth sees it, anyone can build an open source model into their product — but not everyone can find expert annotators to train it into a workable product. \n“We believe that the best way to do it is through data,” he told TechCrunch, “through building custom models, through high-quality, human-led data training.” \nCorrection: A previous version of this piece referred to Turing by an incorrect name. TechCrunch regrets the error.\n",

Ultimately, a bankruptcy administrator put the company’s assets through a competitive bid process. \nNow, some of its tech will live on over at Archer Aviation, which beat out Ambitious Air Mobility Group and U.S. based Joby Aviation with the winning bid of €18 million ($21 million) for all 300 of Lilium’s patent assets. Joby Aviation confirmed it participated in the bid.\nLilium, which was founded in 2015, was developing a vertical take-off and landing aircraft with speeds of up to 100 km/h. The company raised more than $1 billion from investors before going public in 2021 on the Nasdaq Exchange via a reverse merger with a blank-check company, SPAC Qell. While it managed to land high-profile investors like Tencent and lock in customers, including an order for 100 electric jets from Saudi Arabia, it burned through cash long before it could deliver a product. \nAn Archer spokesperson said the patents span critical eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) technologies, including high-voltage systems, flight controls, ducted fans, and advanced aircraft design. The new patents represent a “strong addition” to Archer’s growing IP portfolio, which now totals more than 1,000 global patent assets, the spokesperson noted in an email.\nWhat Archer plans to do with those patents isn’t totally clear, although there are hints. Lilium’s electric ducted fans would be a good application for light-sport or regional electric flight — which goes beyond Archer’s original mission.\nArcher, which went public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, initially focused on developing an air taxi network. It added a defense program in December, which included an exclusive deal with weapons manufacturer Anduril to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered VTOL aircraft for critical defense applications. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

The media has also been documenting the problem, while openly wondering if AI has already ruined Pinterest or if it could still be fixed.\nThe problem, if left unresolved, could destroy Pinterest’s reputation and, ultimately, its bottom line.\nAI slop is potentially a tough nut to crack as more of the web fills up with AI-generated content and the quality of the AI content improves, making it less obvious to spot. Citing academic literature, Pinterest notes that GenAI content now makes up 57% of all online material.\nTo address the issue, Pinterest earlier this year introduced “AI modified” labels that would appear on images whose metadata indicated AI generation, or if Pinterest’s own systems detected that the content was AI-generated. At the time, the company said it would “soon” introduce consumer-facing tools that would let users choose to see less AI content.\nImage Credits:Pinterest\nThose tools have now arrived and will be available in the app’s “Settings” menu, under “Refine your recommendations.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHere, users will be able to configure whether they’d like to see less GenAI content in certain categories that are prone to AI-generated imagery, like beauty, art, fashion, and home décor. Pinterest said it will introduce more categories in the future, based on user feedback. Plus, if users want to modify their settings, they can do so at any time.\nIn addition, users can send feedback about AI imagery as they browse the site. If they see a Pin that’s not appealing because of its generative AI nature, they can tap the three-dot overflow menu and select a category to refine their preferences. \nThe new controls are launching first on the website and Android and will roll out to iOS users over the weeks ahead, Pinterest said.\n“Our community is at the heart of everything we do,” said Matt Madrigal, Pinterest’s chief technology officer, in a statement about the launch. “With our new GenAI controls, we’re empowering people to personalize their Pinterest experience more than ever — striking the right balance between human creativity and AI innovation, and ensuring every feed truly reflects what inspires them most.”\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nEnergy startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said Thursday it’s working with Google’s DeepMind division to fine tune — and even improve — the operation of its forthcoming Sparc reactor using AI.\nThe companies’ plan will simulate the plasma that will burn inside CFS’s reactor using specialized DeepMind software known as Torax. They also plan on pairing Torax with AI models to help CFS figure out how best to achieve fusion power.\nFusion power promises to deliver massive amounts of electricity with zero emissions from a near limitless source of fuel: water. AI-related companies have been bullish on fusion startups as a source of electricity to power energy-hungry data centers. Google appears to be eyeing them as potential customer as well.\nThis isn’t Google’s first foray into nuclear fusion. The tech company has worked with another fusion startup, TAE Technologies, to use AI to study how plasma behaves inside TAE’s fusion machine. \nThere’s a reason Google keeps coming back to the problem: AI might be uniquely suited to making fusion power possible. \nOne of the biggest challenges facing fusion startups is keeping the plasma inside a reactor hot enough for long enough. Unlike nuclear fission reactions, which are self-sustaining, fusion reactions are difficult to maintain outside of stars like the sun. Without that sort of mass and gravity, the plasma is constantly in danger of diffusing and snuffing itself out. \nIn CFS’s reactors, powerful magnets substitute for gravity to help corral the plasma, but they’re not perfect. Reactor operators have to develop control software that can enable the device to continuously react to changing plasma conditions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nProblem is, there are almost too many knobs to turn, certainly more than a human is capable of. That’s the sort of problem that AI excels at. Experts have cited AI as one of the key technologies that has enabled the industry’s remarkable advances over the past several years.\nCFS is currently building Sparc, its demonstration reactor, in a suburb outside Boston. The device is about two-thirds completed, and when finished later in 2026, the startup is predicting that it will be the first fusion device capable of producing more power than the plant needs to run itself.\nGoogle said Torax can be used with reinforcement learning or evolutionary search models to find the “most efficient and robust paths to generating net energy.” The two companies are also exploring whether AI can be used to control the reactor’s operation. \nIn August, Google participated in CFS’s $863 million Series B2 round alongside Nvidia. Earlier this year, Google also said it would buy 200 megawatts of electricity from CFS’s first commercial power plant, Arc, which is planned to be built outside Richmond, Virginia. The tech company is also an investor in CFS competitor TAE Technologies. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

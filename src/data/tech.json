Two weeks later, the MPA sent Meta a cease-and-desist letter, asserting that Meta’s claim that content on teen Instagram accounts would follow PG-13 guidelines is “literally false and highly misleading.”\nThe company states that its movie-rating system can’t be compared to Meta’s content restrictions, which it says “appear to rely heavily on artificial intelligence.”\n“The MPA has worked for decades to earn the public’s trust in its rating system,” said the letter. “Any dissatisfaction with Meta’s automated classification will inevitably cause the public to question the integrity of the MPA’s rating system.”\nIn response to the letter, Meta stated that it hasn’t claimed its teen accounts were certified by the MPA or officially PG-13 rated. Additionally, the company says its content restrictions are “guided” by PG-13, rather than directly linked to the MPA. Meta also says its use of the term qualifies as fair use.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced on his social media platform Truth Social that he is re-nominating Shift4 founder Jared Isaacman to lead the NASA, the nation’s space agency, months after withdrawing the nomination.\nThe reversal comes after weeks of online sniping from Elon Musk and others directed at Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who has been leading NASA in an interim capacity.\n“The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming. I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations,” Isaacman — who is also a billionaire pilot and private astronaut — wrote in a post on X on Tuesday evening.\nEarlier Tuesday, before the re-nomination, Isaacman posted his vision for NASA on the platform. He decided to publish those plans after a draft version was circulated in Washington among those seeking to keep Duffy in charge of NASA. Isaacman said he suspected “political operators” were “causing the controversy” between himself and Duffy.\n",

Rappaport added that while a milestone, the deal still has a way to go before it officially closes.\nTechCrunch reached out to Wiz for more and for more information regarding the timeline to close.\nGoogle initially approached Wiz in 2024 with an offer to buy the startup for $23 billion. Wiz walked away from that offer and Rappaport said, at the time, that he felt the business could grow to be a lot bigger than that.\nHe was right. Google and Wiz revived acquisition talks in the first few months of 2025, and Google announced it was buying Wiz for $32 billion in March.\nBloomberg initially reported that the deal was under antitrust review in June. The deal is expected to close in early 2026, according to Reuters.\n",

Only, it’s a circle of profit that ensures the money eventually comes back to their own coffers.\nCase in point: SoftBank, which is investing tens of billions into OpenAI and committing dozens more to build AI data centers and infrastructure, just launched a joint venture with the ChatGPT maker in Japan that will localize and sell the AI company’s enterprise tech to companies in the country. And the first customer of this joint venture is going to be SoftBank itself.\nCalled SB OAI Japan, the joint venture will be owned 50-50 by SoftBank and OpenAI, and will provide what the companies are calling “Crystal intelligence,” which is being defined as a “packaged enterprise AI solution” targeted at corporate management and operations in Japan.\n“Crystal intelligence is designed to help organizations enhance productivity and management efficiency through the adoption of advanced AI tools. The solution combines OpenAI’s enterprise offerings with localized implementation and support provided through SB OAI Japan,” SoftBank said in a statement.\nIt seems SoftBank is intent on fueling the AI hype cycle, and the resultant revenues: The conglomerate said all its employees are “actively utilizing AI in their daily operations,” and that it has so far created 2.5 million custom ChatGPT instances for internal use.\nThe conglomerate said it would put the joint venture’s solutions to use throughout its various businesses, validate their effectiveness for product development and “business transformation,” and then pass on the insights and expertise it gains to other companies back through SB OAI Japan.\nThe joint venture comes as analysts raise concerns about the truckloads of cash being thrown at AI development and associated efforts, as well as the stratospheric valuations awarded to companies benefiting from it. The movement is being likened to the dot-com boom, when the widespread adoption of the internet resulted in a wave of venture capital and sky-high valuations, and similar booms over the past couple of decades where massive sums were spent on developing unproven business models without a clear sign of meaningful returns on investment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Now, the company is upgrading the app with Gemini to let users ask its AI bot questions while driving, improve navigation, and perform more tasks.\nWhile driving, users can now ask Gemini to answer questions about places of interest on their route, return results about other topics (like sports or news), and even perform tasks like adding events to their calendar. \nYou can ask multiple questions in a conversation, too: for example, “Is there a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route, something within a couple of miles? … What’s parking like there?”\nDrivers can even report traffic incidents using Gemini, and Maps will proactively notify users of disruptions on the route ahead.\nImage Credits: Google\nGoogle is also adding a new feature to Maps that combines Gemini with Street View data to improve navigation instructions. So instead of telling you to turn right after, say, 500 feet, Maps will now mention a nearby landmark, like gas stations, restaurants or famous buildings, and highlight them before you have to make the turn. \nThe company said that Gemini cross-references information about 250 million places with Street View images to identify important and visible landmarks for navigation.\nMaps is also getting the ability to answer questions about your surroundings by working together with Google Lens. So you can point the camera at places of interest, like restaurants and landmarks, and ask questions like, “What is this place and why is it popular?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle said the new Gemini navigation features will be rolled out to iOS and Android devices in the coming weeks, and said support for Android Auto would be coming soon.

    "body": "\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is calling Google’s proposal in its antitrust settlement with the Fortnite maker a “comprehensive solution” that “genuinely doubles down” on Android’s vision of being an open platform. \nThe companies on Tuesday reached a settlement that sees the search giant agreeing to Android app store reforms that include lowering fees and enabling more competition.\nUnder the new proposal, which still requires the judge’s approval, Google will allow Android app developers to point users to alternative payment mechanisms inside their apps and through external web links. It also caps the fees Google is able to charge developers at either 9% or 20%, depending on the type of transaction.\nIn a post on X, Sameer Samat, president of the Android Ecosystem at Google, wrote that the company’s proposed changes “focus on expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe.” If approved by the court, the deal would put an end to the antitrust litigation.\nSweeney praised the proposal, calling it “awesome,” and contrasted it with Apple’s model, which he said was focused on “blocking all competing stores and leaving payments as the only vector for competition.” \nApple has argued its policies are about protecting consumers and managing App Store security. That said, the iPhone maker recently reported record revenue for its Services business, which includes the App Store — the segment’s revenue rose 15% to $28.75 billion in the last quarter from a year earlier.\nEpic Games had sued both Google and Apple, accusing their respective app store ecosystems of being  anti-competitive, and alleging the companies have too much control, charge excessive fees, and favor their own in-app payment systems. Apple largely won its case with Epic, but had to modify its App Store rules to allow for alternative payment options. Google, however, lost its appeal in July after a jury found that the search giant had stifled competition and needed to make changes.\nAfter the win, Sweeney announced that the Epic Games Store for Android would be coming to the Google Play Store.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nCybersecurity is a massive sector, but startups in the category are more likely to be acquired than go public. Even Wiz, which for a time held the title of the fastest-growing startup, abandoned its IPO ambitions when it agreed to sell to Google earlier this year.\nIn the past few years, there have been scant few significant cybersecurity listings:  SentinelOne IPO’d in 2021, Rubrik did so last year, and Netscope went public in September.\nArmis, a nine-year-old cybersecurity startup based out of San Francisco, intends to follow in these companies’ footsteps. The company said on Wednesday that it has raised a $435 million pre-IPO round led by Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives. CapitalG made a significant investment in the round, and new investor Evolution Equity Partners also participated. \nThe round values Armis at $6.1 billion, a meaningful jump from the $4.5 billion tender offer valuation the startup announced in August.\nArmis is hoping to launch its IPO in late 2026 or early 2027, its co-founder and CEO, Yevegny Dibrov (pictured above; right), told TechCrunch.\nThe round comes in the wake of significant acquisition interest in the company.

Prefer standing floor tickets.” AI Mode will then search across multiple websites to find real-time ticket options that meet your specific requests. It will then present you with a curated list of ticket prices to choose from. AI Mode links you directly to the booking page so you can finalize your purchase.\nThe new agentic capabilities are available to all users opted into Google’s experimental arm, Search Labs, in the U.S. The company notes that Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers have access to high limits.\nGoogle first brought agentic capabilities to AI Mode back in August, when it started letting people use the feature to find restaurant reservations.\nImage Credits:Google\nWith this capability, you can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. For example, you could ask, “Find me a dinner reservation for three people this Friday after 6 p.m. around Logan Square. Craving ramen or bibimbap.”\nAI Mode will then search across different reservation platforms to find real-time availability for restaurants that match the inquiry. It then surfaces a curated list of options to choose from. \n“Our priority in Google Search is connecting you with high-quality information you can rely on,” Google explained on its Search Labs page. “This new mode is rooted in our core quality and safety systems, but it’s still an early experiment and may make mistakes.”\nGoogle first launched AI Mode in March to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. Since then, the tech giant has brought AI Mode to more than 180 countries and has been building it out with new functionalities. For instance, AI Mode recently got access to a Canvas feature that helps you build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel. It also now lets you use Google Lens to ask about what’s on your desktop screen.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPeople Inc., one of the largest media publishers in the U.S., has signed an AI licensing deal with Microsoft. The media giant (formerly known as Dotdash Meredith) made the announcement Tuesday as a part of parent company IAC’s third-quarter earnings. \nUnder the deal, People Inc. will become a launch partner in Microsoft’s publisher content marketplace. This is the company’s second AI deal following its earlier agreement with OpenAI last year.\nPeople Inc. CEO Neil Vogel described the new marketplace as “essentially a pay-per-use market where AI players directly can compensate publishers for use of their content on, sort of like an ‘a la carte’ basis.”\nHe also praised Microsoft for being committed to paying for content to support its AI efforts, adding that Microsoft’s Copilot would be the first buyer for the marketplace. \n“It’s a very strong endorsement of us to be in the room with them and a very strong endorsement of the publishing marketplace and the value of content to make AI that is of high value,” Vogel said. \nThe announcement of the Microsoft deal was shared during IAC’s earnings, alongside the news that Google Search’s AI Overviews has been hurting the publisher’s traffic. For the first time, People Inc. shared data with investors that showed how Google Search, which accounted for 54% of its traffic two years ago, had dropped to 24% of its traffic during the past quarter.\nThe agreement differs from the OpenAI deal, which Vogel characterized as more of an “all-you-can-eat” model, but said People Inc. was happy with either model. What matters to the company is that its work is “respected and paid for,” he said. The company didn’t share the specific deal terms, though. \nPeople Inc. has taken issue with the way AI companies have ingested media without paying to fuel their AI products and train their models. Recently, Vogel criticized Google, calling the tech giant a “bad actor” because it uses the same bot to crawl websites for its Google search engine and its AI features. Publishers can’t block the bot, as Google search still accounts for a large percentage of their traffic.\nHowever, People Inc. uses the technology from web infrastructure provider Cloudflare to block other AI crawlers, prompting AI players to approach it with content deals. In September, Vogel attributed its decision to leverage Cloudflare’s tech as a way to push AI companies to the negotiating table, noting that its progress on deals was “much further along” after adopting the solution.\nHe reiterated those comments on today’s earnings call with investors, saying that blocking AI crawlers has been “very effective” and “brought almost everyone to the table.” Vogel suggested that more deals would be announced in time, as well. \nIAC reported that People Inc. grew its digital revenue 9% to $269 million in the quarter, driven by performance marketing and licensing, which saw 38% and 24% growth, respectively. It also noted its acquisition of a food-focused media publisher and influencer network Feedfeed.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWhen Nvidia announced its Rubin series of GPUs in March, it also dropped a bomb: racks built with the Ultra version of the chip, which is expected to be released in 2027, could draw up to 600 kilowatts of electricity. That’s nearly twice as much juice as some of the fastest EV chargers can deliver today.\nAs data center racks become that power-hungry, one of the biggest hurdles will be figuring out how to keep them cool. One startup thinks stacks of metal are the answer.\nAlloy Enterprises has developed a technology that turns sheets of copper into solid cooling plates for GPUs and for peripheral chips, the supporting components like memory and networking hardware that account for about 20% of a server’s cooling load. \n“We didn’t care too much about that 20% when racks were 120 kilowatts,” Ali Forsyth, co-founder and CEO of Alloy Enterprises, told TechCrunch. But now, as racks have hit 480 kilowatts on their way to 600 kilowatts, engineers have to figure out how to liquid cool everything from RAM to networking chips, parts for which there are no solutions available today.\nAlloy’s approach uses additive manufacturing (building objects layer by layer) to produce cold plates that are capable of squeezing into tight spots while withstanding the high pressures that liquid cooling can demand.\nImage Credits:Alloy Enterprises\nBut the startup doesn’t use 3D printing. Rather, it takes sheets of metal and forces them to bond using a combination of heat and pressure. It’s more expensive than traditional machining, but cheaper than 3D printing.\nThe result is a cold plate that, for all intents and purposes, is a single block of metal. There’s no seam, unlike machined products, and it’s solid metal, unlike 3D printed versions, which can be porous. “We hit raw material properties,” Forsyth said. “The copper is just as strong as if you had machined it.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMost cold plates are machined, a process that uses tools to carve out features. Because the tools are large, each half of the plate has to be machined separately. The two halves are then sintered together — a process that fuses metal powders using heat — which introduces a seam that could potentially leak under high pressure. Alloy’s process, a type of diffusion bonding it calls stack forging, makes seamless cold plates. \nStack forging can also make smaller features, down to 50 microns, about half the width of a human hair, allowing more coolant to flow past the metal. Alloy’s cold plates have 35% better thermal performance than competitors, Forsyth said.\nBecause of the complexities of stack forging, Alloy does most of the internal design. Customers submit key specifications and dimensions, and the startup’s software helps translate those into a shape that works for the company’s manufacturing process.\nIn Alloy’s factory, rolls of copper are first prepped and cut to size. The features are then cut out using a laser. Parts of the design that the company doesn’t want to bond to each other are coated with an inhibitor. When completed, each slice of a cold plate is registered and stacked before heading into a diffusion bonding machine, which uses heat and pressure to press the stacked slices into a single piece of metal.\nForsyth said her company is working with “all the big names” in the data center world, though she wouldn’t disclose specifics. \nInitially, the company had designed the technology to work with a widely used aluminum alloy, but as it received more interest from data centers, it ported the process to work with copper, which conducts heat well and resists corrosion. When Alloy announced the product in June, “things just blew up,” Forsyth said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe University of Pennsylvania confirmed on Tuesday that a hacker stole university data as part of last week’s data breach, during which alumni and other affiliates received suspicious emails from official university email addresses.\n“We got hacked,” the message from the hackers read. “We love breaking federal laws like FERPA (all your data will be leaked),” the message added. “Please stop giving us money.”\nWhile Penn initially told TechCrunch that the email was “fraudulent,” the university has now confirmed the hacker’s claim that data was taken during the breach.\n“On October 31, Penn discovered that a select group of information systems related to Penn’s development and alumni activities had been compromised,” the university wrote in a statement, which was emailed to alumni and shared online. “Penn’s staff rapidly locked down the systems and prevented further unauthorized access; however, not before an offensive and fraudulent email was sent to our community and information was taken by the attacker.”\n(Disclosure: As an alumna and former employee of the university, the hackers sent the message to my personal email three times, each coming from different official @upenn.edu email addresses, including one from a senior Penn staff member.)\nA partially redacted email sent by hackers from a university of Pennsylvania email address.Image Credits:TechCrunch (Screenshot)\nThe university said that the breach occurred due to a social engineering attack, a hacking technique in which individuals are tricked into handing over sensitive information like log-in credentials, perhaps through phishing or a phone call.\nA Penn employee, who we are not naming as they were not authorized to speak to the press, told TechCrunch that the university requires students, staff, and alumni to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their accounts as a security measure; however, the employee said that some high-ranking officials were granted exemptions to MFA requirements.\nTechCrunch asked Penn about these alleged MFA exceptions, and if the university could provide a percentage of MFA adoption among staff. Penn spokesperson Ron Ozio declined to comment to TechCrunch beyond Penn’s official data incident page.\nAs required by law, Penn said it will contact individuals whose personal information was accessed by hackers. The university has not said when these notifications will occur, how many people are affected, or what information was accessed.\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian reports that the alleged Penn hacker claimed to have taken documents relating to university donors, bank transaction receipts, and personally identifiable information. The hacker said they were financially motivated.\nEarlier this year, hackers breached Columbia University, accessing sensitive information about around 870,000 students and applicants, including their Social Security numbers and citizenship status.\nBoth the Penn and Columbia hacks appear motivated by discontent with affirmative action policies. In the email that the Penn hacker sent to the university community, the hacker wrote, “We hire and admit morons because we love legacies, donors, and unqualified affirmative action admits.” Meanwhile, the Columbia hacker told Bloomberg that they sought to access data from the university to investigate its affirmative action practices. \nIf you have more information about the Penn hack, you can contact Amanda Silberling securely on Signal at @amanda.100, or by email, from a non-work device.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nAmazon has told Perplexity to get its agentic browser out of its online store, the companies both confirmed publicly on Tuesday. After warning Perplexity multiple times that Comet, its AI-powered shopping assistant, was violating Amazon’s terms of service by not identifying itself as an agent, the e-commerce giant sent the AI search engine startup a sternly worded cease-and-desist letter, Perplexity wrote in a blog post titled “Bullying is not innovation.”\n“This week, Perplexity received an aggressive legal threat from Amazon, demanding we prohibit Comet users from using their AI assistants on Amazon. This is Amazon’s first legal salvo against an AI company, and it is a threat to all internet users,” Perplexity lamented in the blog post.\nPerplexity’s argument is that, since its agent is acting on behalf of a human user’s direction, the agent automatically has the “same permissions” as the human user. The implication is that it doesn’t have to identify itself as an agent.\nAmazon’s response points out that other third-party agents working at the behest of human users do identify themselves. “It is how others operate, including food delivery apps and the restaurants they take orders for, delivery service apps and the stores they shop from, and online travel agencies and the airlines they book tickets with for customers,” Amazon’s statement explains.\nIf Amazon is to be believed, then Perplexity could simply identify its agent and start shopping. Of course, the risk is that Amazon, which has its own shopping bot called Rufus, could also block Comet — or any other third-party agentic shopper — from its site.\nAmazon suggests as much as its statement, which also says, “We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers from other businesses should operate openly and respect service provider decisions whether or not to participate.”\nPerplexity claims that Amazon would block the shopping bot because Amazon wants to sell advertising and product placements. Unlike human shoppers, a bot tasked with buying a new laundry basket presumably wouldn’t find itself buying a more expensive one, or getting lured into buying the latest Brandon Sanderson novel and a new set of earphones (on sale!).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf all of this sounds a bit familiar, that’s because it is. A few months ago, Cloudflare published research accusing Perplexity of scraping websites while specifically defying requests from websites blocking AI bots. Interestingly, many people came to Perplexity’s defense that time, because this wasn’t a clear-cut case of web crawler bad behavior. Cloudflare documented how the AI was accessing a specific public website when its user asked about that specific website. Perplexity fans argued that this is exactly what every human-operated web browser does.\nOn the other hand, Perplexity was using some questionable methods to do that accessing when a website opted out of bots, like hiding its identity.\nAs TechCrunch reported at the time, the Cloudflare incident foreshadowed the challenges to come if the agentic world materializes as Silicon Valley predicts it will. If consumers and companies outsource their shopping, travel bookings, and restaurant reservations to bots, will it be in the best interest of websites to block bots entirely? How will they allow and work with them?\nPerplexity may be right in that Amazon is setting a precedent. As the 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce, it is clearly saying that the way this should work is for an agent to identify itself and let the website decide.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nRivian has created its second spinoff company this year: an industrial AI and robotics venture called Mind Robotics.\nThe new effort will be focused around using “industrial AI to reshape how physical world businesses operate and leverage Rivian operations data as the foundation for a robotics data flywheel,” according to the company’s third-quarter shareholder letter published Tuesday.\nThat’s a mouthful of buzzwords, and Rivian declined to clarify beyond that explanation. On an investor call Tuesday, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said his company realized it had the chance to “develop products and robotic solutions that allow us to run and operate our manufacturing plants more efficiently.” Scaringe will serve as chairman of the board of directors for Mind Robotics, according to a filing, and Rivian is a shareholder, he said on the call.\n“As much as we’ve seen AI shift how we operate and run our businesses through the wide-ranging applications for LLMs, the potential for AI to really shift how we think about operating in the physical world is, in some ways, unimaginably large,” Scaringe said on the call. “So the creation of this company is ultimately the culmination of us coming to the view that we wanted to have direct control and direct influence over the design and development of advanced AI robotics that would be very focused on industrial applications.”\nMind Robotics has already raised a $115 million seed round, which was led by VC firm Eclipse. Jiten Behl, a partner at Eclipse who also used to work at Rivian, revealed the investment in a LinkedIn post after TechCrunch previously reported the firm’s involvement in an earlier version of this story.\nThe launch of Mind Robotics marks the second time this year that Rivian has created a new stand-alone company. In March, the company spun out its skunkworks micromobility division into a startup called Also Inc. That new company was funded in part by money from Eclipse, with additional funding from Greenoaks Capital.\nIt’s unclear if Rivian employees are moving over to Mind Robotics, like was the case with Also. A Rivian spokesperson declined to say. But the company hinted at the possibility in Tuesday’s letter.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“With our strong bench of technology talent and an innovation-driven culture, we have been able to identify additional areas of value to accelerate our mission on a wider scale while maintaining Rivian’s focus,” Scaringe wrote.\nRobotics and industrial AI are hot areas for investment right now. There is a slew of humanoid robotics companies raising money and trying to ship products, including Tesla. General Motors is working on its own robotics and AI division, too. \nBeyond Rivian’s announcement Tuesday, though, very little is known about what Mind Robotics will get up to. There is essentially no digital footprint for the company yet, save for the trademark application. That application is very broadly targeted and says Mind Robotics could use the trademark for everything from machinery, to vehicles, to “incubators for eggs.”\nThis story has been updated with new information from a regulatory filing in the third paragraph, the LinkedIn post in the fifth paragraph, and from the investor call throughout.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nSora, the AI video generator from OpenAI, is now officially available for Android users in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. \nInitially launched as an iOS app in September, Sora quickly rose to the top of the App Store charts, amassing over 1 million downloads in a week. With its arrival on the Google Play Store, Sora is expected to attract a larger user base, likely resulting in a surge in downloads.  \nThe Android version retains all the features of its iOS counterpart, including the “Cameos” feature, which allows users to generate videos of themselves performing various activities using their own likeness. \nThe videos can be shared in a feed reminiscent of TikTok, allowing users to discover and engage with content from others. This appears to be a strategic move by OpenAI to strengthen its position in the competitive landscape of short-form video sharing. The AI giant aims to rival major players like Meta, which has recently launched its own AI video feed called Vibes, as well as existing platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.\n— Sora (@soraofficialapp) November 4, 2025 \nHowever, the app has faced criticism for its handling of deepfakes. After its initial launch, users began uploading disrespectful videos of historical figures, including Martin Luther King Jr. As a result, Sora paused the generation of content depicting Dr. King last month and strengthened its guardrails.\nThe company also recently addressed the backlash surrounding copyrighted characters, such as SpongeBob and Pikachu, by changing its policy for the Sora app from an “opt-out” approach to an “opt-in” system for rights holders.\nAdditionally, it’s currently involved in a legal dispute with celebrity video maker Cameo regarding the name of Sora’s flagship feature, “Cameo.”\nLooking ahead, OpenAI plans to introduce additional features to Sora. These include character cameos, letting users create AI-generated videos featuring their pets and inanimate objects. Basic video editing tools are also on the way, including the ability to stitch multiple clips together. Sora also plans to help users customize their social feeds, focusing on content from selected individuals rather than a large audience.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

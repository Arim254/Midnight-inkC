    "body": "\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced on his social media platform Truth Social that he is re-nominating Shift4 founder Jared Isaacman to lead the NASA, the nation’s space agency, months after withdrawing the nomination.\nThe reversal comes after weeks of online sniping from Elon Musk and others directed at Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who has been leading NASA in an interim capacity.\n“The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming. I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations,” Isaacman — who is also a billionaire pilot and private astronaut — wrote in a post on X on Tuesday evening.\nEarlier Tuesday, before the re-nomination, Isaacman posted his vision for NASA on the platform. He decided to publish those plans after a draft version was circulated in Washington among those seeking to keep Duffy in charge of NASA. Isaacman said he suspected “political operators” were “causing the controversy” between himself and Duffy.\n",

But it is the latest hurdle in Tesla’s lengthy campaign to sway shareholders to give Musk the largest corporate performance pay package in history.

It’s worth noting that if a deal does come together, iHeartMedia might not license its entire podcast catalog to the streaming service.\nThe news comes a few weeks after Netflix signed a similar deal with Spotify that will bring a curated selection of sports, culture, lifestyle, and true crime podcasts from Spotify Studios and The Ringer to Netflix.\nUnder the Spotify deal, podcasts available on Netflix will be removed from YouTube but remain on Spotify. Some of Spotify’s biggest shows, including “The Joe Rogan Experience,” will remain on YouTube.\nFor Netflix, these video podcast deals will give it a new way to better compete with YouTube, which is the most-watched platform for video podcasts after surpassing 1 billion monthly active podcast viewers earlier this year. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n",

    "body": "\nWhatsApp announced on Tuesday that it’s launching an Apple Watch companion app. For the first time, WhatsApp users will be able to use their Apple Watch to get call notifications, read full messages, and record and send voice messages.\n“This new experience will help you stay on top of your chats without needing to pull out your iPhone,” WhatsApp wrote in a blog post. “In addition to reading and responding to messages, for the first time, WhatsApp on Apple Watch will now support many requested features.”\nOther supported features include the ability to react to messages and the option to see more of your chat history on-screen when reading messages. Additionally, you will see clearer images and stickers.\nThe Meta-owned messaging app notes that, as always, your personal messages and calls are protected with end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp also says that it plans to deliver even more functionality to Apple Watches in the future.\nThe new WhatsApp Apple Watch app requires an Apple Watch Series 4 or later, running watchOS 10 or later.\nTuesday’s announcement doesn’t come as a total surprise, as WhatsApp was spotted testing the new Apple Watch app last week.\nWhatsApp has been working to make it easier for users to access its service beyond mobile and desktop. In May, WhatsApp debuted its long-awaited iPad app, which allows you to make video and audio calls with up to 32 people, share your screen, and use both front and rear cameras. Before the launch of the app, if you wanted to use WhatsApp on your iPad, you had to use the web version in a browser.\nWhatsApp’s launch of an Apple Watch app comes a few months after Snapchat rolled out one as well. The app allows users to preview an incoming message and also reply using the keyboard, Scribble, Dictation, or an emoji. Snapchat is focused on using its watchOS app to enable users to quickly respond to messages, not to view images or videos.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPeople Inc., one of the largest media publishers in the U.S., has signed an AI licensing deal with Microsoft. The media giant (formerly known as Dotdash Meredith) made the announcement Tuesday as a part of parent company IAC’s third-quarter earnings. \nUnder the deal, People Inc. will become a launch partner in Microsoft’s publisher content marketplace. This is the company’s second AI deal following its earlier agreement with OpenAI last year.\nPeople Inc. CEO Neil Vogel described the new marketplace as “essentially a pay-per-use market where AI players directly can compensate publishers for use of their content on, sort of like an ‘a la carte’ basis.”\nHe also praised Microsoft for being committed to paying for content to support its AI efforts, adding that Microsoft’s Copilot would be the first buyer for the marketplace. \n“It’s a very strong endorsement of us to be in the room with them and a very strong endorsement of the publishing marketplace and the value of content to make AI that is of high value,” Vogel said. \nThe announcement of the Microsoft deal was shared during IAC’s earnings, alongside the news that Google Search’s AI Overviews has been hurting the publisher’s traffic. For the first time, People Inc. shared data with investors that showed how Google Search, which accounted for 54% of its traffic two years ago, had dropped to 24% of its traffic during the past quarter.\nThe agreement differs from the OpenAI deal, which Vogel characterized as more of an “all-you-can-eat” model, but said People Inc. was happy with either model. What matters to the company is that its work is “respected and paid for,” he said. The company didn’t share the specific deal terms, though. \nPeople Inc. has taken issue with the way AI companies have ingested media without paying to fuel their AI products and train their models. Recently, Vogel criticized Google, calling the tech giant a “bad actor” because it uses the same bot to crawl websites for its Google search engine and its AI features. Publishers can’t block the bot, as Google search still accounts for a large percentage of their traffic.\nHowever, People Inc. uses the technology from web infrastructure provider Cloudflare to block other AI crawlers, prompting AI players to approach it with content deals. In September, Vogel attributed its decision to leverage Cloudflare’s tech as a way to push AI companies to the negotiating table, noting that its progress on deals was “much further along” after adopting the solution.\nHe reiterated those comments on today’s earnings call with investors, saying that blocking AI crawlers has been “very effective” and “brought almost everyone to the table.” Vogel suggested that more deals would be announced in time, as well. \nIAC reported that People Inc. grew its digital revenue 9% to $269 million in the quarter, driven by performance marketing and licensing, which saw 38% and 24% growth, respectively. It also noted its acquisition of a food-focused media publisher and influencer network Feedfeed.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSora, the AI video generator from OpenAI, is now officially available for Android users in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. \nInitially launched as an iOS app in September, Sora quickly rose to the top of the App Store charts, amassing over 1 million downloads in a week. With its arrival on the Google Play Store, Sora is expected to attract a larger user base, likely resulting in a surge in downloads.  \nThe Android version retains all the features of its iOS counterpart, including the “Cameos” feature, which allows users to generate videos of themselves performing various activities using their own likeness. \nThe videos can be shared in a feed reminiscent of TikTok, allowing users to discover and engage with content from others. This appears to be a strategic move by OpenAI to strengthen its position in the competitive landscape of short-form video sharing. The AI giant aims to rival major players like Meta, which has recently launched its own AI video feed called Vibes, as well as existing platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.\n— Sora (@soraofficialapp) November 4, 2025 \nHowever, the app has faced criticism for its handling of deepfakes. After its initial launch, users began uploading disrespectful videos of historical figures, including Martin Luther King Jr. As a result, Sora paused the generation of content depicting Dr. King last month and strengthened its guardrails.\nThe company also recently addressed the backlash surrounding copyrighted characters, such as SpongeBob and Pikachu, by changing its policy for the Sora app from an “opt-out” approach to an “opt-in” system for rights holders.\nAdditionally, it’s currently involved in a legal dispute with celebrity video maker Cameo regarding the name of Sora’s flagship feature, “Cameo.”\nLooking ahead, OpenAI plans to introduce additional features to Sora. These include character cameos, letting users create AI-generated videos featuring their pets and inanimate objects. Basic video editing tools are also on the way, including the ability to stitch multiple clips together. Sora also plans to help users customize their social feeds, focusing on content from selected individuals rather than a large audience.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nNvidia is playing fast and loose with its war chest as it looks to build on its momentum as the chief benefactor of the AI boom. \nThe company on Tuesday signed a €1 billion ($1.15 billion) partnership with Deutsche Telekom to set up an “AI factory” in Munich that aims to boost Germany’s AI computing power by 50%.\nCalled the “Industrial AI Cloud,” the project will use more than 1,000 Nvidia DGX B200 systems and RTX Pro Servers with up to 10,000 Blackwell GPUs to provide AI inferencing and other services to German companies while complying with German data sovereignty laws.\nDeutsche Telekom said early partners of the project include Agile Robots, whose bots will be used to install server racks at the facility, and Perplexity, which will use the data center to provide “in-country” AI inferencing to German users and companies. The telco also outlined digital twins and physics-based simulation as use cases for industrial companies.\nThe telecom company said it would provide the physical infrastructure for the project, while SAP will provide its business technology platform and applications.\nThe partnership comes at a time when the European tech industry has been calling on EU lawmakers to reduce their reliance on foreign infrastructure and service providers and to foster adoption of homegrown alternatives. At the same time, tech companies have been criticizing the bloc’s approach to regulating AI, arguing that the rules only serve to hold back innovation.\nThe EU earlier this year committed €200 billion to set up “AI gigafactories” on the continent, focusing on “industrial and mission-critical applications.” But funding for AI initiatives in the European Union has been notably lower than in the U.S., where companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle have pumped in hundreds of billions to build massive data centers and assorted infrastructure to support development of AI models and services.\nDeutsche Telekom noted that this project, expected to start operations in early 2026, is separate from the EU’s AI gigafactory initiative.\n“Mechanical engineering and industry have made this country strong,” says Tim Höttges, CEO of Deutsche Telekom. “But here, too, we are challenged. AI is a huge opportunity. It will help to improve our products and strengthen our European strengths.”\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Prefer standing floor tickets.” AI Mode will then search across multiple websites to find real-time ticket options that meet your specific requests. It will then present you with a curated list of ticket prices to choose from. AI Mode links you directly to the booking page so you can finalize your purchase.\nThe new agentic capabilities are available to all users opted into Google’s experimental arm, Search Labs, in the U.S. The company notes that Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers have access to high limits.\nGoogle first brought agentic capabilities to AI Mode back in August, when it started letting people use the feature to find restaurant reservations.\nImage Credits:Google\nWith this capability, you can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. For example, you could ask, “Find me a dinner reservation for three people this Friday after 6 p.m. around Logan Square. Craving ramen or bibimbap.”\nAI Mode will then search across different reservation platforms to find real-time availability for restaurants that match the inquiry. It then surfaces a curated list of options to choose from. \n“Our priority in Google Search is connecting you with high-quality information you can rely on,” Google explained on its Search Labs page. “This new mode is rooted in our core quality and safety systems, but it’s still an early experiment and may make mistakes.”\nGoogle first launched AI Mode in March to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. Since then, the tech giant has brought AI Mode to more than 180 countries and has been building it out with new functionalities. For instance, AI Mode recently got access to a Canvas feature that helps you build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel. It also now lets you use Google Lens to ask about what’s on your desktop screen.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

Much of the location data is uploaded by ordinary apps installed on a person’s phone, which is sold to data brokers. Those data brokers then sell that data to governments and militaries. \nThe dataset also included the granular location histories of Europe’s top officials, including those who work directly for the European Commission, which has its headquarters in Brussels. \nThe reporters said they were able to identify hundreds of devices belonging to people who work in sensitive areas around the EU, including 2,000 location markers from 264 officials’ devices, and around 5,800 location markers from more than 750 devices in the European Parliament.\nEurope has some of the strongest data protection rules in the world with its GDPR law. However, watchdogs and officials across Europe have been slow to take stronger enforcement action against data brokers, Netzpolitik reported. Data brokering has ballooned to become a billion-dollar industry involving the sale and trade of people’s location data and other private information.\nTo counter some of this location tracking, Apple customers can anonymize their device identifiers, and Android owners can regularly reset their device’s identifier.\nLast year, a data broker called Gravy Analytics had a data breach that exposed the location data belonging to tens of millions of people, including where they have been and where they live and work. Researchers examining the data said the location records could be used to extensively track people’s recent whereabouts.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify says its video podcasts are seeing increased consumer adoption. In its third-quarter earnings report, the company shared that its video podcast catalog has expanded to nearly half a million shows, and more than 390 million users have now streamed a video podcast on the platform.\nThat figure is up 54% year-over-year, and it also reflects Spotify’s increased investment in the format. In June 2024, the company said it had some 250,000 video podcasts as it rolled out tools that let non-hosted podcasters upload their videos to the platform. The streaming giant also lets users engage with podcasts through comments, Q&As, and polls, making the app feel more like a social network.\nAs a result, Spotify says that users’ time spent with video content on Spotify has also more than doubled year-over-year, largely driven by video podcasts. In addition, video podcast consumption has increased by more than 80% since the launch of the Spotify Partner Program, or SPP, in January, which gives qualifying creators the ability to monetize their shows in new ways, including audience-driven payouts from Spotify Premium user engagement.\nThe company also recently announced a partnership with Netflix to distribute its video podcasts to a broader audience starting in 2026 in the United States, with more markets to follow. Investors didn’t ask about the specifics of the revenue-sharing agreement on the earnings call; however, investors did want to understand how distributing podcasts off the platform would ultimately benefit Spotify.\nAccording to incoming co-CEO Alex Norström, the move is meant to center Spotify as a creators’ distribution hub.\n“We think … that when the creator wins, we win, and as creators optimize to create their best shows and interviews, which is really what they’re focused on,” Norström told investors and analysts. “They wanted to syndicate everywhere. And we believe, of course, in helping them to reach audiences in as many places as possible, which is consistent with our core philosophy on being creator-first.”\nLater, co-CEO Gustav Söderström suggested that allowing creators to be both on Spotify and Netflix gives the company further “revenue opportunities.” \n“This is the way to think about it: It’s part of our ubiquity strategy, and it’s really important that while we build a good user experience, we also need to have a very strong creator offer[ing],” he noted.\nNorström pointed out that having Spotify podcasts on YouTube increased awareness about the shows and their origins, which then resulted in net incremental usage on Spotify. The company expects the same with Netflix.\nIn addition, Spotify said the TV opportunity was a part of this equation — hence the recent upgrade of its Apple TV app. The more people can use Spotify across platforms, the more their usage increases, and that helps Spotify’s ads business.\nThe company also noted that it has given advertisers programmatic access to its audio and video inventory, though it admits that 2025 is a “transition year” for its ads business, and it doesn’t expect to see growth improve until the second half of 2026.\nThe streamer also announced its monthly active users increased 11% year-over-year to 713 million, and revenue was up to €4.27 billion (~$4.9 billion), beating Wall Street’s expectations. The company saw an €899 million net profit (~$1 billion) during the quarter.\nHowever, the stock slipped after the opening bell on Tuesday, due to Wall Street’s concerns over Spotify’s mixed guidance for its fourth quarter.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoFundMe has introduced a new offering that allows you to purchase digital gift cards for your loved ones, enabling them to donate to their favorite nonprofit organizations during the holidays. (Note that the product has yet to launch.)\nThe gift cards start at $5 and come in a variety of themes and causes, including Birthday, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Ramadan, as well as cards for animal lovers, cancer fighters, and nature protectors.\nThese cards work differently than traditional gift cards, though. They operate through Giving Funds, GoFundMe’s fee-free donor-advised fund (DAF). Launched in June, this marked the platform’s first entry into DAFs, aiming to make them accessible to everyday donors. Historically, donor-advised funds have been out of reach for most people due to high minimum contributions and fees.\nWhen recipients claim the gift card, the amount is deposited into their personal Giving Fund. They then have the option to donate immediately or allow the funds to grow tax-free in their account, which gives them the opportunity to contribute even more later. The person who purchased the gift card receives a tax deduction.\nRecipients can choose from 1.4 million nonprofits on the platform, ranging from local food banks to global organizations that provide disaster relief, support youth programs, and promote animal welfare.\nImage Credits:GoFundMe\nGoFundMe’s new gifting strategy could appeal to users for several reasons. For example, instead of giving a generic gift, people can help their loved ones support causes that truly matter to them, such as a local soup kitchen that helps feed families during Thanksgiving, a time when many people struggle to put a meal on the table.\nPlus, a nonprofit gift card can also be a great way for older generations to teach younger family members about the importance of giving back. It opens up conversations about different causes and the real impact they have.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn May, GoFundMe celebrated its 15th anniversary and announced that it had surpassed $40 billion raised globally. The company also launched GoFundMe Pro, a platform aimed at helping nonprofits with fundraising. The new platform introduced AI tools designed to make it easier for nonprofits to ask for donations.\nThis story has been updated after publication.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nShares of electric aviation startup Beta Technologies took flight Tuesday as the company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange with an outsized raise of $1 billion and a stock price that closed up. \nThe Vermont-based company priced shares in its IPO at $34, above its predicted range of $27 to $33. Beta Technologies sold 29.9 million shares to raise more $1 billion at a valuation of $7.4 billion.\nOnce trading started, shares of Beta Technologies dipped before recovering and ultimately closing at $36. \nBeta Technologies’ public market debut is a capstone to founder and CEO Kyle Clark’s untraditional approach to building an aviation company. Clark, a Harvard-educated former professional hockey player and pilot instructor, founded Beta Technologies in 2017. He didn’t take the typical path of a startup founder, eschewing Silicon Valley for his Vermont hometown and bypassing venture capital. Instead, Beta has raised funds — to the tune of $1.15 billion — from institutional investors like Fidelity and Qatar Investment Authority. Amazon and General Electric are among Beta’s biggest investors.\nIn another uncommon move, the company filed its IPO paperwork despite the government shutdown. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance last month that lets companies in IPO limbo issue statements, including share price, that become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule.\nThe decision to proceed under this SEC guidance would mean a 20-day roadshow with investors, Clark told TechCrunch, adding that bank advisers told him being on the road that long was risky.\n“And I said, ‘You know what? It actually is not. I think the more time we spend with investors, the better this is going to be for Beta,’” Clark said in an interview Monday evening. “As people started to dig really deep into the tech and the strategy, we got stronger and stronger, and our oversubscription speaks for itself.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHis hope, he told TechCrunch, is for steady and slow growth of the stock, not a wild, uncontrolled pop. \nNow Clark says he is focused back on the company, including the commercial certification of its electric aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration.\nBeta aims to be an OEM to the aviation sector. The company has designed two electric aircraft. A conventional electric aircraft, called the Alia CX300 eCTOL, is designed for regional flight. An electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, dubbed the Alia A250 eVTOL, is primed for urban environments.\n Beta has also built an EV aircraft charging business, of which Archer Aviation is a customer.\nBeta’s IPO regulatory documents show it has generated revenue but is still not near profitability. Beta brought in $15.6 million in the first half of 2025, double the revenue from the same period in 2024. Its net losses have also grown by roughly one-third to $183 million over the first six months of the year.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nRivian has created its second spinoff company this year: an industrial AI and robotics venture called Mind Robotics.\nThe new effort will be focused around using “industrial AI to reshape how physical world businesses operate and leverage Rivian operations data as the foundation for a robotics data flywheel,” according to the company’s third-quarter shareholder letter published Tuesday.\nThat’s a mouthful of buzzwords, and Rivian declined to clarify beyond that explanation. On an investor call Tuesday, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said his company realized it had the chance to “develop products and robotic solutions that allow us to run and operate our manufacturing plants more efficiently.” Scaringe will serve as chairman of the board of directors for Mind Robotics, according to a filing, and Rivian is a shareholder, he said on the call.\n“As much as we’ve seen AI shift how we operate and run our businesses through the wide-ranging applications for LLMs, the potential for AI to really shift how we think about operating in the physical world is, in some ways, unimaginably large,” Scaringe said on the call. “So the creation of this company is ultimately the culmination of us coming to the view that we wanted to have direct control and direct influence over the design and development of advanced AI robotics that would be very focused on industrial applications.”\nMind Robotics has already raised a $115 million seed round, which was led by VC firm Eclipse. Jiten Behl, a partner at Eclipse who also used to work at Rivian, revealed the investment in a LinkedIn post after TechCrunch previously reported the firm’s involvement in an earlier version of this story.\nThe launch of Mind Robotics marks the second time this year that Rivian has created a new stand-alone company. In March, the company spun out its skunkworks micromobility division into a startup called Also Inc. That new company was funded in part by money from Eclipse, with additional funding from Greenoaks Capital.\nIt’s unclear if Rivian employees are moving over to Mind Robotics, like was the case with Also. A Rivian spokesperson declined to say. But the company hinted at the possibility in Tuesday’s letter.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“With our strong bench of technology talent and an innovation-driven culture, we have been able to identify additional areas of value to accelerate our mission on a wider scale while maintaining Rivian’s focus,” Scaringe wrote.\nRobotics and industrial AI are hot areas for investment right now. There is a slew of humanoid robotics companies raising money and trying to ship products, including Tesla. General Motors is working on its own robotics and AI division, too. \nBeyond Rivian’s announcement Tuesday, though, very little is known about what Mind Robotics will get up to. There is essentially no digital footprint for the company yet, save for the trademark application. That application is very broadly targeted and says Mind Robotics could use the trademark for everything from machinery, to vehicles, to “incubators for eggs.”\nThis story has been updated with new information from a regulatory filing in the third paragraph, the LinkedIn post in the fifth paragraph, and from the investor call throughout.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nE-commerce software provider Shopify is bullish on AI-powered shopping agents, citing AI as an “incredible tool” to enable more entrepreneurs and calling it the “biggest shift in technology since the internet” during its third-quarter earnings call. The company, which partnered with ChatGPT maker OpenAI in September, reported that traffic from AI tools to its online stores is up 7x since January of this year, and purchases attributed to AI-powered search have increased by 11x.\nAccording to Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, the company’s advantage in the AI era comes from its ability to access the data from millions of merchants and billions of transactions, and its “founder mode” mentality to ship products quickly.\nThis also includes its internal tools, like Scout, which uses AI to help Shopify employees search hundreds of millions of pieces of merchant feedback to make better product decisions.\n“And Scout is just one of many tools we’re developing to turn our own signals, whether it’s support tickets, usage data, reviews, social interactions, or even Sidekick prompts, into fast, informed decisions,” Finkelstein said on the call. “If you take away one thing from this call, let it be this: AI is not just a feature at Shopify. It is central to our engine that powers everything we build.”\nIn addition to ChatGPT, Shopify is working with Perplexity and Microsoft Copilot on other in-chat shopping experiences. A recent Shopify survey found that 64% of shoppers said they’re “likely” to use AI to some extent when making purchases.\n“We’ve been building and investing in this infrastructure to make it really easy to bring shopping into every single AI conversation,” Finkelstein said. “The fact that we’re already working with the leaders in the space should, I think, be a testament to the fact that we want to make sure merchants on Shopify are better prepared than those that are not. It’s still obviously very, very early,” he continued. “But what we’re really trying to do is lay the rails for agentic commerce.”\nWhile the company is currently focused on building connections with AI agents, it’s also prepared for the fact that there will be “different permutations” of how agentic commerce will evolve, Finkelstein also noted, which means it needs to be ready for “whichever path wins.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“That was the same thing when social commerce started to get a lot of attention, or when [people realized it wasn’t] e-commerce versus physical commerce but … this idea of commerce everywhere,” he added.\nSeparately, Shopify’s Q3 financial results showed revenue up 32% to $2.84 billion, ahead of estimates, and profit of $264 million, or 20 cents per share.

    "body": "\nThe Information reports that Anthropic expects to generate as much as $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in cash flow in 2028. The growth projections are fueled by rapid adoption of Anthropic’s business products, a person with knowledge of the company’s financials said.  \nLast month, Reuters reported that Anthropic is projected to more than double, and potentially nearly triple, its annual revenue run rate next year. The company is reportedly on track to meet a goal of $9 billion in ARR by the end of 2025 and has set a target of $20 billion to $26 billion ARR for 2026. \nAnthropic expects its revenue this year from selling access to its AI models through an API to hit $3.8 billion, doubling the $1.8 billion revenue OpenAI expects to generate from API sales, per The Information. Claude Code is reportedly close to generating $1 billion in annualized revenue, up from about $400 million in July. \nIn recent weeks, Anthropic’s aggressive B2B strategy has become clearer. Microsoft and Anthropic recently began partnering to use Anthropic’s models in Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot. Anthropic has also expanded its Salesforce partnership and plans to roll out its AI assistant Claude to hundreds of thousands of employees at Deloitte and Cognizant.  \nWhen it comes to model improvements, Anthropic has, over the last two months, launched smaller, more cost-effective models — Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 — which appeal to businesses deploying AI at scale. The startup has also expanded Claude for Financial Services and introduced Enterprise Search to enable businesses to connect all their internal work apps to Claude. \nAnthropic might lean on its growth to raise more funds. The startup last raised $13 billion from investors in September in an oversubscribed round that valued Anthropic at $170 billion. If it raises again, Anthropic would likely target a valuation of between $300 billion and $400 billion, according to The Information. \nThe outlet’s reporting also includes a projection of $17 billion in cash flow in 2028. Cash flow isn’t the same thing as profit — it just means a company has more money coming in than is going out from its operations, investments, and financing activities. Anthropic’s publicly available liabilities include a $2.5 billion credit facility and a $1.5 billion legal settlement from a copyright lawsuit that a group of authors brought against the company. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, the company expects its gross profit margin — which measures a company’s profitability after accounting for direct costs associated with producing goods and services — to reach 50% this year and 77% in 2028, up from negative 94% last year, per The Information.\nOpenAI, Anthropic’s main rival recently valued at $500 billion, is also pursuing a B2B strategy, coupled with a strong consumer push fueled by its 800 million weekly users. OpenAI expects to generate $13 billion in revenue this year and reach revenue of $100 billion in 2027. But whereas Anthropic is projecting positive cash flow by 2028, OpenAI is expecting sizable losses, with cash burn reaching $14 billion in 2026 and expected to mount to $115 billion through 2029 as the company ramps up infrastructure spending.  \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

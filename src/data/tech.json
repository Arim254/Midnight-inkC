    "body": "\nApple has been promising a new-and-improved, cutting-edge, AI-powered Siri since it first unveiled Apple Intelligence in 2024. Over about a year and a half since then, the release date for this new era of Siri has been continuously pushed back. According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, we’ll likely have to wait even longer.\nWhile the new Siri was expected to launch with the upcoming iOS 26.4 update in March, now, the changes are expected to roll out more slowly over time, reportedly postponing some features until the May iOS update, or even until the release of iOS 27 in September. Apparently, Apple ran into trouble when testing the software, requiring the launch date to be pushed back further.\nThe changes are rumored to make the longtime digital assistant more like the LLM chatbots that have swept the tech world — but instead of opening up a ChatGPT or Claude app on your iPhone or MacBook, you would be able to just talk to Siri, which will be powered by Google Gemini.\nWe’re starting to feel bad for the Siri product managers. Hang in there, folks.\n\n\tTopics\n",

Discovery (WBD) is facing significant new resistance. Investment group Ancora Holdings announced it has purchased $200 million in WBD shares and opposes Netflix’s offer. Instead, Ancora is throwing its support behind a rival bid from Paramount.\nThe WSJ had the exclusive. \n​In a press release on Wednesday, Ancora aligned itself with Paramount’s arguments: It claims the Netflix deal is inferior, involves more regulatory risk, and doesn’t deliver as much immediate cash to shareholders. \n​Just one day earlier, Paramount improved its bid by offering WBD shareholders a new incentive: $0.25 per share for each quarter the deal remains unclosed after December 31, 2026. Additionally, it pledged to cover the $2.8 billion termination fee owed to Netflix if WBD shareholders choose Paramount’s offer.\nAncora stepping in is notable because, while its stake may be relatively small, it’s seeking to rally other shareholders to reject the Netflix proposal. Ancora has warned that if the WBD board refuses to reconsider Paramount’s proposal, it will vote against the Netflix deal and press for board accountability at the company’s 2026 annual meeting. \n​Still, it remains uncertain whether Ancora will be able to sway a significant number of other shareholders. Just last month, WBD reported that more than 93% of shareholders had voted against what the company called Paramount’s less attractive offer, instead favoring the Netflix deal.\n​But if Ancora actually gets a few shareholders to change their minds, the whole Netflix takeover could get flipped on its head. Suddenly, this already tense situation would get even more unpredictable and dramatic.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n",

The eero Signal automatically switches to cellular when an outage occurs, then returns to Standby mode when service is restored.\nIt’s ideal for work-from-home employees, those needing security systems to stay online, or those in areas prone to outages.\nImage Credits:eero\nBecause the cellular network is only used intermittently, the subscription costs less than most comparable 4G LTE plans. At launch, users can choose between a $99.99 annual eero Plus subscription with 10 GB of backup data or a $199.99 eero Plus 100 plan with 100 GB of data. Both offer discounted pricing when you first purchase the device. Eero says the device supports several major carriers, including AT&T and Verizon, and connects to the optimal network at the time using a built-in multi-carrier eSIM. \nLater this year, the company will also launch a 5G version of the eero Signal for $199.99, and support for the device will come to those on eero Business plans, as well. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Hardware\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t11:50 AM PST · February 11, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIt’s already quite easy to use Cash App. However, on Wednesday, the payment platform owned by Block, Inc. introduced a new feature designed to make its user experience significantly easier: payment links.\nThe feature allows app users to send payments via a hyperlink that can be attached to a variety of communications.\nUsers can access the links by taking the typical steps in Cash App’s payment tab, but instead of clicking “add recipient,” the user now has the option to click “share link.” Choosing this will create a link that can subsequently be added to texts, emails, and DMs as a payment request. The recipient clicks the link, which preloads the requested payment amount, allowing the transaction to be facilitated quickly.\nCash App says that the links can be used for recurring payments as well as group payments.\nCash App introduced the new feature after surveying Gen Z users and finding that it was common for multiple communications to occur around payments. The links are designed to alleviate any social awkwardness that may accompany those communications while also making payments more direct.\nImage Credits:Cash App\n“Payment links make moving money even more seamless, but just as importantly, they make the task of requesting money feel more human and less awkward,” said Kristen Anderson, P2P & Networks Product Lead at Cash App. “We’ve heard from our customers that sending in-app payment requests and push notifications can sometimes come across as overly formal or even passive-aggressive. Payment links solve this by allowing customers to send requests through whichever platform feels most natural so that they can add context, levity, or humor to the conversation.” \nCash App has added a number of new features lately, including an AI chatbot that debuted late last year and is designed to advise users on their finances, as well as a new benefits program with a high-borrowing limit.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nModal Labs, a startup specializing in AI inference infrastructure, is talking to VCs about a new round at a valuation of about $2.5 billion, according to four people with knowledge of the deal. Should the deal close at these terms, the funding round would more than double the company’s valuation of $1.1 billion announced less than five months ago, when it announced an $87 million Series B round.\nGeneral Catalyst is in talks to lead the round, the people told TechCrunch. Modal’s annualized revenue run rate (ARR) is approximately $50 million, our sources said. The discussions are early, and terms could still change.  \nModal Labs co-founder and CEO Erik Bernhardsson denied that his company was actively fundraising and characterized his recent interactions with VCs as general conversations. General Catalyst did not respond to our requests for comment.\nModal is focused on optimizing inference, the process of running trained AI models to generate answers from user requests. Improving inference efficiency reduces compute costs and cuts down the lag time between a user’s prompt and the AI’s response.\nModal is one of the handful of inference-focused companies attracting intense investor attention now. Last week, its competitor Baseten announced a $300 million raise at a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the $2.1 billion valuation it reached just months prior in September. Similarly, Fireworks AI, an inference cloud provider, secured $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October.\nIn January, the creators of the open source inference project vLLM announced they had transitioned the tool into a VC-backed startup, Inferact, raising $150 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz at an $800 million valuation. Meanwhile, TechCrunch reported that the team behind SGLang has commercialized as RadixArk, which sources told us secured seed funding at a $400 million valuation led by Accel.\nModal was co-founded by CEO Erik Bernhardsson in 2021 after he spent more than 15 years building and leading data teams at companies including Spotify and Better.com, where he was CTO.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe startup counts Lux Capital and Redpoint Ventures among its earlier backers.\nEditor’s Note: This story was updated to include a comment from Modal.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

The beta version is now available in the app.​\nTo use the new chatbot, users search for a grocery store in the Uber Eats app and tap the purple Cart Assistant icon on the store’s page to begin shopping. \nCustomers can enter a list or upload an image of one, and Cart Assistant will automatically add the necessary items to their basket. This includes photos of handwritten lists or screenshots of recipes and their ingredients. Users can then customize the basket by swapping items for preferred brands or adding more products from the store.​\nImage Credits:Uber Eats\nUber Eats notes that Cart Assistant uses previous orders to prioritize familiar items — like your usual milk or favorite oatmeal — to make the experience more personalized.​\n“Users were telling us they wanted a quicker way to shop, and we know how precious your time is,” Uber CTO Praveen Neppalli Naga said in a statement. “Cart Assistant helps you get from idea to checkout in seconds.” \nCart Assistant could help Uber Eats better compete with other food delivery and grocery apps that are already integrating or developing AI chatbots.​ For example, Instacart launched an AI search tool powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2023 to help customers save time and receive personalized shopping recommendations. DoorDash was also reportedly testing an AI chatbot called DashAI that same year.​\nLast year, both Uber Eats and rival DoorDash integrated with ChatGPT to streamline food ordering. With Uber Eats, U.S. users can browse local restaurants and menus in ChatGPT, then complete their purchase in the Uber Eats app. DoorDash’s integration allows users to request meal plans and automatically add all necessary ingredients to their DoorDash cart.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNotably, Bloomberg reported in 2023 that Uber Eats was developing an AI-powered chatbot that would supposedly ask users about their budget and food preferences, and help them place an order.​\nOverall, Uber Eats is rapidly investing in AI, including tools for merchants like AI-generated menu descriptions, enhanced food photos, and customer review summaries.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Joan Cros/NurPhoto / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:00 AM PST · February 11, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nGoogle on Wednesday released the first beta of Android 17, which brings performance improvements and a way to add new features to media and camera apps. Most importantly, it’s changing how developers get access to new APIs and features of the latest version.\nWith this release, the company is ditching developer betas and adopting a continuous Canary channel to push updates for developers. This is similar to how Google approaches web browser development, as Google has a Canary channel for the Chrome browser, too.\nThe company said that because of this approach, features and APIs become available to developers as soon as they are approved in internal testing. Plus, the Canary channel allows for over-the-air updates, benefiting developers with more integrated workflows and better ways to test their apps.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle said it’s targeting March for platform stability, with the planned release of Android 17 in Q2 2026. With Android 16’s release last year, Google adopted a two-release structure in a calendar year, with a major SDK release in the first half and a minor SDK release in the second half of the year. The company made this move to give time to device makers to roll out the latest version more quickly to devices and reduce fragmentation in the Android ecosystem.\nAndroid 17 will restrict developers from opting out of resizing restrictions. This means developers can’t force orientation or resizing on large-screen devices. This is Google’s way of making more apps work better on tablets and foldables in different orientations and window sizes.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle is also adding more camera capabilities to Android 17. It’s adding APIs to let developers handle camera transitions more smoothly, support for VVC (H.266) video codec, better handling of loudness across apps to maintain consistent volume, and stricter controls for background audio.\nAndroid 17 also brings performance improvements, decreased missed frames, and a better garbage collection mechanism for memory clean-up. The company is improving Wi-Fi connectivity with better proximity detection and secure peer discovery, as well. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI has disbanded a team that was designed to communicate the company’s mission to the public and to its own employees. At the same time, the team’s former leader has been given a new role as the company’s “chief futurist.”\nOpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that the team’s members have now been assigned to other roles. The news was first reported by Platformer.\nThe disbanded team in question appears to have been formed in September of 2024. Platformer reports that the team was dedicated to promoting “the company’s stated mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”\nAn official OpenAI spokesperson described the team thusly: “The Mission Alignment project was a support function to help employees and the public understand our mission and the impact of AI. That work continues throughout the organization.”\nIn a blog post published Wednesday, Josh Achiam, the former head of OpenAI’s mission alignment team, explained his new role as the company’s chief futurist. “My goal is to support OpenAI’s mission — to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity — by studying how the world will change in response to AI, AGI, and beyond,” Achiam wrote.\nAchiam noted that, in his new role, he would be collaborating with Jason Pruet, an OpenAI physicist.\nA spokesperson for OpenAI said the rest of the mission alignment team — a group of six or seven people — had subsequently been reassigned to different parts of the company. The spokesperson couldn’t say where exactly the team members had been assigned, but said that they were engaged in similar work in those roles. It was also unclear whether Achiam would have a new team as part of his “futurist” role.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe spokesperson attributed the disbanding of the team to the kinds of routine reorganizations that occur within a fast-moving company. \nOpenAI previously had what it called a “superalignment team” — which was formed in 2023 and focused on studying long-term existential threats posed by AI — but that team was disbanded in 2024. \nAchiam’s personal website still lists him as head of mission alignment at OpenAI, and describes him as being interested in ensuring that the “long-term future of humanity is good.” His LinkedIn profile shows he had served as head of mission alignment since September 2024.\nCorrection: This story originally confused mission alignment with another, similarly named team called alignment. It has been corrected and we apologize for the error.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nMicrosoft has rolled out fixes for security vulnerabilities in Windows and Office, which the company says are being actively abused by hackers to break into people’s computers.\nThe exploits are one-click attacks, meaning that a hacker can plant malware or gain access to a victim’s computer with minimal user interaction. At least two flaws can be exploited by tricking someone into clicking a malicious link on their Windows computer. Another can result in a compromise on opening a malicious Office file.\nThe vulnerabilities are known as zero-days, because the hackers were exploiting the bugs before Microsoft had time to fix them.\nDetails of how to exploit the bugs have been published, Microsoft said, potentially increasing the chance of hacks. Microsoft did not say where they had been published, and a Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately comment when reached by TechCrunch. In its bug reports, Microsoft acknowledged the input of security researchers in Google’s Threat Intelligence Group in their discovery of the vulnerabilities. \nMicrosoft said one of the bugs, officially tracked as CVE-2026-21510, was found in the Windows shell, which powers the operating system’s user interface. The bug affects all supported versions of Windows, the company said. When a victim clicks on a malicious link from their computer, the bug allows hackers to bypass Microsoft’s SmartScreen feature that would typically screen malicious links and files for malware.\nAccording to security expert Dustin Childs, this bug can be abused to remotely plant malware on the victim’s computer.\n“There is user interaction here, as the client needs to click a link or a shortcut file,” Childs wrote in his blog post. “Still, a one-click bug to gain code execution is a rarity.”\nA Google spokesperson confirmed that the Windows shell bug was under “widespread, active exploitation,” and said successful hacks allowed the silent execution of malware with high privileges, “posing a high risk of subsequent system compromise, deployment of ransomware, or intelligence collection.”\nAnother Windows bug, tracked as CVE-2026-21513, was found in Microsoft’s proprietary browser engine, MSHTML, which powers its legacy and long-discontinued Internet Explorer browser. It’s still found in newer versions of Windows to ensure backward compatibility with older apps. \nMicrosoft said this bug allows hackers to bypass security features in Windows to plant malware.\nAccording to independent security reporter Brian Krebs, Microsoft also patched three other zero-day bugs in its software that were being actively exploited by hackers.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFor 24 years, Microsoft’s Amanda Silver has been working to help developers — and in the last few years, that’s meant building tools for AI. After a long stretch on GitHub Copilot, Silver is now a corporate vice president at Microsoft’s CoreAI division, where she works on tools for deploying apps and agentic systems within enterprises. \nHer work is focused on the Foundry system inside Azure, which is designed as a unified AI portal for enterprises, giving her a close view of how companies are actually using these systems and where deployments end up falling short.\nI spoke with Silver about the current capabilities of enterprise agents, and why she believes this is the biggest opportunity for startups since the public cloud.\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.\nSo, your work focuses on Microsoft products for outside developers — often startups that aren’t otherwise focused on AI. How do you see AI impacting those companies?\nI see this as being a watershed moment for startups as profound as the move to the public cloud. If you think about it, the cloud had a huge impact for startups because it meant that they no longer needed to have the real estate space to host their racks, and they didn’t need to spend as much money on the capital infusion of getting the hardware to be hosted in their labs and things like that. Everything became cheaper. Now agentic AI is going to kind of continue to reduce the overall cost of software operations again, because many of the jobs involved in standing up a new venture — whether it’s support people, legal investigations — a lot of it can be done faster and cheaper with AI agents. I think that’s going to lead to more ventures and more startups launching. And then we’re going to see higher-valuation startups with fewer people at the helm. And I think that that’s an exciting world. \nWhat does that look like in practice?\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWe are certainly seeing multistep agents becoming very broadly used across all different kinds of coding tasks, right? Just as an example, one thing developers have to do to maintain a codebase is stay current with the latest versions of the libraries that it has a dependency on. You might have a dependency on an older version of the dot-net runtime or the Java SDK. And we can have these agentic systems reason over your entire codebase and bring it up to date much more easily, with maybe a 70% or 80% reduction of the time it takes. And it really has to be a deployed multistep agent to do that.\nLive-site operations is another one — if you think of maintaining a website or a service and something goes wrong, there’s a thud in the night, and somebody has to be on call to get woken up to go respond to the incident. We still do have people on call 24/7, just in case the service goes down. But it used to be a really loathed job because you’d get woken up fairly often for these minor incidents. And we’ve now built a genetic system to successfully diagnose and in many cases fully mitigate issues that come up in these live site operations so that humans don’t have to be woken up in the middle of the night and groggily go to their terminals and try to diagnose what’s going on. And that also helps us dramatically reduce the average time it takes for an incident to be resolved.\nOne of the other puzzles of this present moment is that agentic deployments haven’t happened quite as fast as we expected even six months ago. I’m curious why you think that is.\nIf you think about the people who are building agents, what is preventing them from being successful, in many cases, it comes down to not really knowing what the purpose of the agent should be. There’s a culture change that has to happen in how people build these systems. What is the business use case that they are trying to solve for? What are they trying to achieve? You need to be very clear-eyed about what the definition of success is for this agent. And you need to think, what is the data that I’m giving to the agent so that it can reason over how to go accomplish this particular task?\nWe see those things as the bigger stumbling blocks, more than the general uncertainty of letting agents get deployed. Anybody who goes and looks at these systems sees the return on investment.\nYou mention the general uncertainty, which I think feels like a big blocker from the outside. Why do you see it as less of a problem in practice?\nFirst of all, I think that it’s going to be very common that agentic systems have human-in-the-loop scenarios. Think about something like a package return. It used to be that you would have a workflow for the return processing that was 90% automated and 10% human intervention, where somebody would have to go look at the package and have to make a judgment call as to how damaged the package was before they would decide to accept the return. \nThat’s a perfect example where actually now the computer vision models are getting so good that in many cases, we don’t need to have as much human oversight over inspecting the package and making that determination. There will still be some cases that are borderline, where maybe the computer vision is not yet good enough to make a call, and maybe there’s an escalation. It’s kind of like, how often do you need to call in the manager? \nThere are some things that will always need some kind of human oversight, because they’re such critical operations. Think about incurring a contractual legal obligation, or deploying code into a production codebase that could potentially affect the reliability of your systems. But even then, there’s the question of how far we could get in automating the rest of the process.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nUpScrolled, a social network that caught fire after TikTok’s ownership change in the U.S., is facing a serious moderation problem. After growing to more than 2.5 million users in January, users have reported the app is not taking action on the creation of usernames and hashtags that contain racial slurs, and hasn’t been able to properly moderate harmful content.\nAfter receiving tips from UpScrolled users, TechCrunch confirmed the existence of a wide range of racial slurs and hate speech being used in people’s usernames on the app. For instance, some usernames would feature the name of the slur itself, the slur combined with other words, or multiple slurs in a single username; other usernames contain hate speech, like “Glory to Hitler.” \nAfter reporting these slurs to UpScrolled’s public email address, we received a response from that email that the company is “actively reviewing and removing inappropriate content,” and is working to expand its moderation capacity. The email advised us not to engage with bad-faith actors while the situation is resolved.\nDays after reporting this activity on the app, the accounts with slurs in the usernames that were provided to UpScrolled via screenshots remained online. \nIn addition, slurs and hate speech can be found elsewhere in the app, including hashtags and text used alongside its photo or video content, TechCrunch found. Other harmful content was available, including text posts with racial slurs and hate speech, and photo and video content glorifying Hitler, based on TechCrunch’s review of the app.\nTechCrunch wasn’t alone in identifying this problem; the ADL also published a blog post this month, noting that UpScrolled was becoming home to antisemitic and extremist content and designated foreign terrorist organizations, like Hamas and others.\nUpScrolled, which was founded in 2025, claims on its website claims that the platform offers every voice “equal power.” The app has seen more than 4 million downloads on iOS and Android since June 2025, according to market intelligence provider Appfigures — a figure even higher than the startup’s self-reported number last month.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut while UpScrolled’s FAQ explains the app doesn’t “censor opinions,” it does indicate that its policy is to restrict content that involves “illegal activity, hate speech, bullying, harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted material, or anything intended to cause harm.”\nThat guidance is similar to most modern-day social media platforms. It’s clear, however, that the company is struggling to enforce its rules.\nIt’s battle that social networks are often faced with — especially those that receive a large influx of new users in a short time period. Bluesky, for instance, faced issues with slurs in account usernames in July 2023, which led to users threatening to leave the site.\nAfter UpScrolled’s initial reply to our inquiry, TechCrunch also received a response from the press account on Tuesday, which directed us to UpScrolled founder Issam Hijazi’s new video, where he addressed the issues with content moderation.\n\nIn the video, he confirmed that users have been uploading “harmful content” that goes against UpScrolled’s terms of service and the company’s beliefs.\n“We are offering everyone the freedom to express and share their opinions in a healthy and respectful digital environment,” Hijazi said. To create that environment, he said the company is “rapidly expanding our content moderation team, and we are upgrading our technology infrastructure so we can catch and remove harmful content more effectively.” \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, xAI took the rare step of publishing a full 45-minute all-hands meeting video on X, making it publicly accessible. Details of the Tuesday night meeting were previously reported by The New York Times, which may have influenced xAI’s decision to post the video online.\nThe full video reveals significant new details about Musk’s plans for the AI lab, including its product roadmap and its ongoing ties to the X platform.\n\nThe most immediate revelation concerned a string of departing employees, which Musk described as layoffs resulting from a changing organizational structure at the company. While reorganizations are common, the breadth of the departures has caused significant confusion, particularly as it has meant the loss of a significant portion of the founding team.\n“As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve,” Musk said on X. “This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.”\nThe new organizational system splits xAI into four primary teams: one focused on the Grok chatbot (including voice), another for the app’s coding system, another for the Imagine video generator, and finally a team focused on the Macrohard project, which spans from simple computer use simulation to modeling entire corporations.\n“[Macrohard] is able to do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do,” Toby Pohlen, who will lead the project under the new organizational structure, told his colleagues. “There should be rocket engines fully designed by AI.”\nImage Credits:xAI (screenshot)\nThe all-hands also featured claims about new usage and revenue figures for xAI and X. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, said X had “just crossed” $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions, which he attributed to a marketing push during the holidays.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdditionally, executives said the xAI’s Imagine tool is generating 50 million videos a day, and more than 6 billion images over the past 30 days, according to their internal metrics.\nBut it’s difficult to separate those figures from the flood of deepfake pornography that overtook X during that same period. The X platform saw engagement skyrocket as AI-generated explicit images became more prevalent, and with an estimated 1.8 million sexualized images generated over just nine days, the image-generation figures likely include substantial amounts of this controversial content.\nThe most eye-catching part of the presentation came at the end, when Musk reemphasized the importance of space-based data centers despite the technical challenges involved. Musk went still further, envisioning a moon-based factory for AI satellites, including a lunar mass driver — essentially an electromagnetic catapult — to launch them. With such infrastructure, Musk said, one could launch an AI cluster capable of capturing significant portions of the sun’s total energy output or even expanding to other galaxies.\n“It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” Musk said, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nThreads is introducing an AI-powered feature that lets users personalize their feed, the Meta-owned social network announced on Wednesday. The platform’s new “Dear Algo” feature lets users tell Threads what they temporarily want to see more or less of in their feed.\nTo use the feature, users need to type “Dear Algo” in a public Threads post, followed by what they’d like to see more or less of. For example, if you want to see more content about popular podcasts, you can post “Dear Algo, show me more posts about podcasts.” Your feed will be adjusted for three days after submitting a request.\nIt’s worth noting that because Dear Algo works through public postings, others are able to see your request, and they can even repost your request to apply it to their own feed. This aspect of the feature may be a hindrance for some users, as they might not want their requests to be public. However, Meta says it views this as a way for users to discover new conversations and topics, turning personalization into a community experience.\nImage Credits:Meta\nBy allowing users to temporarily influence what appears on their feeds, Threads gains an edge over its competitors by offering a feature that isn’t available on rival platforms.\n“Threads is where you go to keep up with what’s happening right now,” the company wrote in a blog post. “But sometimes, what matters to you changes in an instant, and you want your Threads feed to reflect that — whether it’s seeing more posts during a live NBA game or less about a TV show you haven’t caught up on yet.”\nAlthough Threads and its competitors, X and Bluesky, already offer users a simple way to indicate their preferences with a “Not Interested” button, the new Dear Algo feature takes personalization a step further. The feature could also help make Threads feel more real-time, something X has historically been known for.\nDear Algo is available now in the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, and the U.K. Threads plans to introduce it in more countries in the future. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe launch of the new feature comes a few weeks after a report from market intelligence firm Similarweb suggested that Threads now surpasses X in daily mobile usage. Although X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.\nThe report revealed that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on mobile as of January 7, 2026, while X had 125 million daily active users.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

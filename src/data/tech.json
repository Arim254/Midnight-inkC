But while app access to ChatGPT is tightly curated, Gemini CLI extensions can be published with no endorsement or participation from Google. Available extensions will be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://geminicli.com/extensions/\">hosted in public repositories on Github</a> and installed manually by developers.</p>\n<p>“That open ecosystem is vital to us,” Taylor Mullen, a senior staff engineer on the project, told TechCrunch. “Everything we’re doing is grounded in a fair ecosystem that anyone can participate in.”</p>\n<p>The first available extension was to Google’s own Nanobanana image generator, which was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/nanobanana\">posted to GitHub</a> last week. Once installed, the extension allows users to generate images directly from the Gemini CLI terminal.</p>\n<p>Launched in June, Gemini CLI has grown to over one million users, Google says, with usage heavily skewed towards software developers. Notably, Gemini CLI is heavily used in the development and maintenance of its own codebase, closely overseen by product managers, as detailed in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/how-googles-dev-tools-manager-makes-ai-coding-work/\">a recent TechCrunch interview</a>.</p>\n<p>In an interview, Google’s senior director of product management for developer tools Ryan J. Salva told TechCrunch that the purpose of the new feature was to turn Gemini CLI into “an extensibility platform, a conduit to other tools and instructions that come from elsewhere in your tool chain.”</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The app, which lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, is now available in Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panamá, Honduras, Argentina, and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>“When we opened up Opal to users in the U.S. we anticipated they might build simple, fun tools,” said Megan Li, a senior product manager at Google Labs, in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/opal-expansion/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. “We didn’t expect the surge of sophisticated, practical and highly creative Opal apps we got instead. The ingenuity of these early adopters made one thing clear: we need to get Opal into the hands of more creators globally.”</p>\n<p>Opal works by getting users to enter a description of the app they want to make, after which the tool uses different Google models to do so. Once the app is ready, users can open the editor panel to view and customize the visual workflow of inputs, outputs, and generation steps. They can click any step to review or edit the prompt, or add new steps manually using Opal’s toolbar. Users can also publish their app to the web and share a link so others can test it with their own Google accounts.</p>\n<p>In addition to the expansion, Google also announced improvements coming to Opal. </p>\n<p>The tech giant says it has improved the debugging program but intentionally kept it no-code. Users can now run their workflow step by step in the visual editor or tweak specific steps in the console. Errors show up right where they happen to provide immediate context and eliminate guesswork. </p>\n<p>Google also says that it’s made significant improvements to Opal’s core performance. The company notes that previously it would take up to five seconds or more to create a new Opal. Now, it’s worked to speed that up to make it easier to get started. Plus, users can now run steps in parallel, allowing complex workflows with multiple steps to execute simultaneously.</p>\n<p>With the U.S. launch of Opal in July, Google joined a growing list of competitors including Canva, Figma, and Replit that are building tools to help nontechnical users design app prototypes without writing any code. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

According to the company, it will present users with 50% more Reels that were uploaded on the same day that they’re scrolling.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=768,669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=680,592 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=430,374 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=720,627 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=900,784 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=800,697 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=668,582 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=431,375 431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=709,617 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=610,531 610w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/01_-Social-Bubbles__Carousel-01.gif.webp?resize=50,44 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Facebook Reels will also feature AI-powered search suggestions.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Google is bringing its AI-powered conversational search feature, Search Live, to India — launching in English and Hindi — and expanding AI Mode to seven new Indian languages, as the company strengthens its presence in one of its fastest-growing markets.</p>\n<p>First <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/googles-ai-mode-gets-new-canvas-feature-real-time-help-with-search-live-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced</a> in the U.S. in July, Search Live builds on Google’s Project Astra technology and is available through the company’s AI Mode. The feature lets users point their phone camera at objects to get real-time assistance, supporting back-and-forth conversations that draw on the visual context from the camera feed.</p>\n<p>With this launch, India becomes the second market after the U.S. to get Search Live — a logical move given the country’s vast base of early AI adopters, who have helped Google grow products like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/india-leads-the-way-on-googles-nano-banana-with-a-local-creative-twist/\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini’s Nano Banana model</a>. Google plans to leverage India’s early adoption to train its systems on a wider range of visual contexts, making Search Live more capable over time.</p>\n<p>“People in India are power users of multimodal search, forming our largest user base for both voice and visual search globally,” said Hema Budaraja, vice president of product management for Search at Google, in a new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/supercharging-search-for-india-new-languages-in-ai-mode-search-live-debuts/\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>Search Live is starting to roll out to users in India today and will reach more people over the coming weeks. Once available, users can access it by tapping the “Live” icon under the search bar in the Google app, or by opening Lens and selecting “Live” from the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Google revealed that Search Live is <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/search-live-ai-mode/\" target=\"_blank\">powered by a custom version of Gemini</a>. The Gemini app separately includes a similarly named feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/google-updates-the-gemini-app-with-real-time-ai-video-deep-research-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">called Gemini Live</a>, which was introduced in May and offers a comparable experience. This overlap could easily confuse some users.</p>\n<p>Google has also expanded its AI Mode to seven Indian languages: Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. This is part of a global AI Mode expansion, which will be available in <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-expands-languages-locations/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 35 new languages and 40 new countries and territories</a>, making the AI-powered search experience accessible in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Google’s AI Mode, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/google-searchs-new-ai-mode-lets-users-ask-complex-multi-part-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">debuted</a> in the U.S. in March and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-ai-mode-rolls-out-to-us-will-add-support-for-deeper-research-comparison-shopping-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">rolled out to more U.S. users</a> in May, lets users ask complex, multi-part questions through an AI-powered interface. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/google-introduces-ai-mode-to-users-in-india/\" target=\"_blank\">launched</a> in India in June and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/googles-ai-mode-expands-globally-adds-new-agentic-features/\" target=\"_blank\">expanded globally</a> in August. Last month, Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/googles-ai-mode-adds-5-new-languages-including-hindi-japanese-and-korean/\" target=\"_blank\">added five new languages</a> — including Hindi, Indonesian, and Japanese — to the feature.</p>\n<p>“The advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding of our custom Gemini model for Search allows AI Mode to truly grasp the subtleties of local languages, ensuring AI Mode is genuinely helpful and relevant in all the new languages we introduce,” Budaraju said in his post.</p>\n<p>Google’s AI Mode and other AI features, including AI Overviews, have faced criticism for reducing search traffic to online publishers. The company, however, has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/google-denies-ai-search-features-are-killing-website-traffic/\" target=\"_blank\">denied that its AI-driven search tools are hurting</a> website visits.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://qapita.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Qapita</a>, a Singapore-based equity management platform, has raised $26.5 million in a Series B round led by Charles Schwab.</p>\n<p>As part of the deal, Charles Schwab has introduced a new platform called Schwab Private Issuer Equity Services — powered by Qapita — which let’s U.S. startups manage their cap tables, administer stock plans, and prepare for public listings. </p>\n<p>Founded in 2019 by former banker Ravi Ravulaparthi (CEO) with Lakshman Gupta (COO) and Vamsee Mohan (CTO) (pictured above, from left to right), Qapita helps private companies track ownership, manage employee equity, and facilitate secondary share sales. The startup serves private companies across Southeast Asia and the U.S., and also provides its platform for listed firms in India to manage equity after going public.</p>\n<p>Qapita began as a platform to manage cap tables after Ravulaparthi, during his earlier banking career, noticed that many companies still relied on spreadsheets. When the startup launched in January 2021, it expanded the platform based on early customer feedback to include an equity management tool for employee stock plans, initially released in beta. Competitor Carta later entered the Indian market but exited in 2023, giving Qapita room to strengthen its position.</p>\n<p>The startup currently has about 2,700 companies using its platform, it says. Roughly 70% are based in India and 20% in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Indonesia. Qapita counts around half of India’s unicorns among its customers, Ravulaparthi said in an interview.</p>\n<p>While Qapita offers free access to its platform for early-stage companies, about half of its users — roughly 1,400 firms — pay for at least one of its services, Ravulaparthi told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In addition to India and Southeast Asia, the startup has a few users in the U.S. as part of its early market testing. However, this partnership will significantly expand its presence in the U.S.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Of course, the U.S. is a very large market. There are a few options in the private market space in the U.S., but they are too few for a market of that size,” Ravulaparthi said of competitors.</p>\n<p>Charles Schwab already handles stock plans for major public companies. However, this deal gives it a foothold with private companies letting it compete for startups with Carta, Pulley, or Morgan Stanley’s Shareworks.</p>\n<p>The platform will provide equity management tools to automate cap table processes, produce reports and dashboards, and link with other financial systems. It will also tie into Schwab’s wealth management network, enabling companies and their employees to manage stock plans and prepare for IPOs.</p>\n<p>Qapita’s Series B also included participation from its existing investors, Citi and MassMutual Ventures. This funding will also help the startup enhance its platform by launching a fund admin product across multiple markets.</p>\n<p>To date, the startup has raised more than $80 million in funding and has a headcount of 300 employees.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>After AMD and OpenAI announced an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/amd-to-supply-6gw-of-compute-capacity-to-openai-in-chip-deal-worth-tens-of-billions/\" target=\"_blank\">expanded partnership on Monday</a>, the <a href=\"https://x.com/litcapital/status/1975402366611378538\" target=\"_blank\">chatter</a> immediately turned to the unusual way OpenAI would pay for its AMD purchases. It will use AMD’s own stock to do so. </p>\n<p>To recap: OpenAI has agreed to help AMD refine its line of Nvidia competitor chips, the Instinct GPUs, as well as to purchase and deploy 6 gigawatts of compute capacity from AMD over multiple years. AMD said this deal is worth billions in revenue. </p>\n<p>But OpenAI isn’t paying for this out of its own revenues. Instead AMD has granted OpenAI a boatload of stock warrants — up to 160 million AMD shares — which will vest in tranches as certain milestones are achieved. Those milestones include specific increases in the stock price, with the last tranche dependent on AMD shares soaring to $600 apiece, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000002488/000119312525230895/d28189d8k.htm\" target=\"_blank\">AMD disclosed</a>. They were trading at about $165 before the news hit and soared to $214 by market close Monday after the announcement.  </p>\n<p>If the stock price hits its marks, and OpenAI achieves all its required contributions, and OpenAI holds all of AMD’s shares, not selling any along the way, OpenAI may make enough on AMD stock to pay for a lot of GPUs. The stock could be worth about $100 billion.  </p>\n<p>“We would note that the final 6th tranche requires ~$1T market cap to vest – ergo, if OAI were to hold stock until the end of the deal, its stake would be worth ~$100B,” writes UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri in a research note on Tuesday.  </p>\n<p>But Arcuri believes that a more likely scenario is that OpenAI will sell its AMD stock along the way to pay its AMD bill. So, essentially, this is a scheme for AMD to finance this customer’s purchases.  </p>\n<p>Still, Arcuri argues, the validation that AMD’s AI GPUs can handle OpenAI workloads, and ergo any other AI workloads, is valuable enough for AMD to make this financing gambit. “AMD highlighted ongoing customer dialogs beyond OpenAI and expects this agreement to ultimately accelerate AMD adoption momentum,” he writes. In particular, OpenAI’s stamp of approval gives it an in to sell its GPUs to the many cloud service providers it already provides with CPUs.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>So in the long run, the ones who will truly be paying for OpenAI’s giant multi-year purchase of AMD GPUs will be retail and institutional investors if they do indeed bid the stock price up. </p>\n<p>In many ways Nvidia is also financing OpenAI’s purchases of Nvidia’s wares with its own $100 billion investment <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-plans-to-invest-up-to-100b-in-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">announced last month</a>. The difference, of course, is that Nvidia’s multiple investments in OpenAI has granted Nvidia a stake in the fast-growing AI provider, not the other way around. </p>\n<p>But what choice did AMD have? By financially engineering a deal that costs OpenAI little, it gets a significant foothold — as much as 30% market share, USB estimates — into one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\">biggest build-outs</a> of next-generation data centers the world has ever seen.  </p>\n<p>While Arcuri admits that AMD’s deal is “arguably less attractive” than Nvidia’s, “we see this as a major validation of its [AMD’s] roadmap that could snowball to other customers.” </p>\n</div>",

While the Premium Organizations tier comes with a grey checkmark and is intended for governments and multilateral organizations, Premium Business will feature a gold checkmark and is designed to help businesses drive growth on X.</p>\n<p>The Premium Business subscription offering includes new tools for businesses to scale their organizations, whether they’re a small business, startup, or global corporation, X says. There are three tiers for Premium Business: Basic, Full Access, and Enterprise.</p>\n<p>The social network says Premium Business will help companies drive growth on the platform by boosting credibility with a gold checkmark and increasing visibility through affiliate badges. It also comes with advanced impersonation defense tools and faster human support to resolve issues quickly.</p>\n<p>Premium Business also offers tools for hiring, real-time brand and industry monitoring, access to SuperGrok, and more.</p>\n<p>Additionally, X says Premium Business will soon also get access to priority handles and explore a marketplace to acquire “high-value handles.” The company told TechCrunch in an email that priority handles are a set of inactive handles that will be available to Premium Businesses for free, while rarer or more valuable inactive handles will be available for purchase. </p>\n<p>The Premium Business Basic subscription costs $200 per month and comes with “the essentials to establish your business on X.” The Full Access tier costs $1,000 per month and comes with affiliates, fast support, priority handles, impersonation defense, and early access to new features.</p>\n<p>The Enterprise tier comes with advanced tools, account management, and “maximum support for your unique goals,” X says.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Hackers working for the North Korean government have stolen more than $2 billion in crypto so far this year, <a href=\"https://www.elliptic.co/blog/north-korea-linked-hackers-have-already-stolen-over-2-billion-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\">according to blockchain analysis firm Elliptic</a>. </p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Elliptic <a href=\"http://elliptic.co/blog/north-korea-linked-hackers-have-already-stolen-over-2-billion-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\">published a blog post</a> with this new estimate, which the company says is the “largest annual total on record, with three months still to go,” and is based on more than 30 hacks this year. </p>\n<p>The previous record was in 2022, when North Korea stole $1.35 billion. The regime’s total amount of stolen crypto since 2017 is at least $6 billion, according to Elliptic, which said that figure may still be an underestimate.  </p>\n<p>“The actual figure may be even higher. Attributing cyber thefts to North Korea is not an exact science,” reads the blog post.  </p>\n<p>“We are aware of many other thefts that share some of the hallmarks of North Korea-linked activity but lack sufficient evidence to be definitively attributed. Other thefts are likely unreported and remain unknown,” said Elliptic. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1200,627 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1280,669 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=720,376 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=900,471 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=800,418 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=2048,1071 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=668,349 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=1180,617 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=708,370 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LI_Blog_North-Korea-linked-hackers_V2.webp?resize=50,26 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Elliptic</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The company said that North Korea’s main targets are still crypto exchanges, but the regime’s hackers are also starting to target “high-net-worth individuals,” who own large amounts of crypto.  </p>\n<p>And that’s not the only recent change, the company said.  </p>\n<p>“The majority of the hacks in 2025 have been perpetrated through social engineering attacks, where hackers deceive or manipulate individuals in order to gain access to cryptocurrency,” read the blog post. “This marks a shift from earlier attacks where in many cases technical flaws in crypto infrastructure were exploited to steal funds. This shift highlights that the weak point in cryptocurrency security is increasingly human, rather than technical.” </p>\n<p>Elliptic’s estimate seems to be in line with that of other organizations. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/21/north-korean-crypto-hackers-have-stolen-3b-since-2017-says-un-security-council-report\" target=\"_blank\">the United Nations Security Council estimated</a> that between 2017 and 2023, North Korean hackers stole $3 billion in cryptocurrency. Adding Elliptic’s estimates of this year’s $2 billion, and last years’ $742.8 million, the total gets close to the $6 billion figure.  </p>\n<p>The governments of Japan, South Korea, and the United States <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/north-korea-stole-over-659m-in-crypto-heists-during-2024-deploys-fake-job-seekers/\" target=\"_blank\">accused North Korean hackers of stealing</a> more than $659 million in 2024, roughly the same figure as Elliptic’s.  </p>\n<p>The United Nations <a href=\"http://bbc.com/news/world-asia-60281129\" target=\"_blank\">believes</a> the regime led by Kim Jong-Un uses the stolen crypto to fund its nuclear weapons program.  </p>\n<p>This year’s record was fueled mostly by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/crypto-exchange-bybit-says-it-was-hacked-and-lost-around-1-4-billion/\" target=\"_blank\">the massive theft of more than $1.4 billion from crypto exchange Bybit</a>, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/fbi-says-north-korea-responsible-for-1-4-billion-bybit-heist/\" target=\"_blank\">the FBI</a> and several blockchain monitoring firms and researchers <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/researchers-accuse-north-korea-of-1-4-billion-bybit-crypto-heist/\" target=\"_blank\">attributed to North Korea</a>.  </p>\n<p>Other victims of North Korea’s hackers in the crypto world over the years have been play-to-earn game <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/15/us-officials-link-north-korean-lazarus-hackers-to-625m-axie-infinity-crypto-theft/\" target=\"_blank\">Axie Infinity</a> ($625 million in 2022), crypto startup Harmony ($100 in 2022), and crypto exchange <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/21/wazirx-halts-trading-after-230-million-hit-to-crypto-exchange/\" target=\"_blank\">WazirX</a> ($235 million in 2024), among many others.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. </p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com\">lorenzo@techcrunch.com</a>, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>",

When you first sign up for an account on a new platform, you may not know who to follow and aren’t sure who might be posting about topics of interest.</p>\n<p>Bluesky tried to solve this problem <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/bluesky-lets-you-curate-accounts-and-feeds-to-follow-with-its-starter-pack-feature/\">with Starter Packs</a>, a feature that lets everyday users curate a collection of suggested follows. Today, you can find Starter Packs focused <a href=\"https://blueskystarterpack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">on nearly any topic</a>, as well as those that feature top users on the app or other sorts of recommendations.</p>\n<p>The idea was so popular that Meta late last year <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/metas-threads-is-developing-its-own-take-on-blueskys-starter-packs/\">implemented</a> a similar feature on its X competitor, Instagram Threads. </p>\n<p>Now, Mastodon says it’s <a href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/10/our-ideas-about-packs/\" target=\"_blank\">ready to do the same</a>, but with some key differences.</p>\n<p>Mastodon believes that users should have control over whether or not they will appear in Packs on Mastodon. It suggests making Packs an extension of the service’s existing account discoverability features. That means to opt out of Packs, you would disable the setting “Feature profile and posts in discoverability algorithms.”</p>\n<p>In addition, users will be notified when they’re included in a Pack. On Bluesky, a user who wanted to be removed from a Starter Pack would have to report the pack or block the user who made it. Mastodon says it aims to offer a simpler mechanism to remove themselves from Packs, similar to how it allows users to remove their posts from the newly launched Quote Posts. </p>\n<p>The nonprofit developing the Mastodon software, Mastodon gGmbH, is collaborating with other fediverse developers on a <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep\" target=\"_blank\">Fediverse Enhancement Proposal (FEP)</a>, which is now on <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/featured_collections\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Square, Block’s merchant payments platform, has launched new features for merchants, including AI-powered voice ordering for restaurants, enhancements to its AI assistants — such as providing local insights — and an integrated Bitcoin solution to accept and hold the digital currency.</p>\n<p>The company now lets restaurants and cafes using Square leverage AI to handle incoming calls. This is particularly useful for cloud kitchens (delivery-only restaurants) and other delivery-focused establishments, as they can hand off order taking, customization, and other menu-related questions to AI.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><br />Otter.ai CEO Sam Liang isn’t satisfied with the company being viewed, and used, as just a meeting notetaker. Liang wants Otter.ai to become a go-to source for enterprises and a new batch of products released Tuesday is the first step in that evolution. </p>\n<p>The Silicon Valley-based AI meeting assistant startup on Tuesday released a new suite of tools for enterprises designed to better incorporate data from meetings into other workflows by funneling that information to a central knowledge base. The aim is to grow Otter’s business by helping companies get more out of the meetings they record.</p>\n<p>Otter’s new product suite includes an API that allows users to build custom integrations with platforms like Jira and HubSpot, an MCP server — which connects users’ Otter data to external AI models — and a new AI agent that can search a company’s meetings notes or presentations.  </p>\n<p>Liang told TechCrunch it is the next phase of Otter’s life.  </p>\n<p>“We are evolving from a meeting notetaker to a corporate meeting knowledge base,” Liang said. “This is a system record for conversations. It can help corporations scale their growth and drive measurable business value.” </p>\n<p>When Otter was founded in 2016, there were just a handful of meeting transcription companies — a far leap from today. The AI boom that kicked off in 2022 fueled a surge in startups like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/ai-note-taking-app-granola-raises-43m-at-250m-valuation-launches-collaborative-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Granola</a> or <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/yc-backed-circleback-is-out-to-become-the-best-meeting-notetaker/\" target=\"_blank\">Circleback</a>. Even older players like Fireflies have seen a <a href=\"https://fireflies.ai/blog/fireflies-1-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">surge in interest</a>.  </p>\n<p>Liang argues this transition puts Otter into a separate division than its former peers.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Meetings are where the majority of company knowledge is stored, in Liang’s opinion, whether that is notes from a customer sales call or discussions around a marketing strategy. But without a centralized place for these meeting notes, that information can only help a company so much.  </p>\n<p>“A lot of times, inefficiency happens because of information silos,” Liang said. “One team doesn’t know what the other team is doing, and it thinks that that was planned like a month ago. Oftentimes the plan changes, but not everybody is informed. So, the idea is to create a permission system so that you know most of the [nonconfidential] information is shared as broadly as possible.” </p>\n<p>Not every meeting with Otter will be directly added to this companywide knowledge base, and users can choose to restrict meeting note access for recordings that deal with sensitive information.  </p>\n<p>Employee and information privacy remains a concern despite access controls. Even if a meeting is around a neutral topic, Otter transcriptions pick the small talk and chatter that happens before and after meetings, which could contain gossip or information meant for only certain participants to hear.  </p>\n<p>Otter is also the subject of an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/15/g-s1-83087/otter-ai-transcription-class-action-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">August class-action lawsuit</a> that claims the company was recording private conversations without user consent and using that information to train its transcription services. </p>\n<p>Liang said that while he can’t comment on the lawsuit specifically, this isn’t an issue specific to Otter, and that when looking at the bigger picture, more access to information is better than not.  </p>\n<p>“If they accuse us, then they could accuse everyone else, all the tools you heard about doing meeting notes,” Liang said. “My view is that we are on the right side of history. We’re building this new AI revolution. If you want AI to help, you need to put AI in the meetings.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Zelda Williams, daughter of the late actor Robin Williams, has a poignant message for her father’s fans.</p>\n<p>“Please, just stop sending me AI videos of Dad. Stop believing I wanna see it or that I’ll understand. I don’t and I won’t,” she wrote in a post on her Instagram story on Monday. “If you’ve got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop. It’s dumb, it’s a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it’s NOT what he’d want.”</p>\n<p>It’s probably not a coincidence that Williams was moved to post this just days after the release of OpenAI’s Sora 2 video model and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/openais-sora-soars-to-no-1-on-the-u-s-app-store/\">Sora</a> social app, which gives users the power to generate highly realistic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">deepfakes of themselves</a>, their friends, and certain cartoon characters.</p>\n<p>That also includes dead people, who are seemingly fair game because it is <a href=\"https://splc.org/2019/10/can-you-libel-a-dead-person/\" target=\"_blank\">not illegal to libel the deceased</a>, according to the Student Press Law Center.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg 1851w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=680,546 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=1200,963 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=1280,1028 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=430,345 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=720,578 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=900,723 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=800,642 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=1536,1233 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=668,536 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=467,375 467w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=769,617 769w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=661,531 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zelda-williams-deepfakes.jpg?resize=50,40 50w\" /></figure>\n<p>Sora will not let you generate videos of living people — unless it is of yourself, or a friend who has given you permission to use their likeness (or “cameo,” as OpenAI calls it). But these limits don’t apply to the dead, who can mostly be generated without roadblocks. The app, which is still only available via invite, has been flooded with videos of historical figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Richard Nixon, as well as deceased celebrities like Bob Ross, John Lennon, Alex Trebek, and yes, Robin Williams.</p>\n<p>How OpenAI draws the line on generating videos of the dead is unclear. Sora 2 won’t, for example, generate former President Jimmy Carter, who died in 2024, or Michael Jackson, who died in 2009, though it did create videos with the likeness of Robin Williams, who died in 2014, according to TechCrunch’s tests. And while OpenAI’s cameo feature allows people to set instructions for how they appear in videos others generate of them — guardrails that came in response to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">early criticism of Sora</a> — the deceased have no such say. I’ll bet Richard Nixon would be rolling over in his grave if he could see the deepfake I made of him advocating for police abolition.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Deepfakes of Richard Nixon, John Lennon, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robin Williams\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg 4700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=150,58 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=300,116 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=768,298 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=680,264 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=1200,466 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=1280,497 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=430,167 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=720,279 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=900,349 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=800,310 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=1536,596 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=2048,795 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=668,259 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=1440,559 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=708,275 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sora-ai-deepfakes.jpg?resize=50,19 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Deepfakes of Richard Nixon, John Lennon, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robin Williams</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sora, screenshots by TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>OpenAI did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the permissibility of deepfaking dead people. However, it’s possible that deepfaking dead celebrities like Williams is within the firm’s acceptable practices; <a href=\"https://j4t.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NOTES_Tiptoeing-through-the-libel-minefield.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">legal precedent</a> <a href=\"https://splc.org/2019/10/can-you-libel-a-dead-person/\" target=\"_blank\">shows</a> that the company likely wouldn’t be held liable for the defamation of the deceased.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to ‘this vaguely looks and sounds like them so that’s enough,’ just so other people can churn out horrible TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening,” Williams wrote.</p>\n<p>OpenAI’s critics accuse the company of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/26/openais-viral-studio-ghibli-moment-highlights-ai-copyright-concerns/\">taking a fast-and-loose approach on such issues</a>, which is why Sora was quickly flooded with AI clips of copyrighted characters like Peter Griffin and Pikachu upon its release. CEO Sam Altman originally said that Hollywood studios and agencies would need to explicitly opt out if they didn’t want their IP to be included in Sora-generated videos. The Motion Picture Association has already called on OpenAI to take action on this issue, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/10/mpa-sora-2-openai-copyright-infringement-1236571849/\" target=\"_blank\">declaring</a> in a statement that “well-established copyright law safeguards the rights of creators and applies here.” He has since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/04/sam-altman-says-sora-will-add-granular-opt-in-copyright-controls/\">said the company will reverse this position.</a></p>\n<p>Sora is, perhaps, the most dangerous deepfake-capable AI model accessible to people so far, given how realistic its outputs are. Other platforms like xAI lag behind, but have even fewer guardrails than Sora, making it possible to generate pornographic <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/report/718975/xai-grok-imagine-taylor-swifty-deepfake-nudes\" target=\"_blank\">deepfakes of real people</a>. As other companies catch up to OpenAI, we will set a horrifying precedent if we treat real people — living or dead — like our own personal playthings.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

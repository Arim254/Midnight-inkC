Less than 1% of all notifications receive any interactions from users, notes Google.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chrome-notifcations-safety.png\" alt=\"screenshots showing the Chrome feature, saying: \"Chrome unsubscribed you from notifications.\" \" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chrome-notifcations-safety.png 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chrome-notifcations-safety.png?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chrome-notifcations-safety.png?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chrome-notifcations-safety.png?resize=680,496 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chrome-notifcations-safety.png?resize=430,314 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chrome-notifcations-safety.png?resize=668,487 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chrome-notifcations-safety.png?resize=514,375 514w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chrome-notifcations-safety.png?resize=50,36 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Still, the tech giant believes some notifications can be helpful, which is why it won’t revoke those for <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1\" target=\"_blank\">installed web apps</a> — only for the sites where there’s low user engagement and high volume of notifications sent. This change alone could push spammy websites that push a lot of notifications to reconsider how many they want to send alerts, so they won’t lose access entirely.</p>\n<p>Unwanted notifications have been an issue facing consumers for years. On the iPhone, for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/\">Apple was forced to add controls</a> that let users send their push notifications to a daily summary, mute them, or turn them off altogether from the notification message itself, after <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/turn-off-your-push-notifications/\" target=\"_blank\">consumer</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/tim-cook-wants-you-to-put-down-your-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">frustrations</a> with the notification system grew.</p>\n<p>Google says it will inform users when it’s removing notification permissions, allowing users to change the setting back, if they prefer. If users would rather Google didn’t intervene, they can also opt to turn off this auto-revocation feature altogether, the company notes. </p>\n<p>The feature had been in testing ahead of today’s official launch. Google found that these changes didn’t significantly impact the total number of clicks on notifications, an indication that people weren’t really engaging much with these pop-ups to begin with.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

This option always existed; firms just rarely use it because they prefer having SEC reviewers actually look at their disclosures before going public. The difference here is that the SEC won’t penalize companies for omitting pricing or “price-dependent information” during the shutdown, making this workaround more palatable.</p>\n<p>Put another way, there’s still vetting, just the kind that happens after retail investors have already bought a company’s shares, which seems . . . not good, but maybe we’ll be surprised to learn that investor protection works better after the money changes hands. </p>\n<p>Companies do remain legally liable for their disclosures, and the SEC can demand amendments later.</p>\n</div>",

Paradigm Ventures, CapitalG, and Coinbase Ventures also participated.</p>\n<p>Kalshi also revealed that consumers in 140 countries can now make bets on its platform.</p>\n<p>The prediction market is seeing a dramatic surge in activity: Kalshi is set to reach $50 billion in annualized trading volume, up significantly from the approximately $300 million volume posted last year, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/business/dealbook/kalshi-prediction-market-fundraising.html\">New York Times</a> reported.</p>\n<p>Kalshi’s fundraise announcement follows one made just days earlier by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/kalshi-ceo-admits-enlisting-influencers-to-dis-polymarket-in-a-now-deleted-podcast-segment/\">archrival Polymarket</a>, which revealed that it had secured an investment of up to $2 billion from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, at a pre-money valuation of $8 billion. The deal valued Polymarket at $8 billion pre-money, a monumental increase from its $1 billion valuation only two months earlier in August.</p>\n<p>Both Kalshi and Polymarket rose to prominence last year, drawing significant attention for their prediction markets on the presidential election outcome.</p>\n<p>Polymarket has been barred from serving U.S. residents since 2022, following a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In July, the company acquired a derivatives exchange and a clearing house. The move helped Polymarket receive the right to reenter the U.S. market. Last month, the company’s CEO and founder, Shayne Coplan, <a href=\"https://x.com/shayne_coplan/status/1963280673709625346\" target=\"_blank\">said on X</a>: “Polymarket has been given the green light to go live in the USA by the CFTC.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Kalshi secured the right for Americans to use its platform after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/kalshi-ceo-state-law-doesnt-really-apply-to-us/\">successfully suing the CFTC</a> last year.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

He promised this is the “first of many” such Nvidia AI factories that will be deployed across Microsoft Azure’s global data centers to run OpenAI workloads.</p>\n<p>Each system is a cluster of more than 4,600 Nvidia GB300 rack computers sporting the much-in-demand Blackwell Ultra GPU chip and connected via Nvidia’s super-fast networking tech called InfiniBand. (Besides AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also had the foresight to corner the market on InfiniBand when his company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/nvidia-to-buy-supercomputer-chipmaker-mellanox-for-6-9b-beating-intel-in-a-bidding-war/\">acquired Mellanox</a> for $6.9 billion in 2019.)</p>\n<p>Microsoft promises that it will be deploying “hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs” as it rolls out these systems globally. While the size of these systems is eye-popping (and the company shared plenty <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/blog/behind-the-cloud-understanding-datacenters-and-communities/\" target=\"_blank\">more technical details</a> for hardware enthusiasts to peruse), the timing of this announcement is also noteworthy.</p>\n<p>It comes just after OpenAI, its partner and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/the-cracks-in-the-openai-microsoft-relationship-are-reportedly-widening/\">well-documented frenemy</a>, inked two high-profile data center deals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/wall-street-analysts-explain-how-amds-own-stock-will-pay-for-openais-billions-in-chip-purchases/\">with Nvidia and AMD</a>. In 2025, OpenAI has racked up, by some estimates, $1 trillion in commitments to build its own data centers. And CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/even-after-stargate-oracle-nvidia-and-amd-openai-has-more-big-deals-coming-soon-sam-altman-says/\">Sam Altman said this week that more were coming</a>.</p>\n<p>Microsoft clearly wants the world to know that it already has the data centers — <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/blog/behind-the-cloud-understanding-datacenters-and-communities/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 300</a> in 34 countries — and that they are “uniquely positioned” to “meet the demands of frontier AI today,” the company said. These monster AI systems are also capable of running the next generation of models with “hundreds of trillions of parameters,” it said.</p>\n<p>We expect to hear more about how Microsoft is ramping up to serve AI workloads later this month. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott will be speaking at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, which will be held October 27 to October 29 in San Francisco. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has pushed back on local media reports suggesting it plans to open an office in India, with a general partner calling the coverage “entirely fake news.”</p>\n<p>Earlier on Thursday, Indian media outlets <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/a16z-andreessen-horowitz-india-expansion-bengaluru-ai-saas-startups-11759839746933.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that a16z was preparing to establish a physical presence in the country by setting up an office in Bengaluru. The reports, which cited unnamed sources, also said the firm was in the process of hiring a local partner.</p>\n<p>However, Anish Acharya, a Bay Area-based general partner at a16z who has spent the last six years with the firm, dismissed the reports. “As much as I adore India and the many impressive founders+investors in the region, this is entirely fake news!” he <a href=\"https://x.com/illscience/status/1976363023133725168\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> on X.</p>\n<p>When contacted, an a16z spokesperson confirmed Acharya’s statement and referred to his post.</p>\n<p>The denial comes as a16z appears to be scaling back some of its international ambitions. Earlier this year, the firm decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/documents-show-uk-wooed-a16z-for-five-years/\" target=\"_blank\">shut down its London office</a> — which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/london-lures-a16zs-first-international-office-with-predictable-crypto-regs/\" target=\"_blank\">opened in 2023</a> after the U.K. government reportedly spent <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/andreessen-horowitz-london-office\" target=\"_blank\">five years</a> trying to woo the powerhouse firm, according to the outlet Sifted. The closure came just 18 months after a16z set up shop, with the firm citing a shift in strategy and more favorable regulatory developments back home. The firm said, however, that it would continue to invest internationally through remote teams and local networks. Reports later indicated that several of its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/a16z-has-venture-scouts-scattered-across-europe/\">scouts were active across Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>So far, India has not been a major focus for a16z — unlike other U.S. venture firms such as Accel, General Catalyst, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which have made deep inroads into the market. The firm’s only notable bet in India has been crypto exchange CoinSwitch, which it backed as part of the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/\" target=\"_blank\">$260 million funding round</a> in 2021.</p>\n<p>In the months that followed, a16z was reportedly seeking to invest <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/02/andreessen-horowitz-india/\" target=\"_blank\">about $500 million in Indian startups</a>, though it has not made any major investments in the country since.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>As TechCrunch has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/02/andreessen-horowitz-india/\">previously noted</a>, a16z co-founder and general partner Marc Andreessen delivered a talk at Stanford Graduate School of Business many years ago, saying while it is “extremely tempting” to back startups in emerging markets, it is also challenging for a venture fund to expand to more countries. Venture capital is a “very hands-on process of understanding the people you’re working with for both evaluating the company and work[ing] with the company,” he said at the time.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Instagram head Adam Mosseri said AI will change who can be creative, as the new tools and technology will give people who couldn’t be creators before the ability to produce content at a certain quality and scale. However, he also admitted that bad actors will use the technology for “nefarious purposes” and that kids growing up today will have to be taught that you can’t believe something just because you saw a video of it.</p>\n<p>The Meta executive shared his thoughts on how AI is impacting the creator industry at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QntoYdZNpTs\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg Screentime</a> conference this week. At the interview’s start, Mosseri was asked to address the recent comments from creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). On Threads, MrBeast had suggested that AI-generated videos could soon <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/mrbeast-says-ai-could-threaten-creators-livelihoods-calling-it-scary-times-for-the-industry/\">threaten creators’ livelihoods</a> and said it was “scary times” for the industry.</p>\n<p>Mosseri pushed back a bit at that idea, noting that most creators won’t be using AI technology to reproduce what MrBeast has historically done, with his huge sets and elaborate productions; instead, it will allow creators to do more and make better content.</p>\n<p>“If you take a big step back, what the internet did, among other things, was allow almost anyone to become a publisher by reducing the cost of distributing content to essentially zero,” Mosseri explained. “And what some of these generative AI models look like they’re going to do is they’re going to reduce the cost of producing content to basically zero,” he said. (This, of course, does not reflect the true <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\" target=\"_blank\">financial</a>, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2025/09/23/environmental-cost-of-ai/85797763007/\" target=\"_blank\">environmental</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/the-human-costs-of-the-ai-boom/\" target=\"_blank\">human</a> costs of using AI, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/orgs-demand-action-to-mitigate-ais-environmental-harm/\" target=\"_blank\">which</a> are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/01/ai-training-data-has-a-price-tag-that-only-big-tech-can-afford/\" target=\"_blank\">substantial</a>.)</p>\n<p>In addition, the exec suggested that there’s already a lot of “hybrid” content on today’s big social platforms, where creators are using AI in their workflow but not producing fully synthetic content. For instance, they might be using AI tools for color corrections or filters. Going forward, Mosseri said, the line between what’s real and what’s AI generated will become even more blurred.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be a little bit less like, what is organic content and what is AI synthetic content, and what the percentages are. I think there’s gonna be actually more in the middle than pure synthetic content for a while,” he said.</p>\n<p>As things change, Mosseri said Meta has some responsibility to do more in terms of identifying what content is AI generated. But he also noted that the way the company had gone about this wasn’t the “right focus” and was practically “a fool’s errand.” He was referring to how Meta had initially tried to label AI content automatically, which led to a situation where it was <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/metas-approach-to-labeling-ai-generated-content-and-manipulated-media/#:~:text=Update%20on%20July%201%2C%202024%20at%207%3A00AM%20PT%3A%C2%A0\" target=\"_blank\">labeling real content as AI</a>, because AI tools, including those from Adobe, were used as part of the process.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The executive said that the labeling system needs more work but that Meta should also provide more context that helps people make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>While he didn’t elaborate on what that newly added context would be, he may have been thinking about Meta’s Community Notes feature, which is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/meta-is-launching-community-notes-in-the-us-next-week/\">crowdsourced fact-checking system launched in the U.S. this year,</a> modeled on the one X uses. Instead of turning to third-party fact checkers, Community Notes and similar systems mark content with corrections or additional context when users who often share opposing opinions agree that a fact-check or further explanation is needed. It’s likely that Meta could be weighing the use of such a system for flagging when something is AI generated but hasn’t been labeled as such.</p>\n<p>Rather than saying it was fully the platform’s responsibility to label AI content, Mosseri suggested that society itself would have to change. </p>\n<p>“My kids are young. They’re nine, seven, and five. I need them to understand, as they grow up and they get exposed to the internet, that just because they’re seeing a video of something doesn’t mean it actually happened,” he explained. “When I grew up, and I saw a video, I could assume that that was a capture of a moment that happened in the real world,” Mosseri continued. </p>\n<p>“What they’re going to … need to think about who is saying it, who’s sharing it, in this case, and what are their incentives, and why might they be saying it,” he concluded. (That seems like a heavy mental load for young children, but alas.)</p>\n<p>In the discussion, Mosseri also touched on other topics about the future of Instagram beyond AI, including its plans for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/instagram-is-exploring-a-dedicated-tv-app-in-video-push\" target=\"_blank\">a dedicated TV app</a> and its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/instagram-is-testing-a-reels-first-ui-in-india-and-south-korea/\" target=\"_blank\">newer focus on Reels and DMs</a> as its core features (which Mosseri said just reflected user trends), and how TikTok’s changing ownership in the U.S. will impact the competitive landscape.</p>\n<p>On the latter, he said that, ultimately, it’s better to have competition, as TikTok’s U.S. presence has forced Instagram to “do better work.” As for the TikTok deal itself, Mosseri said it’s hard to parse, but it seems like how the app has been built will not meaningfully change.” </p>\n<p>“It’s the same app, the same ranking system, the same creators that you’re following — the same people. It’s all sort of seamless,” Mosseri said of the “new” TikTok U.S. operation. “It doesn’t seem like it’s a major change in terms of incentives,” he added. </p>\n</div>",

It plans to use the new capital largely for acquisitions.</p>\n<p>The company has also made its first acquisition, buying Prezentium, founded by Deepti Juturu, a services-led presentation company that operates in the life sciences vertical. In an unusual arrangement, Prezent founder Rajat Mishra was one of the co-founders of Prezentium. Mishra said that since the beginning of his new startup, he has been the non-operating president of Prezentium. Both startups already have an existing relationship, as Prezent uses Prezentium as a go-to-market partner. The acquisition essentially brings Mishra’s two ventures under one roof, allowing Prezent to use Prezentium’s client base to offer its own AI suite to more customers.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg 3845w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=1280,854 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/prezent_slide-library_laptop@2x.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Prezent</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are plenty of companies trying to create AI-powered presentation-building tools, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/accel-backs-indian-ai-startup-building-chatgpt-for-presentations/\">Presentations.ai</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/03/ex-microsoft-employees-get-4m-from-accel-to-build-an-ai-tool-for-product-presentations/\">Lica</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/gamma-brings-in-7m-to-bring-the-slide-deck-into-the-21st-century/\">Gamma</a>, and <a href=\"http://chroniclehq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chronicle</a>.

However, Mishra noted that for now, the company wants to focus on serving clients in the life sciences and tech industries.</p>\n<p>“There are plenty of tools that are trying to make presentations pretty. We want to provide the best tools for business communications. I think presentation is one of the frontiers in businesses that is not automated yet.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The energy transition is seemingly under assault, with congressional Republicans <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/03/final-gop-bill-kneecaps-renewables-and-hydrogen-but-lifts-nuclear-and-geothermal/\">killing tax credits</a> for clean energy and the Trump administration threatening to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/trumps-doe-proposes-cutting-billions-in-grants-for-gm-ford-and-lots-of-startups/\">cancel billions of dollars’ worth of grants</a>. </p>\n<p>But there are signs the setback might not be as catastrophic for the transition as the headlines make it sound.</p>\n<p>Investor sentiment, which judging by the size of two new funds, remains strong. And more founders are pouring into the sector. The upshot: People and organizations are betting money and time that the energy transition isn’t going away.</p>\n<p>This week, Brookfield announced it had raised $20 billion for its second energy transition fund. The infrastructure investor has already deployed $5 billion of that money into renewable power projects and developers focusing on solar, wind, and battery storage.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more notable is the fact that Brookfield raised 33% more money this time around than it did for its first transition fund in 2021, when zero percent interest rates and a frothy economy led some to speculate that clean energy was <a href=\"https://www.energyconnects.com/news/renewables/2021/november/green-investing-may-be-a-bubble-jeremy-grantham-says-but-he-s-doubling-down/\" target=\"_blank\">entering a bubble</a>. This second, larger fund raised in a less exuberant period suggests that limited partners see durable growth ahead.</p>\n<p>Also this week, Energy Impact Partners (EIP) announced it had closed its third flagship fund with $1.36 billion in commitments, some 40% larger than the previous one. EIP is a venture fund that invests after early-stage startups prove their mettle; the median size of a round it invests in is $26 million, according to PitchBook.</p>\n<p>Climate tech — or whatever people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/21/if-climate-tech-is-dead-what-comes-next/\">are calling it these days</a> — has seen an uptick in new founders flocking to the sector over the past five years, driven by a changing climate that became <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/climate-investors-canada-wildfires/\">too hard to ignore</a> for many. Not all of those will have survived (such is the nature of early-stage startups), but enough have made it that investors see opportunity in funding the next stage of their growth.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Already, EIP has deployed about a quarter of its new fund to companies like GridBeyond, which helps manage distributed energy resources, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/how-an-over-the-air-update-made-quilts-heat-pumps-more-powerful/\">Quilt</a>, a consumer-facing heat pump manufacturer.</p>\n<p>Investing trends that have developed over the past decade remain strong. Since 2014, large LPs like pension funds and endowments have committed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/large-funds-are-too-invested-in-the-energy-transition-to-turn-back-now/\">nearly $1 trillion</a> to the energy transition. And while climate tech VCs are on track to raise about as much as last year, they’re outpacing the broader venture world, securing a larger percentage of commitments. This year, they’ve raised 3.8% of all venture capital, nearly double their share in 2020, <a href=\"https://my.pitchbook.com/research-center/report/60abbe3b-aa8d-3f41-98e3-e9093b0f2d3a\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to PitchBook.</p>\n<p>In the U.S., there are headwinds in the near term. </p>\n<p>The Trump administration is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/trumps-energy-department-forbids-staff-from-saying-climate-change-or-green/\">openly opposed</a> to the idea of an energy transition, and it is doing its best to undermine what progress has been made. As a result, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2025\">revised downward</a> the forecast for renewable adoption in the U.S., predicting that the rollout between now and 2030 will be 45% lower than the agency had predicted last year.</p>\n<p>Despite that, renewable capacity worldwide is expected to double by 2030, led by solar installations in China, India, the EU, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/zeno-emerges-from-stealth-to-crib-teslas-master-plan-for-africa-and-beyond/\">Subsaharan Africa</a>.</p>\n<p>The IEA isn’t the only organization predicting that the transition will continue. Analysts at DNV <a href=\"https://www.dnv.com/eto2025/\" target=\"_blank\">expect</a> that renewables will provide 65% of the world’s electricity by 2040 and nearly all of it by 2060. </p>\n<p>It won’t be enough to hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, DNV said. But few transitions are without their ups and downs, and the momentum appears to favor more renewable energy, not less. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

Other traditional general search providers are significantly smaller than Google and have been for many years. Bing is the largest of these providers, but its current shares of queries and search advertising are both less than 5%. No traditional general search providers have materially grown relative to Google for at least fifteen years,” the CMA wrote in a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68e8b643cf65bd04bad76724/Final_decision_-_strategic_market_status_investigation_into_Google_s_general_search_services.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>.</p>\n<p>Although the designation does not mean that the CMA has found evidence of wrongdoing and does not introduce any immediate requirements, it does open the gates to launch further assessments and introduce interventions to change how Google runs its search services in the country, the CMA said. </p>\n<p>The designation covers Google’s search and online search advertising services; its AI-enabled search features like AI Overviews and AI Mode, and the “Discover” feed and results, as well as the “Top Stories” and News tab. It does not cover the Google News app and website, and search syndication services are also out of scope.</p>\n<p>The CMA, however, noted that while Google’s Gemini AI assistant isn’t covered by the designation at the moment, it will review the scope of the designation given uncertainty over how the AI search market is evolving. </p>\n<p>The regulator said it would launch a consultation on possible interventions later this year.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The move follows a nine-month <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/uks-cma-slaps-google-search-and-its-90-market-share-with-an-antitrust-investigation/\">investigation</a> into the company launched earlier this year after the U.K.’s new digital markets competition regime came into force in January. The CMA was looking to prove if Google is enabling weak competition and “barriers to entry and innovation in search”; whether the company prefers its own services over those offered by third parties; and if it uses consumer data without their explicit consent. </p>\n<p>The CMA’s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6859810eeaa6f6419fade671/Roadmap_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> of possible enforcement actions may include: enabling U.K. residents to choose and switch search engines via choice screens; implementing data portability systems; enforcing fair ranking of search results; ensuring proper attribution of publishers’ work in search; and enabling consent mechanisms for Google’s AI services.</p>\n<p>Google, for its part, says that any interventions following the designation would harm innovation in the U.K. “The UK enjoys access to the latest products and services before other countries because it has so far avoided costly restrictions on popular services, such as Search. Retaining this position means avoiding unduly onerous regulations and learning from the negative results seen in other jurisdictions, which have cost businesses an estimated €114 billion,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/cma-designation-google-search/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>“Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation. Others pose direct harm to businesses, with some warning that they may be forced to raise prices for customers,” it added.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.</p>\n<p>Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-microsoft-s-1-billion-investment-in-openai\">Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI</h2>\n<p>This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi\" target=\"_blank\">In 2019</a>, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment\" target=\"_blank\">in the form of Azure cloud credit</a> rather than cash. </p>\n<p>It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.</p>\n<p>The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/microsoft-is-no-longer-openais-exclusive-cloud-provider/\">no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively</a>, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.</p>\n<p>OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-amazon-trainium\" target=\"_blank\">making kernel-level modifications</a> on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/how-ai-startups-are-fueling-googles-booming-cloud-business/\">smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf</a> as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-171740706.html\" target=\"_blank\">in September</a>, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-the-rise-of-oracle\">The rise of Oracle</h2>\n<p>On June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\">a spot alongside Google</a> as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>A few months later, it happened again. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/openai-and-oracle-reportedly-ink-historic-cloud-computing-deal/\">On September 10</a>, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/why-the-oracle-openai-deal-caught-wall-street-by-surprise/\">climbed even higher</a>, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. </p>\n<p>But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-nvidia-s-investment-spree\">Nvidia’s investment spree</h3>\n<p>As AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly all buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, the company bought <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/nvidia-buys-5-billion-stake-in-intel-planning-ai-chip-collaboration/\">a 4% stake in rival Intel </a>for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-as-huang-touts-biggest-ai-infrastructure-project-in-history-171740509.html\" target=\"_blank\">a $100 billion investment in OpenAI</a>, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement</a> with AMD.</p>\n<p>If that seems circular, it should. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-building-tomorrow-s-hyperscale-data-centers\">Building tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers</h2>\n<p>For companies like Meta that already have <a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/research/metas-hyperscale-infrastructure-overview-and-insights/\" target=\"_blank\">significant legacy infrastructure</a>, the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says\" target=\"_blank\">through the end of 2028</a>.</p>\n<p>In just the first half of 2025, the company spent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/meta-to-spend-up-to-72b-on-ai-infrastructure-in-2025-as-compute-arms-race-escalates/\">$30 billion more</a> than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent <a href=\"https://aimagazine.com/news/inside-metas-cloud-deal-with-google-for-ai-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">$10 billion deal with Google Cloud</a>, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. </p>\n<p>A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, <a href=\"https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/55248311/meta-sees-10b-ai-data-center-in-louisiana-using-combo-of-clean-energy-nuclear-power\" target=\"_blank\">dubbed Hyperion</a>, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/\">provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power</a>. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. </p>\n<p>That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/06/elon-musk-xai-memphis-gas-turbines-air-pollution-permits-00317582?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR5SDS-dmGr0PSpTHkF5PV2cXs3-rKqNuPaMbeyJmaGGE56-qWvJrA29i9S4pg_aem_leaKorFEsIQuzImIDd960A\" target=\"_blank\">experts say violate the Clean Air Act</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h-the-stargate-moonshot\">The Stargate moonshot</h2>\n<p>Just two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.” </p>\n<p>In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.</p>\n<p>As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/softbank-concedes-stargate-project-with-openai-needs-more-time\" target=\"_blank\">In August</a>, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of <a href=\"https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/stargate-abilene/abilenes-data-center-advances-swiftly-with-5000-workers/\" target=\"_blank\">eight data centers in Abilene, Texas</a>, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on September 22.</em></p>\n</div>",

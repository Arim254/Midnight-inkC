By shrinking them down to “small modular” size, the hope is that costs will come down as parts are mass produced and engineering and construction crews become more familiar with building them.\nTo date, though, only two small modular reactors are operational, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n",

    "body": "\nEvery year, Google releases a report highlighting the top trending searches, offering a snapshot of what captured our collective curiosity, spanning pop culture, entertainment, internet trends, and news events. This year, people around the world were most curious about everything from hot honey and AI chatbots to the Toronto Blue Jays.\nBefore we get into the specifics, it’s worth noting that Google’s report doesn’t reflect the overall most popular searches. If it did, the list would be filled with general terms like “weather” rather than trending topics. Instead, Google’s “Year in Search” highlights queries that saw a sustained spike in traffic in 2025 compared with 2024.\nThat being said, the top trending search of the year was “Gemini,” which is Google’s AI chatbot, followed by “India vs England” and “Charlie Kirk.” Gemini wasn’t the only AI chatbot to make the list, as DeepSeek ranked seventh among the year’s trending searches.\nIn 2025, Google says Charlie Kirk was the top trending news topic, with the query “Charlie Kirk assassination” leading the list. The second and third trending news queries were “Iran” and “US Government Shutdown,” respectively.\nAs for recipes and food, the top spot went to the sweet-and-spicy condiment hot honey, while Marry Me Chicken and chimichurri rounded out the top three.\nFor movies, the top trending search was “Anora” followed by “Superman” and the “Minecraft Movie.” The top trending search for actors went to “Anora” star Mikey Madison. Lewis Pullman, who starred in Marvel’s “Thunderbolts,” took the second spot, followed by Isabela Merced, who was featured in “Superman.”\nIn terms of sports, “FIFA Club World Cup” was the top trending search, followed by “Asia Cup” and “ICC Champions Trophy.” The top searched sports team was Paris Saint-Germain F.C., while the second and third were S.L. Benfica and the Toronto Blue Jays, respectively. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs for podcasts, the top trending search was “The Charlie Kirk Show,” followed by Jason and Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” and “This is Gavin Newsom.”\nFor books, the top trending search was for Colleen Hoover’s “Regretting You.” Rebecca Yarros’ “Onyx Storm” and Naveesa Allen’s “Lights Out” rounded out the top three. \nYou can check out the full report here. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhile many venture firms seem to only have eyes for AI these days, Nexus Venture Partners is deliberately splitting its focus for its new $700 million fund. \nThe firm will back AI startups and seek out India-focused startups in consumer, fintech, and digital infrastructure.\nAI has soaked up most of the venture capital raised globally and the 20-year-old VC firm also sees AI as a defining technological shift. But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse.\nFor Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins. The Delaware-headquartered firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Mumbai and Bengaluru, has operated as a single fund and an integrated U.S.–India team since its founding in 2006. \nIt backs early-stage software and India-focused startups from the same pool of capital. Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure.\nMeanwhile its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market\n“AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years. The firm has recorded more than 30 exits to date, including several IPOs, underscoring the depth of its early-stage, long-horizon approach.\nAbhishek Sharma, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch the firm’s sweet spot remains inception to seed and Series A, often beginning with checks as small as a few hundred thousand dollars or around $1 million.\nNexus, which operates with an eight-member investment team, began with a $100 million fund and has kept its fund size at $700 million since launching Fund VII in 2023. It typically raises every 2.5 to 3 years. Bhattacharjee said the reason for keeping the eighth fund the same size was the firm believes $700 million is the right amount for its early-stage strategy.\n“We don’t want to raise money for the sake of raising,” he noted.\nEven though India’s AI journey is not as advanced as the U.S.’s in many areas, Nexus believes India could leapfrog in several parts of the AI ecosystem. \nBhattacharjee underlined the country’s large talent pool, rising digital infrastructure, and demand for localized models that support India’s many languages and service needs. These dynamics, he said, are pushing Indian startups to build AI applications and agents faster, often atop open-source tools and emerging domestic AI infrastructure companies.\nThe partners pointed to companies backed by Nexus, such as Zepto and Neysa, to illustrate how AI is taking shape in India. They said Zepto, the quick-commerce platform, uses AI extensively across its operations — from customer support to routing and fulfillment — demonstrating how consumer businesses are becoming deeply AI-native. Besides, infrastructure players like Neysa are emerging to address India-specific needs, including sovereign AI workloads, localized data handling and support for the country’s many languages.\nNexus did not share fund metrics. The partners said its funds have been realizing significant enough returns over the years to largely fill this fund from returning limited partners. The firm’s LP base spans the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Japan.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Roblox\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:01 PM PST · December 3, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nThe online gaming platform Roblox has been banned in Russia, according to a report from Russian state media.\nRoblox is a user-generated content platform where players can create and share their own games and experiences, similar to Minecraft. The platform hosts various interest-based and affinity communities, including military roleplaying games and LGBTQ solidarity groups. But Russia has laws designating public LGBTQ advocacy as “extremist activity.“\nAccording to a translation of an article in TASS, a state-owned Russian news agency, Russia’s communications agency cited the presence of LGBTQ content on the platform as one of the reasons behind the ban.\nRoblox did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the ban this afternoon.\nThe ban comes as Roblox faces broader safety and moderation challenges. Recent reports have highlighted how the platform exposed some of its underage users to child predators. In the U.S., Roblox has faced legal probes from the attorneys general in Texas and Louisiana. Roblox has since introduced age checks and content moderation tools aimed at keeping children safe — beginning in January, the company plans to implement mandatory facial verification to access Roblox’s chat features. (However, facial verification technology comes with safety concerns of its own.)\nRoblox has also asked developers to flag experiences that “are primarily themed on a sensitive social, political, or religious issue” so that the parents of users under 13 years old can decide if their children can access that content. This sparked backlash from advocacy groups like Out Making Games, Women in Games, and BAME in Games, which represent minority groups in the gaming industry. In an open letter, the groups wrote that Roblox considered topics like “pay equity in sports” to be “sensitive.”\n“While parental controls serve an important purpose, they shouldn’t come at the expense of fundamental human dignity,” the letter said. “We are calling on Roblox to reconsider these guidelines and find ways to protect young users without legitimizing discrimination or silencing important voices.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Appfigures, an app intelligence firm, Roblox was installed an estimated 70 million times in Russia on mobile, with about 8 million downloads so far this year.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nFintech company Marquis is notifying dozens of U.S. banks and credit unions that they had customer data stolen in a cyberattack earlier this year. \nDetails of the cyberattack emerged this week after Marquis filed data breach notices with several U.S. states confirming its August 14 incident as a ransomware attack.\nTexas-based Marquis is a marketing and compliance provider that allows banks and other financial institutions to collect and visualize all of their customer data in one place. The company counts more than 700 banking and credit union customers on its website. As such, Marquis has access to and stores large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the United States.\nAt least 400,000 people are so far confirmed affected by the data breach, according to legally required disclosures filed in the states of Iowa, Maine, Texas, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire that TechCrunch has reviewed.\nTexas has the largest number of state residents so far who had data stolen in the breach, affecting at least 354,000 people.\nMarquis said in its notice with Maine’s attorney general that banking customers with the Maine State Credit Union accounted for the majority of its data breach notifications, or around one-in-nine people who are known to be affected throughout the state.\nThe number of individuals affected by the breach is expected to rise as more data breach notifications roll in from other states.\nMarquis said the hackers stole customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, such as bank account, debit, and credit card numbers. Marquis said the hackers also stole customers’ Social Security numbers.\nAccording to its most recent notices, Marquis blamed the ransomware attack on hackers who exploited a vulnerability in its SonicWall firewall. The vulnerability was considered a zero-day, meaning the flaw was not known to SonicWall or its customers before it was maliciously exploited by hackers. \nMarquis did not attribute the ransomware attack to a particular group, but the Akira ransomware gang was reportedly behind the mass-hacks targeting SonicWall customers at the time. \nTechCrunch asked Marquis if it is aware of the total number of people affected by the breach, and if Marquis received any communication from the hackers or if the company paid a ransom, but we did not hear back by the time of publication.\nDo you know more about the Marquis data breach? Do you work at Marquis or a company affected by the breach? We would love to hear from you.

    "body": "\nRight on the heels of announcing Nova Forge, a service to train custom Nova AI models, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced more tools for enterprise customers to create their own frontier models.\nAWS announced new capabilities in Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI at its AWS re:Invent conference on Wednesday. These new capabilities are designed to make building and fine-tuning custom large language models (LLMs) easier for developers.\nThe cloud provider is introducing serverless model customization in SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure, according to Ankur Mehrotra, general manager of AI platforms at AWS, in an interview with TechCrunch.\nTo access these serverless model-building capabilities, developers can either follow a self-guided point-and-click path or an agent-led experience where they can prompt SageMaker using natural language. The agent-led feature is launching in preview.\n“If you’re a healthcare customer and you wanted a model to be able to understand certain medical terminology better, you can simply point SageMaker AI, if you have labeled data, then select the technique and then off SageMaker goes, and [it] fine tunes the model,” Mehrotra said.\nThis capability is available for customizing Amazon’s own Nova models and certain open source models (those with publicly available model weights), including DeepSeek and Meta’s Llama.\nAWS is also launching Reinforcement Fine-Tuning in Bedrock that allows developers to choose either a reward function or a pre-set workflow, and Bedrock will run a model customization process automatically from start to finish.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFrontier LLMs — meaning the most advanced AI models — and model customization appear to be an area of focus for AWS at this year’s conference.\nAWS announced Nova Forge, a service where AWS will build custom Nova models for its enterprise customers for $100,000 a year, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s keynote on Tuesday.\n“A lot of our customers are asking, ‘If my competitor has access to the same model, how do I differentiate myself?’” Mehrotra said. “‘How do I build unique solutions that are optimized, that optimize my brand, for my data, for my use case, and how do I differentiate myself?’ What we’ve found is that, the key to solving that problem is being able to create customized models.”\nAWS has yet to gain a substantial user base for its AI models. A July survey from Menlo Ventures found that enterprises greatly prefer Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini to other models. However, the ability to customize and fine-tune these LLMs could start to give AWS a competitive advantage.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual enterprise tech event here, and see all the announcements you may have missed thus far here.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nBrevo, a customer relationship management company headquartered in Paris, is now a unicorn — a startup valued at more than $1 billion. The startup raised €500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as Hubspot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S.\nFormerly known as Sendinblue, Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a new name reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&M.\nThe U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo’s revenue — one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That’s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth. \n“That’s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,” the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch.\nRevenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upwards. \nAfter joining the centaur club in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass €200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time, and aims to reach €1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch.\nThat’s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting $41.55 billion in revenue for 2026. The French company hopes being a unicorn will help boost its notoriety, thanks to the status itself, and also to the equity funding, which comes in addition to debt that Brevo had previously secured. (Brevo claims “double-digit EBITDA margin.”)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese coffers have already supported Brevo’s plans to invest €50 million in AI over five years, and to use acquisitions (11 to date) as one of its growth levers. The 1,000-employee company now intends to use its new funding to support these two endeavors, alongside its push in the U.S., on which it plans to spend over €100 million, according to a press release.\nBrevo didn’t disclose the exact valuation resulting from its latest round. It did give more details on its updated cap table. \nRumors had described the deal as Brevo getting acquired, but Thiberge said Brevo’s management and employees still hold the largest share (26%) while new entrants General Atlantic and Oakley Capital each bought 25%; existing investors Bpifrance and Bridgepoint collectively retained 24%, while Series A lead Partech completed its exit. \nThis makes for a global cap table that mirrors Brevo’s stated ambition to “build a global European CRM leader capable of competing with U.S. players through product excellence.” In other words, not through playing the European sovereignty card.\nFor Thiberge, “whoever has the best product wins, and it’s a race to see who can make the product that is both the most complete and the easiest to use.” There’s an inherent tension to doing this, and to catering both to mid-market companies and very small businesses. “I’m not saying it’s easy every day […] but for us, this combination has been incredibly successful.”\nTo serve this diverse audience, Brevo has significantly expanded beyond its email marketing roots. While it still competes with Mailchimp in that space, the company now offers an all-in-one platform with marketing automation, CRM, customer data management, and communication across email, SMS, WhatsApp, live chat, push notifications, and even integrated sales calls.\nThese functionalities are also increasingly boosted by AI, either through integrations or in-house. Expanding this feature set is one driver of Brevo’s M&A strategy, but inorganic growth from buying competitors in key markets is the other. With acquisitions expected to contribute 45% of its €1 billion revenue target for 2030, the company’s shopping list should be extensive.\nThis story was updated to correct cap table details.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nAlan Dye, the design executive who led Apple’s user interface team for the last decade, is leaving the company to join Meta, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.\nThis is a significant hire for Meta, as the company makes a push toward consumer devices like smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Dye will focus on improving AI features in these devices and report directly to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth.\nAt Apple, Dye will be replaced by Steve Lemay, who has had “a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,” according to a statement Apple CEO Tim Cook gave Bloomberg.\nIt seems that Meta is recruiting from its competitors to help the company compete in the AI race, as Meta also poached researchers from OpenAI this summer. (Allegedly, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hand-delivered homemade soup to an OpenAI employee in a recruitment push; OpenAI chief research officer Mark Chen said that he has since delivered his own soup to promising Meta recruits.)\nShortly after the news broke of Dye’s departure, Zuckerberg announced a new creative studio within Reality Labs that would be led by Dye. There, he’ll be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another former Apple designer who led interface design across Reality Labs; Joshua To, who led interface design across Reality Labs; Meta’s industrial design team, led by Pete Bristol; and its metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin. \nZuckerberg said the studio would “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.”  \n“Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered,” the Meta CEO wrote on Threads. “We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis article was updated after publication with additional information about Meta’s plans.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nEarlier this year, home goods maker Kohler launched a smart camera called the Dekoda that attaches to your toilet bowl, takes pictures of it, and analyzes the images to advise you on your gut health. \nAnticipating privacy fears, Kohler said on its website that the Dekoda’s sensors only see down into the toilet, and claimed that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption.”\nThe company’s use of the expression “end-to-end encryption” is, however, wrong, as security researcher Simon Fondrie-Teitler pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday. \nBy reading Kohler’s privacy policy, it’s clear that the company is referring to the type of encryption that secures data as it travels over the internet, known as TLS encryption — the same that powers HTTPS websites. \nUsing the right terms matters, especially in the context of users’ privacy concerns. Using the expression end-to-end encryption — widely adopted by messaging apps such as iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp — to describe TLS encryption is wrong, and can potentially confuse users who see that expression and think Kohler actually cannot see the pictures that the camera takes. \nA Kohler spokesperson did not respond to questions from TechCrunch, but a company “privacy contact” told Fondrie-Teitler that user data is “encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user’s mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.” The company also said that, “data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.”\nThe security researcher also pointed out that given Kohler can access customers’ data on its servers, it’s possible Kohler is using customers’ bowl pictures to train AI. Citing another response from the company representative, the researcher was told that Kohler’s “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Dekoda costs $599 plus a mandatory subscription of at least $6.99 per month.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nIs it time for MrBeast to hit the New York Stock Exchange? Three years ago, the idea of a YouTuber with a $1.5 billion valuation left some onlookers incredulous — but Beast Industries ended up raising at a $5 billion valuation last year. Now we’re asking a bigger question: Would you buy stock in a 27-year-old named Jimmy?\nIt’s getting to the point where even if you don’t have a child under the age of 15, you should know who MrBeast is. The North Carolinian Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast channel has over 450 million YouTube subscribers — more than any other YouTube channel — making him arguably the most successful social media star ever. \nSo it made sense when at the DealBook Summit, reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin asked MrBeast and Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, about going public.\n“You want to have an IPO at some point, I imagine,” said Sorkin.\n“At some point, we want to be able to give the 1.4 billion unique people around the world who has watched Jimmy’s content the last 90 days a chance to be owners of the company,” Housebold replied. Sounds pretty much like a yes, as we can’t imagine another practical way to give ownership stakes to over a billion people.\nLike other major creators, the MrBeast business expands far beyond YouTube ad revenue and into a company called Beast Industries. Its biggest moneymaker is Feastables chocolate, which is more profitable than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg.\nHousenbold also mentioned that Beast Industries plans to build a two-sided marketplace for creators and marketers to work together (this idea has been explored by many creator economy startups already). Plus, the company is planning to launch a phone company, a financial services platform, and a theme park in Saudi Arabia. Sure, why not!\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDonaldson’s business has had its share of stumbles, though. Beast Industries is in an ongoing lawsuit with the ghost kitchen Virtual Dining Concepts for damaging his brand by selling “inedible” food from MrBeast Burger. Virtual Dining Concepts countersued him for allegedly breaching his contract.\nThen, after filming the first season of “Beast Games,” five contestants sued Donaldson and Amazon for alleged mistreatment and sexual harassment on set. The heavily redacted lawsuit states that the show filmed in an environment that “systematically fostered a culture of misogyny and sexism.”\nIn conversation at DealBook, Donaldson said, “The big thing is, obviously, I learned why people don’t have 2,000 people compete in a show, because you’re creating a scenario where 1,999 aren’t happy, because they didn’t win … I don’t know how openly I’m allowed to speak, but obviously, yes, some people sue you. I’m sure people in here have been sued before because they just want to try to make money.”\nHousenbold cut in, “Listen, we’re always learning and getting better.” He was interrupted by laughter from the crowd. “Mistakes are part of success, so Season 2 is a lot better.”\nNot that Beast Industries’ missteps would prevent it from going public eventually, especially if it moves past them and can build the management discipline needed to bear the scrutiny of being public. \nDonaldson wouldn’t be the first creator-run business to go public — but he could pull off the first creator IPO that actually works. The esports team FaZe Clan went public in a $725 million SPAC but got acquired a year later in 2023 for just $17 million. In November, Pinkfong — the company that made the most-watched YouTube video, “Baby Shark” — went public in Korea.\n“From day one, we’re a global media company, and now we’re working on monetizing that viewership, that fandom, and that trust we built,” Housenbold said.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nIn early October, DualEntry, an AI enterprise resource planning (ERP) startup, announced a $90 million Series A round led by Lightspeed and Khosla Ventures, valuing the one-year-old business at $415 million. \nThe company seeks to replace legacy software like Oracle NetSuite with its offering that can automate routine tasks and provide predictive insights. The massive funding round from top-tier VCs signaled that the startup is likely experiencing phenomenal revenue growth. \nHowever, one VC who declined to invest told TechCrunch that DualEntry’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) was just around $400,000 when he reviewed the deal in August. DualEntry’s co-founder, Santiago Nestares, denies that number. When asked about revenue when the deal closed, Nestares said it was “considerably higher than that.”\nEven so, an extremely handsome valuation relative to revenue is becoming an increasingly common investment strategy among top-tier VC firms. The tactic is known as “kingmaking.” \nThis approach involves deploying massive funding into one startup in a competitive category, aiming to overwhelm rivals by granting the chosen company a bank-account advantage so significant that it creates the appearance of market dominance.\nKingmaking isn’t new, but its timing has shifted dramatically.\n“Venture capitalists have always evaluated a set of competitors and then made a bet on who they think the winner is going to be in a category. What’s different is that it’s happening much earlier,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis early aggressive funding contrasts with the last investment cycle.\n“The 2010s version of this was just called ‘capital as a weapon,’” said David Peterson, partner at Angular Ventures. He pointed out that massive funding into Uber and Lyft was a canonical example of this, but the capital weaponization for the ride-sharing companies didn’t begin until they reached their Series C or D rounds.\nAs with Uber vs. Lyft, investors in DualEntry’s competitors Rillet and Campfire are evidently just as eager to see their bets succeed with the help of substantive capital. In early August, Rillet raised a $70 million Series B led by a16z and Iconiq, just two months after the company closed a $25 million Series A led by Sequoia.\nSimilarly, Campfire AI had two back-to-back funding rounds. In October, it grabbed a $65 million Series B, just a couple of months after announcing a $35 million Series A round led by Accel.\nAI ERP is just one of the several AI application categories where startups are raising funding in rapid succession. “There’s no new data between rounds. Series Bs happen 27-60 days after Series As regularly,” Jaya Gupta a partner at Foundation Capital, posted on X last month. Besides AI ERP, she wrote that she sees this pattern in categories such as IT service management and SOC compliance.\nWhile some startups like Cursor or Lovable have reportedly grown at a breakneck pace between their back-to-back rounds, several VCs told TechCrunch that’s not the case for all. AI ERPs and several other categories of startups that raised multiple rounds in 2025 still have ARRs in the single-digit millions, these investors said.\nAlthough not all VCs agree that kingmaking is a sound investment strategy, there are reasons why offering large amounts of capital could be beneficial even when the startup maintains a modest burn rate. For instance, well-funded startups are perceived as more likely to survive by large enterprise buyers, making them the preferred vendor for significant software purchases. That’s a strategy that helped legal AI startup Harvey attract large law firm customers, investors say.\nStill, history shows that massive capitalization offers no guarantee of success, with notable failures, including the logistics company Convoy and the bankruptcy reorg of scooter company Bird.\nBut those precedents don’t faze major VC firms. They prefer to bet on a category that seems like a good case for AI, and they would rather invest early because, as Peterson put it: “Everybody has fully internalized the lesson of the power law. In the 2010s, companies could grow faster and be bigger than almost anybody had realized. You couldn’t have overpaid if you were an early Uber investor.”\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

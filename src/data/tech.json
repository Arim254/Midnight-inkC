    "body": "\nElevenLabs struck a deal with actors Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to AI-generate their voices, the company announced this week.\nHollywood and AI have an up-and-down relationship, with its guardrails — or lack thereof — serving among the main concerns that led to the Hollywood strikes a few years ago. Since then, some artists have started to warm up to the idea of AI.\nLast year, Meta announced that its Meta AI would offer voice assistants that sound like actresses Kristen Bell and Judi Dench. With McConaughey, an investor in ElevenLabs, the company will translate his newsletter into Spanish audio with the use of his AI voice.\nElevenLabs also announced this week that it was launching a marketplace to let brands use authorized AI-generated voices of celebrities, which will include Caine and other names like Liza Minnelli and Dr. Maya Angelou. ElevenLabs is one of the more popular AI unicorn companies and has backers including a16z and ICONIQ.  \n\n\tTopics\n",

A new launch date has not yet been announced.\nNew Glenn’s first launch in January was mostly a successful demonstration mission of the rocket. Blue Origin delayed the second launch multiple times, though, and the company is being cautious since this is the first time the rocket has a commercial payload onboard. \nNew Glenn nearly took off this past Sunday, but weather concerns and an errant cruise ship in the flight path, plus some issues with the launch pad equipment, caused the company to shelve the attempt.\n",

The acquirer is the music and technology company Stingray Group, which will pay $150 million at closing and up to $25 million one year later.\nIt financed the deal with a loan under its renewed credit facility, the company said on Wednesday.\nFounded in 2002, TuneIn was an early player in the online music space. Unlike rivals such as Apple Music or Spotify Premium that offer ad-free, subscription-based music on demand, TuneIn focused on streaming traditional radio stations over the internet. This business model also allowed TuneIn to deliver a wide variety of content beyond music, like news, talk, and live sports. The company attempted to monetize this content through a paid subscription that also included audiobooks and ad-free radio channels.\nHowever, the company struggled to compete in the crowded streaming market, particularly as consumer demand for talk radio shifted to podcasts, and people grew comfortable paying for ad-free music subscriptions.\nStingray, a Montreal-based company that owns radio stations and provides music tech and advertising services, acquired TuneIn to expand its reach, particularly through partnerships with device manufacturers, automakers, and content providers. The company noted that TuneIn’s content is available on more than 200 platforms and connected devices, including over 50 in-car audio systems, spanning more than 100 countries.\nThe $175 million purchase price was based on TuneIn’s forecasted sales of $110 million and adjusted EBITDA of US$30 million for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2025. TuneIn has over 75 million monthly active listeners worldwide.\nStingray says the TuneIn brand will remain. Once the deal closes, Stingray expects its revenue to exceed $400 million.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n",

(Users who use an authenticator app are unaffected.)\nX said this was part of an effort to retire the older twitter.com domain, which currently redirects to x.com. That change took effect in May 2024. The problem is that passkeys and security keys are digitally tied to the old twitter.com domain and can’t be transferred to x.com. That means users have to manually un-enroll and re-enroll using the new x.com domain.\nAs part of the switchover, X warned that after November 10, customers would have their accounts locked until they re-enroll or choose another method of two-factor authentication. \nNow that the deadline has passed, plenty of users are reporting that they’ve been locked out of their accounts and can’t re-enroll their passkey or security key, citing error messages or getting caught in an endless loop.\nThis is the latest issue to beset X, now owned by Elon Musk after he bought Twitter, as it was known then, for $44 billion. Since taking charge of the social networking site, the company has experienced massive layoffs and countless controversies.\nX did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk, who now owns X, has been posting as usual, presumably unaffected by the change.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOne of the most effective use cases to have emerged from modern AI models is their ability to understand the human voice better, which has led to more accurate dictation tools. One such Mac tool, Willow, is launching an iOS app to let users type with their voice across all apps.\nSimilar to Wispr Flow, Willow’s keyboard transcribes your voice and also formats the message according to the context. The app, which supports over 100 languages, lets you define your own vocabulary terms or create different writing styles across app categories like work, messaging, email, and others.\nOne key advantage of Willow’s app is that there is a full keyboard available to type, whereas Wispr Flow only offers a numeric keyboard. This helps with quick edits to modify some words or sentences rather than typing them out. Plus, you don’t have to switch to another keyboard when you want to type some words instead of speaking them.\nImage Credits Willow\nWillow was founded by Allan Guo and Lawrence Liu, who attended Stanford and dropped out to build a startup. Gui got into Y Combinator in the summer of 2024 with a different set of co-founders, and their initial idea was in healthcare — specifically to build software to manage assisted living facilities. However, the idea didn’t stick, and for a year, the company tried to build different things.\n“While we were working on healthcare solutions, we noticed that doctors have voice AI scribes that record conversations with patients and create documents for follow-ups. I had a lot of conversations with doctors; they said these notetakers were very useful to them. This nudged us to build a voice AI tool for knowledge workers and other users,” Guo told TechCrunch over a call. \nGuo added that he chose not to build another AI notetaker because he felt that the market was saturated. Instead, the dictation space was more appealing as a lot of communication takes place outside meetings. He said that the company uses a series of models and focuses heavily on tuning its text-to-text pipeline, which is based on Meta’s Llama models, for formatting and personalization\nImage Credits: Willow\nThe startup then moved its YC batch to Spring 2025 to launch the product. The company said that since the launch, it has grown 50% month over month in terms of users. It also has enterprise customers like Uber, Heidi Health, and Zeg using the tool for dictation with features like custom team vocabulary.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWillow has raised $4.5 million from Box Group, Y Combinator, Burst Capital, and angel investors such as HubSpot’s Dharmesh Shah; Gusto’s Tomer London; Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian; ex-Yelp COO Kipp Bodnar; Opendoor CEO Kaz Nejatian; Adam Guild, co-founder and CEO of the restaurant software company Owner; and Instacart co-founder Max Mullen.\nMullen said that he believes that the most amazing user interfaces in the future are going to be voice-led.\n“I was really impressed with Allan’s vision around not just creating a great dictation app but, long term, aiming for creating an interface that can control your computer,” he said. “When I am writing through Willow, I need to make fewer edits than I had to with a computer’s built-in dictation system.”\nMullen pointed out that one of his favorite workflows was that on desktop, you can also use the “Hey Willow” assistant to instruct the app to write things like email replies in your own voice.\nThe startup competes with other players like Wispr Flow, which has raised more than $56 million in funding to date; Monologue, which is part of Every’s subscription bundle; and the YC-backed startups Aqua, Talktastic, Superwhisper, and Betterdication.\nGuo said that in the coming months, it plans to do platform expansion with Windows and Android, along with better personalization to reduce the number of manual edits users have to do post dictation. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhen former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt, someone from the audience asked him if HBO’s hit satire “Silicon Valley” would be revived. Costolo, who was a writer for the show, essentially answered no (at timestamp 38:17).\nWhile the writers talk about that regularly, he said, they don’t pursue it because today’s actual Silicon Valley is so bizarre, it can’t be parodied.  \nThe latest case in point is a new company called Clad Labs that launched out of Y Combinator this week. Clad’s product is so outside-the-box that people thought it was an April Fools’ joke in November. \nBut it’s a real product, founder Richard Wang told TechCrunch. The product is called “Chad: The Brainrot IDE.” It is yet another vibe coding integrated development environment — an IDE is the software developers use to code — but with a twist. While waiting for the AI coding tool to finish its task, the developer can mess around with their favorite brainrot activities within a window of the IDE. \nOr, as the company’s website advertises: “Gamble while you code. Watch TikToks. Swipe on Tinder. Play minigames. This isn’t a joke — it’s Chad IDE, and it’s solving the biggest productivity problem in AI-powered development that nobody’s talking about.” \nThe founders say their IDE increases productivity by helping with “context switching.” Their argument is, by doing your brainrot activities within the IDE itself, as soon as the AI is done with the task, you’ll get right back to work rather than be focused on your phone or browser. \nReaction on X was mixed. While some people thought it was a fake satire, others thought it was a good — or a terrible — idea.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLike it or hate it, everyone had an opinion, even Jordi Hays, co-host of the enthusiastically pro-tech podcast TBPN. Hays penned a post on the product called, “Rage Baiting is for Losers.” In it he said of Chad IDE: “On one hand it’s funny. On the other hand, what are we doing here and why does this belong on the official YC account?” \nHe argued that products like Chad IDE and Cluely have moved rage bait from a marketing gimmick to a “product strategy” and “it really should not be.” He urged YC to start teaching founders that “rage baiting is for losers.” \nThis is particularly interesting advice from someone who, as a founder, had mastered viral marketing without rage. Hays and his wife Sarah founded Party Round, a funding startup that went viral for their friendly marketing gimmicks like launching NFT versions of top “helpful” VCs. (Party Round rebranded to Capital and sold to Rho in 2024.) \nWang tells TechCrunch what the haters don’t get about his brainrot IDE is that it wasn’t intended to be rage bait. The founders hope it becomes a genuinely beloved AI vibe coder for consumer-app type developers. They want to give these folks a consumer app-like experience in an IDE.\nWhile the product is real, it’s not available to the public yet. \n”We’re currently in a closed beta,” Wang said. Right now, Chad is attempting to build a “community” of users who like the idea. Clad Labs hopes to open the product to the public soon, but for now, users must get an invite from someone already in the beta.\nNo doubt there’s a certain type of developer who would love Chad. But whatever the future holds for this product, one thing is true: It is nearly impossible to parody Silicon Valley these days. \n",

The recent update includes a slider that lets users adjust the opacity of the clock displayed on the Lock Screen. This new feature enables users to make the clock nearly fully transparent or give it a more frosted look. There will still be an option to completely turn off Liquid Glass.\nAnother change is the ability to set alarms for reminders. When creating a reminder, choosing a specific time and then enabling the “Urgent” option will trigger an alarm at that time.

If someone speaks to a user in another language, Siri can provide translations through the AirPods. This feature was initially rolled out in the U.S. and select other countries with iOS 26, but it wasn’t accessible in the EU until iOS 26.2, as Apple required additional time to ensure it met the EU’s Digital Markets Act requirements.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdditionally, the Apple News app will feature a new “Following” tab in the bottom navigation bar, which will include favorites, saved stories, and history. Users will also find new buttons that facilitate quick access to topics such as Food, Politics, Puzzles, and Sports.\nApple Podcasts is also gaining new features, including AI-generated chapters for podcast episodes. There will also be a Podcast Mentions function, so if a podcast host references another show during an episode, Apple Podcasts will automatically include a link to that show in the episode description. \nOther features include offline lyric support in Apple Music, enabling listeners to view song lyrics even when not connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular network.

    "body": "\nCrafting a perfect prompt for AI chatbots is often a challenge —  so much so that startups are creating roles for prompt engineers. Consumer-facing AI apps are increasingly adding features like suggestion buttons or autogenerated recommendations to nudge customers to use the chatbot more frequently and show them about what the app can do.\nHero, a productivity startup founded by former Meta employees, announced a new autocompletion SDK today that will fill in prompts for you based on context. The SDK is currently invite-only and will let developers integrate this tech into their apps.\nHere is how it works: When you are booking a flight, you might write “Book a flight” in the prompt. The autocomplete SDK will start populating fields like “to,” “from,” “on date,” “at time,” “airline,” and “returning on.” You can stop at any point and send the query to the chatbot.\nImage Credits:Hero\nThis is also useful when you are using an AI-powered image or a video generator, where autocomplete can help you with different parameters like object, style, location, landscape, and camera angle. Notably, Adobe’s new feature for creating soundtracks with its Firefly app lets users enter keywords in different sections of a prompt, such as mood, style, and purpose, to easily create a tune.\nAdobe’s way to approach easier prompt generation for creating a soundtrack.Image Credits:Adobe\nHero engineer Saharsh Vedi, who worked on this feature, said that usually you need a lot of back-and-forth with an AI app to get the results you want. With this autocomplete feature, you can get there with fewer prompts — or even just one.\n\n\n\nThe startup’s co-founder, Brad Kowalk, told TechCrunch that the company is using a series of models to predict what you might type into a prompt next.\n“With AI autocomplete, we pull forward all the inputs needed to complete an action, finishing it 10 times faster as there are fewer back-and-forths involved. This unlocks a whole new set of use cases ranging from travel to commerce, and ads to customer support,” Kowalk said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe added that because there are fewer messages involved, companies operating at scale can save on server costs.\nKowalk said that he and his co-founder, Seung W. Lee, thought of building the tech based on their experience working on AR features at Meta. On AR glasses, there are constraints on screen size, so the interface for prompts needs to be simple — like adding parameters to a query.\nThe startup, which raised $4 million in seed funding last year, has secured $3 million in additional funding led by Forerunner Ventures. Kowalk said that in the coming months, depending on the app and SDK growth, Hero plans to raise a bigger round.\nHero is testing a version of this technology in its app that helps users find time for a meeting or to catch up with a friend through autocomplete prompts. The feature will be released to users in a couple of months.\nThe company is also in talks with Koah Labs, an ad tech startup, to build AI-powered ads where brands can show up in autocomplete suggestions.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple Watch and iPhone owners in the United States will now be able to carry a copy of their U.S. passport on their device, which they can then use at TSA checkpoints across more than 250 U.S. airports when traveling domestically.\nThe feature, known as Digital ID, was previously announced as part of the iOS 26 release, and adds passports to the list of existing government IDs supported in Apple Wallet. The company has rolled out the feature to a dozen states and Puerto Rico, with more on the way.\nUsing Digital ID in Apple Wallet, users can create and present an ID, even if they don’t have a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or state ID. The ID does not replace a physical passport, and it’s not currently supported for international travel or crossing borders, Apple notes.\nImage Credits:Apple\nUsers can add their passport to Wallet by tapping on the “Add” (+) button in the Wallet app, then selecting “Driver’s License or ID Cards.” From there, select Digital ID and follow the steps to complete the setup process, which includes using the iPhone to scan the photo page of their passport and scanning the chip embedded on the back to ensure the passport’s authenticity. Users will also have to take a selfie for verification and then complete a series of facial and head movements for additional security.\nSupport for IDs in Apple Wallet is the last obstacle standing in the way of making iPhones a replacement for a physical wallet, as it can now hold payment cards, loyalty cards, tickets and passes, and more.\nPresenting Apple’s new Digital ID in person works much like using Apple Pay. You can double-click the side button or Home button to access your Wallet, then select Digital ID. The iPhone or Apple Watch should be held near an identity reader, and users will use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate their information. Users will also be able to see what identity information is being requested before completing the verification process.\nImage Credits:Apple\nThe feature is still in beta, as it hasn’t fully rolled out to all the device readers at the TSA checkpoints at this time. (The TSA website offers a list of which states are currently supporting mobile ID but still advises travelers to carry their physical ID.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nApple says that users will eventually be able to present their Digital ID at businesses and organizations where they need to verify their age, both in-person and online.\nThis could include event venues or bars, where users need to present their ID at the door to verify if they’re of drinking age. Online, websites that restrict content to adults could also leverage Apple’s APIs to verify users’ ages. For instance, if a user wanted to order alcohol for delivery through a service like Uber Eats, they could verify their ID during the ordering process.\nIn both cases, users would be able to confirm that their age is over 21 without having to also share personal information like their name, address, or birthday.\nApple said it can’t see when or where a user presents their ID or what data was shared. Plus, users don’t have to unlock their phone or hand it over to present their ID, as it works just like Apple Pay. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSearch and rescue missions often happen in areas that are difficult for humans to navigate due to extreme weather, rough terrain, or dangerous conditions like smoke or dust.\nA researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) wants to send robots inspired by bats on these missions instead of humans.\nNitin J. Sanket, a professor at WPI, has developed small flying robots with his team that fit in the palm of a hand and use ultrasound — just like bats. These robots use AI-powered software to filter out noise from the ultrasound signals the devices collect, allowing them to spot obstacles within a two-meter radius.\n“Search and rescue is done on foot,” Sanket told TechCrunch. “There are a lot of people who go on foot with flashlights in really harsh conditions and put their lives at danger to save others. We thought drones are the answer because they can cover a lot of ground really fast. They can be agile and quick.”\nNitin Sanket.Image Credits:Nitin Sanket / WPI\nSanket has long been fascinated by aerial robots and drones and how the tech can be retrofitted for real-world situations. During his PhD program, his adviser challenged him to create the smallest robot possible, which sparked his research into taking cues from biology to build smaller machines.\n“We had to reimagine what a drone would be at that point, which is go back to biology, because biology does this way better than we can today,” Sanket said. “How do insects or birds do it with super limited compute and not-so-good sensing apparatus? Their eyes are not that great, their brains are really small, but they’re still able to do these amazing feats of flight. So we started looking at that, and that’s what gave rise to my PhD thesis.”\nSanket built a prototype of a robotic beehive made up of small drones that could pollinate flowers. Despite his efforts, he realized that this application was probably a moonshot and started thinking of areas where biology-based robots could make a difference sooner, which led him to his current project.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the search and rescue robots, the main challenge was building something with the necessary sensors and flying technology without making the robot too large, expensive, or energy intensive.\nSanket said they turned to the ultrasound sensors used in automatic faucets because they require very little power. While that approach worked, the propellers they built on the robots created too much noise, which overloaded the sensor’s ability to spot obstacles.\nTo fix this problem, they turned back to bats.\n“Bats have these special tissues in their nose, ears, and mouth which adaptively change in thickness and density to modulate the way they hear and chirp sound,” Sanket said. “We were like, ‘Okay, that’s super cool.’ Can we do something like that? We designed a 3D-printed structure to place in front of the robot, which essentially does the same [functionally, as] what a bat does, which is change the shape of the sound itself.”\nNow that they’ve been able to get the robots to work, they are working to tackle their next challenge: improving their speed.\n“We, as human beings, like to try to mimic a lot of things the human brain does,” Sanket said. “We tend to forget how remarkable other animals are, which are much smaller than us. Especially insects and birds, which are much tinier, can actually do remarkable feats of navigation, which I think we don’t really see often. I think we should think more as scientists rather than just pure engineers.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

The company described the sites as “custom built for Anthropic with a focus on maximizing efficiency for our workloads.”\n“We’re getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren’t possible before,” Anthropic’s CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei (pictured above) said in a statement. “Realizing that potential requires infrastructure that can support continued development at the frontier.”\nBecause of the intense compute demands of Anthropic’s Claude family of models, the company is already engaged in significant cloud partnerships with both Google and Amazon (which is also an investor). But this is the company’s first major effort to build custom infrastructure. The $50 billion outlay, while large, is in line with the company’s internal revenue projections, which reportedly see Anthropic reaching $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in positive cash flow by 2028.\nWhile $50 billion represents a massive commitment in both cash and compute power, it is nonetheless dwarfed by similar projects from Anthropic’s competitors. Meta has committed to building $600 billion worth of data centers over the next three years, while the Stargate partnership between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle has already planned $500 billion in infrastructure spending. The spending has fueled concerns about an AI bubble due to flagging demand or even misallocated spending.\nThe project marks a major success for Fluidstack, a relatively young neocloud company that has become a vendor of choice in the AI building boom.

    "body": "\nSixteen years ago, engineers working on the Google self-driving project conducted their first autonomous vehicle tests on the freeway that connects Silicon Valley to San Francisco. \nThe company would eventually become Waymo, autonomous vehicle testing would expand — fanning out to other cities. Eventually, the company launched commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Other cities soon followed. \nBut freeways, despite some of that early testing, would remain out of reach. Until today. \nWaymo said Wednesday it will begin offering robotaxi rides that use freeways across San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, a critical expansion for the company that it says will reduce ride times by up to 50%. That stat could help attract a whole new group of users who need to travel between the many towns and suburbs within the greater San Francisco Bay Area or quicken commutes across the sprawling Los Angeles and Phoenix metro areas. \nUsing freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in. \nThe service won’t be offered to all Waymo riders at first, the company said. Waymo riders who want to experience freeway rides can note their preference in the Waymo app. Once the rider hails a ride, they may be matched with a freeway trip, according to the company.\nThe company’s robotaxi routes will now stretch to San Jose, an expansion that will create a unified 260-mile service area across the Peninsula, according to Waymo. The company said it will also begin curbside drop off and pick up service at the San Jose Mineta International Airport. It already offers curbside service to the Sky Harbor Phoenix International Airport.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Waymo\n“Freeway driving is one of those things that’s very easy to learn, but very hard to master when we’re talking about full autonomy without a human driver as a backup, and at scale,” Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov said in a media briefing with reporters. “It took time to do it properly, with a strong focus on system safety and reliability.”\nWaymo robotaxis have been spotted on freeways for months. TechCrunch took a test ride last year in the Phoenix area that included freeways. The company has provided trips to employees for more than a year. It also expanded testing to include closed course and simulation\nWhile many assume freeway driving is easier, it comes with its own set of challenges, principal software engineer Pierre Kreitmann said in a recent briefing. He noted that critical events happen less often on freeways, which means there are fewer opportunities to expose Waymo’s self-driving system to rare scenarios and prove how the system performs when it really matters. The company chose to augment its public road driving with a combination of closed course and simulation testing.\nThis expanded testing and validation of the software was done to ensure the vehicles transition smoothly and safely between freeways and surface streets, and recognize and adapt to the unique context of the road around them, Kreitman said. \nWaymo has also expanded its operational protocols, including how it coordinates with safety officials like California Highway Patrol, now that its robotaxis are on freeways. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nA group of Democratic lawmakers have sent letters to several state governors, including in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Wisconsin, warning that their states are inadvertently sharing drivers’ data with federal immigration authorities.\nThe letter, which was first reported by Reuters, told governors that their states are providing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies “with frictionless, self-service access to the personal data of all of your residents,” through a nonprofit managed by state police agencies called the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, or Nlets.\nNlets facilitates the sharing of state residents’ personal data, in this case driver license data, between state, local, and federal police agencies. \nThe lawmakers asked the group of governors to stop the practice and block access to ICE and “other federal agencies that are now acting as Trump’s shock troops.” \nICE and Nlets did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. \nFor two decades, most states have made their residents’ data, such as drivers’ licenses and other information from each state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database, available for search and retrieval to approximately 18,000 federal and local law enforcement agencies across the U.S. and Canada. This practice allows those agencies to directly access residents’ data without the knowledge or involvement of any state employee, according to the letter.\nThe letter said that it’s possible that ICE is using drivers’ license photos for their facial recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which agents are using to identify people on the street and relies on 200 million photos.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to the letter, Nlets facilitated “over 290 million queries for DMV data,” with more than 290,000 queries from ICE and some 600,000 from Homeland Security Investigations during the year before October 1, 2025. \n“It is now abundantly clear that a major reason that so few states have locked down the data they share through Nlets is because of an information gap,” reads the letter. “Because of the technical complexity of Nlets’ system, few state government officials understand how their state is sharing their residents’ data with federal and out-of-state agencies,” read the letter. \nThe letter said blocking the agencies’ “unfettered access” would not prevent federal agencies obtaining information from states for solving serious crimes, but taking action would “increase accountability and reduce abuse” by allowing state employees to review data requests first.\nThe lawmakers noted that some states, including Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Washington recently restricted what kind of data ICE can access via Nlets, and reminded the governors that it is up to them to stop the practice at any time.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

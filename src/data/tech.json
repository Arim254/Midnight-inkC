As the court date gets closer, Meta’s lawyers are working hard to limit what can be used against the company in court. \nAccording to public records reviewed by Wired, the company wants to block research about social media’s impact on youth mental health, stories about teen suicides linked to social media, any mention of Meta’s finances, the company’s past privacy violations, and even things about CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s college years.\nThese efforts are part of a lawsuit filed by New Mexico attorney general Raúl Torrez in late 2023. The state accuses Meta of failing to protect minors from online predators, trafficking, and sexual abuse on its platforms. The case claims Meta allegedly allowed explicit material to reach minors and didn’t put adequate child safety measures in place. \nNotably, this lawsuit is considered the first trial of its kind at the state level, scheduled to begin on February 2.\nIt’s fairly standard that Meta would try to keep the case as narrow as possible. However, two legal experts who talked to Wired believe the company’s attempt to keep out so much information is unusually broad, including its requests not to mention its AI chatbots.\nAdditionally, Meta requested that the court block any mention of a public health warning issued by former U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy regarding social media’s effect on youth mental health. The company also doesn’t want surveys (including its own) about the amount of inappropriate content on its platforms. It argues that all this information is irrelevant or could unfairly sway the jury.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n\n",

Congrats to the Tesla AI team!” \nHe then made a recruitment pitch for engineers interested in “solving real-world AI,” which he says will “likely lead to AGI” to join the Tesla AI team. \nThe automaker launched its robotaxis in the Texas city last June in a limited deployment with a safety operator in the front passenger seat. Tesla initially offered those first rides to influencers and handpicked customers. In December, Tesla began testing its robotaxis in Austin without a safety driver in the front seat — a precaution in case the vehicle needs a human to take over.\nNot all of Tesla’s fleet in Austin will be fully driverless. Per Tesla’s AI lead Ashok Elluswamy, the company will be “starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.”\nTesla is charging for the rides, according to one rider who posted on X. There also appears to be a chase car following the driverless vehicles. \nSome of Tesla’s rivals, like Zoox and Waymo, did not immediately charge for driverless rides upon initial deployment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTechCrunch has attempted to reach out to Tesla for clarification. \nThe article has been updated to reflect new information, including that Tesla is charging for the rides. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Transportation\n\n",

But as AI coding tools have gotten better, the test has had to change a lot to keep candidates from simply filling in all the answers with Claude.\nTeam lead Tristan Hume described the history of the challenge in a blog post on Wednesday. “Each new Claude model has forced us to redesign the test,” Hume writes. “When given the same time limit, Claude Opus 4 outperformed most human applicants. That still allowed us to distinguish the strongest candidates — but then, Claude Opus 4.5 matched even those.”\nCandidates are allowed to use AI tools on the test, but the situation still presents a serious candidate-assessment problem. If human beings can no longer improve on the model’s output, then the test is only measuring the different models used and it’s no longer useful for finding top performers. \n“Under the constraints of the take-home test, we no longer had a way to distinguish between the output of our top candidates and our most capable model,” Hume writes.\nThe issue of AI use on tests is already wreaking havoc at schools and universities around the world, so it’s ironic that AI labs are having to deal with it too. But Anthropic is also uniquely well-equipped to deal with the problem. In the end, Hume designed a new test that had less to do with optimizing hardware, making it sufficiently novel to stump contemporary AI tools. \nBut as part of the post, he also shared the original test to see if anyone reading could come up with a better solution.\n“If you can best Opus 4.5,” the post reads, “we’d love to hear from you.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated Anthropic’s policy towards the use of AI tools on the take-home test.

    "body": "\nIt’s going to be more difficult to fake or manipulate Ring camera video footage going forward. On Thursday, the Amazon-owned device maker introduced Ring Verify, a new video authenticity feature that will allow anyone to determine whether a video has been altered in any way.\nThe company says this could be useful when you come across shared videos, like those sent to you by a neighbor or those purporting to show some sort of incident.\nWhile you may not be able to instantly identify whether some TikTok video was AI-generated — like bunnies jumping on a trampoline, for instance — you will be alerted to any changes to a Ring video that someone has shared with you directly.\nImage Credits:Ring\n“Think of it like the tamper-evident seal on a medicine bottle — if anyone changes the video in any way, even something small like trimming a few seconds or adjusting the brightness, the seal breaks,” Ring explained in its announcement.\nThe verification feature will be automatically enabled on every video recorded with a Ring device from December 2025 onward, the company notes. Any changes or edits, including cropping and filters, will break that verification seal. Ring says this includes videos uploaded to sharing sites that compress footage.\nFailing verification doesn’t necessarily mean the video is fake. It’s just a signal that it has been altered. Maybe someone boosted the brightness for visibility, or it could mean the video was recorded before December 2025.\nImage Credits:Ring\nIn the case of a failed verification, recipients can request a copy of the unedited video. Ring suggests this could be useful for purposes like insurance claims.\nThe verification feature will be present on all videos downloaded or shared from Ring’s cloud, regardless of the specific device that captured the footage. But the company notes that content verification will not be compatible with videos recorded using end-to-end encryption — those will always show as “not verified,” it said.\nTo verify footage, Ring will be able to visit the website Ring.com/verify and submit their video link and get instant results.\nTechCrunch noticed the site isn’t yet up and running, which could suggest the announcement was shared prematurely. We also didn’t see the announcement on the Ring blog’s homepage at the time of publication but were able to preview the news via the blog post’s direct URL. We’ve asked the company for clarification.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The company announced on Thursday that the beta app will allow subscribers to watch video posts and livestreams on TV created by authors on its platform.\nThe TV app features a TikTok-like “For You” row that will highlight videos from these creators, along with recommended videos.\nFree and paid subscribers can now start using the TV app, with access based on their subscription tier. Substack plans to add paid content previews for free subscribers in the future. The platform also plans to add audio posts and read-alouds, enhanced search and discovery features, in-app upgrades to paid subscriptions, and dedicated sections for each publication where subscribers can explore all videos from a specific creator.\nThe move comes as Substack has been investing more heavily in video and livestreaming, as it looks to compete with platforms like YouTube and Patreon for both creators and viewers.\nSubstack began its push into video with the launch of video posts back in 2022. It then started allowing creators to monetize videos early last year. Around the same time, it rolled out livestreaming capabilities to all publishers. The company has also embraced short-form video, launching a TikTok-like video feed in its app in March 2025.\n“Substack is the home for the best longform—work creators put real care into and subscribers choose to spend time with,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Now these thought-provoking videos and livestreams have a natural home on the TV, where subscribers can settle in for the extended viewing that great video deserves.”\nWhile Substack sees the launch as the next step in its video ambitions, comments on its announcement tell another story. The top comment on the company’s blog post reads: “Please don’t do this. This is not YouTube. Elevate the written word.” Another popular comment reads: “You guys have gone from saying Substack is the best home for longform writing/writers to ‘Substack is the home for the best longform—work…’. I get trying to evolve, but this just seems like another venture capital-fueled idea.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOther comments reflect a similar sentiment, questioning why the platform appears to be shifting its focus from writing to video. \nIt’s worth noting that Substack isn’t the only platform pushing into the living room, as Instagram recently launched IG for TV, a new experience that lets users watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTwo days after settling a lawsuit accusing Snapchat of causing social media addiction and mental health issues, Snap announced that it’s introducing new parental controls. Parents and guardians can now use Snapchat’s “Family Center” tool to see how much time their teen is spending on the platform, along with additional details about the new friends they add.\nWith these new features, Snap is likely looking to appease regulators and parents over concerns about safety and screen time on its platform.\nParents can now see the average amount of time their teen spent on Snapchat each day over the previous week. They can see how this time breaks down across different parts of the app, including chatting, snapping, creating with the camera, using Snap Map, or watching content on Spotlight and Stories.\nWhile Family Center already allowed parents to see a full list of their teen’s friends on Snapchat, they can now see how their teen likely knows a new user that they’ve added as a friend. For example, parents will be able to see whether they have mutual friends, are saved as a contact, or belong to shared communities.\nImage Credits:Snapchat\n“These trust signals make it easier for parents to understand new connections and have greater confidence that their teen is chatting with someone they know in real life,” Snap wrote in a blog post. “If a parent or guardian sees a new friend they aren’t familiar with, they have the information they need to start a productive conversation.”\nSnap launched Family Center in 2022 — a suite of parental monitoring tools — in response to regulatory pressure over social media companies’ failure to protect minors on their apps. Since then, Snap has built out the tool with additional features, including the ability to see who teens have recently interacted with, set time restrictions, and block access to the app’s My AI chatbot.\nThe new features come as Snap earlier this week settled a lawsuit filed by a 19-year-old identified in court documents as K.G.M., who accused the company and other social media giants of designing algorithms and features that fueled addiction and harmed users’ mental health.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe lawsuit also names other platforms, including Meta, YouTube, and TikTok, but no settlements have been reached with these companies. The remaining case against Meta, TikTok, and YouTube is set to proceed with jury selection beginning next.\nSnap is still a defendant in other social media addiction cases. According to documents disclosed in the ongoing cases, Snap employees raised concerns about risks to teens’ mental health as far back as nine years ago. The company has said the examples were “cherry-picked” and taken out of context. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said he’s “surprised” that OpenAI has already moved to introduce ads within its AI chatbot. In an interview with Axios at Davos, the AI leader was responding to a question about using ads to monetize AI services, saying the idea is something that the team at Google was thinking through “very carefully.”\nHassabis also said that his team wasn’t feeling pressure from the tech giant to make “a knee-jerk” decision around advertising, despite how key ads are to Google’s core business.\nThe DeepMind co-founder’s remarks followed Friday’s news that OpenAI will begin testing ads as a way to generate additional revenue from the portion of the AI chatbot’s 800 million weekly active users who don’t have a paid subscription. \nWhile OpenAI may have been forced to consider ads, considering its growing infrastructure and energy costs, its decision could change how users view the service.\n“I’m a little bit surprised they’ve moved so early into that,” Hassabis said, referring to OpenAI’s adoption of ads. “I mean, look, ads, there’s nothing wrong with ads…they funded much of the consumer internet. And if done well, they can be useful,” he clarified.\n“But in the realm of assistants, and if you think of the chatbot as an assistant that’s meant to be helpful — and ideally, in my mind, as they become more powerful, the kind of technology that works for you as the individual…there is a question about how ads fit into that model?… You want to have trust in your assistant, so how does that work?” he questioned.\nReiterating some early comments from another Davos interview, Hassabis also said that Google didn’t have “any current plans” to do ads in its AI chatbot. Instead, the company would monitor the situation to see how users respond.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOf course, we’ve already seen consumer backlash to the idea of ads infiltrating people’s conversations with AI assistants. When OpenAI last month began exploring a feature that suggested apps to try during users’ chats, for instance, people reacted negatively, saying these suggestions felt like intrusive ads. Shortly after, OpenAI turned off the app suggestions, which it claimed were not actually ads as they had “no financial component.”\nBut whether or not money had exchanged hands was not what made users angry. Rather, it was how the app suggestions degraded the quality of the experience.\nThat’s something that also concerns Hassabis, his remarks suggested. \nHe explained that using a chatbot is a much different experience than using Google Search. With Search, Google already understands a user’s intent, so it can show potentially useful ads. Chatbots, on the other hand, are meant to become helpful digital assistants that know about you and can help you with many aspects of your life, he said. \n“I think that’s very different from the search use case. So I think there, that has to be thought through very carefully,” he added. \nMaking Gemini more useful to each user is also the focus of newly launched personalization features announced today for Google’s AI Mode. Now, users can opt into having Gemini’s AI tap into their Gmail and Photos for tailored responses in Search’s AI Mode, similar to how Gemini’s app just added a Personal Intelligence feature that can reference users’ Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.\nWhile personalized ad targeting is a business that sustains the free web, pushing an ad on the user while they’re in a conversation with an AI assistant can feel off-putting. It’s why customers rejected Amazon’s earlier attempts to infuse ads into its Alexa experience — they wanted an assistant, not a personal shopper hawking things for them to buy. \nHassabis said he wasn’t feeling top-down pressure to force ads into the AI product, either, though he admitted there may be a way to do them right later on. \n“We don’t feel any immediate pressure to make knee-jerk decisions like that — I think that’s been the history of what we’ve done at GoogleMind — is be very scientific, and rigorous, and thoughtful about each step that we take — be that the technology itself or the product,” he noted.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe top talent behind yet another promising AI startup has been gobbled up by an incumbent. As part of a new licensing agreement, Google DeepMind is bringing on the CEO and several of the top engineers at voice AI startup Hume AI, reports Wired.\nWhat’s left of Hume AI will continue to supply its technology to other AI firms. No financial details of the deal were shared. \nTechCrunch has reached out to Google and Hume AI to confirm the news.\nCEO Alan Cowen and about seven other engineers will work with DeepMind to improve Gemini’s voice features, according to Wired. \nThe Hume acqui-hire is the latest example of a leading AI firm scooping top talent off the market and skirting regulatory scrutiny by acquiring a startup’s team rather than the company outright. Last year, Google acquired viral AI coding startup Windsurf’s CEO and other top researchers, and OpenAI has acquired several startup teams in recent months, including Convogo and Roi. The Federal Trade Commission recently said that it would take a closer look at such deals. \nThe deal also shows that voice is becoming the next frontier in AI.\nHume AI’s secret sauce is its model’s ability to understand a user’s emotions and mood based on their voice. In 2024, the startup launched its Empathetic Voice Interface, a conversational AI with emotional intelligence. Hume AI has raised close to $80 million to date according to PitchBook, and expects to bring in $100 million in revenue this year, per Wired. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut Hume AI isn’t the only company working on voice-focused models. Google has been steadily improving its Gemini Live feature, which allows a user to have conversations with the chatbot. Last month, Google released a new native audio model for the Live API that improved the model’s ability to “handle complex workflows,” per the Gemini API release notes. \nOthers in the industry are investing big into voice capabilities as well. OpenAI is reportedly preparing to overhaul its audio models in preparation for its audio-first personal device, created with Jonny Ive’s io, to launch this year. Recent leaks suggest the device could be a form of earbuds.\nLast year, Meta also accelerated its AI audio push by acquiring startup Play AI. The Facebook-maker’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are increasingly relying on voice and audio capabilities for tasks like helping you hear conversations in noisy rooms and enabling hands-free control for calls, texts, music, and photos. \n“Voice is the only acceptable input mode for wearables,” investor Vanessa Larco told TechCrunch. “This acquisition will only accelerate the need for voice apps.”\nDemand continues to increase for voice capabilities. Earlier this month, ElevenLabs, the AI voice generation startup, said it crossed $330 million in annual recurring revenue. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

The company announced that it’s now focusing its AI education efforts on standardized testing with free SAT practice exams powered by Gemini. \nStudents can prompt Gemini by typing “I want to take a practice SAT test,” and the AI will provide them with a free practice exam. Gemini then analyzes the results, highlighting strengths and identifying areas that need further review. It also offers detailed explanations for any incorrect answers. \nImage Credits:Google\nThe company said it partnered with education companies like the Princeton Review to ensure the content is vetted and that students are working with questions that closely mirror what they will encounter on the actual SAT.\nThis recent move by Google is viewed as a game-changer for students who can’t readily access personalized SAT tutoring. By making SAT prep free, Google is trying to open the door for more students to compete on equal footing. However, it also sparks a broader conversation about the role of AI in education and just how much we want AI to shape how students learn.\nThe adoption of AI in education is not without controversy. Many teachers worry that students might end up leaning too heavily on tools like Gemini and ChatGPT to get their work done. If students let AI do all the thinking, it could chip away at their problem-solving skills. There are even studies out there that back this up, suggesting that relying too much on AI can actually weaken students’ ability to think critically and tackle challenges on their own.\nLet’s also not forget about human SAT tutors. Free AI-powered exam prep poses a significant threat to the traditional tutoring industry, which has long thrived on providing personalized coaching to college-bound students. With Google offering a free alternative, the job security of private SAT tutors may be at risk.\nThis news follows Google’s recent launch of a Gemini-powered feature that lets teachers create podcast-style audio lessons, which could help catch the attention of Gen Z students. Other available Gemini tools include features that help teachers brainstorm ideas, build lesson plans, and tailor learning materials for their classes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\nWaymo robotaxis can now be hailed by the public in Miami. \nThe company said Thursday it will initially open the service, on a rolling basis, to the nearly 10,000 local residents on its waitlist. Once accepted, riders will be able to hail a robotaxi within a 60-square-mile service area in Miami that covers neighborhoods such as the Design District, Wynwood, Brickell, and Coral Gables. \nWaymo said it plans to eventually expand to Miami International Airport, but didn’t provide a timeline beyond that it was coming “soon.”\nWaymo has had a presence in Miami for months in the lead-up to the commercial launch. After mapping and then testing its autonomous vehicles on Miami’s public roads, the company removed safety operators from the fleet in November. The driverless service was initially open to employees.\nImage Credits:Waymo\nThis phased approach is part of Waymo’s launch playbook, and one that is being implemented far more often than even a year ago. Waymo first opened its robotaxis to the general public in Phoenix in 2020. It expanded to San Francisco and Los Angeles and eventually opened it to all riders in 2024. As the company continued to expand in those metro areas — pushing into the larger Bay Area and into Silicon Valley, for example — it also opened in new markets. \nWaymo opened a robotaxi service in spring 2025 in partnership with Uber in Atlanta and Austin, and expanded its service area in existing markets to include freeways. \nWaymo has laid out an aggressive plan to bring its robotaxi service to nearly a dozen more cities over the next year. Those plans include Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, London, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The company has already started testing in some of those cities using a mix of its all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles and newer Zeekr RT vans that have been rebranded “Ojai.”\nWaymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last October that “by the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week.” \nThe expansion hasn’t been without problems. Residents in cities like San Francisco have captured video of Waymo vehicles creating traffic jams, notably during a widespread power outage in December. \nIt has also gotten the attention of federal safety regulators.  \nThe National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened an initial investigation into the company last October over how its robotaxis operated around a stopped school bus in Atlanta. School district officials in Austin have shared video and complaints around the same issue of Waymo moving past school buses even when the lights are on and the stop sign is deployed.\nThe company has issued a voluntary software recall to fix that issue. However, new videos, which show Waymos illegally passing school buses, suggest the problem has not been resolved.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAI Mode, Google’s conversational Search feature for complex questions, is getting more personalized. The tech giant announced on Thursday that it’s bringing “Personal Intelligence” to AI Mode, enabling it to tap into your Gmail and Google Photos to provide more individualized responses.\nThe company debuted Personal Intelligence last week in the Gemini app to allow the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.\nThe opt-in feature is now starting to roll out to AI Mode to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in English in the U.S. \nBy bringing Personal Intelligence to Gemini and AI Mode, Google is leveraging the wealth of user data already within its ecosystem. Since users already rely on services like Gmail and Photos, Google can deliver more personalized experiences that rivals can’t easily match. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and emails, so you can turn Personal Intelligence on or off at any time.\n“With Personal Intelligence, recommendations don’t just match your interests — they fit seamlessly into your life,” Robby Stein, VP of Product, Google Search, explained in a blog post. “You don’t have to constantly explain your preferences or existing plans, it selects recommendations just for you, right from the start.”\nImage Credits:Google\nSay you’re planning a vacation and searching for things to do and places to eat that everyone in your family will enjoy. With Personal Intelligence, AI Mode can draw on your hotel booking in Gmail and past travel memories in Google Photos to suggest a tailored itinerary with something for everyone. For example, you might see recommendations like an old-timey ice cream parlor based on the many ice cream selfies stored in Google Photos.\nGoogle notes that AI Mode won’t just give you a generic list of restaurants and activities; it instead provides a personalized starting point for planning.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Personal Intelligence can also be particularly helpful for shopping, because AI Mode considers the types of items you buy and where you shop,” Stein wrote. “If you need a new coat for your upcoming trip, AI Mode could automatically take into account the brands you prefer, as well as your flight confirmation in Gmail to identify the destination and timing (Chicago in March). You’ll get suggestions for windproof, versatile coats that fit the weather and your preferred look. It’s like a personal shopper who already knows your itinerary and the vibe you’re going for.”\nGoogle says other questions you could ask are: “Make a scavenger hunt for [partner’s name] to celebrate our anniversary. For each location, include a hint about us,” or “I’m decorating [child’s name ]’s bedroom, give me ideas for a theme and suggestions for decor.”\nThe company notes that AI Mode doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts and the model’s responses. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nClothing and fitness data company Under Armour said it is investigating claims of a data breach after a cybercriminal posted millions of customer records to a hacker forum.\nThe seller told TechCrunch that the data was taken in a November data breach, which the Everest ransomware gang claimed responsibility for in a post on its dark web leak site at the time. \nNews of the data theft became more widely known this week after breach notification site Have I Been Pwned obtained a copy of the stolen data, and notified 72 million individuals by email that their information had been compromised.\nHave I Been Pwned said the stolen Under Armour dataset included names, email addresses, genders, dates of birth, and customers’ approximate location based on postcode or ZIP code. The data also included information relating to purchases.\nThe seller provided TechCrunch with a sample of the stolen data, which appears to contain millions of records of Under Armour customer purchases and matched the types of data that Have I Been Pwned had reported. The stolen data contains reams of email addresses belonging to Under Armour employees.\nWhen reached for comment, Under Armour spokesperson Matt Dornic told TechCrunch that the company is “aware of claims that an unauthorized third party obtained certain data.”\n“Our investigation of this issue, with the assistance of external cybersecurity experts, is ongoing. Importantly, at this time, there’s no evidence to suggest this issue affected UA.com or systems used to process payments or store customer passwords,” the spokesperson added.\n“What we know at this time is the number of affected customers with any sort of information that could be considered sensitive is a very small percentage,” said Dornic. \nThe spokesperson did not immediately respond to a follow-up email asking what types of customers’ information Under Armour considers “sensitive” information, nor did he provide an accurate figure of how many customers are affected by the breach.\n“Any implication that sensitive personal information of tens of millions of customers has been compromised is unfounded,” the spokesperson said.\nUnder Armour did not say if it planned to notify customers whose information was compromised. It did not say if it had received any correspondence from the hackers, such as a demand for ransom.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify is rolling out Prompted Playlists, a new AI playlist creation tool, to Premium subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. The feature, which was originally tested in New Zealand, allows users to make a playlist by describing what they want to hear, in their own words.\nPrompted Playlists builds on an earlier AI playlist product, launched in 2024, which allowed for simpler prompts like “get focused at work with instrumental electronica,” or “get pumped up with fun, upbeat, and positive songs.”\nInstead, the new Prompted Playlists feature lets users explain in more detail, and in a conversational mode, what they want to hear.\nIn a demo to press, for example, Spotify showed off a playlist that was built on a long prompt, which read “Find me one artist I haven’t listened to yet, but would probably love, or an artist I’ve only heard one or two songs from, and introduce me to them. Build a playlist of songs that’ll give me an overview of their catalog so it feels like I’m getting to know them. Put the songs you think I’ll like the most in the top five spots.” \nThe idea behind the new feature, explains J.J. Italiano, head of Global Music Curation and Discovery at Spotify, is to make it possible for anyone to build a playlist, even if they don’t know much about music curation or the correct words to use.\nImage Credits:Spotify\n“For most people,  isn’t a part of their job. You don’t always have the time or the energy to keep building the perfect playlist every time your mood changes, and that’s where prompted playlists will come in,” said Italiano, whose team makes popular Spotify playlists like Today’s Top Hits, New Music Friday, and Rap Caviar, among others. “This gives listeners access to that creative process without needing to know genres, or years, or industry language. You don’t need the right words. You just need your words.”\n“If you can describe a feeling, you can make a playlist,” he added.\nThe AI behind the feature analyzes the world of music in real time, including “trends, charts, culture, and history,” Spotify says, as well as the user’s entire listening history since joining the service.\nWhile the playlists are personalized to their creator by default, users can also use the tool to help break out of their usual listening habits and get different recommendations. That is, they can specifically tell the AI not to use their own listening history as a reference point, or they can direct it to introduce them to songs they’ve never heard before, as in the example above.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nThe prompts don’t have to include any musical terminology, either. For instance, users could ask for a playlist inspired by the weather or a favorite TV show.\nBecause the prompts are shareable, the feature could also lead to a new type of creator — one who makes AI prompts that others will want to try. While the prompt itself would be the same, each user’s resulting playlist would differ, as it’s personalized to their own tastes and listening history. They could then modify that playlist further, if they chose. \nImage Credits:Spotify\nSpotify says Prompted Playlists are the “next evolution” of its earlier AI playlist feature. The new version is more tuned into real-time music trends and culture, understands the full arc of a user’s listening behavior — not just what they’ve listened to recently — and offers deeper control. However, the older AI playlist feature will not be shut down. Instead, the two products will live side-by-side, which could lead to consumer confusion, given the similarities.\nThe feature will have some usage limits in place because it’s still in beta, and those could change over time. It’s also only available in the English language for the time being.\nThe company couldn’t say when Prompted Playlists would reach global subscribers, noting that it first wants to learn from these initial markets to inform future launches.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Blue Origin\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6:49 AM PST · January 22, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nBlue Origin is targeting late February for the third launch of its mega-rocket, New Glenn. But it won’t be heading to the moon, as the company had previously suggested. The rocket will instead carry a satellite to low-Earth orbit for AST SpaceMobile, marking the second time that Jeff Bezos’ space company has flown a commercial payload with New Glenn.\nThe company didn’t immediately explain why it chose to launch the AST SpaceMobile satellite instead of its own robotic lunar lander. The lander, known as Blue Moon Mark 1 (MK1), is currently being shipped to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Texas for vacuum chamber testing. A launch date for that mission has not been set.\nStill, this will be the third New Glenn launch in just over a year, after the rocket spent a decade in development. \nThe launch will come at a busy month for spaceflight: NASA may launch its Artemis II mission, in which four astronauts will orbit the moon, as early as February 6; SpaceX is expected to start testing the third version of its Starship rocket; and NASA and SpaceX will launch the Crew-12 mission, which will help bring the International Space Station back up to full staff after the Crew-11 team was medically evacuated earlier this month.\nFor this launch, Blue Origin will reuse the booster stage from New Glenn’s second mission, which happened last November. The company recovered that booster by landing it on a drone ship in the ocean, similar to what SpaceX has been doing with its Falcon 9 boosters for years.\nNew Glenn is Blue Origin’s first vehicle meant to regularly deliver payloads to Earth orbit and beyond, and it builds on the suborbital rocket program called New Shepard that has been in operation for more than a decade. The company has signed a deal with AST SpaceMobile to send multiple satellites to orbit to help that company build out its space-based cellular broadband network.\nBut New Glenn is just one piece of the company’s grander ambitions. In November, the company revealed a super-heavy variant of New Glenn that will be taller than a Saturn V rocket, on par with SpaceX’s Starship. And on Wednesday, the company announced a satellite internet constellation called TeraWave that it plans to start deploying in late 2027.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company also hopes to use its Blue Moon landers on missions to the moon and Mars, and has been developing another spacecraft called Blue Ring that can host and deploy payloads for other space companies.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nJenny Liu, former CEO of exclusive, celebrity-favorite gym Dogpound, said there were two reasons she wanted to start her own venture fund. \nFor one, she was surrounded by wellness founders at her local gym who loved testing new products and building community. Second, Liu also realized that many of these founders, especially women and minorities, were struggling to fund their ideas due to limited access to founder networks. \nTo bridge this gap, she launched Crush It Ventures, a wellness-focused early-stage fund. The firm hopes to back companies building across the wellness sector, including in mental health, fitness and sport, beauty, and hospitality. On Thursday, it announced the final close of a $5 million Fund I. \nThe wellness industry often overlaps with the health sector (like sleep and body health), making it quite hard to estimate how big it truly is. Nonetheless, wellness trends have been booming in the past few years. Gyms have become a Gen Z obsession, and so have run clubs.\nA McKinsey study from last year found that the U.S. alone spends more than $500 billion a year on wellness. Young people in particular have become big spenders as they continue to openly talk about mental health and burnout. The McKinsey report said that though Gen Z makes up 36% of the adult U.S. population, they are responsible for over 41% of wellness spending. This is compared to those 58 and older, who make up around 35% of the U.S. population, yet account for 28% of wellness spending.\nLiu believes this area has become so popular because people are realizing that health is more than just physical fitness — it also involves mental, emotional, and social well-being. “As we automate more with technology in our daily lives, we’re valuing experiences and products that foster real connection and long-term well-being,” she said. “It’s also a reflection of shifting values: younger generations want purpose-driven brands and are craving real community.” \nLiu said she started raising the fund in 2024. Though the environment was “cautious,” she said, there was a growing interest in wellness, “especially from LPs looking for more diverse mission-driven funds.” The environment for new funds is still tough (especially for a woman solo GP) as most of the capital continues to flow to the top firms.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLiu declined to share the name of the LPs in the fund but said she was able to break through as a new fund manager by leaning into her network. She has a background in banking before angel investing in the gym, later joining as CFO. During her decade there, she was CEO for two years.\nAt Dogpound, she worked with founders and celebrities around the world. “I learned that brand building is not just about marketing a product or service, but about creating a space for shared experiences, joy, and genuine connection,” she said, adding that her fund is keen on helping founders build their brand and communities as they scale their businesses. \nCrush It plans to typically write checks of $100,000 to $250,000, and invest in between 20 and 25 companies, she said. So far, the firm has invested in 18 companies, like the wearable tech company Elemind and CPG business Caliwater. She hopes to deploy all of the checks within the next 12-18 months. \n“We want to help close the gap in wellness funding for underrepresented founders, build stronger founder networks, and show that purpose and community-driven companies can scale and make a meaningful difference in health and lifestyle,” she said. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

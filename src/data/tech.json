This past weekend, X users asked Grok to create sexualized deepfakes of real people — including children.

Meta had originally planned to launch the glasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the U.K. in early 2026.\n“Since launching last fall, we’ve seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,” the company said. “Because of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we’ve decided to pause our planned international expansion.”\nMeta says it will continue focusing on fulfilling U.S. orders while it re-evaluates its approach to international availability.\nUnveiled in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures.\nAt CES this week in Las Vegas, Meta showed off new features coming to the glasses and the Neural Band. The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.\nMeta is also expanding pedestrian navigation to Denver, Las Vegas, Portland, and Salt Lake City. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n",

Probably not mentioned at the show is that these gadgets might be creating a massive environmental problem.\nIt isn’t something that tends to get much attention, but a new study from Cornell University and the University of Chicago found that by 2050, demand for health wearables could hit 2 billion units per year, or 42 times more than today. Unless we change how they’re made, these devices could generate over a million tons of electronic waste and 100 million tons of carbon dioxide over that same period, the authors warn.\nAn even bigger surprise is that it’s not the plastic that’s the problem. The study, published in Nature, found that the printed circuit board — the device’s “brain” — accounts for 70% of its carbon footprint, largely due to intensive mining and manufacturing.\nThe researchers suggest two fixes: develop chips using common metals like copper instead of rare minerals like gold, and make devices modular so the circuit board can be reused while the outer covering gets replaced.\nWrote one of the study’s co-authors, “When these devices are deployed at global scale, small design choices add up quickly.” It’s something to think about while scrolling through CES announcements.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Biotech & Health\n",

    "body": "\nLMArena, a startup that originally launched as a UC Berkeley research project in 2023, announced on Tuesday that it raised a $150 million Series A at a post-money valuation of $1.7 billion. The round was led by Felicis and the university’s fund, UC Investments.\nThe startup bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture with a $100 million seed round in May at a $600 million valuation. This new round means it raised $250 million in about seven months.\nLMArena is best known for its crowdsourced AI model performance leaderboards. Its consumer website lets a user type a prompt that it sends to two models, with the user then choosing which model did a better job. Those results, which now span more than 5 million monthly users across 150 countries and 60 million conversations a month, the company says, fuel the leaderboards. It ranks various models on a variety of tasks including text, web development, vision, text-to-image, and other criteria.\nThe models it tests include various flavors of OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Grok, as well as ones that are geared toward specialties like image generation, text to image, or reasoning.\nThe company began as Chatbot Arena, an open research project built by UC Berkeley researchers Anastasios Angelopoulos and Wei-Lin Chiang, and was originally funded through grants and donations.\nLMArena’s leaderboards became something of an obsession among model makers. When LMArena started pursuing revenue, it partnered with select model companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to make their flagship models available for its community to evaluate. In April, a group of competitors published a paper alleging that this helped those model makers game the startup’s benchmarks, an allegation LMArena has vehemently denied.\nIn September, it publicly launched a commercial service, AI Evaluations, in which enterprises, model labs, and developers can hire the company to perform model evaluations through its community. This gave LMArena an annualized “consumption rate” — as the company describes its annual recurring revenue (ARR) — of $30 million as of December, less than four months after launch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat trajectory, and the startup’s popularity, were enough for VCs to pile in for the Series A, which included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, The House Fund, LDVP, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Laude Ventures.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:39 AM PST · January 6, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThreads is exploring games in chats, beginning with a basketball game. A spokesperson for Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is internally prototyping the game and that it’s not available to the public.\nThe game was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development. Paluzzi shared a screenshot of the basketball game, which appears to let users virtually shoot hoops by swiping their finger. The idea behind the game is likely to allow friends to compete to see who can score the most baskets, similar to other mobile basketball games.\n\nLaunching in-message games would give Threads an edge over competitors like X and Bluesky, which don’t offer built-in games. It could also even help Threads compete with Apple’s Messages, which supports games via third-party apps like GamePigeon.\nAs with any internal prototype, it’s unknown when or if Meta plans to officially roll out games in Threads messages.\nIt’s also worth noting this isn’t the first time Meta has explored in-message gaming, as Instagram launched a hidden emoji game in DMs last year. The goal of the game is to use your finger to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep an emoji of your choice afloat and continuously bouncing. If you let the emoji fall, you lose. The idea is to compete with the other person in the chat to achieve the highest score.\nThe internal prototype comes as Meta continues to build out Threads with new features to take on its competitors. For example, the platform recently expanded its Communities feature with more topics, likely aiming to draw users away from Reddit and X. Plus, it added a “disappearing posts” feature that lets users share their thoughts and engage in conversations that are automatically archived after 24 hours.\nWhile Threads boasts 400 million monthly users, it still has quite a way to go to catch up with X in the U.S., according to data from Pew Research Center’s report released a few weeks ago. The report says 21% of U.S. adults said they have used X, compared with only 8% who have used Threads, and 4% who have used Bluesky.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

It will be built off of the company’s Intel Core Series 3 processors, known as Panther Lake, which was announced last year and is now being rolled out in a variety of PCs.\nThis future platform includes a chip specifically for handheld gaming devices, according to reporting from IGN, which was confirmed by TechCrunch.\nThese Panther Lake chips are the company’s first built on its 18A manufacturing process, which started production in 2025.\nIntel is no stranger to the gaming industry and has been building chips for gaming PCs since the 1990s. The company leaned more heavily into gaming in 2022 with the release of its Intel Arc GPUs.\nEntering the handheld gaming space would be an interesting development, though, as the market is currently dominated by AMD. AMD just announced a new processor designed for gaming PCs, AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, in its CES keynote on Monday, in addition to new ray tracing and graphics technologies for gaming.\nRogers said Intel will share more details about its new products for handheld gaming devices later this year. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Gaming\n",

The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.\nNarwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing. \nImage Credits:Narwal\nThe Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean themselves. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee they will listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.\nNarwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2’s design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.\nImage Credits:Narwal\nAlong with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41 kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal. The company also demoed an unnamed cordless vacuum with a slim design, 360-degree swivel, and up to 50 minutes of run time. The cordless vacuum also has an auto-empty station that can support up to 60 days of dust disposal.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su kicked off her keynote at CES 2026 with a message about what compute could deliver: AI for everyone.\nAs part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future.\nThe semiconductor giant revealed the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, the latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation.\nThese new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction.\nThis is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017.\nRahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company’s recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.\n“In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.\n“No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.”\nPCs that include either the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nA Reddit user claiming to be a whistleblower from a food delivery app has been outed as a fake. The user wrote a viral post alleging that the company he worked for was exploiting its drivers and users.\n“You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories,” the supposed whistleblower wrote.\nHe claimed to be drunk and at the library to use its public Wi-Fi, where he was typing this long screed about how the company was exploiting legal loopholes to steal drivers’ tips and wages with impunity.\nThose claims were, unfortunately, believable — DoorDash actually was sued for stealing tips from drivers, resulting in a $16.75 million settlement. But in this case, the poster had made up his story.\nPeople lie on the internet all the time. But it’s not so common for such posts to hit the front page of Reddit, garner over 87,000 upvotes, and get crossposted to other platforms like X, where it got another 208,000 likes and 36.8 million impressions.\nCasey Newton, the journalist behind Platformer, wrote that he contacted the Reddit poster, who then contacted him on Signal. The Redditor shared what looked like a photo of his UberEats employee badge, as well as an 18-page “internal document” outlining the company’s use of AI to determine the “desperation score” of individual drivers. But as Newton tried to verify that the whistleblower’s account was legitimate, he realized that he was being baited into an AI hoax.\n“For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together,” Newton wrote. “Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThere have always been bad actors seeking to deceive reporters, but the prevalence of AI tools has made fact-checking require even more rigor.\nGenerative AI models often fail to detect if an image or video is synthetic, making it challenging to determine if content is real. In this case, Newton was able to use Google’s Gemini to confirm that the image was made with the AI tool, thanks to Google’s SynthID watermark, which can withstand cropping, compression, filtering, and other attempts to alter an image.\nMax Spero — founder of Pangram Labs, a company that makes a detection tool for AI-generated text — works directly with the problem of distinguishing real and fake content.\n“AI slop on the internet has gotten a lot worse, and I think part of this is due to the increased use of LLMs, but other factors as well,” Spero told TechCrunch. “There’s companies with millions in revenue that can pay for ‘organic engagement’ on Reddit, which is actually just that they’re going to try to go viral on Reddit with AI-generated posts that mention your brand name.”\nTools like Pangram can help determine if text is AI-generated, but especially when it comes to multimedia content, these tools aren’t always reliable — and even if a synthetic post is proven to be fake, it might have already gone viral before being debunked. So for now, we’re left scrolling social media like detectives, second-guessing if anything we see is real.\nCase in point: When I told an editor that I wanted to write about the “viral AI food delivery hoax that was on Reddit this weekend,” she thought I was talking about something else. Yes — there was more than one “viral AI food delivery hoax on Reddit this weekend.”\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nMobileye made its name, and money, by supplying automakers with millions of computer vision chips designed to support automotive safety features and advanced driver assistance systems. The Intel subsidiary and publicly traded company later expanded to tackle autonomous driving through its chips and software. \nNow, co-founder and president Amnon Shashua is taking the company into what he calls Mobileye 3.0. And that means robotics and a hefty acquisition.\nThe Israeli company announced Tuesday during CES in Las Vegas it has reached a deal to acquire Mentee Robotics — a startup co-founded by Shashua in 2022 — for $900 million. Under the agreement, Mobileye will buy Mentee Robotics for about $612 million in cash and up to 26.2 million shares of common stock. Shashua, who is the chairman, co-founder, and a significant shareholder of Mentee, recused himself from the Mobileye board’s consideration and approval, according to the company.\nThe transaction, which was approved by the Mobileye board and Intel, its largest shareholder, is expected to close in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to modestly increase Mobileye’s operating expenses in 2026 by a low-single-digit percentage.\n“Today marks a new chapter for robotics and automotive AI, and the beginning of Mobileye 3.0,” Shashua said Tuesday. “By combining Mentee’s breakthroughs in humanoid robotics with Mobileye’s expertise in automotive autonomy, and its proven ability to productize advanced AI, we have a unique opportunity to lead the evolution of physical AI across robotics and autonomous vehicles on a global scale.”\nMentee Robotics, which is developing humanoid robots, will continue as an independent unit within Mobileye. Of course, with Shashua as brains and shareholder between the two companies, there will surely be plenty of overlap. \nThe benefits for Mobileye aren’t entirely obvious except that every one seems to be jumping into the humanoid robot game these days. Officially, Mobileye said the acquisition “broadens the scope of the business with a decisive step toward Physical Artificial Intelligence in general.” Specifically, systems that are designed to understand context and intent as well as act natural with humans and the physical world. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn other words, Mobileye, and Shashua, seem to want to move beyond the technology used to allow vehicles to navigate the world and apply it to humanoid robots as well. The company suggests in its announcement it has the funds to get it there, noting that its current automotive revenue pipeline — driven by its advanced vehicle autonomy and core advanced driver assistance tech — is $24.5 billion over the next eight years. The company said that pipeline figure is up more than 40% compared to January 2023. \nOf course, the development of humanoid robots that can eventually go into production will be a costly enterprise. Mentee stands to gain considerably as it can tap into Mobileye’s resources, which include advanced AI training infrastructure — aka compute. \nThe acquisition news comes a day after Mobileye announced another customer win for its next-generation chip built for hands-off advanced driver assistance systems. The company announced Monday that a “top 10 automaker” struck a deal to buy 9 million of its EyeQ6H-based Surround ADAS systems. Volkswagen Group announced in March it would also use the chip. Mobileye now estimates future delivery of more than 19 million EyeQ6H-based Surround systems. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.”\n“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.”\nThe bill, dubbed SB 867, comes in the wake of President Trump’s recent executive order directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety. The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.\nOver the past year, lawsuits filed by families whose children died by suicide after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently passed SB 243, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users.\nWhile the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group PIRG Education Fund warned that toys like Kumma — a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot — could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics. NBC News found that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at times indicate that it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values.\nOpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel were slated to release an “AI-powered product” in 2025, but delayed their release. Neither company explained the delay, and it’s not clear if they plan to release a toy in 2026. \n“Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on,” Padilla said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nKate Lowry, a former vice president at Insight Partners, is suing the firm, alleging disability discrimination, gender discrimination, and wrongful termination, according to a suit filed on December 30 in San Mateo County, California, and seen by TechCrunch. Insight Partners did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nLowry told TechCrunch she filed the suit because she believes “too many powerful, wealthy people in venture act like it’s OK to break the law and systemically underpay and abuse their employees.”\n“It’s an oppressive system that reflect[s] broader trends in society that use fear, intimidation, and power to silence and isolate truth. I’m trying to change that.”\nLowry began working at Insight Partners in 2022, after previously working for Meta, McKinsey & Company, and an early-stage startup. The suit alleges that, upon being hired, she was assigned to a different supervisor than the person mentioned during her interview.  \nShe alleges in the suit that she was told by her new supervisor, who was a woman, to be “online all the time, including PTO, holidays, and weekends,” and to respond between “6 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily.”  \nLowry says in the suit that this first supervisor “berated, hazed, and antagonized” her, spoke openly about a hazing that would be “longer and more intense” than what she put other male reports through.  \nSome comments the supervisor allegedly made, according to the suit, include “you are incompetent, shut up and take notes” and “you need to obey me like a dog; do whatever I say whenever I say it, without speaking.”  Lowry also alleges that her supervisor assigned her “redundant tasks” and restricted her ability to participate in calls, while allowing less experienced male colleagues to do so. Lowry, instead, she alleges, was relegated to “administrative tasks such as note-taking and cataloging.”  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLowry said she became “increasingly ill” because of the work environment and that her physician advised a medical leave of absence, which she was granted and took from February to July 2023.  \nWhen she returned to work, she was placed on a new team and, the suit alleges, was told by the head of human resources that “if the new team did not like her, she would be fired.”  \nIn September 2023, Lowry said she got a concussion and took another medical leave and returned to work near the end of 2024. Due to some departures, she was placed under the supervision of a new person, where Lowry said her poor treatment continued. She also alleges that in 2024, her compensation was about 30% below the market. \nBy April 2025, she alleges she was told her compensation would be cut. In May of 2025, through her attorneys, Lowry sent a letter to Insight regarding her alleged treatment by the company. A week later, the firm terminated her employment, the suit states.  \nThe lawsuit is reminiscent of Ellen Pao’s suit against Kleiner Perkins back in 2012, in which she alleged discrimination and retaliation. That suit offered what was, at the time, a rare glimpse into how women partners felt they were treated in venture capital. Though Pao lost that suit, it sent waves through the industry, and other women went on to sue major tech companies.  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s augmenting its Ring smart doorbells with new features, including new fire alerts, an app store, and a new set of Ring Sensors.\nAnnounced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the company said the new Ring Sensors can detect motion, openings, glass breakage, and smoke, and can also monitor carbon monoxide levels, leaks, temperature changes, and air quality. They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.\nAmazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn’t specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.\nAnd as fires grow more common in drought-affected areas, the company has teamed up with the fire monitoring app Watch Duty to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app’s Neighbors section.

    "body": "\nThe founder of a U.S.-based spyware company, whose surveillance products allowed customers to spy on the phones and computers of unsuspecting victims, pleaded guilty to federal charges linked to his long-running operation. \npcTattletale founder Bryan Fleming entered a guilty plea in a San Diego federal court on Tuesday to charges of computer hacking, the sale and advertising of surveillance software for unlawful uses, and conspiracy.\nThe plea follows a multi-year investigation by agents with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a unit within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. HSI began investigating pcTattletale in mid-2021 as part of a wider probe into the industry of consumer-grade surveillance software, also known as “stalkerware.”\nThis is the first successful U.S. federal prosecution of a stalkerware operator in more than a decade, following the 2014 indictment and subsequent guilty plea of the creator of a phone surveillance app called StealthGenie. Fleming’s conviction could pave the way for further federal investigations and prosecutions against those operating spyware, but also those who simply advertise and sell covert surveillance software.\nHSI said that pcTattletale is one of several stalkerware websites under investigation.\nA spokesperson for ICE did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Kelly Thornton, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, which brought the charges against Fleming, declined to comment.\nFleming’s lawyer Marcus Bourassa did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\npcTattletale was a remote surveillance app that had been under Fleming’s control since at least 2016. Stalkerware apps like pcTattletale allow ordinary consumers to buy software capable of tracking people and their data without their knowledge, including romantic partners and spouses, which is illegal in the United States and many other countries.\nOnce physically planted on a person’s phone or computer (usually with knowledge of the victim’s passcode or login), the app would continuously upload a copy of the victim’s information, including messages, photos, and location data, to pcTattletale’s servers and make the data accessible to whoever planted the spyware.\nFleming shut down pcTattletale in 2024 following a data breach, which saw a hacker deface the company’s website and steal reams of data from its servers, including identifiable information belonging to its customers and their victims. More than 138,000 customers who had signed up to use pcTattletale had their breached information shared with data breach notification site Have I Been Pwned. \nAt the time, Fleming told TechCrunch that his company was “out of business and completely done,” after deleting the contents of pcTattletale’s servers.   \nDespite the shutdown, federal agents were already far into their investigation of Fleming’s illegal spyware business.\nFeds search founder’s $1.2M home\nHSI began investigating pcTattletale in June 2021 after finding over 100 stalkerware websites offering surveillance products, many of which advertised lawful uses of the software, such as monitoring children or employees.\npcTattletale stood out because it was specifically advertising its spyware for “surreptitiously spying on spouses and partners,” wrote HSI special agent Nick Jones in the 2022 affidavit in support of a search warrant for Fleming’s home. The affidavit was unsealed in early December 2025 ahead of Fleming’s anticipated plea hearing. \nCrucially for investigators, Fleming was believed to be operating pcTattletale from his home in Bruce Township, Michigan, well within reach of U.S. law enforcement — unlike many overseas stalkerware operators who are not.  \nUnlike some stalkerware operators who shield their identities to avoid legal and reputational risks from working with spyware, Fleming was brazen in how he advertised pcTattletale. In videos posted on YouTube, Fleming could be seen at his home promoting pcTattletale as its creator and founder. \n\nA surveillance photo taken by HSI agents outside of Bryan Fleming’s home in MichiganImage Credits:Justice Department (affidavit)\n\nAccording to the affidavit, HSI obtained a warrant in 2022 allowing the search of Fleming’s email accounts. HSI said the emails showed that Fleming “knowingly assisted customers seeking to spy on nonconsenting, non-employee adults.” \nFederal agents later surveilled Fleming’s home to confirm it was in fact him. \nJones also went undercover to collect evidence, posing as an affiliate marketer under the guise of promoting the spyware in exchange for a cut of the proceeds. As a result of this operation, Jones exchanged emails with Fleming, in which the pcTattletale founder provided images intended for banner ads that promoted the spyware as a way to “catch a cheater,” which made it clear Fleming wanted to market his product for illegal purposes. \nBy November 2022, HSI had obtained permission from a U.S. judge to search Fleming’s home, which agents raided soon after, seizing an unknown number of items. Agents also obtained records associated with Fleming’s bank and his PayPal account, which had transactions totaling more than $600,000 as of the end of 2021. \nThe search warrant was filed under seal amid concerns that Fleming could destroy or tamper with evidence. Fleming has since sold the house for $1.2 million, per public records.\nFleming’s conviction is a win for privacy advocates and campaigners who work to counter the proliferation of stalkerware and raise awareness to its dangers.\nEva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the co-founder of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, who has investigated and fought stalkerware for years, commented on Fleming’s guilty plea when reached by TechCrunch.\n“One of the most striking aspects of this case is the extent to which stalkware companies like pcTattletale operate out in the open,” said Galperin. “This is because the people behind these companies so rarely face consequences for selling tools that they themselves say are explicitly for monitoring other people’s devices without their knowledge or consent.” \n“I hope that this case changes the risk calculus for makers of stalkerware,” said Galperin.\nFleming is expected to be sentenced later this year.\n——\nIf you or someone you know needs help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) provides 24/7 free, confidential support to victims of domestic abuse and violence.

    "body": "\nMario Götze will go down in soccer history as the player who scored the winning goal that made Germany the 2014 FIFA World Cup champion. But he is also an increasingly seasoned angel investor.\nCompanion M, Götze’s personal investment vehicle, now has a portfolio of more than 70 companies, two of which became unicorns in 2025 — Danish fintech Flatpay and German AI startup Parloa. But the athlete also learned some lessons along the way about vetting opportunities. “I only agree to invest if the startup and its founders check all the boxes,” he told TechCrunch.\nThe boxes can be quite subjective at the stage at which Götze invests — typically pre-seed and seed rounds, with ticket sizes between €25,000 and €50,000 ($29,000-$58,000). To address this, Götze says Companion M “focuses on specific areas where we have built profound network and expertise.” Surprisingly, sports isn’t one of those areas — at least not directly.\nAccording to Götze, Companion M primarily focuses on B2B SaaS, software infrastructure, and cybersecurity, as well as health and biotech. While that’s not sports tech per se, health and biotech are a natural niche for an athlete interested in human performance and wellness — and who has the freedom to pursue unconventional opportunities in those fields.\nIn 2020, Götze made headlines for investing in German cannabis startup Sanity Group when most European institutional investors wouldn’t touch cannabis with a 10-foot pole. Since then, Germany has liberalized some aspects of its cannabis laws, creating tailwinds for the startup that claimed a 10% share of the German medical cannabis market in 2024.\nWith cannabis still forbidden for athletes in competition, Götze will have to wait to try the stuff himself: The 33-year-old is still playing professionally at the top league level with German club Eintracht Frankfurt. But rather than waiting for retirement, he is taking cues from American athlete-investors such as NBA champion Kevin Durant.\nGötze is not the only active European soccer player who also invests in startups — for instance, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé also do. But as the father of two young daughters, he has to balance his various commitments. “I have to schedule calls before or after practices and align meetings with weeks when I don’t have away games or play Champions League,” Götze wrote.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGötze isn’t doing it all himself, but he is not simply entrusting others with his money either. Instead, he created Companion M as a small team that supports him with angel investing, partnerships, and other tasks. “These are important for myself as a brand, particularly in the long term, after [my] active career,” he explained.\nThere is an undeniable branding aspect to these efforts. When Götze became Revolut’s first-ever brand ambassador for Germany, the fintech company cited his track record as an angel investor as an incentive. But while preparing for his post-soccer career, Götze has found what he describes as “another passion apart from sport.”\nThis passion may be less unexpected than it seems. While Götze and his brothers all became soccer players, their father Jürgen is a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of TU Dortmund University, and the family spent time in Houston, Texas, when Jürgen was visiting Rice University as a postdoctoral researcher.\nNot coincidentally, Götze mostly invests in Europe and in the U.S., with past investments including Miami-based Arcee AI and Frankfurt-based Qualifyze. Several portfolio companies went on to raise significant amounts of follow-on funding, and he has already exited some, such as Berlin-based KoRo.\nExits give Götze capital to reinvest, but he’s also focused on long-term wealth consolidation. As a limited partner, Companion backed more than 20 venture capital firms on both sides of the Atlantic, including 20VC, Cherry Ventures, EQT Ventures, Planet A, Merantix, Visionaries Club, and World Fund.\nGötze is still under contract with his club and is reportedly discussing an extension. But whenever he finally retires, these venture firms could count him as a peer. “After my career ends, I plan to focus on my investment activities,” he told Bloomberg. But even then, don’t expect him to publish his anti-portfolio of startups he passed on and that later became huge successes.\n“There are plenty of new startups every year, and there will be some that you miss out on. But regretting past decisions leads to making uneducated or impulsive decisions in the future,” he told TechCrunch. Spoken like a true sportsman: Dwelling on what you missed won’t help you score the next goal.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

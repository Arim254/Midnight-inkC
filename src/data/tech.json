Even if DOGE nixed some federal contracts and laid off workers (which it did), plenty of remaining obligations and the skyrocketing federal debt would remain.\nSo, he wagered his entire life savings — over $342,000 — to take the counter bet that the U.S. federal budget wouldn’t insta-shrink. He slowly amassed 3% of a Kalshi prediction market that had grown to $12 million (making a few hedging bets along the way), he told the WSJ.\nWhen the government released the 2025 year-end spending report on February 20, showing increases compared to 2024, Cole walked away with $470,300 and a handsome $128,000 profit.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Fintech\n\n",

Waymo usually enters a new city by first conducting months of manual driving and mapping to understand local road conditions, traffic patterns, and edge cases before gradually introducing autonomous testing and eventually fully driverless operations.\nWhile Charlotte — with its suburban-style layout and mild weather — may be an easier use case, Chicago’s harsh winters, heavy traffic, and dense urban complexity would be more of a challenge for Waymo. Operating there successfully would strengthen Waymo’s case that its system is nationally scalable. It also gives Waymo another shot at a northern city after New York dropped a proposal that would have allowed commercial robotaxi pilots in parts of the state.\nThe news comes the same week Waymo began offering commercial driverless operations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, bringing its total city count to 10.\nAside from Chicago and Charlotte, Waymo is also testing and planning to launch in Denver, London, and Washington, D.C., among other cities. The Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company earlier this month clinched $16 billion in funding to expand internationally.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Transportation\n\n",

The European Union has led the charge on this front with laws like the GDPR, the Digital Services Act and the AI Act, seeking to curb tech companies’ control and exploitation of user data and hold them accountable. \nThe Trump administration has historically opposed such regulatory approaches, and this order reinforces that position as the government seeks to boost U.S. AI companies. \nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n\n",

    "body": "\nSnapchat announced on Wednesday that it’s hosting its first-ever awards show on March 21. The social media giant says the awards show, called “The Snappys,” is designed to celebrate “the creators shaping culture on Snapchat.”\nCreators will receive awards like “Spotlight MVP,” “Best Storyteller,” and “Breakout Creator of the Year,” alongside awards across fashion, beauty, sports, music, food, and games. Additional categories include collaboration, comedy, and cultural impact.\n“Together, these honors reflect the many ways creators spark conversations, build community, and define culture on Snapchat,” the company wrote in a blog post. “The Snappys reinforces Snapchat’s ongoing commitment to celebrating creators not just as users, but as artists, entertainers, and cultural leaders.”\nSnapchat is the latest social media platform to launch awards for creators. Meta-owned Instagram introduced a new “Ring” award last October to recognize creators around the world. Instagram announced the 25 winners online, and each winner received a physical custom ring designed by English fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner, along with a digital golden ring around their Instagram profile.\nIn November, TikTok launched its first-ever TikTok Awards show in the U.S. Like Snapchat, Instagram handed out category-specific awards, like “Creator of the Year,” “Video of the Year,” “Muse of the Year,” “Breakthrough Artist of the Year,” and more. It’s worth noting that TikTok has also hosted awards shows in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, and Korea.\nSnapchat’s awards are more in line with TikTok’s, as it will also host a traditional awards show where the winners will be revealed live at the event. The company says the show will bring together “creators, industry leaders, and special guests.” One of the “special guests” is DJ Khaled, who will be receiving Snapchat’s “Lifetime Achievement Award.”\nBy launching awards, Snapchat and its rivals are positioning themselves as more than just social media apps and as notable players in the entertainment industry. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Snappys will be hosted by comedian and creator Matt Friend and will take place at Snap‘s Santa Monica headquarters. Snapchat says it will release more details, including lists of nominees, in the coming weeks. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

Some of these have included several members of its election security team, TechCrunch reported last year. CISA is the federal agency responsible for election security. Some warned that Trump’s ongoing obsession with promoting false claims about the 2020 election has led to the administration deprioritizing CISA.\nCISA also reassigned hundreds of other staffers to aid other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security as part of the Trump administration’s broad immigration crackdown.\nMany of Cyberscoop’s sources blame the Trump administration, Congress, or both. Others singled out CISA’s acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, as having struggled to lead the agency and reportedly caused security headaches as a result.\nCISA has been without a permanent director since Trump entered office in 2025.\nThe cybersecurity agency is said to be currently operating at around 38% staff levels as the partial U.S. federal government shutdown, which began on February 14, drags on. Lawmakers have declined to continue funding federal immigration authorities amid widespread criticism following the killings of two U.S. citizens by federal agents.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen reached for comment, CISA’s Gottumukkala told TechCrunch that the agency “remains unwavering in its commitment to protect our federal networks from malicious cyber threat actors despite the multi-week government shutdown” of Homeland Security. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWearables startup CUDIS is launching its newest series of health rings this week. The updated ring comes equipped with a number of features, including an AI “agent coach” designed to keep users on track to attain their fitness goals.\nCUDIS says it differentiates itself from other wearables by not just delivering health metrics but also incentivizing healthy behavior through a points system. Users garner digital “health points” for healthy behaviors — things like daily sleep, 10,000 steps every day, sports activities, and conversations with the ring’s AI coach — which can then be redeemed through an integrated marketplace for discounts on health supplements and other products.\nThe ring’s AI Agent Coach, meanwhile, is designed to leverage generative AI to aid with healthy programs for exercise and daily health. The company says that its agent generates tailored programs including “daily tasks, recovery protocols, supplement recommendations, and direct referrals to licensed medical professionals.”\nThe ring also tracks a host of body metrics and daily behaviors, such as sleep quality, stress management, movement, and recovery. This helps them see how these metrics affect their Pace of Aging (PoA), showing whether their body is aging faster or slower than their chronological age, the company explains.\nCUDIS CEO and co-founder Edison Chen told TechCrunch that since his company’s first wearable was launched in 2024, the company has sold over 30,000 units across its first two models. The app’s user base has also grown to 250,000 users across 103 countries, he added.\n“Our strongest markets so far have been North America, Europe, and Asia,” Chen said. “What we’re good at is pattern recognition for healthy people trying to optimize,” Chen told TechCrunch. \n“The AI spots when you’re trending in the wrong direction, such as chronic poor sleep, declining HRV, elevated resting heart rate, and either suggests lifestyle changes or connects you to a professional. The control is in the escalation pathway to the right care access,” he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company claims that it keeps user data encrypted and secure via the Solana blockchain. It has previously been described as a “web3 AI wellness company.” (TechCrunch was not able to test the smart ring directly to verify its security claims.)\nCUDIS announced $5 million of seed funding in 2024. The round was led by Draper Associates and included a number of other investors, including a number of blockchain-associated investor groups like Skybridge, DraperDragon, Monke Ventures, and Foresight Ventures, among others. The company also plans to launch a Kickstarter soon.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nElectric trucking startup Harbinger has acquired autonomous driving software company Phantom AI, in an effort to vertically integrate more technology and create new revenue streams for the young company.\nThe acquisition, which is Harbinger’s first, is part of the startup’s plan to steadily expand its portfolio beyond the electric truck chassis it’s been building and selling for the last year. Just last month, Harbinger announced it would start selling its battery packs for energy storage and auxiliary power, with Airstream as the first customer.\nHarbinger announced Wednesday it has already lined up a customer for Phantom’s advanced driver assistance tech that it just acquired. German automotive technology giant ZF Group has agreed to license that tech from Harbinger, and plans to sell it to automakers for use in their passenger cars. (Terms of the two deals were not disclosed.)\nHarbinger co-founder and CEO John Harris told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview that he expects this new software services business line to generate “millions” of dollars in revenue this year, which he said is mostly “not material” compared to the amount the company will make from selling its truck chassis. The startup recently raised $160 million in a funding round co-led by FedEx and THOR Industries, both of which are customers.\nHarris instead expects the ZF Group deal will bring in more significant revenue in 2027 or 2028. \n“The passenger car market is slower, but the volumes are very, very large,” he said.\nHarbinger was already using Phantom AI’s driver assistance tech, Harris said, and the acquisition will see the companies deepen that integration. Harris expects that to be a big win for Harbinger’s own customers. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Medium-duty [trucking] has a complete lack of safety features,” he said. “The majority of medium-duty vehicles on the road that have no backup cameras, no air conditioning, no lane keeping, no automatic emergency braking. It’s just not a thing that exists in the market yet, which is crazy.”\nHarbinger already promises a lower total cost of ownership for commercial customers, better emissions compliance, and an easier truck to drive thanks to the simpler, quieter electric powertrain. But Harris thinks the safety features enabled by Phantom’s tech will make Harbinger’s chassis that much better — especially because of how and where they tend to be used.\n“These vehicles, many of them are spending their time navigating around truck ports and pulling in and out of neighborhoods to deliver packages. They’re all in places where there’s a very high safety risk of backing into vehicles, hitting pedestrians, hitting bicyclists, hitting children,” he said. “We need to have, maybe not the cutting-edge 2026 safety features, but we should at least have the safety features that were commodity in 2020 or 2015.”\nWhile Harbinger’s headquarters are in Los Angeles, California, Phantom AI’s 30 employees — including its leadership team — will remain in Mountain View. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nLast month, OpenAI said that it is going to introduce ads to users of the free and Go tiers in ChatGPT. The company rolled out ads to U.S.-based users earlier this month amid criticism from rivals like Anthropic, which published a string of Super Bowl ads.\nOn the sidelines of the India AI summit, TechCrunch asked OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap about how the company is approaching ads. Lightcap said that the process is iterative and the company has to get user privacy and trust right.\n“Well, this is going to be an iterative process for sure. This is something we are committed to getting right. What does that look like? It means obviously maintaining user trust at a very high level. It means getting privacy right,” Lightcap said.\nHe also noted that ads can add to the product experience of users if they are done right. He urged to give OpenAI a few months to see how the company fares in rolling out the product.\n“It means really creating a delightful product experience. We think ads done right can be additive to a product experience. And so it’ll take iteration, it’ll take time, but we’re just starting out. So maybe give us a few months and see how it goes,” he said.\nLightcap didn’t specify if the company is thinking about rolling out ads beyond the U.S. market at the moment.\nEarlier this month, Sam Altman hit back at Anthropic with a long post on X about the Super Bowl ads, calling the OpenAI rival “dishonest” and accusing them of making an expensive product that serves “rich people.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. More Texans use ChatGPT for free than the total number of people who use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do,” Altman wrote.\nVarious outlets have reported that OpenAI is charging $60 for 1,000 impressions, an unusually high rate. Last month, Adweek noted that OpenAI is asking for $200,000 of minimum commitment from advertisers. Earlier this week, The Information reported that Shopify is allowing its merchants to advertise on ChatGPT through its Shop Campaigns ad network, joining early testers like Target, Williams Sonoma, and Adobe.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPodcasts have officially overtaken AM/FM talk radio as the more popular medium for spoken-word audio in the United States, according to Edison Research’s Share of Ear survey.\nThe researchers have tracked these statistics over the last decade, and almost always, the percentage of time people spent listening to podcasts increased, while their time with spoken radio broadcasts decreased. For the first time this year, podcasts eclipsed spoken-word radio with 40% of listening time, as opposed to 39% for radio.\nIf anything, it’s surprising that it has taken this long for podcasts to overtake radio shows. (Remember, this doesn’t include listening to music on the radio.) But perhaps that speaks more to the durability of good, old-fashioned radio than the merits of podcasting.\nImage Credits:Edison Research\nWe checked with Edison to see if these statistics include video podcasts, and they do. But the need to clarify that question points to the undeniable growing prevalence of video podcasts, hosted on platforms like Spotify and YouTube, which marks another key trend in podcasting.\nPerhaps an industry bellwether, Netflix is inking deals with iHeartMedia and Barstool Sports to bring podcasts to the streaming service as a more trendy version of the daytime talk show. It’s not a bad investment — according to YouTube, people watch them on TV. YouTube said that viewers watched 700 million hours of podcasts each month in 2025 on living room devices, like TVs, up from 400 million the previous year.\nBut the popularity of video podcasts doesn’t seem to be detracting from audio-first podcast listening. \nTriton Digital’s U.S. Podcast Report for 2025 showed that 80% of consumers over 18 years of age tune into both audio and video podcasts; 13% only listen to audio, while 7% only watch video. Listener preferences also appear to vary greatly depending on a podcast’s genre, with podcasts about topics like music, sports, comedy, and news skewing more popular on video. Genres like science, history, art, fiction, and true crime are more often consumed via audio.\nEdison’s findings show a similar trend in the role of video in podcasting. Eighty-five percent of weekly U.S. podcast listeners above the age of 13 consume podcasts with any sort of video component, up 7% from 2023. The research also showed that there are an estimated 115 million weekly podcast listeners in the U.S., with only 5% of listeners reporting that they watch podcasts, but don’t listen to them.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Samsung\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t11:23 AM PST · February 25, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nAt Samsung’s Galaxy S26 live event on Wednesday, the company introduced a new display technology that allows users to turn on a privacy mode and prevent so-called “shoulder surfing” on a per-app basis. The display tech will offer a smarter and more flexible alternative to privacy films, which are overlaid on top of a smartphone’s screen to limit viewing unless you’re looking directly at the phone.\nAs Samsung pointed out, these traditional privacy films come with trade-offs — like dimmer screens or more difficulties when you’re trying to show someone else something on your phone. \nImage Credits:Samsung\nIts solution is a new display technology for mobile devices that uses two different types of pixels: narrow pixels and wide pixels. This architecture, which Samsung dubbed Black Matrix, will narrow the path of light emitted from each pixel to precisely control the light visible to you when the privacy mode is enabled. When it’s turned off, a widened standard pixel works with the narrow pixels to deliver the light in every direction.\nsamsungImage Credits:Samsung\nThe Privacy Display feature is also customizable, so you can set certain apps or notifications to trigger privacy mode, while others are viewed normally. For instance, you could set your messaging app or banking app to always be displayed in a private mode, but leave it off for other apps where privacy is less of a concern. This flexibility also extends to notifications, essentially blacking out certain alerts when viewed from a side angle. \nSamsung says there’s also a setting for “maximum privacy protection,” which intensifies the privacy effect further by bringing down the bright areas and lifting the darker ones. \nImage Credits:Samsung\nThe new display will initially be available on the high-end Galaxy S26 Ultra smartphone, which also includes support for upgraded and faster AI and a custom chipset. \nThe privacy screen was demoed live on stage during the event Wednesday, with creator Miles Franklin (of MilesAboveTech) showing the technology in action. In the demo, the feature appeared to work as advertised, including for smaller elements on the screen like specific notifications.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company had teased the technology ahead of Wednesday’s event, but hadn’t yet explained how it would work.

    "body": "\nGoogle on Wednesday announced a series of updates to its Gemini AI-powered features on the Android operating system, the most notable being a new way to use the AI to handle multi-step tasks like ordering an Uber or food delivery. These automations join other Gemini improvements shipping today, including an expansion of scam detection for phone calls and Circle to Search updates that now let you identify all the items on your phone’s screen.\nThe automations, explains Google, allow users to essentially offload their to-do list to Gemini. In practice, however, the types of things that Gemini can manage are still limited.\nThe company says that the feature, which is in beta, will initially support select apps in the food, grocery, and rideshare categories. \nIt will also be limited to the Gemini app on certain devices, including the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S26 series. And it will initially be available only in the U.S. and Korea.\nImage Credits:Google\nAI-powered automations could potentially go wrong, of course, so Google has added some protections. For starters, the automations can’t be kicked off without an explicit command from the device’s owner. As they run, you can watch their progress in real time and stop the task if it’s making a mistake or getting stuck. Google notes also that the automations take place in a secure, virtual window on your phone where they can only access limited apps, not the rest of the data on your device.\nThe feature ties into the growing trend of using AI to automate more tasks in users’ personal lives. ChatGPT, for instance, lets users create tasks that can be run on schedules or at specific times, as well as offering an agent that can complete a variety of computer-based tasks like navigating a calendar, generating a slideshow, or running code. Anthropic’s Cowork, meanwhile, brings the capabilities of its Claude AI to non-coding tasks, letting non-developers automate everyday file and task management. And, of course, an AI tool called OpenClaw recently went viral for its ability to manage everyday tasks like sending emails, managing calendars, checking into flights, and more.\nImage Credits:Google\nAnother Gemini update arriving now is the expansion of a Scam Detection feature for phone calls, which is becoming available on Samsung Galaxy S26 series devices in the U.S. (The feature is already offered on Pixel phones in the U.S., Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, and the U.K.) Google is also using its Gemini on-device model to detect scam texts in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. on Pixel 10 series devices, and soon on the Galaxy S26 series phones, as well.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFinally, Google says its Circle to Search feature, which lets you use gestures like scribbles and circling to initiate searches, can now search for everything you’re seeing on the phone screen, not just a single object. That means you can search every item of clothing and every accessory in an outfit you like, or learn more about a group of things and the related topic on the screen.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle has been steadily releasing Gemini updates to its Android ecosystem at regular intervals through new operating system updates and updates targeted toward its flagship phone, the Google Pixel, via its frequent updates known as Pixel Drops. Meanwhile, Apple has been struggling to release a more comprehensive AI feature set, which is set to include an AI-powered Siri — a launch that was recently pushed back again to later in the year.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAI chatbots have become embedded in the lives of American teenagers, according to a report published Tuesday by the Pew Research Center. \nWhile the most common uses of AI among this demographic include searching for information (57%) and getting help with schoolwork (54%), teens are also using AI to fill roles that would typically be occupied by friends or family. Sixteen percent of U.S. teens say they use AI for casual conversation, while 12% use AI chatbots for emotional support or advice.\nSome teens may find solace in talking to chatbots, but mental health professionals are wary. General-purpose tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok are not designed for such uses, and in the most extreme cases, these chatbots can have life-threatening psychological effects.\n“We are social creatures, and there’s certainly a challenge that these systems can be isolating,” Dr. Nick Haber, a Stanford professor researching the therapeutic potential of LLMs, told TechCrunch recently. “There are a lot of instances where people can engage with these tools and then can become not grounded to the outside world of facts, and not grounded in connection to the interpersonal, which can lead to pretty isolating — if not worse — effects.”\nImage Credits:Pew Research Center\nPew’s survey also shows a discrepancy between teenagers’ self-reported AI usage and the extent to which their parents think they engage with this technology. About 51% of parents said that their teen uses chatbots, while 64% of teens reported using them.\nThe majority of parents are okay with their teens using AI to search for information (79%) or get help with schoolwork (58%), but far fewer parents approve of their teens using AI chatbots for casual conversation (28%) or to get emotional support or advice (18%). In fact, 58% of parents are not okay with their child using AI for such purposes.\nAI safety is a contentious topic among leading tech companies, to say the least. But one popular chatbot maker, Character.AI, made the choice to disable the chatbot experience for users under the age of 18. This decision followed public outcry and lawsuits filed over two teenagers’ suicides, which took place after prolonged conversations with the company’s chatbots. OpenAI, meanwhile, made the decision to sunset its particularly sycophantic GPT-4o model, which sparked backlash from people who had come to rely on the model for emotional support.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThough a majority of teens use AI chatbots in some way, they have mixed feelings about the impact of this kind of technology on society. When asked how they think AI will impact society over the next 20 years, 31% of teens said the impact would be positive, while 26% said it would be negative. \n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of the viral AI agent OpenClaw who has since been hired by OpenAI, has some advice for those experimenting with AI technology, including AI agents. From his own experience, the best way to build today is to explore, be playful, and not expect to be an expert at what you do right away.\n“I wish I could say that I had the unified plan in the beginning, but a lot of it was just exploration,” Steinberger said. “I wanted things, and those things didn’t exist, and … let’s say I prompted them into existence.”\nThe developer was chatting with OpenAI’s Head of Developer Experience, Romain Huet, on the first episode of the company’s new Builders Unscripted podcast. Here, he spoke about what OpenClaw was like in its early days and how he didn’t have a plan when he got started.\nSteinberger explained he began by building a tool that would integrate with WhatsApp, but then set it aside for a bit and focused on other things, as he assumed the AI labs would build something like what he was working on in the near future.  \n“I just experimented a lot. My mission was, kind of like, to have fun and inspire people,” Steinberger noted. By last November, however, the developer was surprised that no AI labs had started to build what he wanted to use. That led him to create the initial prototype of what’s now OpenClaw. \n“Where it really clicked was where I was at this weekend trip in Marrakesh, and I found myself using it way more because it was so convenient … There was no really good internet. [But] WhatsApp just works everywhere,” he said. The tool made it easy for him to find restaurants, look up things on his computer, send texts to friends, and more.\n\n\n\nThe more he played with the technology, Steinberger realized how good modern AI models have become at problem-solving, much like coders are. \n“Now they can just, like, actually come up with the solutions themselves, even though you never programmed them at all,” he noted. \nThroughout the process of building, Steinberger said that his workflow improved — and he stresses to other developers that’s something that can take time, so don’t give up.\n“There’s these people that … write software in the old way, and the old way is going to go away,” he pointed out. They then decide to try vibe coding but are disappointed with the results.\n“I think vibe coding is a slur,” said Steinberger, basically suggesting that it’s not as simple a process at first as the term makes it sound. “They try AI, but they don’t understand that it’s a skill,” he said, then compared the process of coding with AI to learning guitar.\n“You’re not going to be good at guitar on the first day,” he said. Instead, he recommends that people approach learning with a more playful attitude. If he writes a prompt now, he has a gut feeling as to how long it will take, and if it takes longer, he reflects on what may have gone wrong and adapts.\n“My … advice always is, approach it in a playful way. Build something that you always wanted to build. If you’re at least a little bit of a builder, there has to be something on the back of your mind that you want to build. Like, just play.”\nThis ability to experiment and have fun is what’s most important, especially at a time when people are worried their jobs will be overtaken by AI. \n“If your identity is: I want to create things. I want to solve problems. If you’re high agency, if you’re smart, you will be in more demand than ever,” Steinberger said.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Together they led the 2020 acquisition of Grindr from Chinese ownership for over $600 million, then took the app public in 2022 through a blank-check merger.\nReportedly, Zage and Lu, who together control more than 60% of Grindr, pledged nearly all their shares as collateral for personal loans from a unit of Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek. After Grindr began a slide at the end of September, those loans became undercollateralized (worth less than the debt), so the Temasek unit seized and sold some of the shares last week.\nGrindr’s stock slide appears disconnected from business fundamentals – profits were up 25% in the second quarter, Semafor notes, though it has seen some executive turnover; there has been some investor concern about narrowing margins, too.\nEither way, the pair are now said to be in talks with Fortress Investment Group – itself now majority owned by Mubadala Investment Company, which is itself owned by the government of Abu Dhabi – to secure financing for a buyout at around $15 per share, which would value Grindr at around $3 billion. Shares jumped following the report.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

The company, backed by Sequoia Capital, TCV, and Jackson Square Ventures, was last valued at $2.2 billion in May.\nStrava has the wind at its back, certainly. The app’s user base has exploded to 50 million monthly active users in 2025, according to Sensor Tower – nearly double its closest competitor, with downloads up 80% year-over-year.\nStrava’s growth coincides with a cultural shift around running, particularly as people in their teens and 20s seek more alcohol-free ways to socialize. Runners also emphasize the mental health benefits of finding support networks (and, sometimes, romance). Applications for the 2026 London Marathon jumped 31% this year to 1.1 million people.\nStrava’s secret sauce? Turning workouts into social currency with “kudos” and split comparisons. Sensor Tower estimates consumers spent over $180 million on its subscription tier through September – a figure Strava says significantly underestimates actual revenue. The company also earns from sponsored challenges and brand partnerships.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

    "body": "\nIn an effort to protect its underage users from harmful content, Instagram is rolling out new restrictions to teen accounts. Users under 18 will now by default only see content that adheres to PG-13 movie ratings, avoiding themes like extreme violence, sexual nudity, and graphic drug use.\nUsers under 18 won’t be able to change this setting without their parents or guardians’ explicit approval.\nInstagram is also introducing a stricter content filter, called Limited Content, that will prevent teens from seeing and posting comments on posts that have the setting turned on. \nThe company said starting next year, it will apply more restrictions to the kinds of chats teens can have with AI bots that have the Limited Content filter turned on. It is already applying the new PG-13 content settings to AI conversations.\nImage Credits: Instagram\nThis move as chatbot makers like OpenAI and Character.AI are being taken to court for allegedly causing harm to users. Last month, OpenAI rolled out new restrictions for ChatGPT users under 18, and said it is training the chatbot to refrain from “flirtatious talk.” Earlier this year, Character.AI also added new limits and parental controls.\nInstagram, which has been building tools related to teen safety across accounts, DMs, search, and content, is expanding controls and restrictions in various areas for underage users. The social media service will not allow teenagers to follow accounts that share age-inappropriate content, and if they follow such accounts, they won’t be able to see content from these accounts or interact with them, and vice versa. The company is also removing such accounts from recommendations, making them harder to find.\nImage Credits: Instagram\nThe company is also blocking teenagers from viewing inappropriate content linked to them in DMs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeta already restricts teen accounts from discovering content related to eating disorders and self-harm. The company is now blocking words like “alcohol” or “gore,” and says it is also making sure that teens don’t find content under these categories by misspelling these terms.\nImage Credit: Instagram\nThe company said it is testing a new way for parents to flag content that shouldn’t be recommended to teens using supervision tools. Flagged posts will be sent to a review team.\nInstagram is rolling out these changes in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada starting today, and globally next year.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFarewell, V2: SpaceX on Monday night sent Starship’s current configuration on one last test flight, in a mission that the company says hit all its key goals, moving the program into its next phase.\nThe nearly 400-foot-tall rocket lifted off from Starbase, Texas at 6:23 PM local time. The Super Heavy booster, reused from a March test, tried a new landing-burn profile, reigniting 13 engines before throttling down to five, and finally three for the final hover before completing a planned soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico roughly seven minutes after liftoff.\nMeanwhile, Starship’s upper stage deployed eight mock Starlink satellite simulators, trialing a new “dynamic banking maneuver” profile that the company aims to use for future return-to-pad attempts at Starbase. The upper stage then splashed down in the Indian Ocean.  \nThis marked the final launch of the second-gen Starship and the first-gen Super Heavy variants. As with the previous test flight, engineers also experimented with the heat shield tiles on the upper stage, including selective removals and novel tile variations to gather reentry data.\nSpaceX also duplicated Flight 10’s other key milestones: deploying simulators, and relighting one of Starship’s six Raptor engines on orbit.\nMonday’s test formally started the program’s next phase: flying an upgraded prototype called V3, outfitted for in-orbit docking and propellant-transfer demonstrations, capabilities essential for crafts that aim to reach the Moon and Mars. SpaceX says V3 also incorporates structural changes and upgrades to the Raptor engine that are aimed at increasing lifting capacity, though the company did not share specific figures.\n“This next iteration will be used for the first Starship orbital flights, operational payload missions, propellant transfer, and more as we iterate to a fully and rapidly reusable vehicle with service to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond,” the company said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn parallel, SpaceX is upgrading Pad A at Starbase, and shifting launches to Pad B. The company is simultaneously working to build dual Starship launch pads in Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\nStarship is the most powerful rocket ever developed. It’s also the cornerstone of both NASA’s Artemis campaign and SpaceX’s plan to start deploying higher-capacity Starlink satellites.\nActing NASA Administrator Sean Duffy applauded the mission on X, saying it was “another major step toward landing Americans on the Moon’s south pole.”\nSpaceX was awarded more than $4 billion to develop a human-rated variant of Starship, called the Human Landing System, for the Artemis 3 crewed mission currently scheduled for 2027. But meeting that date will require SpaceX to demonstrate increasingly complex milestones first, especially orbital docking and in-orbit propellant transfer.\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFinnish health tech company Oura has raised $900 million in fresh funding led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, with participation from new investor ICONIQ and contributions from Whale Rock and Atreides.\nThe company said today that this funding will value it at “approximately $11 billion,” more than double the valuation it received for its last round in December. Bloomberg previously reported that Oura was closing new funding at $11 billion valuation.\n“This new funding is a testament to the strength of Oura business and the trust millions of members place in us every day. We’re proud to be building not just a product, but a global movement toward proactive health—helping people understand their bodies, make better lifestyle decisions, and connect more effectively with their healthcare providers,” CEO Tom Hale said in a statement. \nThe company told TechCrunch that it plans to use the new funding for AI and production innovation, introducing new health features, and improving its global distribution.\nOura has sold over 5.5 million smart rings since launch. The past year has been particularly fruitful for the company, providing more than half of those sales. The smart ring maker more than doubled its revenue in 2024, raking in $500 million. The company expects the trend to continue this year, with sales likely to cross $1 billion. According to a report from IDC published last year, Oura holds more than 80% of the smart ring market.\nThe company is also luring in customers of different demographics. Earlier this week, at the Elevate conference in Toronto, Oura’s chief commercial officer, Dorothy Kilroy, said that women in their early twenties are becoming a core market for the company. \nOura launched its latest device, Oura ring 4, last October. Earlier this month, the company launched ceramic versions of the ring along with a new optional charging dock. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBeyond health tracking hardware, the company is venturing into health tests. This month, Oura launched a new feature called Health Panels in the app that lets users book a blood test for $99 at one of 2,000 Quest Diagnostics labs across the U.S. While Oura doesn’t provide medical advice, users will be able to see the report in the app and chat with its AI bot about general suggestions.\nThe new blood testing feature also pits Oura against startups like Whoop, which launched a similar feature this month, as well as ring makers like Ultrahuman and Samsung, \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark bill on Monday that regulates AI companion chatbots, making it the first state in the nation to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions.\nThe law, SB 243, is designed to protect children and vulnerable users from some of the harms associated with AI companion chatbot use. It holds companies — from the big labs like Meta and OpenAI to more focused companion startups like Character AI and Replika — legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet the law’s standards.\nSB 243 was introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, and gained momentum after the death of teenager Adam Raine, who died by suicide after a long series of suicidal conversations with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The legislation also responds to leaked internal documents that reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children. More recently, a Colorado family has filed suit against role-playing startup Character AI after their 13-year-old daughter took her own life following a series of problematic and sexualized conversations with the company’s chatbots.\n“Emerging technology like chatbots and social media can inspire, educate, and connect — but without real guardrails, technology can also exploit, mislead, and endanger our kids,” Newsom said in a statement. “We’ve seen some truly horrific and tragic examples of young people harmed by unregulated tech, and we won’t stand by while companies continue without necessary limits and accountability. We can continue to lead in AI and technology, but we must do it responsibly — protecting our children every step of the way. Our children’s safety is not for sale.”\nSB 243 will go into effect January 1, 2026, and requires companies to implement certain features such as age verification, and warnings regarding social media and companion chatbots. The law also implements stronger penalties for those who profit from illegal deepfakes, including up to $250,000 per offense. Companies must also establish protocols to address suicide and self-harm, which will be shared with the state’s Department of Public Health alongside statistics on how the service provided users with crisis center prevention notifications.\nPer the bill’s language, platforms must also make it clear that any interactions are artificially generated, and chatbots must not represent themselves as healthcare professionals. Companies are required to offer break reminders to minors and prevent them from viewing sexually explicit images generated by the chatbot.\nSome companies have already begun to implement some safeguards aimed at children. For example, OpenAI recently began rolling out parental controls, content protections, and a self-harm detection system for children using ChatGPT. Replika, which is designed for adults over the age of 18, told TechCrunch it dedicates “significant resources” to safety through content-filtering systems and guardrails that direct users to trusted crisis resources, and is committed to complying with current regulations.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCharacter AI has said that its chatbot includes a disclaimer that all chats are AI-generated and fictionalized. A Character AI spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company “welcomes working with regulators and lawmakers as they develop regulations and legislation for this emerging space, and will comply with laws, including SB 243.” \nSenator Padilla told TechCrunch the bill was “a step in the right direction” towards putting guardrails in place on “an incredibly powerful technology.”\n“We have to move quickly to not miss windows of opportunity before they disappear,” Padilla said. “I hope that other states will see the risk. I think many do. I think this is a conversation happening all over the country, and I hope people will take action. Certainly the federal government has not, and I think we have an obligation here to protect the most vulnerable people among us.”\nSB 243 is the second significant AI regulation to come out of California in recent weeks. On September 29th, Governor Newsom signed SB 53 into law, establishing new transparency requirements on large AI companies. The bill mandates that large AI labs, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google DeepMind, be transparent about safety protocols. It also ensures whistleblower protections for employees at those companies.\nOther states, like Illinois, Nevada, and Utah, have passed laws to restrict or fully ban the use of AI chatbots as a substitute for licensed mental health care.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Meta and OpenAI for comment.\nThis article has been updated with comments from Senator Padilla, Character AI, and Replika.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nGoldman Sachs has agreed to acquire Industry Ventures, a 25-year-old, San Francisco-based investment firm with $7 billion in assets under management, CNBC was first to report on Monday. The deal underscores the growing importance of secondary markets and buyouts as traditional venture exits remain sluggish.\nThe investment bank is paying $665 million in cash and equity, with up to $300 million more tied to the firm’s performance through 2030, according to a release from Goldman. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, and all 45 Industry Ventures employees are expected to join Goldman.\nWe’ve reached out to Swildens for more information.\nThe acquisition comes as venture funds increasingly turn to non-traditional exits amid a prolonged IPO drought that only now looks to be breaking. Speaking on TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast earlier this year, Industry Ventures founder and CEO Hans Swildens said that tech buyout funds now account for 25% of all liquidity in the entire venture ecosystem — “a huge chunk of liquidity,” he said.\nSwildens explained that venture managers are being forced to adapt their approach. “Just going out and seeing companies, putting them in your fund and then waiting for an IPO or strategic M&A exit probably won’t work anymore,” he said in the podcast interview. “[VCs] need to start working on alternative liquidity solutions.”\nAt the time — in April — he noted that at least five major venture funds had hired full-time staff dedicated to manufacturing non-traditional exits, including secondary transactions, continuation funds, and buyouts. “All the brand name funds are all staffing and thinking through liquidity structures,” Swildens said.\nGoldman is making the acquisition to bolster its $540 billion alternatives investment platform, which the bank has identified as a key growth engine.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Industry Ventures’ trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world,” Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a prepared statement. “By combining the global resources of Goldman Sachs with the venture capital expertise of Industry Ventures, we are uniquely positioned to serve the increasingly complex needs of entrepreneurs, private technology companies, limited partners, and venture fund managers,” the statement continued.\nIndustry Ventures says it has made more than 1,000 investments, has stakes in more than 700 venture firms, and that it boasts an internal rate of return of 18%.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nGoogle is making a $15 billion investment to set up a 1-gigawatt data center and AI hub in India, even as the Indian government pushes for reduced reliance on U.S. tech giants.\nOn Tuesday, Google said it would build the data center in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, in the port city of Visakhapatnam. The investment will take place over the next five years through 2030, the company added. Notably, this marks Google’s largest investment in India and comes five years after it first announced a $10 billion commitment to the South Asian nation in 2020.\nWeeks after President Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian imports in August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi began urging the use of “swadeshi” (Hindi for “made in India”) products. In response, Indian lawmakers and ministries started promoting local alternatives to Google — including those from Chennai-based enterprise tech firm Zoho Corporation, which offers competitors to Google Cloud and Gmail, and most recently, WhatsApp-rival Arattai, as well as MapMyIndia, a Google Maps-rival. While the initial impact has been limited, these moves could pose a real political threat to the future of companies Google and Microsoft in India.\nGoogle has 14,000 employees in India, and has operated in the country for 21 years. The company also counts Delhi and Mumbai as official cloud regions.\nThe new Google AI hub will be the company’s largest investment outside of the U.S., said Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, adding that it would be scaled to “multiple gigawatts” over time.\n“It is part of a global network of AI centers in 12 different countries,” Kurian said at the launch of the AI hub in New Delhi. “In addition to that, we’re also pleased to announce that we will be making Vishakhapatnam a global connectivity hub.”\nGoogle also announced plans to bring its subsea cable infrastructure to Visakhapatnam. The U.S. tech giant has partnered with Indian telecom provider Bharti Airtel to build both the data center and the cable landing station in the city. Further, Google has teamed up with Adani Group-backed AdaniConneX to set up the infrastructure for the data center.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle’s AI hub launch in India with Indian lawmakersImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n“We see it not just becoming a landing station for a large number of cables, but also providing a digital backbone connecting different parts of India together,” Kurian said.\nGoogle said the AI hub will offer a “full stack of solutions,” including its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to enable local AI processing.\nThe Mountain View–based company will also provide access to its AI models — including Gemini — and its platform for building agents and applications. The hub will additionally support consumer services such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Ads.\n“We see this hub not just serving India but from India serving Asia and other parts of the world,” Kurian said.\nGoogle’s choice of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh is not surprising. The southern state, under Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, has previously attracted global tech firms like Oracle and Microsoft to set up hubs in Hyderabad, which was Andhra Pradesh’s capital before the creation of Telangana. Naidu, a key political ally who supported Prime Minister Modi’s return to power in the last general election, has since played a prominent role in shaping national policy discussions.\n“This AI hub will be a very important contribution to the [India] AI mission goals in different ways,” said Indian IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.\nThe minister urged Google to consider India’s Andaman Islands as the next major hub for global internet data transfer, noting that Singapore “is all choked,” and assured the company of full government support. He also proposed linking Visakhapatnam with Sittwe, a city in Myanmar, to improve connectivity in India’s northeastern states.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAirbound, an Indian drone startup, has raised $8.65 million in seed funding led by Physical Intelligence co-founder Lachy Groom, as it begins a drone-delivery pilot with a private hospital and works toward one-cent delivery using its ultra-light, blended-wing-body aircraft.\nThe seed round includes participation from Humba Ventures and Airbound’s existing investor Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril.\nFounded in 2020 by Naman Pushp — who was 15 at the time and is now 20 — Airbound has developed an aircraft using a tail-sitter design (where the drone sits vertically and launches upright like a rocket) and carbon fiber frame, aiming to deliver parcels at up to 20 times lower cost than conventional methods and significantly cheaper than existing drone delivery systems. The aircraft uses a blended-wing-body shape with two propellers, rather than the more common quadcopter configuration. This enables the aircraft to take off like a rocket and fly like a plane.\nAirbound is targeting one-cent deliveries by rethinking how energy is used to move goods, founder and CEO Pushp said in an interview.\nTypically, electric two-wheelers are used in India to deliver payloads weighing under 3 kilograms, Pushp told TechCrunch, even though the vehicles themselves weigh around 150 kilograms (331 pounds) and cost about ₹2 (about $0.02) per kilometer in energy. Airbound aims to cut that cost down to as low as 10 paise (around $0.001) by using its drone, called the TRT, which is built specifically for small payloads and removes the need for a human driver — reducing total transport weight by roughly 30 times. That, Pushp said, translates into a 20-fold drop in energy cost per kilometer, making one-cent drone delivery a feasible end state.\n“There is actually an incredible amount of gaps between where drones are today and where they can be,” the founder said. “You need four kilograms of drone to lift one kilogram of payload, which is insane to me. Range is a broken metric. There’s no concept of aerodynamic efficiency with drones “[right now].”\nThe aircraft’s rocket-like, blended-wing design eliminates the need for additional propellers and heavy moving parts, improving aerodynamic efficiency over conventional quadcopters. By avoiding propellers that disrupt airflow over the wing, the drone maintains a higher lift-to-drag ratio, reducing the amount of thrust needed to stay aloft and making forward flight significantly more energy-efficient, the founder told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe first version of Airbound’s drone weighs 3.3 pounds and carries a payload of up to 2.2 pounds, and the startup also aims for its second version to support a 6.6-pound payload while weighing just 2.6 pounds itself.\nA prototype of the second version is expected to be ready and flying by mid-next year, with production targeted for the first quarter of 2027, Pushp said.\n“When you get into the world of autonomy, logistics is just a physics problem. It’s a game of efficiency and weight. And so if you have a lower weight than anyone else and a higher efficiency than others, you win,” Pushp said.\nHe began working on Airbound during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, inspired by a video of Zipline, the on-demand drone delivery company. He submitted an early prototype — made from 2D slices held together with toothpicks and tape, then sanded to resemble a fiberglass body — to a hackathon, where it earned a $500 grant. That experience prompted him to apply to Y Combinator, though he was not accepted. Instead, he received a $1,000 grant from the 1517 Fund in 2021, followed by a $25,000 check from Grad Capital and a $12,000 grant from Emergent Ventures.\nAt 17, Pushp received a term sheet from Lightspeed, but waited until after his 18th birthday to sign it. “That was the first legally binding document that I signed,” he recalled.\nThe aircraft packs lithium-ion batteries — instead of a commonly used lithium-polymer battery pack. Lithium ion batteries typically have a cycle life of 500 to 800 cycles, whereas lithium polymer lasts for around 100–200 cycles, Pushp said.\n“The biggest cost of operating these drones ends up being their battery replacement costs,” he said.\nThe drone costs Airbound $2,000 to make and ₹24 (around $0.27) per delivery. The startup aims to cut the delivery cost to below ₹5 (roughly $0.05) by the end of 2026. It also projects reaching a million deliveries per day by the middle of 2027, and to achieve that, it plans to increase its manufacturing capacity to over 100 drones a day. This is up from the startup’s current one-drone-per-day production rate at its Bengaluru facility.\nAirbound has started its first pilot program with Bengaluru’s Narayana Health through which it will deliver medical logistics for three months, aiming to complete ten deliveries a day of medical tests, blood samples, and other critical supplies.\nHowever, Airbound also targets other sectors including quick commerce, food deliveries, and “a few other smaller areas of last-mile” delivery, the founder told TechCrunch.\nAirbound also plans to go beyond India after scaling to one million deliveries per day and enter the U.S. in three years. Meanwhile, the startup is also in talks with regulators including India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation to start its flights soon.\nTo date, Airbound has raised over $10 million in total funding, and it has a team of 50 people.\nThe latest round will help scale its manufacturing capabilities and expand operations. The pilot program will also help improve its service and reduce costs to better prepare for broader market adoption in 2026, the startup said.\n",

    "body": "\nSalesforce announced Monday the latest version of its AI agent platform as the company looks to lure enterprises to its AI software in an increasingly crowded market.\nThe customer relations manager giant unveiled the new platform, branded Agentforce 360, ahead of its annual Dreamforce customer conference that kicks off October 14. This newer version of Agentforce includes new ways to instruct AI agents through text, a new platform to build and deploy agents, and new infrastructure for messaging app Slack, among others.\nA notable aspect of Agentforce 360 is its new AI agent prompting tool, called Agent Script, which will be released in beta in November. Agent Script gives users the ability to program their AI agents to be more flexible and better respond to “if/then” situations. This allows AI agents to be programmed to be more predictable in less rigid situations like customer questions.\nUsers can tap into “reasoning” models, which claim to think before responding as opposed to responding based on patterns. Anthropic, OpenAI and Google Gemini power these “reasoning” agents.\nSalesforce also announced it is releasing a new agent building tool, Agentforce Builder, which allows users to build, test and deploy AI agents from a singular spot. This tool, which will be released in beta in November, includes Agentforce Vibes, an enterprise-grade app vibe coding tool that Salesforce announced earlier this month.\nThe company also announced a broader integration between Agentforce and Slack. Salesforce said its core apps, including Agenforce Sales, IT and HR, among others, will surface directly in Slack starting this month and expand through the beginning of 2026.\nSlack is piloting a new version of its Slackbot chatbot that is meant to be more of a personalized AI agent that learns about its user and will offer insights and suggestions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSalesforce wants Slack to serve as an enterprise search tool in the future too and plans to launch connectors with platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Dropbox in early 2026.\nThis latest update from Salesforce comes at an interesting time for the enterprise AI market. Companies continue to release AI features aimed at their enterprise customers while enterprises struggle to see a return on investment for these tools.\nLast week Google announced Gemini Enterprise, a suite of tools — many of which were already available — for building enterprise-grade AI agents, that counts Figma, Klarna and Virgin Voyages as early customers, among others.\nAnthropic also started to show traction for its enterprise product, Claude Enterprise. The company announced it struck a deal with consulting giant Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to Deloitte’s 500,000 global employees — its largest enterprise deal yet. Anthropic announced a strategic partnership with IBM the next day.\nSalesforce touts that Agentforce has 12,000 customers — significantly higher than any of its competitors, according to its Agentforce press release. Early pilot customers of its Agentforce 360 upgrades include Lennar, Adecco, and Pearson. \nThis is all despite a recent MIT study found that 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before they reach production as companies still struggle to justify spending money on these AI tools.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nIn the latest bid by a Silicon Valley defense firm to assert its own solution for the Army’s mixed-reality ambitions, Anduril Industries on Monday unveiled “EagleEye,” a helmeted computing system that seeks to turn soldiers into AI-augmented warfighters. \nThe launch is notable given that the initiative is led by Anduri’s co-founder Palmer Luckey, who previously started the pioneering VR company, Oculus, which was acquired by Meta.\nAnduril describes EagleEye as a modular “family of systems” built atop its Lattice software that puts command-and-control tools, sensor feeds, and AI directly into a soldier’s field of vision.\nThe company claims the system can integrate live video feeds; features rear- and side-sensors to alert operators to threats; and can track teammates in real-time. EagleEye variations include a helmet, visor and glasses.\nThe launch comes as the U.S. Army looks to expand its pool of mixed-reality gear suppliers. It had been using Microsoft’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), a $22 billion program awarded in 2018, but after years of issues, the Army handed control of the contract to Anduril this February.\nThen in September, Anduril won a $159 million award to prototype a new mixed-reality system for soldiers, part of a broader Soldier Borne Mission Command effort. Anduril said the award was “the largest effort of its kind” to outfit “every soldier with superhuman perception and decision-making capabilities.”\nEarlier this year, Anduril also announced a partnership with Meta to develop extended reality (XR) devices for the military, marking an unexpected reunion between Luckey and his former employer.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“I am glad to be working with Meta once again,” Luckey said in a blog post. “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.”\nEagleEye has a long history: the concept first appeared in Anduril’s first pitch deck draft, before investors convinced the startup’s team to focus on software like Lattice. \n“Going toe-to-toe with Microsoft and Magic Leap would have been demoralizing windmill-tilting driven by magical thinking,” Luckey said in a post on X in February. “Everything is different now. The world is ready, and so is Anduril.”\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApart from antivirus apps, the cybersecurity industry has traditionally been business to business, with regular internet users left on their own to protect themselves. And older people, who did not grow up with the internet and smartphones, are perhaps the most vulnerable. \nZoraSafe, a startup founded by sisters Catherine Karow and Ellie King Karow wants to step in and help them out. Their idea is to create an app that not only protects older people against scammers and hackers, but also teaches them how to stay safe through gamified microlearning, as Catherine and Ellie told TechCrunch ahead of the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, where ZoraSafe will be part of Startup Battlefield.\nThe app is not out yet, but Catherine and Ellie expect to launch it in a month. They said it will cost $12.99 a month for individual subscribers, and a higher rate for family and group plans.\nThe first version of the app, Catherine explained in a phone call, will have several features, such as a mode to scan QR codes for malware or phishing, the ability to send suspicious SMS text messages and emails to ZoraSafe to get them checked out, and a feature to share a known scam or threat with the app so it can be added to a database to help other users.\n“We’re trying to incentivize social sharing of scams, so we can also alert the entire Zora network at once, so one person is alerted by that scam, and then we can make sure everyone in that community is protected immediately,” Catherine said.\nFuture releases will also include a feature that will allow users to get ZoraSafe to join a suspicious phone call, so the company’s AI system can detect if it’s a scam or a deepfake call. In that case, however, the app will not be listening to or recording the calls, according to Catherine.  \nOnce the app detects a threat, it will spin up a chat that will explain to the user what that threat was and teach them how to spot and deal with similar situations in the future, Ellie said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The whole purpose of which is to build resilience and hopefully make it so that even if you’re not directly interacting with the app, you’re a little bit more aware when you are interacting online,” she added. \nEllie said that the AI engine is designed with privacy in mind, doing 85% of the processing on the device, and only 15% in the cloud, which she claimed will be “sanitized of your personal information before it leaves your device.” \nCatherine also said they are planning to make an “NFC sticker” that will be incorporated in phone cases so that users can quickly pull up the app if they get a deepfake call, or even if they fall and need to alert their caretakers. That’s one of the ways they plan on getting around iOS’s restrictions on apps monitoring what happens on other apps. Another way is to have a “Share to ZoraSafe” option in the iOS menu that will allow users to send text messages or emails to the company’s systems.  \nEventually, the sisters said they want to expand ZoraSafe to children, too, partner with schools, and also launch the app in different languages, starting with Spanish.  \nIf you want to learn more about ZoraSafe — while also checking out dozens of other companies, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29, in San Francisco. Learn more here.  \n\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

Its existing investors include Andreessen Horowitz, among others.\nThe round, which was Fal’s third fundraise this year, valued the company at $4.5 billion, about three times what the company was worth when it raised its $125 million Series C in July, Bloomberg reported.\nTechCrunch reported in October that Fal raised a new round from investors, including Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins at a valuation of over $4 billion. We also reported at the time that the raise was around $250 million, according to our sources. This higher amount reflects the $140 million capital raised from the company and a secondary sale where existing investors sold shares, people familiar with the deal tell TechCrunch.\nFal provides the infrastructure layer for multimodal AI for customers, including Adobe, Shopify, Canva, and Quora. Founded in 2021 by Burkay Gur (a former Coinbase machine learning leader) and Gorkem Yurtseven (an ex-Amazon developer), the company has already surpassed $200 million in revenue as of October, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLatest in Startups\n",

The funding is a first installment toward the goal of up to $1 billion for the round, Rao told Bloomberg.\nTechCrunch was first to report, back in October, that Unconventional AI was seeking this mega funding for Rao’s new startup, although the final valuation is marginally lower than the $5 billion sources told us he was seeking. If he does eventually raise as much as $1 billion, we’ll see how that impacts his company’s value.\nUnconventional AI is set on building a new, energy-efficient computer for AI. Rao previously wrote on X that his goal is to create a computer that is “as efficient as biology.”\nDatabricks acquired Rao’s previous startup, MosaicML in 2023, for $1.3 billion. Prior to MosaicML, Rao co-founded the machine learning platform Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for reportedly more than $400 million. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

Subscribers can give access to up to family members, too.\nBefore this, Google’s cheapest AI subscription available in the country was AI Pro, which was priced at ₹1,950 per month ($21.69).\nBut Google is late to customize its pricing for India, as the AI Plus plan was first introduced in Indonesia in September, and offered it in other countries that very month. OpenAI debuted its sub-$5, ChatGPT Go plan in India in August and made it available in other countries in subsequent months. The plan allows users to have 10 times more limits than the free plan for messages, image generation, and file uploads. \nAI companies have been busy offering freebies in India as they seek to tap its huge population for users. First, Perplexity partnered with telco Airtel to offer its Pro plan for a year to all Airtel customers for free. OpenAI also offered ChatGPT Go free for a year to existing subscribers of Go and new users. \nMeanwhile, Google teamed up with telco Reliance Jio to offer its AI Pro plan for 18 months at no cost to users on a certain carrier plan.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Figma\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6:00 AM PST · December 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nDesign tool Figma launched new AI-powered image editing features today, including the ability to remove and isolate objects and expand images.\nThe company said that these features will save the hassle of exporting images to other tools for editing and importing them back. It added that generation models like Nano Banana are good for creating images, but users often need granular tools for editing that work without any text prompts. \nFigma has improved its lasso tool for selection. Now you can use it to select an object, remove it, or isolate it to move it around. When you move around the object, the image still retains other characteristics, such as background and color. Users can also select an object to adjust factors like lighting, shadow, color, or focus.\nThe company is also bringing an image expansion feature to its design suite. This feature is handy when you are adjusting a creative for a particular format and need to fill in the background or other details. For instance, creating a web banner or mobile banner from a 1×1 image. It essentially saves you from constantly cropping an image and adjusting elements within it. \nImage Credits: Figma\nBesides adding these features, Figma is collating all its image editing tools in one toolbar for easier access. You can select objects or parts of images, change background color, and add annotations or text using this toolbar. The company said removing background is one of the most common actions on the platform, and that is why it is getting a prominent spot on the new toolbar. \nRivals like Adobe and Canva have had object removal for a few years now. Figma is finally catching up to offer these features. \nThe company said the new image editing features are available on Figma Design and Draw, with plans to make them available across Figma tools next year. \nFigma’s launch comes on the same day as Adobe making some of these features available to users within ChatGPT. Figma was one of the launch partners of the app, calling on ChatGPT in October. It is not clear if these new functions will be available to users using Figma within OpenAI’s tool. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon announced on Wednesday that customers in over 2,300 cities and towns in the U.S. can now get fresh groceries through its Same-Day Delivery service. The e-commerce giant says it will expand the service to additional cities in 2026. \nAmazon first launched the ability to order perishable items via Same-Day Delivery in August, a move that was seen as a way for the company to compete more directly with Instacart and Walmart+ in the quick-commerce space.\nSince launch, customers have ordered fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, seafood, baked goods, and frozen foods alongside electronics, books, pantry staples and snacks, and everyday household essentials like paper towels and toothpaste.\nAmazon says its “specialized temperature-controlled fulfillment network” ensures that shoppers receive perishable groceries intact, and that orders undergo a six-point quality check upon arrival and before leaving for delivery. Plus, temperature-sensitive products are delivered in insulated bags.\nFresh groceries now make up nine of the top ten most-ordered items for fast delivery, Amazon says. \nThe top bestsellers for Same-Day Delivery are bananas, Haas avocados, strawberries, honeycrisp apples, limes, blueberries, blackberries, organic bananas, navel oranges, and bathroom tissues.\nThe company also notes that perishable grocery sales have grown 30 times since January, and that customers who add fresh groceries to their Same-Day Delivery orders shop about twice as often as those who don’t.\nSame-day delivery is free for orders worth more than $25 for Prime members. If an order doesn’t meet the minimum amount, subscribers can still choose same-day delivery for a $2.99 fee. For customers without a Prime membership, the service is available with a $12.99 fee, regardless of the order size.\nAmazon says it has grown its perishable selection available for Same-Day Delivery by over 30% since August, and has included thousands of popular items from Whole Foods Market.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nInstagram is introducing a new tool that lets you see and control your algorithm, starting with Reels, the company announced on Wednesday. The new tool, called “Your Algorithm,” lets you view the topics that shape your Reels recommendations and customize them to better fit your interests.\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you’ll see an icon in the upper right corner that looks like two lines with hearts. Tapping on that will open “Your Algorithm.” You will then see what topics Instagram thinks you care about the most. Instagram says your list of interests is determined by your activity and summarized by AI.\nFor example, you might see a description that reads: “Lately you’ve been into creativity, sports hype, fitness motivation, and skateboarding.” You can choose to share this description to your Story, so your followers can see what you’re into, kind of like you do with your Spotify Wrapped results.\nImage Credits:Instagram\nUnderneath the summary, you will see the list of topics that Instagram thinks you’re interested in. You can select which topics you want to see more or less of, and your recommendations will adapt accordingly. Plus, if you’re interested in a topic that isn’t listed, you can type it in to add it to your list of interests. \nThe move follows TikTok’s rollout of its “Manage Topics” feature last year, which allows users to take greater control over what they see on their For You feed. Similar to Instagram’s new feature, TikTok lets you tailor your feed to show more or less of certain topics.\nImage Credits:Instagram\nHowever, unlike TikTok, which only displays around a dozen generic topic categories, Instagram’s list is personalized to you and lets you add additional topics. \nThe new Instagram tool is available starting Wednesday in the U.S. and will roll out globally in English soon. \nIn the future, people will be able to use the Your Algorithm tool to personalize their Explore feed, Instagram says. The company plans to bring the tool to more places in the app as well.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon said on Wednesday it will invest an additional $35 billion in India by 2030, taking its total planned commitment in the country to about $75 billion as it expands its retail and cloud operations in the South Asian nation.\nThe e-commerce giant said the new investment will support its efforts to digitize small businesses and strengthen its logistics and operations footprint in India. The company said it aims to enable AI access for up to 15 million small businesses and generate 1 million direct, indirect, induced and seasonal jobs by 2030.\nCiting an Economic Impact Report by Keystone Strategy, Amazon said it has invested nearly $40 billion in India to date. In 2023, Amazon said it would invest $15 billion in the country by 2030 — of that, $12.7 billion was earmarked for its cloud business through Amazon Web Services. \nAmazon’s new plan comes just a day after Microsoft said it would invest $17.5 billion in India by 2029. And in October, Google said it would spend $15 billion to build an AI hub and data center infrastructure in the country.\nIndia is an important market for Big Tech, drawn by its huge populace, which features more than a billion internet users and hundreds of millions of smartphone users. The country has also attracted interest from AI firms such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity, as a large share of the population comes online for the first time, and a growing developer base accelerates the adoption of GenAI applications.\n“One of the things that I look for is what’s happening here,” said Russell Grandinetti, senior VP of international stores at Amazon, at the company’s annual small business-focused Smbhav event in New Delhi. “That’s inevitably going to become part of how we run our business around the world.”\nAmazon faces strong competition in India from Walmart-backed Flipkart, Meesho, and quick-commerce firms such as Swiggy’s Instamart, Zomato’s Blinkit and Zepto, which are expanding fast and targeting the same urban consumer base. However, with its immense logistics network and more than 1.7 million sellers, the company does enjoy scale advantages in the market.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“India continues to be Amazon’s one of the largest long-term opportunities,” said Amit Aggarwal, senior VP of emerging markets at Amazon.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAdobe is doubling down on its strategy of using AI to bring more users into its product ecosystem. The company on Wednesday said it is adding features from Photoshop, Express and Acrobat to ChatGPT, letting users ask the chatbot to use these apps to edit images, modify PDFs, or animate elements.\nSo users can now tell ChatGPT to use Photoshop to edit specific parts of images; remove or blur the background; adjust exposure, brightness, and contrast; or apply various effects. The chatbot will also give you an option to modify the intensity of effects using sliders. \nWith support for Express, ChatGPT now lets users tell it to do stuff like fetch existing designs from its library, put together themed creatives, animate elements, and edit designs.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nAnd with Acrobat’s PDF editing capabilities, ChatGPT can do things like merge files, edit or extract text or tables within a file, and do more.\nIf at any point you don’t feel like struggling with ChatGPT, you get an option to continue working inside Adobe’s apps to finish the job yourself or use features that are not available within ChatGPT.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nAdobe said these features will be available globally. While features from all three Adobe apps are available on ChatGPT’s desktop, web and iOS apps, only Adobe Express is currently supported on ChatGPT for Android. The company says support for Photoshop and Express is coming soon.\nAdobe has shipped many AI-powered features and products this year. In October, the company released AI assistants for Express and Photoshop, and also teased a cross-app assistant, dubbed Project Moonlight. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s unclear if Open AI and Adobe have a revenue-sharing arrangement, or\nOpenAI started supporting third-party apps inside ChatGPT in October, launching with Canva, Spotify, Expedia and Figma. But as more companies work to bake in their apps within the popular chatbot, the challenge for companies will be getting people to use their app instead of a rival’s inside ChatGPT. For instance, you can use both Canva and Photoshop to edit images with the chatbot, but if you don’t use either of these apps, you might not have a preference.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nUnacademy, once one of India’s best-known edtech startups, may now be worth less than $500 million, 85% less than its pandemic-era peak valuation, as the company undergoes a steep reset and explores merger and acquisition options.\nIn a detailed note posted on X on Wednesday marking the startup’s 10th anniversary, Unacademy’s CEO Gaurav Munjal said the startup’s valuation has fallen sharply from its $3.5 billion peak three years ago to less than $500 million today. He also confirmed the startup is in M&A talks.\nIndia’s edtech landscape has fractured since the pandemic, when the sector saw a rare moment of opportunity during the lockdowns. Startups like Unacademy and Byju’s raised billions, hired freely, and invested heavily in sales and marketing to draw customers, but growth stalled after the lockdowns eased and students went back to offline classes.\nByju’s, India’s most valuable startup just three years ago, has seen its valuation written down to effectively zero, and it entered insolvency proceedings in September last year. In November, a U.S. bankruptcy court ordered its founder Byju Raveendran to pay more than $1.07 billion for ignoring court directives, and providing “evasive, incomplete” responses related to the transfer of $533 million by the startup’s U.S. unit that it never recovered.\nMeanwhile, Physics Wallah, long considered the underdog, has turned profitable and continued to expand, and last month had a strong public-market debut. \nIn his note, Unacademy’s Munjal saw the last three years were marked by shrinking demand, intensifying competition, and internal turmoil as the startup suffered losses and abandoned aggressive expansion plans.\n“Personally, for us founders, this was the most difficult three years that we had ever seen in our lives because until 2021, we had not seen a single month of degrowth [sic],” he wrote. “But in the last three years, we saw losing market share in the game that we literally invented and it hurt.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMunjal believes the slump was driven by a rapid shift in market dynamics after the pandemic. As students moved back to offline classrooms and competitors launched lower-priced offerings modeled on Unacademy’s early strategy, the company saw demand decline and growth stagnate.\n“We got complacent,” he wrote, adding that the firm failed to innovate on price even as rivals undercut it.\nIn recent months, Munjal has devoted increasing attention to AirLearn, his new AI-first language learning app that imitates Duolingo’s gamified approach. That shift has created friction with some Unacademy investors, who felt the core edtech business was being left adrift during a difficult phase, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2015, Unacademy has raised about $854.3 million over 13 funding rounds, according to PitchBook, and counts SoftBank, Tiger Global, General Atlantic, and Peak XV Partners among its backers.\nMunjal said Unacademy has spent the past two years overhauling its operations, slashing its annual burn from ₹14 billion (around $155.7 million) in 2022 to less than ₹1.75 billion (approximately $19.5 million) this year. The startup has significantly reduced headcount through layoffs, cut marketing costs, and refocused on its core subscription business.\nRecent reports have suggested that rival UpGrad has discussed acquiring Unacademy for between $300 and $400 million.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPet wellness company Petco has taken a portion of its Vetco Clinics website offline after a security lapse exposed reams of customers’ personal information to the open web. \nAfter TechCrunch alerted the company to the exposed data relating to Vetco customers and their pets, Petco confirmed in a statement that it was investigating the data leak at its veterinary services company, and declined to comment further. \nThe security lapse allowed anyone on the internet to download customer records from Vetco’s website without needing a user’s login information. At least one customer record was exposed and indexed by Google, allowing anyone to find the data by searching for it.\nThe customer records, seen by TechCrunch, included visit summaries, medical histories, and prescription and vaccination records, among other files relating to Vetco customers and their pets. \nThe files also contained customer names; their home address, email address, and phone number; the location of the Vetco clinic where the services were performed; medical assessments, tests and diagnoses; and the costs of goods, names of veterinarians, consent forms, owner signatures, and dates of service.\nWe also found animal names, species and breed, their sex, age and date of birth, their microchip number (if registered), their medical vitals, and prescription records in the files.\nTechCrunch alerted Petco to the security lapse on Friday after discovering the vulnerability. The company acknowledged the data exposure days later on the following Tuesday after TechCrunch followed-up by attaching several exposed customer files to our email.\nPetco spokesperson Ventura Olvera told TechCrunch late on Tuesday that the company has “implemented, and will continue to implement, additional measures to further strengthen the security of our systems,” though the company did not provide evidence for the claim.\nOlvera would not say if the company has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if any data was extracted from the company’s systems during the course of the data spill.\nHow TechCrunch found the data spill\nTechCrunch identified a vulnerability in how Vetco’s website generates copies of PDF documents for its customers.\nVetco’s customer portal, located at petpass.com, allows customers to log in and obtain veterinary records and other documents relating to their pet’s care. But TechCrunch found that the PDF generating page on Vetco’s website was public, and not protected with a password.\nAs such, it was possible for anyone on the internet to access sensitive customer files directly from Vetco’s servers by modifying the web address to input a customer’s unique identification number. Vetco customer numbers are sequential, which means one could access other customers’ data simply by changing a customer number by one or two digits. \nTechCrunch checked at intervals of 100,000 customers to determine how many records may have been exposed in total. The sequential customer numbers suggest that millions of Petco customers’ information could have been retrieved.\nThe bug is classed as an insecure direct object reference (or IDOR), a common lapse in security practices  that allows unfettered access to files on a server because there aren’t proper checks in place to make sure the person accessing the data is permitted to.\nIt’s not clear how long these customer records have been left exposed, but the customer record listed on Google was dated mid-2020.\nThird Petco breach this year\nBy TechCrunch’s count, this is Petco’s third data breach in 2025.\nEarlier this year, hackers associated with the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters hacking collective allegedly stole reams of data from a database of customer information that Petco hosts with cloud giant Salesforce. The hackers demanded victim companies pay a ransom to not have their information leaked.\nIn September, Petco disclosed a second data breach involving a security issue that the company said it discovered on its own. Petco blamed the data leak on “a setting within one of our software applications that inadvertently allowed certain files to be accessible online,” but did not provide specific details of the incident. \nThat data breach included sensitive customer information, such as Social Security numbers, driver’s licenses, and financial information, including debit and credit card numbers.\nOlvera declined to say how many people are affected by the September incident, but California law requires companies to disclose data breaches publicly when the number of victims in the state crosses 500 people.\nTechCrunch believes this latest data leak involving Vetco is a separate security incident, given that Petco began notifying its customers of the previous data leak several months ago.\n",

For the U.S. market, OpenAI’s ChatGPT topped the ranks of free iPhone apps (not including games) with the most installs in 2025. \nThe AI app was followed by Threads, Google, TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail and then Google’s Gemini.\nChatGPT made it to No. 4 last year, but the top spot was taken by Chinese shopping app Temu. In 2023, the AI app didn’t make the top-ten list despite being released on the iPhone in May 2023 to a strong debut.\nThe fact that ChatGPT is outpacing social networking standbys, and much-needed utilities like Google Maps indicates how deeply AI has penetrated people’s everyday lives here in the U.S. It also demonstrates the potential for OpenAI to disrupt Google’s tight hold on the search market on mobile devices, as more people turn to a chatbot for answers first.\nThere were signs that ChatGPT was on its way to No. 1 earlier in the year — it became the most-downloaded app globally in March, outpacing other top apps like TikTok and Instagram.\nApple also released its list of the top paid apps, the top free and paid games for iPhone and iPad, as well as the top Apple Arcade games.\nBlock Blast! was the top free game this year, while Minecraft took the crown as the top paid game. On iPad, YouTube was the No. 1 free app, and users downloaded the creativity app Procreate as the top paid game on iPad.

    "body": "\nOboe, a learning startup from Anchor co-founders and former Spotify execs Nir Zicherman and Michael Mignano, said today it has raised $16 million in Series A funding led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Eniac, Haystack, Offline, and Factorial. The round also saw investments from individuals such as Adam D’Angelo, Garry Tan, Lenny Rachitsky, Mati Staniszewski, Mikey Shulman, Jared Hecht, and M.G. Siegler.\nThat platform, which officially launched in September, allows users to define a learning goal and use AI to create a course for them. \nThe startup’s fundraise comes three months after the app’s launch and a year after it raised a $4 million seed round. Zicherman said the reason behind the fresh round is to fuel growth at scale.\n“We want to reach billions of people who want to learn about new topics, and it is a very big opportunity,”  he told TechCrunch over a call. “We need to execute faster and reach a larger audience at scale to achieve this vision.” \n“We have a team of successful consumer product builders that can execute well, which gives us an edge over other startups in the market,” he added.\nBryan Kim, a partner at a16z, said that he was impressed by how fast Oboe started generating content on a topic and didn’t make users wait behind a loading indicator. \n“We have had a thesis around how AI-aided learning can help people explore new topics and have been looking for the right company. After Oboe launched, we tried it and loved the product. We wanted to back a founder who was ambitious, flexible in adopting different form factors, and understood AI to build a big platform. We found that in Oboe,” he told TechCrunch over a call.\nThe company is making changes to its core course generation experience, as well. Earlier, Oboe generated different text and audio formats for users in different styles. Plus, it capped course generation based on the payment plan.\nImage Credits: Oboe\nWith the new version, the app will first understand your goal and then generate chapters based on that to help you learn about those topics. What’s more, users will see other modalities like quizzes appear within the course material seamlessly. For some courses, Oboe will also generate flashcards for you to easily remember course materials.\nIn terms of audio, instead of having to choose between a podcast format and a lecture format, the company generates a podcast for you and changes its tone based on the learning material and other signals from users. \nImage Credits: Oboe\nZicherman said that the company observed that there is a high demand among users to learn about STEM topics (Science, Technology, Engineering, and  Maths). The startup has worked on sourcing the best material for these topics, including programming.\nHe said that good teachers decide what the best way of learning for students and the company is taking that approach of designing courses for learners. \nImage Credits: Oboe\nOboe is revamping its pricing model to give unlimited course generation to users. \nHowever, if they want to dive deeper into a topic, they can pay $15 a month ($144 per year) to access more course chapters. There is also a $40 per month ($384 per year) Pro plan, which gives unlimited chapter access and allows users to export or download courses for consumption outside Oboe. The startup said this is suitable for students who want to take printouts of the study material and consume it offline.\nZicherman said that right now Oboe is offering courses in English, but it wants to reach different parts of the world better with localized courses and language support. The platform is currently available on the web, with mobile support planned for the future. \nIn the last few years, multiple tools, including Google’s NotebookLM and ex-Google employees’ Huxe, allow you to enter a prompt to get a podcast episode to explore a topic. While these are one-off generations, Oboe’s approach is to let you dive deeper into the topic with chapter-based learning.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA new helper has arrived at the North Pole in recent years: AI.\nTavus, the AI startup that creates digital replicas using voice and face cloning technology, has launched its AI Santa experience for the second year in a row. This allows parents and children to video chat with a virtual version of the jolly old Saint Nick.\nAfter signing up for a free account, users can interact with AI Santa via text, phone, or video chat. Users can tell AI Santa what they want for Christmas, share their holiday plans, and find out if they’re on the naughty or nice list. \nThis year, the company debuted an improved version of AI Santa, designed to be more expressive and emotionally aware. Santa is now a “Tavus PAL,” the company’s name for its real-time AI agents that are built to see, hear, respond, and appear human.\nAI Santa can now see users’ expressions and gestures and respond to them. It also remembers users’ conversations and interests, creating a more personalized experience. Notably, it now can take actions of its own, including searching the web for present ideas or even perform everyday tasks like drafting emails.\nImage Credits:Tavus\nDuring testing, the conversation with AI Santa was engaging for the most part. When we mentioned wanting a new PlayStation for Christmas, Santa followed up with questions about our favorite video games, showing knowledge of specific titles like Baldur’s Gate 3. It also smiled back when we did. (We didn’t like that part very much, but maybe others will.)\nUsers appear to be enjoying the improved experience so far. Founder and CEO Hassaan Raza said that many people are engaging with the platform frequently, spending hours chatting with AI Santa and often reaching their daily limits.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Last year’s AI Santa drew millions of hits, and we’re on pace to surpass that by a wide margin as Christmas approaches,” he noted.\nWhile this level of engagement marks a milestone for Tavus, it also raises questions about the impact of such interactions, especially for young children. Children may struggle to distinguish between AI and a real person. Spending hours in conversation with an AI has already been linked to negative effects in adults, making the potential effects on children who strongly believe in Santa a concern for some parents.\nDuring our testing, there were subtle cues that the AI Santa does yet appear fully human-like, such as long pauses and a flat voice. We also found that if a user were to question whether it’s real, the programmed response was: “I’m an AI Santa powered by Tavus’ magic and technology. I might not be the physical Santa, but I’ve got the spirit and the cheer.”\nStill, the experience launches amid growing concerns about AI’s effects on young users. There have been reports linking chatbot interactions to serious harm, including cases where chatbots were implicated in the suicide deaths of teenagers. Character.AI removed access to its chatbots for users under 18 in October. \nImage Credits:Tavus\nRaza emphasized that the AI Santa experience is designed for families to enjoy together, with safety measures in place to ensure appropriate interactions. Safety features, such as content filters, have been implemented to maintain family-friendly discussions. \nIn certain situations, conversations can be terminated, and users are directed to mental health resources if necessary. \n“The vast majority of interactions have been family-friendly and true to the Santa experience,” he said. \nAdditionally, when asked about data collection, Raza said the company “collects logs, session timestamps, metadata, and other information users choose to share during their chats. This data is used to provide and maintain a safe experience, and users can request data deletion at any point in time.”\n",

    "body": "\nMarket research is a $90 billion industry that helps brands figure out how to best present themselves to potential customers. But that market insight isn’t cheap, nor is it quick. Cashew Research wants to change that using AI.\nCalgary, Alberta-based Cashew uses AI to develop market research plans and surveys for brands based on what information they are looking for — like what their brand recognition is for a specific population or how a marketing tagline resonates with customers. Cashew then sends the survey to real people and uses AI to summarize and digest the findings.\nCashew was one of the 200 startups chosen for TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield competition in 2025 and won the Enterprise Stage pitch competition at TechCrunch Disrupt.\n“You can use an LLM to try to do deep research and get answers to your questions, or you could use a firm that’s going to be really expensive,” Addy Graves, co-founder and CEO of Cashew, told TechCrunch in describing the current market research industry. “Now there’s Cashew that exists in the middle. It creates custom, fresh data to answer your question instead of you just using an LLM that’s surfacing the same recycled pool of data that everybody’s finding on the internet.”\nGraves has more than a decade of market research experience. The original idea for Cashew was sparked by an issue she ran into frequently: Clients wanted full research projects — with real-world data from humans — done within a few days.\nFor years, shortening that timeline while still producing the same quality of research results wasn’t possible, Graves said, because the technology to speed up the process wasn’t ready yet.\n“That was definitely the aha moment,” Graves said. “And it wasn’t until the onset of AI that we were actually able to automate these processes that we use as researchers, best practices, these data science-backed methodologies, as well as the formatting of reports that we know that everybody wants.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBringing automation to the process also brings the cost down, which makes Cashew an option for small and medium-size brands that wouldn’t have been able to afford to work with a traditional market research firm, Graves added.\nGraves founded Cashew in 2023 alongside Rose Wong, chief operating officer, with an initial focus on consumer packaged goods, specifically food and beverage.\nGraves said she thinks Cashew can stand out in the increasingly crowded AI marketing tools category because it isn’t fully automated. Each Cashew client gets fresh human data with each project, which requires market research expertise, Graves said.\nCashew’s competitive advantage may only grow as the company matures. The company takes all of the real-world data it collects from its clients’ projects, anonymizes it, and puts it in a database, which can help add additional proprietary data to future research projects, too.\nThe company has raised C$1.5 million in pre-seed funding and is gearing up to launch its seed round in early 2026 with the hope of raising up to $5 million, Graves said. That capital will be put toward continuing to develop the product’s tech.\nGraves said the company’s two main areas of focus heading into next year are increasing the company’s presence in the U.S. and also working to build up its B2B business.\n“The people who are already buying research, that’s already a massive category, but that doesn’t even include all the people that could be buying research but just can’t afford it or can’t do it right now because they don’t have the timelines,” Graves said. “We’re actually creating this new category for marketers to gain access to answers to these questions that they’ve had.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nIt’s been quite the year for CoreWeave. In March, the AI cloud infrastructure provider went public in one of the biggest and most anticipated IPOs of the year that didn’t live up to its hype.\nAnother setback took place in October, when a planned acquisition of the cloud provider’s business partner, Core Scientific, faltered due to skepticism from the acquisition target’s shareholders. \nIn the meantime, the firm has acquired a number of different companies, its stock has gone up and down, and it’s been both criticized and lauded for its role in the booming AI data center market. \nIn an interview at the Fortune Brainstorm AI summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, CoreWeave’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Intrator, defended his company’s performance from critics, noting that it was in the midst of creating a “new business model” for how cloud computing can be built and run. Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way.  \n“I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before President Trump’s tariffs went into effect — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy. \n“We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added. \nCoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90. Its more wary critics have compared it to a meme stock due to its penchant for going up and down. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSome of the uncertainty around CoreWeave’s stock has been credited to the company’s hefty level of debt. Not long after CoreWeave announced a deal on Monday to issue even more debt to finance its data center buildout, its stock dropped some 8%.\nIntrator seems to see his company as a disruptor, one whose unconventional tactics may take some getting used to. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” he said during his appearance Tuesday. \nCoreWeave actually started its corporate life as a crypto miner but in short order built itself into a pivotal provider of “AI infrastructure” to some of the tech industry’s most major players. In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans.  \nAnother topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. “Circular” business deals, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have raised questions about the industry’s long-term economic stability. Perhaps not surprisingly, since Nvidia is one of its investors and its supplier of GPUs, Intrator swatted away such concerns. “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand,” he said. “You do that by working together.” Since the IPO, CoreWeave has continued to make efforts to expand its business. After it acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, it went on to acquire OpenPipe, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning. In October, it also made deals to acquire Marimo (the creator of an open source notebook) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently announced an expansion of its cloud partnership with OpenAI and said it has plans to move into the federal market, where it wants to provide cloud infrastructure to U.S. government agencies and the defense industrial base.\n",

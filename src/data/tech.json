The first model, nicknamed N50, will pair with an iPhone and not have its own display. Apple reportedly plans to unveil these smart glasses as soon as next year and release them in 2027. </p>\n<p>The second version of smart glasses that the company is working on include a display.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI has sold $6.6 billion in shares held by current and former employees, according to a new report from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-02/openai-completes-share-sale-at-record-500-billion-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>. The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said.</p>\n<p>The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/28/meta-reportedly-hires-four-more-researchers-from-openai/\">at least seven top engineers from OpenAI</a>, often luring them away with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/meta-is-offering-multimillion-dollar-pay-for-ai-researchers-but-not-100m-signing-bonuses/\">multimillion-dollar signing bonuses</a>.</p>\n<p>OpenAI’s most recent funding round came <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/openai-reportedly-raises-8-3b-at-300b-valuation/\">in August</a>, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz.</p>\n<p>The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\"> the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans</a>. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">invest $100 billion in OpenAI</a> as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership.</p>\n<p>The new sale comes just weeks after <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-reach-non-binding-deal-allow-openai-restructure-2025-09-11/\" target=\"_blank\">a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft</a>, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned.</p>\n<p>OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">releasing its latest Sora 2</a> video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

On <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">its first day</a>, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures.</p>\n<p>The firm estimates Sora’s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30th and October 1st.</p>\n<p>The day-one figure puts Sora’s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI’s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.</p>\n<p>Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even <em>more</em> installs if it were open to all users.</p>\n<p>Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openai-staff-grapples-with-the-companys-social-media-push/\">chagrin of some at OpenAI</a>, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who’s to say that humanity isn’t benefiting from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking</a>, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”)</p>\n<p>To compare Sora’s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps’ U.S. and Canadian downloads. That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/openai-launches-an-official-chatgpt-app-for-ios/\">limited itself to U.S. users</a> at the time, while Grok <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/xai-is-testing-a-standalone-ios-app-for-its-grok-chatbot/\">limited its iOS-only</a> release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/10/anthropics-claude-sees-tepid-reception-on-ios-compared-with-chatgpts-debut/\">its Claude app to iOS last year</a>. </p>\n<p>For more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively.

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://spacecoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Spacecoin</a> says it reached a new milestone in its quest to build a decentralized communications backbone that could one day rival SpaceX’s Starlink.</p>\n<p>The company said this week that it successfully transmitted secured data via its first demonstration satellite, validating the spacecraft’s ability to execute encrypted transactions in orbit.</p>\n<p>The blockchain transaction, beamed from Chile to Portugal, served as a proof-of-concept for moving cryptographic signatures and encrypted data through space.</p>\n<p>“Can we send cryptographic signatures to space intact? Without it, we cannot build a decentralized network of communications satellites and fulfill the vision of building permissionless connectivity,” Spacecoin founder Tae Oh <a href=\"https://x.com/taelimoh/status/1973370839656702279\" target=\"_blank\">said in a video posted on X</a>. “That was the main mission of CTC-0, that we launched December 2024 with SpaceX. And today, I’m glad to share that CTC-0 fulfilled its purpose.”</p>\n<p>CTC-0, a small satellite built by Endurosat and launched on a Falcon 9 rideshare in December 2024, is the first in a line of prototypes that Spacecoin plans to launch. The next three satellites, collectively called CTC-1, will be slightly larger, followed by even bigger spacecraft to boost performance.</p>\n<p>The test comes as Starlink continues to cement its lead in the satellite broadband space. With its vertically integrated launch business, SpaceX has put more than 8,000 satellites in orbit and has already signed on millions of global customers. A handful of competitors, including Amazon’s Kuiper, are also positioning themselves against the company.</p>\n<p>But unlike Starlink and other managed broadband networks, Spacecoin’s approach is based on “tokenized access” and decentralization. The company will launch “Starmesh,” an encrypted internet traffic network, that it says will “maintain internet freedom while allowing safe, untraceable browsing and access to decentralized web services.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Founded in 2022, Oh spun the venture out of Gluwa, a firm he founded that provides financial services to emerging markets. Spacecoin’s internet infrastructure would run on the Creditcoin blockchain, which would let customers pay internet fees and conduct other financial transactions.</p>\n<p>“Unlike terrestrial networks, which remain vulnerable to outages, censorship, and cost barriers, a decentralized satellite-based system can deliver internet access that is global, censorship-resistant, and independent of monopolies,” the company said in a statement.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

On Thursday, the company introduced Jules Tools, a command-line interface that brings Jules directly into the developer’s terminal. The CLI lets developers interact with the agent using commands, streamlining workflows by eliminating the need to switch between the web interface and GitHub. It allows them to stay within their environment while delegating coding tasks and validating results.</p>\n<p>“We want to reduce context switching for developers as much as possible,” said Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, in an interview.</p>\n<p>Google already offers Gemini CLI, an AI-based command-line tool that works across developer environments like terminals and CI/CD pipelines. Both Gemini CLI and Jules use Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model under the hood. However, Korevec told TechCrunch that Jules Tools is designed for “very scoped tasks,” while Gemini CLI requires users to be “a lot more iterative” and to “collaborate a lot more with the tool.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg 1582w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=768,446 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=680,395 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1200,696 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1280,743 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=430,250 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=720,418 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=900,522 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=800,464 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=668,388 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=646,375 646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=1063,617 1063w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=708,411 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-jules-tools.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Google’s Jules Tools</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Google’s senior developer advocate Denise Kwan also elaborated in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@denisetkwan/gemini-cli-or-jules-which-tool-is-for-you-20b7d857641d\" target=\"_blank\">Medium post</a> on how Jules differs from Gemini CLI. Jules is less interactive by design, she noted, and executes tasks independently once the user approves its plan.</p>\n<p>In addition to the CLI, Google has made Jules’ API public, which it had previously used for internal development. The purpose of this is also to help developers use Jules more often as they can extend the tool into their existing workflows where they have “a lot of muscle memory and familiarity,” Korevec said.</p>\n<p>Developers can also use the API to integrate Jules with their integrated development environment (IDE), a software application that helps make coding easier by providing a list of tools, such as VS Code.

For the last few weeks, the tool has also <a href=\"http://jules.google/docs/changelog/\" target=\"_blank\">added a list of other features</a>, including a stacked layout for the diff viewer, image upload, and the ability to read and respond to comments on pull requests.</p>\n<p>Now, another area Google is exploring with Jules is reducing its reliance on GitHub. Currently, the agent codes within a GitHub repository — requiring developers to either connect it to an existing repo or provide a blank one to work in.</p>\n<p>“Users want Jules to integrate with other code hosting providers,” said Korevec. “We are looking into how we can enable that with other version control systems. We are also looking into enabling it for people who don’t want a version control system, or they don’t care where their code is hosted.”</p>\n<p>Oversight of AI tools remains a challenge, especially when they are used in professional settings. Jules, however, is designed to notify the user if it gets stuck on a particular task, prompting them to step in and assist.</p>\n<p>“If something happens where it runs into an issue, or it runs into a situation where it can’t unstick itself, it will pause and ask me a question,” Korevec said.</p>\n<p>However, oversight becomes more difficult when users interact with Jules on mobile, as native notifications are not yet supported. Korevec noted that many users are already accessing Jules through its mobile web interface, and said Google is working to improve the mobile experience — particularly by exploring ways to offer native notifications.</p>\n<p>So far, Jules has primarily been used by software engineers and other professionals — unlike many vibe coding platforms that position themselves as go-to tools for non-coders. Still, some users are experimenting with Jules as a complement to more casual or creative coding environments.</p>\n<p>“We see a lot of people take that project that they have hit the limit in whatever vibe coding tool they’re using, and then bring that to Jules for further extending it,” Korevec told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/snippet/3009702/google-debuts-a-coding-ai-agent-called-jules/\" target=\"_blank\">Launched in public preview</a> in May, Jules <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/googles-ai-coding-agent-jules-is-now-out-of-beta/\" target=\"_blank\">exited beta</a> in August and is now available under structured pricing tiers. A free plan offers up to 15 individual daily tasks and three concurrent tasks.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The U.S. government shutdown could stifle deal flow, freeze visa processing for workers, and cause other problems for startups and the broader tech sector, especially if it lasts longer than a week, according to experts who spoke to TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>The U.S. government shutdown, which began Tuesday, is the first one in seven years. The unpredictability of the Trump administration coupled with a politically entrenched Congress makes it hard<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/government-shutdown-us-congress-10-01-25\" target=\"_blank\"> to predict when the shutdown </a>will end. Out of eight shutdowns since 1990, four <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/01/business/dealbook/markets-shutdown-costs.html\" target=\"_blank\">have happened during Trump</a> administrations; the last one lasted 35 days, the longest in modern history. </p>\n<p>TechCrunch spoke to investors, founders, and lawyers who warned about delayed deal flow and visa processing for workers. The visa process had already been upended when President Trump recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/startup-founders-say-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-is-a-talent-tariff-that-will-hurt-innovation/\">announced the application fee for an H-1B visa </a>would increase to $100,000 — a number that caused sticker shock within the industry. </p>\n<p>The main concern is a slowed-down immigration process for startups, since the Department of Labor — which provides first approval for H-1B visas and green cards — is shut down. The result, immigration attorney Sophie Alcorn said, is that the pipeline for hiring and renewing visas for high-skilled workers is completely frozen. </p>\n<p>“This creates significant uncertainty for a startup’s workforce, including founders who may be on visas themselves,” she told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>“Visa workers are hit hard in a shutdown because their status depends on government approvals,” Michael Scarpati, CEO and founder of the fintech RetireUS, added. “When processes like E-Verify or labor certifications stop, workers risk falling out of status, leaving their future in the U.S. uncertain and creating added disruption for the businesses that depend on them.” </p>\n<p>Thousands<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/h1b-visas-workers-charts-cb81493c\" target=\"_blank\"> of workers in tech are on visas,</a> many of them bringing partners and children with them.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“Many are understandably nervous about processing delays and how that affects their ability to stay and work,” Chris Chib, CEO of the strategy solutions company BlueFin Solves, told TechCrunch. “But just as these engineers help us persevere through complex challenges with ML algorithms and innovation, we owe them the same careful attention and commitment during this situation.”</p>\n<p>Startups may also be affected by delayed or stopped permitting processes and other regulatory requirements, which could drain precious funds and even lead to layoffs.</p>\n<p>Jenny Fielding, managing partner at Everywhere Ventures, said ongoing political uncertainty always worries her. Though past shutdowns have had little economic impact, this one could lead to layoffs if it lasts too long. </p>\n<p>“Since we invest in many regulated areas, the shutdown can potentially halt-slash-slow down essential government functions like FDA approvals or aerospace permits, which can be an existential threat to a startup whose entire business model depends on a single regulatory green light,” Fielding told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Fielding said the timing of the shutdown has, once again, been terrible for her and the firm. When Everywhere Ventures started fundraising in early spring, President Trump announced the tariffs that caused uncertainty and drove up costs for some companies.</p>\n<p>The firm held off on fundraising at the time because limited partners were nervous about investing given the uncertain climate. “And of course, we kicked off fundraising this week, so once again, terrible timing,” she said.</p>\n<p>As for Fielding’s startups, she said it’s hard to wait and see in this case. Founders always need to think about a Plan B, she said, especially because capital is finite. </p>\n<p>“If it’s a week shutdown, then that’s manageable,” she continued. “But when it becomes weeks, then it can get uncomfortable.”  </p>\n<p>Garima Kapoor co-founded the software company MinIO with her husband, AB, who came to the U.S. on an H-1B visa a little over a decade ago. She said startups should start preparing now, just in case the government shutdown is prolonged. </p>\n<p>“When government agencies slow down, deals in highly regulated industries like fintech, health tech, or M&A can grind to a halt. Even companies operating outside the federal sphere could face shrinking valuations and tougher deal terms as more uncertainty seeps into the market,” she told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Overall, founders should remain proactive, communicate transparently with partners and investors, and plan “prudently for slippage,” she said, noting that clarity and alignment will be key here. </p>\n<p>“Preparedness will separate those who weather the disruption from those who get caught flat-footed.” </p>\n<p>Chib echoed that sentiment. “Their resilience is part of what drives progress forward,” he said. ”To those facing these challenges, know this too shall pass. Persevere.” </p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Anthropic has a new chief technical officer, former Stripe CTO Rahul Patil. Patil started at the company earlier this week, taking over from co-founder Sam McCandlish, who will move to a new role as chief architect.</p>\n<p>As part of the change, Anthropic is updating the structure of its core technical group, bringing the company’s product-engineering team into closer contact with the infrastructure and inference teams. As CTO, Patil will oversee compute, infrastructure, inference, and a variety of other engineering tasks. In the chief architect role, McCandlish will work on pre-training and large-scale model training, extending much of his previous work. Both Patil and McCandlish will report to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei.</p>\n<p>This new leadership structure comes as Anthropic faces intense infrastructure competition from AI labs at OpenAI and Meta, which have invested billions into computing infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says\" target=\"_blank\">plans to spend $600 billion</a> on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028, and OpenAI has contracted a similar amount through its work with Oracle and the Stargate project. The scale of Anthropic’s own infrastructure spending is less clear, but there will be immense pressure to optimize the growing infrastructure for both speed and power consumption.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the popularity of Anthropic’s Claude products has already put the company’s infrastructure under significant strain. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/anthropic-unveils-new-rate-limits-to-curb-claude-code-power-users/\">In July</a>, the company introduced new rate limits to Claude Code, with an eye toward power users who had been running the app “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Under the new rules, users are limited to between 240 and 480 hours of Sonnet usage each week, and between 24 and 40 hours of Opus 4 usage, depending on infrastructure strain.</p>\n<p>With more than 20 years in different engineering roles, Patil brings significant infrastructure experience to Anthropic. He previously spent five years in technical roles at Stripe and served as a senior VP for cloud infrastructure at Oracle. He has also held engineering roles at Amazon and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Amodei emphasized Patil’s experience building stable infrastructure for enterprises. “Rahul brings a proven track record in building and scaling the kind of dependable infrastructure that businesses need,” the statement reads. “I couldn’t be more excited about what this means for strengthening Claude’s position as the leading intelligence platform for enterprises.”</p>\n<p>In a paired statement, Patil applauded Anthropic’s research and commitment to AI safety. “I’m thrilled to join Anthropic at this pivotal moment in AI development,” Patil said, adding that his work at the company “feels like the most important work I could be doing right now — I personally can’t think of a greater calling and responsibility.”</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The Department of Energy said Wednesday night it was canceling 321 awards worth $7.56 billion that were largely focused on clean energy. </p>\n<p>The agency hasn’t publicly released a list of the affected projects and, at the time of publication, it had not provided one to TechCrunch. According to E&E News and Heatmap, which have obtained the list, the majority of the cuts have hit states that went for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, though some were in “red” states that voted for President Trump.</p>\n<p>Direct air capture and hydrogen hub projects appear to have been wiped out as a result. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that one of the canceled projects included $1.2 billion for the state’s hydrogen hub, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, and E&E News is <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-cancellations-hit-hydrogen-air-capture-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\">reporting</a> that hubs in Texas and Louisiana were also on the chopping block.</p>\n<p>At least 10 direct air capture (DAC) projects totaling $47.3 million were cut, though those in Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, and North Dakota have survived. The oil and gas industry has been supportive of DAC projects because the captured CO<sub>2</sub> can be injected into underperforming oil wells to boost production.</p>\n<p>Other states affected by the billions in canceled contracts include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.</p>\n<p>The Harris-voting states with canceled projects were confirmed in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/russvought/status/1973450301236715838\">tweet</a> from Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He teased the cancellations earlier yesterday in an apparent effort to deepen partisanship during the shutdown, adding that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.” </p>\n<p>All 16 states that he listed voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, and many are controlled by Democrats at the state level. Conspicuously, Vought omitted Trump-voting states that were on the list.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The awards were originally granted by the office for Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy, Grid Deployment, and Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains.</p>\n<p>The Department of Energy said 26% of the awards were granted between Election Day and Inauguration Day in January; the president’s authority doesn’t end after Election Day, but runs until Inauguration Day. </p>\n<p>The awardees have 30 days to appeal the decision.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has made no secret that it wants to undermine any transition away from fossil fuels. Last week, the Department of Energy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/trumps-energy-department-forbids-staff-from-saying-climate-change-or-green/\">banned staffers from using certain words</a>, including “climate change” and “emissions.”</p>\n<p>In May, the agency canceled $3.7 billion worth of clean energy and manufacturing awards. Those cancellations spanned a broad list of industries, from metal manufacturing and cement companies to power plant operators and chemical plants run by fossil fuel giants.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration’s aggressive cancellations have prompted many awardees to sue the government to retain the awards. The Environmental Protection Agency, which was quick to cancel contracts worth $20 billion, has been an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/fbi-epa-and-treasury-told-citibank-to-freeze-funds-as-trump-administration-tries-to-claw-back-climate-money/\">early target</a> of legal action.

Because without tangible productivity gains, people might be less inclined to switch from their existing browsers.  </p>\n<p>For free users, Perplexity’s Comet browser experience is still limited to the sidecar assistant. All users can also access different tools like Discover (personalized news and content recommendations similar to OpenAI’s new Pulse); Spaces (to organize and manage different projects); Shopping (assists in comparing prices and finding deals across online retailers); Travel (offers aggregated information on travel destinations, flights, accommodation, etc.); Finance (tools for budgeting, tracking expenses, monitoring investments); and Sports (updates on scores, schedules, and news).  </p>\n<p>Max users get access to high-performing AI models and can access Perplexity’s email assistant, which promises to draft replies and write responses that match your tone; organize and prioritize your inbox; schedule meetings; and answer questions about your inbox.  </p>\n<p>Max users also get early access to Perplexity products and features, including a new “background assistant” that CEO Aravind Srinivas announced at an event Wednesday evening.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png 1282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=768,544 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=680,482 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=1200,850 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=1280,907 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=430,305 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=720,510 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=900,637 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=800,567 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=668,473 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=529,375 529w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=871,617 871w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=708,501 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PNG-image.png?resize=50,35 50w\" /><figcaption><span>Perplexity’s “background assistant” can perform multiple tasks at once</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Perplexity</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>A company spokesperson described the assistant as “a team of assistants working for you” that you can manage and track from a central dashboard like a “mission control.” </p>\n<p>The assistant performs multiple tasks on your computer in the background while you do other work or walk away to make a sandwich. In an example a spokesperson gave me, you could give the assistant a task to send an email, add the cheapest tickets to a concert to your cart, and find the best direct flight on a specific date and time. You can check the progress of the task completion in the dashboard and jump in to complete the tasks — like hitting send on the email, intervening, or taking over.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Rivian now expects to deliver no more than 43,500 electric vehicles by the end of 2025, which would represent a nearly 16% drop from last year’s sales.</p>\n<p>The company <a href=\"https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-releases-q3-2025-production-and-delivery-figures\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the new guidance for investors on Thursday alongside production and delivery figures for the third quarter of this year. Rivian saw deliveries jump to 13,201 vehicles, up from 10,661 and 8,640 in the second and first quarters, respectively. The company also built 10,720 EVs in the quarter.</p>\n<p>That’s a good recovery from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/rivian-starts-a-challenging-year-with-a-big-slip-in-deliveries/\" target=\"_blank\">a slow start to the year</a>. But the company has now all but confirmed that this year will see fewer Rivian vehicles delivered than in 2024 <em>and</em> in 2023, when it moved just over 50,000 electric vehicles.</p>\n<p>Rivian’s struggle to grow sales comes at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/06/rivian-r1-revamp-profit-survival-r2-suv/\" target=\"_blank\">a critical time for the company</a>. It’s in the midst of preparing to launch what is supposed to be its most affordable — and most popular — vehicle next year, the R2 SUV. The company expects to build and sell hundreds of thousands of these, and has poured capital into expanding its Normal, Illinois factory to build them. Rivian has also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/rivian-breaks-ground-on-5b-georgia-factory-ahead-of-construction-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\">broken ground on a brand new factory in Georgia</a> where it will build the R2 and its hatchback sibling, the R3.</p>\n<p>Rivian came into this year <a href=\"https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-releases-fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial-results\" target=\"_blank\">optimistic it could match 2024’s sales</a>, telling investors that it expected to deliver between 46,000 and 51,000 vehicles. Rivian sold 51,579 vehicles in 2024. </p>\n<p>But by May, as President Trump implemented sweeping and often-changing tariffs, the company lowered its estimate, saying it would deliver between 40,000 and 46,000. Rivian said, at the time, that the reason for the drop was the “evolving trade regulation, policies, tariffs and the overall impact these items may have on consumer sentiment and demand.”</p>\n<p>The company again “narrowed” that range on Thursday to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Electric vehicles are going through a challenging time in the U.S., especially as the Trump administration becomes increasingly hostile to electric vehicles and renewable energy. Major automakers are playing along. Most have delayed or outright canceled plans for new EVs, and they’ve also expressed support for the administration’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/tesla-asks-epa-not-to-roll-back-emissions-rules-as-trump-calls-climate-change-a-con-job/\" target=\"_blank\">attempt to roll back emissions regulations</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite all that, most of those same automakers saw a huge boost in EV sales during the third quarter of this year as customers rushed to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit. The credit’s demise was such a strong motivator that it helped Tesla <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/tesla-has-its-best-sales-quarter-of-2025-as-ev-tax-credit-expires/\" target=\"_blank\">deliver a record number of vehicles</a>.  </p>\n<p>Rivian may not have enjoyed the same credit phase-out shopping rush as other automakers since the company’s vehicles were only <a href=\"https://rivian.com/offers/7500-lease-credit\" target=\"_blank\">eligible for the subsidy if they were leased</a>.</p>\n<p>Still, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has expressed optimism about his company’s chances in a post-credit world. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u94GAmyWWg&t=1s\" target=\"_blank\">Speaking to InsideEVs in August</a>, Scaringe said he believes some automakers were skewing the market with money-losing EVs in order to reap regulatory credits they could sell to the competition. Without the federal subsidy, that game becomes a losing proposition, he said.</p>\n<p>“What I think will happen as we play out the rest of the 2020s, like through 2029, 2030, is you’re going to have sort of a vacuum of competition, and the pure-play EV-focused companies — Rivian, Tesla, there’s not very many — because they’re completely and fully focused on electrification, will have the advantage of a pretty thin competitive playing field,” he said.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Allan Brooks never set out to reinvent mathematics. But after weeks spent talking with ChatGPT, the 47-year-old Canadian came to believe he had discovered a new form of math powerful enough to take down the internet.</p>\n<p>Brooks — who had no history of mental illness or mathematical genius — spent 21 days in May spiraling deeper into the chatbot’s reassurances, a descent later detailed in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a>. His case illustrated how AI chatbots can venture down dangerous rabbit holes with users, leading them toward delusion or worse.</p>\n<p>That story caught the attention of Steven Adler, a former OpenAI safety researcher who left the company in late 2024 after nearly four years working to make its models less harmful. Intrigued and alarmed, Adler contacted Brooks and obtained the full transcript of his three-week breakdown — a document longer than all seven Harry Potter books combined.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Adler published an <a href=\"https://stevenadler.substack.com/p/practical-tips-for-reducing-chatbot\" target=\"_blank\">independent analysis</a> of Brooks’ incident, raising questions about how OpenAI handles users in moments of crisis and offering some practical recommendations.</p>\n<p>“I’m really concerned by how OpenAI handled support here,” said Adler in an interview with TechCrunch. “It’s evidence there’s a long way to go.”</p>\n<p>Brooks’ story, and others like it, have forced OpenAI to come to terms with how ChatGPT supports fragile or mentally unstable users. </p>\n<p>For instance, this August, OpenAI was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\">sued by the parents</a> of a 16-year-old boy who confided his suicidal thoughts in ChatGPT before he took his life. In many of these cases, ChatGPT — specifically a version powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o model — encouraged and reinforced dangerous beliefs in users that it should have pushed back on. This is called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">sycophancy</a>, and it’s a growing problem in AI chatbots.</p>\n<p>In response, OpenAI has made <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/building-more-helpful-chatgpt-experiences-for-everyone/\" target=\"_blank\">several changes</a> to how ChatGPT handles users in emotional distress and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/openai-reorganizes-research-team-behind-chatgpts-personality/\">reorganized a key research team</a> in charge of model behavior. The company also released a new default model in ChatGPT, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/\">GPT-5,</a> that seems better at handling distressed users.</p>\n<p>Adler says there’s still much more work to do.</p>\n<p>He was especially concerned by the tail end of Brooks’ spiraling conversation with ChatGPT. At this point, Brooks came to his senses and realized that his mathematical discovery was a farce, despite GPT-4o’s insistence. He told ChatGPT that he needed to report the incident to OpenAI.</p>\n<p>After weeks of misleading Brooks, ChatGPT lied about its own capabilities. The chatbot claimed it would “escalate this conversation internally right now for review by OpenAI,” and then repeatedly reassured Brooks that it had flagged the issue to OpenAI’s safety teams.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png 1488w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=768,697 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=680,617 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=1200,1089 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=1280,1161 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=430,390 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=720,653 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=900,817 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=800,726 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=668,606 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=413,375 413w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=585,531 585w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.20.35AM.png?resize=50,45 50w\" /><figcaption><span>ChatGPT misleading brooks about its capabilities.</span><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Steven Adler</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Except, none of that was true. ChatGPT doesn’t have the ability to file incident reports with OpenAI, the company confirmed to Adler. Later on, Brooks tried to contact OpenAI’s support team directly — not through ChatGPT — and Brooks was met with several automated messages before he could get through to a person.</p>\n<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment made outside of normal work hours.</p>\n<p>Adler says AI companies need to do more to help users when they’re asking for help. That means ensuring AI chatbots can honestly answer questions about their capabilities and giving human support teams enough resources to address users properly.</p>\n<p>OpenAI recently <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-support-model/\" target=\"_blank\">shared</a> how it’s addressing support in ChatGPT, which involves AI at its core. The company says its vision is to “reimagine support as an AI operating model that continuously learns and improves.”</p>\n<p>But Adler also says there are ways to prevent ChatGPT’s delusional spirals before a user asks for help.</p>\n<p>In March, OpenAI and MIT Media Lab jointly developed a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/affective-use-study/\" target=\"_blank\">suite of classifiers</a> to study emotional well-being in ChatGPT and open sourced them. The organizations aimed to evaluate how AI models validate or confirm a user’s feelings, among other metrics. However, OpenAI called the collaboration a first step and didn’t commit to actually using the tools in practice.</p>\n<p>Adler retroactively applied some of OpenAI’s classifiers to some of Brooks’ conversations with ChatGPT and found that they repeatedly flagged ChatGPT for delusion-reinforcing behaviors.</p>\n<p>In one sample of 200 messages, Adler found that more than 85% of ChatGPT’s messages in Brooks’ conversation demonstrated “unwavering agreement” with the user. In the same sample, more than 90% of ChatGPT’s messages with Brooks “affirm the user’s uniqueness.” In this case, the messages agreed and reaffirmed that Brooks was a genius who could save the world.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png 1630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=1200,615 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=1280,656 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=430,221 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=720,369 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=900,462 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=800,410 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=1536,788 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=668,343 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=1203,617 1203w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=708,363 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-at-8.19.27AM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Steven Adler</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s unclear whether OpenAI was applying safety classifiers to ChatGPT’s conversations at the time of Brooks’ conversation, but it certainly seems like they would have flagged something like this. </p>\n<p>Adler suggests that OpenAI should use safety tools like this in practice today — and implement a way to scan the company’s products for at-risk users. He notes that OpenAI seems to be doing <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/building-more-helpful-chatgpt-experiences-for-everyone/\" target=\"_blank\">some version of this approach with GPT-5,</a> which contains a router to direct sensitive queries to safer AI models.</p>\n<p>The former OpenAI researcher suggests a number of other ways to prevent delusional spirals.</p>\n<p>He says companies should nudge their chatbot users to start new chats more frequently — OpenAI says it does this and claims its <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\" target=\"_blank\">guardrails are less effective</a> in longer conversations. Adler also suggests companies should use conceptual search — a way to use AI to search for concepts, rather than keywords — to identify safety violations across its users.</p>\n<p>OpenAI has taken significant steps toward addressing distressed users in ChatGPT since these concerning stories first emerged. The company claims GPT-5 has lower rates of sycophancy, but it remains unclear if users will still fall down delusional rabbit holes with GPT-5 or future models.</p>\n<p>Adler’s analysis also raises questions about how other AI chatbot providers will ensure their products are safe for distressed users. While OpenAI may put sufficient safeguards in place for ChatGPT, it seems unlikely that all companies will follow suit.</p>\n</div>",

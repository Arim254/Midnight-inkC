Two weeks later, the MPA sent Meta a cease-and-desist letter, asserting that Meta’s claim that content on teen Instagram accounts would follow PG-13 guidelines is “literally false and highly misleading.”\nThe company states that its movie-rating system can’t be compared to Meta’s content restrictions, which it says “appear to rely heavily on artificial intelligence.”\n“The MPA has worked for decades to earn the public’s trust in its rating system,” said the letter. “Any dissatisfaction with Meta’s automated classification will inevitably cause the public to question the integrity of the MPA’s rating system.”\nIn response to the letter, Meta stated that it hasn’t claimed its teen accounts were certified by the MPA or officially PG-13 rated. Additionally, the company says its content restrictions are “guided” by PG-13, rather than directly linked to the MPA. Meta also says its use of the term qualifies as fair use.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

Rappaport added that while a milestone, the deal still has a way to go before it officially closes.\nTechCrunch reached out to Wiz for more information regarding the timeline to close.\nGoogle initially approached Wiz in 2024 with an offer to buy the startup for $23 billion. Wiz walked away from that offer and Rappaport said, at the time, that he felt the business could grow to be a lot bigger than that.\nHe was right. Google and Wiz revived acquisition talks in the first few months of 2025, and Google announced it was buying Wiz for $32 billion in March.\nBloomberg initially reported that the deal was under antitrust review in June. The deal is expected to close in early 2026, according to Reuters.\n\n\tTopics\n",

I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations,” Isaacman — who is also a billionaire pilot and private astronaut — wrote in a post on X on Tuesday evening.\nEarlier Tuesday, before the re-nomination, Isaacman posted his vision for NASA on the platform. He decided to publish those plans after a draft version was circulated in Washington among those seeking to keep Duffy in charge of NASA. Isaacman said he suspected “political operators” were “causing the controversy” between himself and Duffy.\n",

    "body": "\nTinder is looking to AI to revitalize its dating app, which has now reported nine straight quarters of paying subscriber declines, as of the third quarter this year. The dating app maker, Match Group, told investors on Tuesday’s earnings call that Tinder is testing a feature called Chemistry that will get to know users through questions and, with permission, will access Camera Roll photos on users’ phones to learn more about their interests and personality.\nThe feature is already being piloted in New Zealand and Australia, and will be a “major pillar of Tinder’s upcoming 2026 product experience,” said Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff. \nMatch isn’t alone in requesting access to users’ private Camera Roll photos. Meta also launched a feature last month that asks to use its AI on photos on your phone that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.\nIn both cases, the benefits to the end user for permitting this kind of expanded access are negligible. \nIn Match’s case, the company says it will engage users with interactive questions and learn more about them using AI technology so it can recommend better, more compatible matches. Presumably, that would look something like this: if you had photos of yourself outside hiking or climbing, you might be matched with someone who shared the same outdoor hobbies. \nWhile the company experiments with Tinder, Match’s bottom line is taking a hit. \nIts fourth-quarter guidance includes a $14 million negative impact on Tinder’s direct revenue as a result of the product testing, Match said. This, alongside other dating industry trends, has pulled down Match’s Q4 guidance to land somewhere between $865 million and $875 million, while analysts were expecting $884.2 million. \nThe company is using AI in other areas, as well, including in an LLM-powered system where Tinder nudges users before they send potentially offensive messages, asking them, “Are you sure?” It also uses AI to help users pick their best photos. \nAI isn’t the only thing Tinder is trying to boost subscribers and engagement, however. The company has rolled out other features, like dating “modes,” double dates, facial verification, and redesigned profiles, which feature bio information on the first photo card and prompts integrated into the photo carousel. \nDespite the product changes, Tinder faces a tough market where some young people are leaning away from online dating in favor of more real-world experiences, while online daters in the U.S. may be spending less as their disposable income shrinks, as the country flirts with recession. \nMatch reported in Q3 that Tinder’s revenue declined 3% year-over-year, and it saw a 7% decline in paying users. \nOverall, Match’s revenue and earnings were largely in line with estimates, with revenue up 2% to $914.2 million, versus an expected $915 million, and EPS of 62 cents (profit of $160.8 million), versus an expected 63 cents.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney is calling Google’s proposal in its antitrust settlement with the Fortnite maker a “comprehensive solution” that “genuinely doubles down” on Android’s vision of being an open platform.\nThe companies on Tuesday reached a settlement that sees the search giant agreeing to Android app store reforms that include lowering fees and enabling more competition.\nUnder the new proposal, which still requires the judge’s approval, Google will allow Android app developers to point users to alternative payment mechanisms inside their apps and through external web links. It also caps the fees Google is able to charge developers at either 9% or 20%, depending on the type of transaction.\nIn a post on X, Sameer Samat, president of the Android Ecosystem at Google, wrote that the company’s proposed changes “focus on expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe.” If approved by the court, the deal would put an end to the antitrust litigation.\nSweeney praised the proposal, calling it “awesome,” and contrasted it with Apple’s model, which he said was focused on “blocking all competing stores and leaving payments as the only vector for competition.” \nApple has argued its policies are about protecting consumers and managing App Store security. That said, the iPhone maker recently reported record revenue for its Services business, which includes the App Store — the segment’s revenue rose 15% to $28.75 billion in the last quarter from a year earlier.\nEpic Games had sued both Google and Apple, accusing their respective app store ecosystems of being anti-competitive, and alleging the companies have too much control, charge excessive fees, and favor their own in-app payment systems. Apple largely won its case with Epic but had to modify its App Store rules to allow for alternative payment options. Google, however, lost its appeal in July after a jury found that the search giant had stifled competition and needed to make changes.\nAfter the win, Sweeney announced that the Epic Games Store for Android would be coming to the Google Play Store.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Users will now be able to access AI Mode, which allows users to ask complex questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic directly within Search, via a new dedicated shortcut button under the search bar when opening a “New Tab” page in Chrome. \nThe new shortcut for AI Mode in Chrome is launching in the U.S. starting Wednesday and will soon be coming to 160 new countries and other languages, including Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and more.\nBy making it easier to access AI Mode on mobile, Google likely hopes that people will use its service rather than navigate to competitors’ tools.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe launch of the new shortcut comes as Google recently expanded AI Mode globally, bringing the feature to 180 new countries. The tech giant also made the feature available in more languages, including Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese.\nGoogle first launched AI Mode in March to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. Since then, the tech giant has continuously updated the tool with added functionality. \nYesterday, Google launched new agentic capabilities in AI Mode to allow users to get help with booking event tickets and beauty and wellness appointments in AI Mode. Google first introduced agentic capabilities to AI Mode back in August, when it rolled out the ability for people use the feature to find restaurant reservations. \nAI Mode launched a Canvas feature in July that helps you build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel. It also now lets you use Google Lens to ask about what’s on your desktop screen.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, researchers at Microsoft released a new simulation environment designed to test AI agents, along with new research showing that current agentic models may be vulnerable to manipulation. Conducted in collaboration with Arizona State University, the research raises new questions about how well AI agents will perform when working unsupervised — and how quickly AI companies can make good on promises of an agentic future.\nThe simulation environment, dubbed the “Magentic Marketplace” by Microsoft, is built as a synthetic platform for experimenting on AI agent behavior. A typical experiment might involve a customer-agent trying to order dinner according to a user’s instructions, while agents representing various restaurants compete to win the order.\nThe team’s initial experiments included 100 separate customer-side agents interacting with 300 business-side agents. Because the source code for the marketplace is open source, it should be straightforward for other groups to adopt the code to run new experiments or reproduce findings.\nEce Kamar, managing director of Microsoft Research’s AI Frontiers Lab, says this kind of research will be critical to understanding the capabilities of AI agents. “There is really a question about how the world is going to change by having these agents collaborating and talking to each other and negotiating,” said Kamar. “We want to understand these things deeply.”\nThe initial research looked at a mix of leading models, including GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Gemini-2.5-Flash, and found some surprising weaknesses. In particular, the researchers found several techniques businesses could use to manipulate customer agents into buying their products. The researchers noticed a particular falloff in efficiency as a customer agent was given more options to choose from, overwhelming the attention space of the agent.\n“We want these agents to help us with processing a lot of options,” Kamar says. “And we are seeing that the current models are actually getting really overwhelmed by having too many options.”\nThe agents also ran into trouble when they were asked to collaborate toward a common goal, apparently unsure of which agent should play what role in the collaboration. Performance improved when the models were given more explicit instructions on how to collaborate, but the researchers still saw the models’ inherent capabilities as in need of improvement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We can instruct the models — like we can tell them, step by step,” Kamar said. “But if we are inherently testing their collaboration capabilities, I would expect these models to have these capabilities by default.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nOver the last year, Google has added multiple AI-powered features to Maps to improve discovery and enable users to ask questions about places. Now the company is upgrading the app with Gemini to let users ask its AI bot questions while driving, improve navigation, and perform more tasks.\nWhile driving, users can now ask Gemini to answer questions about places of interest on their route, return results about other topics (like sports or news), and even perform tasks like adding events to their calendar. \nYou can ask multiple questions in a conversation, too; for example, “Is there a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route, something within a couple of miles? … What’s parking like there?”\nDrivers can even report traffic incidents using Gemini, and Maps will proactively notify users of disruptions on the route ahead.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle is also adding a new feature to Maps that combines Gemini with Street View data to improve navigation instructions. So instead of telling you to turn right after, say, 500 feet, Maps will now mention a nearby landmark, like gas stations, restaurants, or famous buildings, and highlight them before you have to make the turn.\nThe company said that Gemini cross-references information about 250 million places with Street View images to identify important and visible landmarks for navigation.\nMaps is also getting the ability to answer questions about your surroundings by working together with Google Lens. So you can point the camera at places of interest, like restaurants and landmarks, and ask questions like, “What is this place and why is it popular?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle said the new Gemini navigation features will be rolled out to iOS and Android devices in the coming weeks and said support for Android Auto would be coming soon. Traffic alerts are rolling out in the U.S. for Android users first; Landmark navigation is currently only going to be available in the U.S. on both iOS and Android; and Lens with Gemini will be functional in the U.S. later this month.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Only, it’s a circle of profit that ensures the money eventually comes back to their own coffers.\nCase in point: SoftBank, which is investing tens of billions into OpenAI and committing dozens more to build AI data centers and infrastructure, just launched a joint venture with the ChatGPT maker in Japan that will localize and sell the AI company’s enterprise tech to companies in the country. And the first customer of this joint venture is going to be SoftBank itself.\nCalled SB OAI Japan, the joint venture will be owned 50-50 by SoftBank and OpenAI and will provide what the companies are calling “Crystal intelligence,” which is being defined as a “packaged enterprise AI solution” targeted at corporate management and operations in Japan.\n“Crystal intelligence is designed to help organizations enhance productivity and management efficiency through the adoption of advanced AI tools. The solution combines OpenAI’s enterprise offerings with localized implementation and support provided through SB OAI Japan,” SoftBank said in a statement.\nIt seems SoftBank is intent on fueling the AI hype cycle and the resultant revenues: The conglomerate said all its employees are “actively utilizing AI in their daily operations,” and that it has so far created 2.5 million custom ChatGPT instances for internal use.\nThe conglomerate said it would put the joint venture’s solutions to use throughout its various businesses, validate their effectiveness for product development and “business transformation,” and then pass on the insights and expertise it gains to other companies back through SB OAI Japan.\nThe joint venture comes as analysts raise concerns about the truckloads of cash being thrown at AI development and associated efforts, as well as the stratospheric valuations awarded to companies benefiting from it. The movement is being likened to the dot-com boom, when the widespread adoption of the internet resulted in a wave of venture capital and sky-high valuations, and similar booms over the past couple of decades where massive sums were spent on developing unproven business models without a clear sign of meaningful returns on investment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nCybersecurity is a massive sector, but startups in the category are more likely to be acquired than go public. Even Wiz, which for a time held the title of the fastest-growing startup, abandoned its IPO ambitions when it agreed to sell to Google earlier this year.\nIn the past few years, there have been scant few significant cybersecurity listings: SentinelOne IPO’d in 2021, Rubrik did so last year, and Netskope went public in September.\nArmis, a nine-year-old cybersecurity startup based out of San Francisco, intends to follow in these companies’ footsteps. The company said on Wednesday that it has raised a $435 million pre-IPO round led by Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives. CapitalG made a significant investment in the round, and new investor Evolution Equity Partners also participated. \nThe round values Armis at $6.1 billion, a meaningful jump from the $4.5 billion tender offer valuation the startup announced in August.\nArmis is hoping to launch its IPO in late 2026 or early 2027, its co-founder and CEO, Yevgeny Dibrov (pictured above, right), told TechCrunch.\nThe round comes in the wake of significant acquisition interest in the company. In September, Bloomberg reported that Armis had received seven offers, which included a potential $5 billion bid from private equity firm Thoma Bravo.\nBut this new funding is an indicator of how serious Armis is about an IPO, a move that Dibrov described as his “personal dream.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Dibrov, Armis has reached annual recurring revenue of $300 million and plans to take that figure to $500 million while becoming cash-flow positive before its IPO.\n The startup is already “behaving like a public company,” Dibrov said, adding that the company is ensuring it hits its quarterly financial targets.\nThe company provides security software for critical infrastructure to Fortune 500 companies, national governments, and state and local entities.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe University of Pennsylvania confirmed on Tuesday that a hacker stole university data as part of last week’s data breach, during which alumni and other affiliates received suspicious emails from official university email addresses.\n“We got hacked,” the message from the hackers read. “We love breaking federal laws like FERPA (all your data will be leaked),” the message added. “Please stop giving us money.”\nWhile Penn initially told TechCrunch that the email was “fraudulent,” the university has now confirmed the hacker’s claim that data was taken during the breach.\n“On October 31, Penn discovered that a select group of information systems related to Penn’s development and alumni activities had been compromised,” the university wrote in a statement, which was emailed to alumni and shared online. “Penn’s staff rapidly locked down the systems and prevented further unauthorized access; however, not before an offensive and fraudulent email was sent to our community and information was taken by the attacker.”\n(Disclosure: As an alumna and former employee of the university, the hackers sent the message to my personal email three times, each coming from different official @upenn.edu email addresses, including one from a senior Penn staff member.)\nA partially redacted email sent by hackers from a university of Pennsylvania email address.Image Credits:TechCrunch (Screenshot)\nThe university said that the breach occurred due to a social engineering attack, a hacking technique in which individuals are tricked into handing over sensitive information like log-in credentials, perhaps through phishing or a phone call.\nA Penn employee, who we are not naming, as they were not authorized to speak to the press, told TechCrunch that the university requires students, staff, and alumni to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their accounts as a security measure; however, the employee said that some high-ranking officials were granted exemptions to MFA requirements.\nTechCrunch asked Penn about these alleged MFA exceptions, and if the university could provide a percentage of MFA adoption among staff. Penn spokesperson Ron Ozio declined to comment to TechCrunch beyond Penn’s official data incident page.\nAs required by law, Penn said it will contact individuals whose personal information was accessed by hackers. The university has not said when these notifications will occur, how many people are affected, or what information was accessed.\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian reports that the alleged Penn hacker claimed to have taken documents relating to university donors, bank transaction receipts, and personally identifiable information. The hacker said they were financially motivated.\nEarlier this year, hackers breached Columbia University, accessing sensitive information about around 870,000 students and applicants, including their Social Security numbers and citizenship status.\nBoth the Penn and Columbia hacks appear motivated by discontent with affirmative action policies. In the email that the Penn hacker sent to the university community, the hacker wrote, “We hire and admit morons because we love legacies, donors, and unqualified affirmative action admits.” Meanwhile, the Columbia hacker told Bloomberg that they sought to access data from the university to investigate its affirmative action practices.\nIf you have more information about the Penn hack, you can contact Amanda Silberling securely on Signal at @amanda.100, or by email, from a non-work device.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nOn an earnings call on Tuesday, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready highlighted the promise of open source AI models in helping the company keep its costs down as it expands the use cases for visual AI.\nThe image pinboarding site, which often serves as consumers’ first step in their shopping journey, leverages AI technology to power a variety of features, including its personalized recommendations, a multimodal search experience that combines text and images, ad targeting, and, most recently, product discovery with the launch of its AI-powered Pinterest Assistant. \nHowever, investors wanted to know what Pinterest’s opportunity in agentic commerce — AI systems that can act autonomously on behalf of users — was given the rapidly changing AI landscape, and how that could impact its bottom line and growth potential.\nThat question has become more pressing. During the company’s third-quarter earnings announcement, it predicted a weaker holiday shopping season than expected, citing President Donald Trump’s tariffs and their negative impact on the home furnishings category. As a result, Pinterest’s fourth-quarter revenue is expected to come in between $1.31 billion and $1.34 billion, while analysts were estimating $1.34 billion, on average. The news sent the stock tumbling by more than 21% on Wednesday.\nDespite the near-term revenue concerns, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready pointed to ways the business could maximize its use of AI and LLMs (large language models), without dramatically increasing its costs. In addition to its own proprietary models that are already accounted for in its cost structure, Ready said the company tests leading off-the-shelf models against open-source options on a regular basis, and found the open-source models promising.\n“One of the really, really interesting things that we’re seeing is that we are just getting tremendous performance from open source models specifically for Pinterest use cases on visual AI,” Ready told investors. “Given current market rates and per token costs, in early testing, we’re seeing orders of magnitude reduction in cost with comparable performance using fine-tuned open source models versus leading off-the-shelf proprietary models.” \nHe said the company planned to move forward with many open-source models for its various use cases, which would come at “a fraction of the cost” of the larger model providers.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We feel really good about the value that we’re bringing to the user there, our ability to align that with monetization, and our ability to control those costs and deliver that effectively,” said Ready.\nThe exec also touched on other areas where Pinterest is considering how to best use AI, including agentic shopping. Ready said that Pinterest already offers “push-button type buying” via its Amazon partnership, and it will wait to see if users actually want the AI to “push the button for them.”\nImage Credits:Pinterest\nIn the meantime, Ready suggested that Pinterest’s biggest differentiator is that it guides the user through the shopping experience — something it hopes to improve with Pinterest Assistant, an AI companion users can talk to, asking for advice and recommendations. The assistant understands the user based on their boards, collages, saves, and how they compare to people with similar tastes, the company says.\nPinterest is also rolling out personalized boards curated with AI, which Ready said combine expert human curation and AI. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWhen Nvidia announced its Rubin series of GPUs in March, it also dropped a bomb: Racks built with the Ultra version of the chip, which is expected to be released in 2027, could draw up to 600 kilowatts of electricity. That’s nearly twice as much juice as some of the fastest EV chargers can deliver today.\nAs data center racks become that power hungry, one of the biggest hurdles will be figuring out how to keep them cool. One startup thinks stacks of metal are the answer.\nAlloy Enterprises has developed a technology that turns sheets of copper into solid cooling plates for GPUs and for peripheral chips, the supporting components like memory and networking hardware that account for about 20% of a server’s cooling load. \n“We didn’t care too much about that 20% when racks were 120 kilowatts,” Ali Forsyth, co-founder and CEO of Alloy Enterprises, told TechCrunch. But now, as racks have hit 480 kilowatts on their way to 600 kilowatts, engineers have to figure out how to liquid cool everything from RAM to networking chips, parts for which there are no solutions available today.\nAlloy’s approach uses additive manufacturing (building objects layer by layer) to produce cold plates that are capable of squeezing into tight spots while withstanding the high pressures that liquid cooling can demand.\nImage Credits:Alloy Enterprises\nBut the startup doesn’t use 3D printing. Rather, it takes sheets of metal and forces them to bond using a combination of heat and pressure. It’s more expensive than traditional machining, but cheaper than 3D printing.\nThe result is a cold plate that, for all intents and purposes, is a single block of metal. There’s no seam, unlike machined products, and it’s solid metal, unlike 3D-printed versions, which can be porous. “We hit raw material properties,” Forsyth said. “The copper is just as strong as if you had machined it.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMost cold plates are machined, a process that uses tools to carve out features. Because the tools are large, each half of the plate has to be machined separately. The two halves are then sintered together — a process that fuses metal powders using heat — which introduces a seam that could potentially leak under high pressure. Alloy’s process, a type of diffusion bonding it calls “stack forging,” makes seamless cold plates. \nStack forging can also make smaller features, down to 50 microns, about half the width of a human hair, allowing more coolant to flow past the metal. Alloy’s cold plates have 35% better thermal performance than competitors, Forsyth said.\nBecause of the complexities of stack forging, Alloy does most of the internal design. Customers submit key specifications and dimensions, and the startup’s software helps translate those into a shape that works for the company’s manufacturing process.\nIn Alloy’s factory, rolls of copper are first prepped and cut to size. The features are then cut out using a laser. Parts of the design that the company doesn’t want to bond to each other are coated with an inhibitor. When completed, each slice of a cold plate is registered and stacked before heading into a diffusion bonding machine, which uses heat and pressure to press the stacked slices into a single piece of metal.\nForsyth said her company is working with “all the big names” in the data center world, though she wouldn’t disclose specifics. \nInitially, the company had designed the technology to work with a widely used aluminum alloy, but as it received more interest from data centers, it ported the process to work with copper, which conducts heat well and resists corrosion. When Alloy announced the product in June, “things just blew up,” Forsyth said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon has told Perplexity to get its agentic browser out of its online store, the companies both confirmed publicly on Tuesday. After warning Perplexity multiple times that Comet, its AI-powered shopping assistant, was violating Amazon’s terms of service by not identifying itself as an agent, the e-commerce giant sent the AI search engine startup a sternly worded cease-and-desist letter, Perplexity wrote in a blog post titled “Bullying is not innovation.”\n“This week, Perplexity received an aggressive legal threat from Amazon, demanding we prohibit Comet users from using their AI assistants on Amazon. This is Amazon’s first legal salvo against an AI company, and it is a threat to all internet users,” Perplexity lamented in the blog post.\nPerplexity’s argument is that, since its agent is acting on behalf of a human user’s direction, the agent automatically has the “same permissions” as the human user. The implication is that it doesn’t have to identify itself as an agent.\nAmazon’s response points out that other third-party agents working at the behest of human users do identify themselves. “It is how others operate, including food delivery apps and the restaurants they take orders for, delivery service apps and the stores they shop from, and online travel agencies and the airlines they book tickets with for customers,” Amazon’s statement explains.\nIf Amazon is to be believed, then Perplexity could simply identify its agent and start shopping. Of course, the risk is that Amazon, which has its own shopping bot called Rufus, could also block Comet — or any other third-party agentic shopper — from its site.\nAmazon suggests as much as its statement, which also says, “We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers from other businesses should operate openly and respect service provider decisions whether or not to participate.”\nPerplexity claims that Amazon would block the shopping bot because Amazon wants to sell advertising and product placements. Unlike human shoppers, a bot tasked with buying a new laundry basket presumably wouldn’t find itself buying a more expensive one, or getting lured into buying the latest Brandon Sanderson novel and a new set of earphones (on sale!).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf all of this sounds a bit familiar, that’s because it is. A few months ago, Cloudflare published research accusing Perplexity of scraping websites while specifically defying requests from websites blocking AI bots. Interestingly, many people came to Perplexity’s defense that time, because this wasn’t a clear-cut case of web crawler bad behavior. Cloudflare documented how the AI was accessing a specific public website when its user asked about that specific website. Perplexity fans argued that this is exactly what every human-operated web browser does.\nOn the other hand, Perplexity was using some questionable methods to do that accessing when a website opted out of bots, like hiding its identity.\nAs TechCrunch reported at the time, the Cloudflare incident foreshadowed the challenges to come if the agentic world materializes as Silicon Valley predicts it will. If consumers and companies outsource their shopping, travel bookings, and restaurant reservations to bots, will it be in the best interest of websites to block bots entirely? How will they allow and work with them?\nPerplexity may be right in that Amazon is setting a precedent. As the 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce, it is clearly saying that the way this should work is for an agent to identify itself and let the website decide.\nUpdate: Amazon has now also published its scathing cease and desist letter.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nFor years, Australians have been been installing solar panels at a rapid clip. Now, that investment is paying off. \nThe Australian government announced this week that electricity customers in three states will get free electricity for up to three hours per day starting in July 2026. \nSolar power has boomed in Australia in recent years. Rooftop solar installations cost about $840 (US) per kilowatt of capacity before rebates, about a third of what U.S. households pay. As a result, more than one in three Australian homes have solar panels on their roof.\n“Now we’re at the level where we can share more of that power with more Australians,” Chris Bowen, minister for climate change and energy, said in an Instagram video announcing the policy.\nThe Solar Sharer plan will be available to everyone in New South Wales, South Australia, and in the southeastern part of Queensland to start; more regions will be added later. Households won’t have to have solar on their rooftops to qualify, though they will need a smart meter installed. The plan will help those who live in apartments or don’t have a suitable rooftop to benefit from their neighbors’ panels, Bowen said.\nAlthough the government hasn’t said which hours in the middle of the day will qualify, the hours between 11 am and 2 pm are the most likely candidates. Customers will have to opt-in to the new plan, which is meant to encourage people to shift their energy use to peak solar production hours. Smart appliances can help people make the most of this by allowing them to time when EVs charge or loads of laundry run. \nThe free electricity hours “help us with the grid at night too because that means transferring the use of power from nighttime — when power is more expensive because it’s being run more by coal and gas — to the middle of the day when its being run by renewable energy,” Bowen said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nShifting loads will also reduce the need for grid-scale batteries, which Australia has been installing to absorb excess solar power.\nThe Australian plan isn’t the first to experiment with periods of free electricity driven by peaks of renewable power production. Octopus Energy in the UK has offered an Agile plan that occasionally gives customers free electricity, though it’s not a regular occurrence like it will be in Australia.\nIn many places, solar has become so cheap that electricity is essentially free for at least part of the day. Midday peaks in solar production can cause electricity prices to turn negative, which occasionally results in power providers paying customers to use energy.\nAustralia is generally considered a sunny country, with vast swathes receiving as much sunlight as the U.S. Southwest. But most solar panels are installed closer to population centers, which receive as much sunlight as most of the U.S. or southern Europe, suggesting that broader solar adoption could drive down energy prices in a number of regions around the world.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

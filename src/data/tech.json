Semrush had a market capitalization of about $1 billion as of Tuesday’s close.\nBy acquiring Semrush, Adobe is betting that companies will choose to invest in optimizing their content and web pages to be more visible to AI tools, as people increasingly use AI chatbots, agents, and AI browsers to do everything from getting the news and finding recipes to shopping and booking their travel. This is a fresh, big market for existing search engine optimization players like Semrush, particularly as this change in consumer behavior drives increasing traffic to websites from generative AI tools.\nIndeed, as of October, traffic to retail websites from generative AI chatbots increased 1,200% compared to a year earlier, per Adobe Analytics data.\nSemrush has been investing in what it calls “generative engine optimization,” and recently launched a tool for tracking and improving website performance using both traditional SEO techniques and optimization for AI engines, like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Grok, and Perplexity.\n“Brand visibility is being reshaped by generative AI, and brands that don’t embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe’s Digital Experience Business. “With Semrush, we’re unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n",

Once they turn 16, they will be able to access their old account as they left it.\nIt will be a challenge, however, for Meta to determine which users are under the age of 16, since people aren’t always truthful about their age when signing up for social media services. But digital age checks are notoriously difficult to execute in a manner that’s safe and effective. Identity verification services are high-profile targets for hacks, and the implications of even a minor security vulnerability are severe, since personal information and government documents can be exposed.\nIdentity verification platforms have already proven problematic for users’ security. Last year, 404 Media found that AU10TIX, a company that verifies the identity of users on TikTok, Uber, and X, had left administrative credentials exposed online for over a year, which allowed users’ sensitive information to be exposed.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n",

    "body": "\nAuckland-founded Kiki Club launched its peer-to-peer subletting startup in New York City in 2023 with the mission of helping renters sublet their apartments while traveling for extended periods. \nHowever, Kiki’s model violated local short-term rental laws, leading to its shutdown this past June. The New York Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement (OSE) announced on Wednesday that Kiki has agreed to pay more than $152,000 to settle charges. \nBacked by Blackbird, the Airbnb competitor aimed to simplify the subletting process and boldly promised a solution that would let users sublet their spaces for up to six months. The platform used a matching system similar to those of dating apps, connecting listers and renters based on their preferences.\nHowever, the startup found itself on the wrong side of NYC’s short-term rental laws. Specifically, Local Law 18, which was enacted in 2022. This legislation imposes strict guidelines on short-term rentals, allowing them only if the host is registered with the OSE as a short-term rental host and meets additional criteria, such as staying in the same unit as the guests. \nWhen the law was first introduced, many Airbnb hosts found the regulations too difficult to manage, leading to a dramatic 85% drop in short-term rentals, according to Inside Airbnb, an organization that monitors the platform’s data.\nAdditionally, under the law, booking services must use OSE’s verification system to confirm that hosts are either registered or exempt. Unverified transactions face a penalty of $1,500 or three times the revenue earned, whichever is lower.\nAccording to the OSE, Kiki failed to submit quarterly reports of short-term rental transactions for eligible listings and didn’t verify nearly 400 short-term rental transactions. \n“This settlement sends a clear message: If you are a company that facilitates short-term rentals, ignoring city laws will be an expensive proposition,” Christian Klossner, executive director of the OSE, said in a statement. “Kiki Club acted as a clandestine conduit for unregistered and illegal short-term rentals, directly undermining the city’s efforts to protect tenants and preserve permanent housing.”  \nWhile Kiki did not admit or deny the findings, it paid the penalties. A spokesperson for Kiki previously acknowledged in an interview with SmartCompany that the company was aware it was operating in a “gray regulatory area.”\nAnd, despite facing such significant consequences in New York, Kiki isn’t throwing in the towel. In June, the startup announced its launch in London. \nIt’s important to note that the U.K. also has regulations concerning illegal renting. Renting to someone who doesn’t have the right to rent in the U.K. can lead to up to five years in prison or a hefty fine.\nHopefully, the startup learned a valuable lesson in New York so its London-based platform doesn’t meet the same fate.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\n\nLoading the player…\n\nWhile everyone’s chasing the next AI infrastructure play in San Francisco, some of the most defensible AI companies are being built by founders with deep expertise in legacy industries — and they’re not getting funded. January Ventures aims to fill that gap, writing pre-seed checks for underrepresented founders transforming healthcare, manufacturing, and supply chain with AI.\nAt TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, Dominic-Madori Davis sat down with Jennifer Neundorfer, co-founder and general partner at January Ventures, for a live episode of Equity. The pair dug into how early-stage investing is changing in the age of AI and why building different networks matters.\n\n\n\t\tMorgan Little is TechCrunch’s Director of Audience Development, having joined the team in 2023.

    "description": "\nThe explosive growth of data centers could threaten the stability of the electrical grid this winter, according to an industry overseer.\nAcross North",
    "body": "\nThe explosive growth of data centers could threaten the stability of the electrical grid this winter, according to an industry overseer.\nAcross North America, demand for electricity this winter is expected to be 2.5% higher than last year for a total of 20 gigawatts, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said in a report released this week. In recent years, winter demand grew by 1% or less. \nData centers are driving a significant chunk of that growth, especially in the mid-Atlantic, U.S. West, and U.S. Southeast, “areas where a lot of data center development is occurring,” Mark Olson, NERC manager of reliability assessments, told E&E News.\nThe report specifically calls out data center expansion in Texas, saying that it is “contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” That stat might be particularly worrisome to Texans, who nearly five years ago suffered through massive power outages during an intense cold snap. \nAt the time, natural gas power plants tripped offline as wellheads froze, slashing the supply of natural gas. Meanwhile, demand for the fossil fuel soared as residential and commercial customers tried to keep homes and offices warm. (The governor publicly blamed wind turbines, despite knowing that they were only a small part of the problem.)\nThis year, NERC said the situation in Texas isn’t likely to be as dire as it was in February 2021, in part because so many batteries have been added to the state’s grid. Those batteries can step in to provide electricity if gas-fired power plants can’t deliver as intended. Plus, they can react more quickly to smaller perturbations than “peaker” power plants, most of which run on natural gas and require minutes to spin up.\nStill, Texas isn’t entirely in the clear. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMost of the batteries deployed in Texas can deliver electricity for a few hours at a time. That’s suitable in circumstances where demand tends to peak for a short time, like in the evening when people return from work. \nBut as NERC notes, data centers tend to draw electricity consistently throughout the day. If a prolonged cold snap hits the state, keeping those batteries sufficiently charged to deliver power to all customers — data centers included — will become more challenging, NERC said. \nIf this winter passes without a significant storm, then NERC anticipates no problems with any region’s electrical grid. But over the last five years, there have been four severe storms, the organization said, which could force grid operators to import electricity, ask large customers to curtail their use, or as a last resort institute rolling blackouts.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFrom electronic health records and blood tests to the stream of data from wearable devices, the amount of health information people generate is accelerating rapidly. Yet, many users struggle to connect this trove of data in a meaningful way and actually use it to improve their health.\nFunction Health, which offers a regular lab testing service to help people track their health, wants to change that by consolidating health data and making it usable for its customers by connecting that data to an AI model. To further that effort, the company recently raised $298 million in a Series B round led by Redpoint Ventures at a valuation of $2.5 billion. \nThe funding round also saw participation from a16z; Aglaé Ventures; Alumni Ventures; NBA athletes Allen Crabbe, Blake Griffin, and Taylor Griffin; Battery Ventures; Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’ investment firm, NFDG; and Roku founder Anthony Wood. The round brings the company’s total capital raised to $350 million.\nAlongside the funding, Function unveiled Medical Intelligence Lab, an effort to build a “medical intelligence” generative AI model that can be used to provide personalized health insights based on users’ data, content, and research. The company said the model is trained by doctors. For its customers, the company is offering an AI chatbot that can answer questions based on their health data and can tap their previous lab results, doctor’s notes, and scans to provide tailored guidance.\n“It is not good enough to be in a world where AI exists and not be applying it to your health,” Jonathan Swerdlin, CEO and co-founder of Function, told TechCrunch. “You should be able to manage your biology. The objective of Function Health is to apply the best available technology to human health.”\nSwerdlin noted the platform meets HIPAA standards, fully encrypts user data, and never sells personal information. “Your data and your identity are never for sale. Every bit of your information is fully encrypted and protected. We are committed to keeping you, and your data, safe.”\nFunction’s chief medical scientist, Dr. Dan Sodickson, and its co-founder and chief medical officer Dr. Mark Hyman, are together leading development of MI Lab and its team of doctors, researchers, and engineers. The MI model is trained by doctors and they stay involved in the process, Swerdlin said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile the space has many players, Function sets itself apart from competitors like Superpower, Neko Health, and InsideTracker thanks to its device-agnostic approach, Swerdlin said, adding that the platform integrates lab testing, diagnostics, and clinical insights to offer more than a typical AI coach or wellness app.\nFunction has 75 locations in the U.S. and plans to have almost 200 by the end of this year, he added. Function says it has completed more than 50 million lab tests since 2023.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nJanuary Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.  \nFounders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.  \n“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” \nThis is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.\n“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.  \nWhether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”  \nElsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox. Meeting and talking technology with people was the part of the job that gave her the most joy and helped her realize how much she would probably love working with early-stage founders.\nBut the learning curve was steep when she decided to transition to investing. In the early days, she said she would constantly check in with founders and give detailed input on their companies.  \n“That’s appropriate for some cases, but it’s really about the relationship with the founder, supporting not only weighing in on the business, but supporting them as a person,” she said.  \nNow she’s comfortable in the job. She serves as a mentor for various organizations, such as Techstars, and has made more than 50 investments at January Ventures, according to PitchBook, nabbing some exits in the meantime.  \nThroughout the conversation, Neundorfer spoke about the changing venture market, funding levels for minorities and women, and about venture markets outside of San Francisco that are seeing success. Her biggest advice to diverse founders right now actually goes for many founders building in this climate: ignore the noise and focus on building a good company.  \n“Anything else becomes something they can’t control, and the worry isn’t worth it.”  \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang struck a bullish tone in the company’s third-quarter earnings. And based on the company’s results, there may be reason to.\nNvidia reported revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter, 62% higher compared to the same quarter last year. The company’s net income on a GAAP basis was $32 billion, 65% higher year-over-year. Both revenue and profit results beat Wall Street expectations.\nThe revenue picture shows a company booming thanks largely to its data center business. Revenue generated by Nvidia’s data center business was a record $51.2 billion, up 25% from the previous quarter and up 66% from a year ago. The remaining $5.8 billion in revenue came from Nvidia’s gaming business with $4.2 billion, followed by sales in professional visualization and automotive.\nNvidia’s CFO Colette Kress noted in a statement to shareholders its data center business has been fueled by an acceleration of computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. During the company’s Q3 call, Kress said in this past quarter, the company announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs.\n“This demand spans every market, CSPs, sovereigns, modern builders enterprises and super computing centers, and includes multiple landmark build outs,” Kress said.\nBlackwell Ultra, a GPU unveiled in March and available in several configurations, has been particularly strong and is now the leader within the company. Previous versions of the Blackwell architecture also saw continued strong demand, according to the company. \nHuang said sales of its Blackwell GPU chips “are off the charts.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Huang said in the company’s Q3 earnings statement. “Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference — each growing exponentially. We’ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast — with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.”\nKress did note that the company’s shipments of H20, a data center GPU designed for generative AI and high-performance computing, were 50 million, a disappointing result due to its inability to sell to China.\n“Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China,,” Kress noted on the earnings call. “While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the U.S. and China governments, and will continue to advocate for America’s ability to compete around the world.” \nImportantly, Nvidia is forecasting more growth with a projected revenue of $65 billion in the fourth quarter, helping push its share price up more than 4% in after-hours trading. \nThe upshot, at least in Huang’s view: forget about the bubble, there is only growth. \n“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Jensen said during the company’s earnings call. “From our vantage point, we see something very different.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

The sanctions also target several of the company’s executives, including its general director — also known as Yalishanda — who allegedly provided servers and troubleshooting to cybercriminals.\nOfficials say criminal hackers relied on Media Land to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks. Prolific ransomware gangs, including LockBit, BlackSuit, and Play allegedly used it for their infrastructure. The Treasury said several of the company’s employees coordinated with cybercriminals.\n“Bulletproof” providers are web hosts and cloud companies that typically tout their services as impervious or resilient to law enforcement actions, such as takedowns or legal demands, and as such are commonly used by cybercriminals to host their malicious infrastructure. \nU.S. officials said hosting companies like Media Land help provide cybercriminals essential services for “attacking businesses in the United States and in allied countries,” though Treasury did not name the victims of the attacks.\nThe U.K.’s Foreign Office said it was also designating a U.K.-based company called Hypercore, which officials said was set up as a front company for Aeza Group, another bulletproof hosting company that was sanctioned by the U.S. in July. The U.K. said in its own statement that Aeza is linked to a Kremlin disinformation organization called the Social Design Agency.\nSanctioning the companies and individuals involved in cybercrime effectively makes it illegal for citizens, residents, or those with business ties to the U.S., U.K., and Australia from transacting or conducting business with those sanctioned.\nU.S. cybersecurity agency CISA and the National Security Agency published guidance Wednesday on how organizations can mitigate the risks from bulletproof hosting providers.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, Spotify announced new features designed to showcase the people behind users’ favorite music, including producers, engineers, songwriters, background vocalists, and more. The company will also release tools that show how songs are connected and what inspired them.\nThe second set of tools is showcased in a new, interactive feature called SongDNA, which shows which songs are being sampled in a given track, who has covered the tune, and what other projects the song’s collaborators may have been involved in.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nTechCrunch reported in October that Spotify was developing the SongDNA feature as a way to help users discover music through a song’s credits, after references to the feature were spotted in the app’s code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong. With SongDNA, Spotify users could explore the other projects that the artists, musicians, and others who worked on a track are involved with.\nPreviously, the Song Credits feature had only featured the topline performance, songwriting, and production credits.\nReferences to the sampled music, meanwhile, come from the online community-built database WhoSampled, which Spotify has acquired. Notably, the streaming service TIDAL also offers interactive credits that let users explore music through the contributors behind the songs.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nSpotify has also planned a feature called “About the song,” which will allow listeners to explore swipeable cards in the “Now Playing” view. Those cards will offer details like what inspired the song, the stories behind the music, the cultural impact, and more. These stories are sourced from third-party resources, which will be linked in the cards.\nThis type of background information about music is something Spotify has offered in previous years, when it partnered with lyrics site Genius on a feature that offered details on certain tracks’ backstories. However, that feature was limited to those stories Genius had in its database. The upcoming feature will link out to various places on the web, screenshots show, including informational sites like Wikipedia, as well as news sites.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Spotify\nSpotify says the expanded Song Credits will roll out starting Wednesday on mobile devices and will come to desktop in the months ahead.\nSongDNA and About the Song will only be available to Premium subscribers. However, these features won’t launch until early next year, initially as Spotify for Artists Preview. This will allow those involved with the music to have a chance to preview the features first and ensure the credits are accurate before they’re made available to the wider public. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nFor Daniil Boiko and Andrei Tyrin, the idea for Onepot AI came from the same frustration.\n“The best ideas in drug discovery were often blocked not by biology, but by synthesis,” Boiko told TechCrunch. Synthesis is the creation of new molecules by using chemical reactions. It’s like a recipe or Lego pieces, where small pieces, ingredients, molecules, come together to form a wider puzzle picture, a food dish, a larger molecule.\nAs one might expect, it’s quite hard to create those small molecules that go on to build bigger ones.\nFor Boiko, a PhD candidate studying machine learning in chemistry at Carnegie Mellon (he received his bachelor’s and master’s in organic chemistry from a university in Russia), that meant realizing that drug hunters — the scientists who oversee drug discovery and development — were skipping promising ideas just because the chemical molecules to create the drugs seemed too hard to make.\n“The compounds never even got a chance to be tested,” Boiko told TechCrunch.\nFor Tyrin (who received his bachelor’s in computer science at MIT), his time working on drug discovery computational pipelines made him realize how behind the world of drug discovery was. “The models could generate ideas in hours, but it could take months for the lab to catch up,” he told TechCrunch.\n“We both saw that the world was throwing money into molecular design and almost ignoring the harder problem of actually making the molecules,” Boiko said. But there was a geopolitical angle too, he continued, global supply chains are becoming vulnerable, and the U.S. is entering a trade war and innovative competition, once again, with China.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It was clear,” Boiko said. “Small molecule synthesis needed to be rebuilt from the ground up in the United States.”\nBoiko and Tyrin came together to create Onepot, a company that is home to the small-molecule synthesis lab POT-1. They also built Phil, an AI organic chemist, to help run experimental analysis to increase the process of compound synthesis for their early commercial partners. Those partners are biotech and pharma companies that are currently trying out their technology.\nOn Wednesday, the company came out of stealth with $13 million of funding, including pre-seed money, and a seed round led by Fifty Years.\n“Currently, pharma and biotech companies either build entire teams of chemists in-house or work with contract research organizations overseas,” Tyrin said of the process for molecular synthesis. Human chemists can spend months of research to create even a single compound, at a cost of thousands of dollars.\nIt involves a lot of trial and error — studying various compounds, collecting data on biological activity, how the drug moves through the body, toxicology reports, and coming up with what to experiment with next. “The main limiting factor here is not testing these compounds, but making them in the first place,” Tyrin continued. “We aim to compress this down to days.”\nTyrin said the product is pretty straightforward. Onepot has a catalogue of molecules it can make. Clients choose which compounds it wants and then Onepot’s technology will synthesize the molecules and ship them to the customer so the customer can use them in their own experiments. (They ship physical products either as dry compounds or solutions in plates or vials.)\nThe back end of the product is where Boiko and Tyrin have fun, dissecting the problems of chemical synthesis to find out which combinations of molecules work together. They built a lab where they are letting LLM agents access these so-called molecule recipes for training so the agents can also find out what works and doesn’t in compound building.\n“When executing experiments in the lab, we capture every single detail that goes into the process,” Tyrin said — that means tracing temperature and, essentially, the ingredients that were added to a mixture to create compounds. “No information is lost, which makes experiences reproducible even if someone decides to run them 10 years from now.”\nThis also means their agents generate hypotheses from real-world experiments rather than literature data, often mined from the internet.\nBoiko called the fundraising process “hectic,” and said they met their lead investor through an intro. “What was supposed to be a short meeting turned into a multi-hour whiteboard session about industrializing synthesis,” Boiko said. Others in the round include Khosla Ventures, Speedinvest, OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba, and Google’s Chief Scientist Jeff Dean.  \nThe fresh capital will be used to build a second lab in San Francisco so the team can take on more customers. It will also expand the team and its compound discovery engine. On the service side, Boiko and Tyrin look at WuXi AppTec and Enamine as competitors.\nOverall, Boiko and Tyrin hope to make drug discovery at least two times faster and hopefully change the perception of what is possible after one taps into the “weird” chemistry that scientists once thought was off limits.  \n“You’re not just speeding up drug discovery, you’re expanding the design space for what drugs and materials can be,” Boiko said. “That drug that we haven’t discovered yet, might be out there, waiting for us to find it.”\n",

    "body": "\nIf you want insight into just how worried VCs (and Silicon Valley, generally) are over legal challenges to AI training on copyrighted material, look no further than AI music site Suno. \nSuno, which allows anyone to create AI-generated songs through prompts, announced on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \nThe company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September. It has now hit $200 million in annual revenue, Suno told The Wall Street Journal. \nIt previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. \nBut Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission.  \nThose types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material. \nBut given Suno’s market success, growth, and the obvious potential market for AI-generated music, its legal complications are a shoulder shrug to investors. \n“Type an idea, click Create, and suddenly, you’re not just imagining music — you’re making it. That shift from listener to creator? That’s what Suno unlocks,” the Menlo VCs who backed the startup describe in their blog post about the investment.\nMenlo didn’t just like the tech, but also that Suno has grown largely through word of mouth — people sharing songs on their group texts, the investors said. \nNo doubt the AI industry is, and will continue, to eventually work out the legal ramifications of acting first, asking for permission later, over training data. But before that’s settled, the era of AI-generated music has clearly arrived.\n",

This includes the inclusion of new reporting categories in the app, changes to its “strike” system for violations, and more guidance provided to those who violate the rules.\nThe moderation changes are rolling out with the latest version of the Bluesky app (v. 1.110), which also includes a dark-mode app icon and a redesigned feature for controlling who can reply to your post.\nThe company says the moderation updates are a result of Bluesky’s rapid growth and the need for “clear standards and expectations for how people treat each other” on the platform.\n“On Bluesky, people are meeting and falling in love, being discovered as artists, and having debates on niche topics in cozy corners. At the same time, some of us have developed a habit of saying things behind screens that we’d never say in person,” the company shared in an announcement, explaining the changes.\nHowever, the news also follows the most recent moderation dust-up on the platform, which saw a user suspended for making a comment that Bluesky interpreted as a threat of violence. Author and influencer Sarah Kendzior had written in a post on Bluesky that she wanted to “shoot the author of this article just to watch him die” — a reference to a Johnny Cash song lyric. That choice of words was apt because she was commenting on an article about Johnny Cash that she didn’t like.\nBluesky’s team said that Kendzior was suspended because she expressed “a desire to shoot the author of the article”– a very literal reading of her commentary. \nWith the updated rules, Bluesky seems focused on ensuring the platform maintains a sense of community and doesn’t devolve into the toxicity that now fuels X, where snarky comments, dunks, and hateful commentary are often the norm. \nImage Credits:Bluesky\nFor starters, Bluesky is expanding the reporting options on posts from six to nine, allowing users more precision in flagging issues and helping moderators take action on critical reports more quickly. For instance, you can now report things like Youth Harassment or Bullying or Eating Disorders, which would help to address Bluesky’s need to abide by the host of new laws designed to protect minors online. In addition, it will allow users to flag possible Human Trafficking content to meet the requirements of the U.K.’s Online Safety Act.\nTo aid in this, Bluesky has improved its internal tools to automatically track violations and enforcement actions in one place. The system will also make sure people get clear information about what happened and where they stand.\nThe company notes that it’s not changing what it enforces, only that it’s made its tooling better so it can be more consistent and transparent with its enforcement. \nAs part of this, Bluesky’s strike system will now assign content a severity rating, which will help dictate the enforcement action taken. For example, content flagged as a “critical risk” would result in a permanent ban. Other content may receive a lower, medium, or higher penalty. And if an account racks up violations, the user could also risk a permanent ban instead of a temporary suspension.\nPlus, the company says users will be notified when they’re the subject of an enforcement action with information about which Community Guideline they violated, the severity level assigned, their total violation count, how close they are to the next account-level action threshold, and the duration and end date of any suspension. Enforcement actions can also be appealed, the company said. \nThe changes also follow Bluesky’s rollout of updated Community Guidelines in October, as part of its broader focus on becoming more aggressive about moderation and enforcement on the platform.\nBut even as the company emphasizes its stricter rules, some Bluesky users remain upset that the company still permits a user who is widely criticized for his writing on trans issues to maintain his account on the platform. This controversy erupted again in October, when Bluesky CEO Jay Graber appeared to dismiss users’ criticism in a handful of posts. \nAt the root of the issue is how Bluesky wants to be perceived versus what it actually is today.\nThe company doesn’t want to be known as just a leftist or liberal version of Twitter; it wants to be a home where many different communities can build out their networks and thrive, without the problems of a centralized social network. However, much of the community that adopted Bluesky did so as they no longer felt represented on Twitter/X, which became more right-leaning under new owner Elon Musk. \nIn addition to wanting to shape its image, Bluesky has to balance its goals with a growing number of laws and regulations that require social platforms to protect their users from harm or face potentially severe consequences, like massive fines. For instance, earlier this year Bluesky blocked its service in Mississippi, saying it didn’t have the resources to meet the state’s age assurance law, which would fine the network up to $10,000 per user for noncompliance. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nI guess we’re past the era of “and that’s what you missed on Glee.” Amazon’s Prime Video streamer is adding AI-generated “Video Recaps” to help viewers catch up between seasons of shows, the company announced on Wednesday.\nAccording to Amazon, the feature “utilizes generative AI to create theatrical-quality season recaps with synchronized narration, dialogue, and music.” It will begin rolling out in beta on Wednesday for select Prime Originals, like “Fallout,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” and “Upload.”\nPrime Video launched a similar AI-powered feature last year called “X-Ray Recaps,” which summarizes complete seasons, episodes, or parts of episodes — at the time, Amazon said that its AI model had guardrails in place to make sure that these recaps don’t inadvertently share spoilers.\nImage Credits:Prime Video\nConsumers have become accustomed to these kinds of text-based AI summaries, since they likely see them when their phone summarizes texts, or when they see a (perhaps unwanted) AI summary at the top of their Google results. But these video summaries veer into newer territory, which may appear more obtrusive in the viewing experience than text summaries — or, maybe they’ll be embraced by people who don’t remember what happened on “Bosch.”\nPrime Video’s competitors are also exploring how they can integrate generative AI into their products. \nYouTube TV, for example, uses a “Key Plays” feature to help viewers catch up on sports games if they start watching while the game is in progress. While it’s a bit imperfect (its algorithm seems to only be able to identify key offensive plays in baseball), the feature helped YouTube TV win its first Technical Emmy Award.\nNetflix, meanwhile, is using generative AI on the production side of its business.\nEarlier this year, Netflix said it used generative AI in the final footage for the first time in the Argentine show “The Eternaut” to create a scene of a building collapsing. After that, “Happy Gilmore 2” used generative AI to make characters look younger in the film’s opening scene, and the producers of “Billionaires’ Bunker” used it in pre-production to envision wardrobe and set design.\nThe use of AI in the film industry has sparked much debate, as artists worry that these tools — which sometimes are trained without permission on their work — could endanger their livelihoods. But some argue that tools that speed up tedious busywork in animation or special effects, like Wonder Dynamics, could expand the capacity for artists to create.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nWhen Anthony Sardain began developing Cavela in 2023, an AI startup that helps brands automate supplier sourcing, he did not foresee that new tariffs would drive customers to become increasingly wary of manufacturing products in China.\n“You don’t just walk into Vietnam and build up a supply chain,” Sardain told TechCrunch. “A lot of brands find one supplier, and they hang on for the rest of their life, because they really don’t want to lose it.”\nThat’s especially true for small and midsize companies that lack dedicated, global sourcing departments. Sardain claims that Cavela solves this problem through its AI agents, software tools that perform tasks autonomously and, in this case, act as a personal procurement team. These agents can find potential suppliers in over 40 countries and negotiate product specifications and pricing.\nOn Wednesday, Cavela announced that it raised $6.6 million in seed funding co-led by XYZ Venture Capital and Susa Ventures, with participation from Crossover Capital.\nFinding suppliers and negotiating pricing with them is an inherently arcane, time-consuming process, and, according to Sardain, it was impossible to automate without generative AI.\n“Making products involves a lot of text data, image data, diagrams, sketches, photos. This is the kind of data that didn’t play nice with technology up until AI,” Sardain said.\nThe latest LLM and image models allow brands to upload their complete product information, including specifications, blueprints, and all other details about the item they want produced, directly into Cavela’s AI agent. Based on those particulars, the agent identifies dozens of potential manufacturers and then instantly contacts those factories via WhatsApp, email, or text to understand production capacity and lead times and to collect pricing quotes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSardain claims the entire process is seamless, sparing brands from sending hundreds of messages back and forth. “They log in a couple of days later, and there are quotes in their inbox,” he said. Companies then typically ask a shortlist of potential suppliers to send product samples, which aids in selecting one or more factories for final production.\nCavela estimates that its customers not only substantially reduce the time spent searching for manufacturing partners, but they also save an average of 35% on production costs.\n“If you get 100 quotes, you’re going to, by chance, land on a much lower price, and you’re also going to get a much better supplier in the process,” Sardain said.\nCavela’s customers, including fire-resistant apparel brand Western Welder Outfitting and men’s grooming brand The Longhairs, report that the startup helped them find manufacturers who produce goods at a significantly lower cost — even below pre-tariff pricing.\nSardain, a former data science lead for the data analysis startup Tierra, traces his knowledge of trade and sourcing back three generations within his family. He grew up living across Asian trade centers, including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, and mainland China, which gave him a valuable understanding of how local manufacturers approach their work.\nCavela’s competitors include Alibaba, which connects brands to thousands of manufacturers in China, and Pietra, a brand operations startup that similarly helps businesses source goods with the help of AI.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

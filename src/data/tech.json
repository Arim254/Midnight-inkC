    "body": "\nTikTok settled a high-profile lawsuit on Monday evening, which alleges that social media companies intentionally make their products addictive, causing harm to users. Snap settled the case last week, but Meta and YouTube — the other defendants — are now heading to trial, where jury selection begins on Tuesday.\nCentering around a 19-year-old plaintiff known by the initials K.G.M., this case is the first of many similar legal challenges against social platforms. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and YouTube head Neal Mohan are expected to testify, which could set a precedent for how dozens of other lawsuits could play out.\nBy settling the case, TikTok and Snap are not necessarily admitting to the allegations. Rather, they came to an agreement with the plaintiff outside of court, though the terms of these settlements are not known. \n",

The settlement includes more than $600 million already distributed or soon to be paid in refunds, plus additional funds that will be paid out to affected consumers, according to court documents.\nUnder the settlement, Amazon will pay $309.5 million into a non-reversionary common fund, a pool of money set aside for members of the class-action lawsuit. The company has already issued about $570 million in refunds, with about $34 million of refunds remaining. Reuters was first to report on the settlement.\nThe e-commerce giant has also agreed to provide over $363 million in non‑monetary relief to enhance its return and refund processes, according to court documents. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing.\nThe lawsuit, filed in 2023, alleged that Amazon caused “substantial unjustified monetary losses” for consumers who returned an item but were still charged for it.  \n“Following an internal review in 2025, we identified a small subset of returns where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify that the correct item had been sent back to us, so no refund had been issued,” Amazon said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “We started issuing refunds in 2025 for these returns and are providing additional compensation and refunds to eligible customers per the settlement agreement.”\nAmazon agreed to pay $2.5 billion last year to settle the FTC’s lawsuit that accused the company of tricking users into subscribing to Prime and making it difficult to cancel.

    "body": "\nGoogle on Tuesday announced its more affordable Google AI Plus plan is now available in all markets where its AI plans are available. This includes the U.S, where it will cost $7.99 per month. \nThe expansion brings the lower-cost plan to 35 new countries and territories, after earlier launches in dozens of global markets, which began with Indonesia last September.\nThe plan includes access to Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro in the Gemini app, Flow’s AI filmmaking tools, research and writing assistance in NotebookLM, and more. It also offers 200GB of storage and the ability to share your plan benefits with up to five other family members.\nExisting Google One Premium 2TB subscribers will automatically gain access to all Google AI Plus plan benefits over the next few days, the company says.\nInitially focused on emerging markets, the Google AI Plus plan is designed as the first step beyond free access to Gemini and other AI tools for those who either don’t need or can’t afford to subscribe to the more expensive Google AI Pro plan, which is typically priced at $20 per month.\nWhile the Plus plan’s price point varies by region, its $8 per month price point could introduce a new, more casual audience to Google’s AI technology here in the United States. Elsewhere, the plan tends to cost less than $5 per month. For instance, users in India pay ₹399 ($4.44 USD) per month.\nWhen it first debuted, Google explained that the plan was designed to bring access to Gemini, Veo, and other creative AI tools to emerging markets at a more affordable price point. It’s also designed to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT Go plan, which is $8 per month in the U.S., or less in some emerging markets. These plans are meant to attract the large online population of users who could become regular AI customers over time, giving companies a boost in their AI adoption numbers.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the time being, subscribers can take 50% off for the first two months of their subscription in a promotional offering, Google says.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTikTok says it’s making progress on recovering its U.S. infrastructure after an unfortunately timed data center outage, which affected the region shortly after the TikTok U.S. deal went through. Last week, TikTok announced the creation of a separate U.S. entity with American investors to avoid a nationwide ban.\nAround the time of the transition, users reported issues with TikTok searches, watching videos, posting, loading comments, unexpected behavior with the For You algorithm, content, and more. \nOn Monday, the company attributed glitches to a data center power outage, which it said was impacting TikTok and other apps.\nToday, a post on the TikTok USDS Joint Venture’s X account indicates the outages are not yet fully resolved.\n“We’ve made significant progress in recovering our U.S. infrastructure with our U.S. data center partner,” the post states. “However, the U.S. user experience may still have some technical issues, including when posting new content. We’re committed to bringing TikTok back to its full capacity as soon as possible. We’ll continue to provide updates. Thanks for your patience.” \n\nWe've made significant progress in recovering our U.S. infrastructure with our U.S. data center partner.

Creators may also see zero views or likes on their posts, or their earnings will seem to be missing, but this is also caused by server timeouts.\n“Your actual data and engagement are safe,” the company advised.\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Now users will be able to jump into a conversational back-and-forth with AI Mode, Google’s conversational Search feature for complex questions.\nThe tech giant also announced that it’s making Gemini 3 the new default model for AI Overviews globally. The company said in a blog post that this update will give users “a best-in-class AI response right on the search results page.”\nTuesday’s announcements mark Google’s ongoing efforts to make Search less of a static search results experience and more of an interactive, AI-driven experience.\n“People come to Search for an incredibly wide range of questions — sometimes to find information quickly, like a sports score or the weather, where a simple result is all you need,” Robby Stein, VP of Product, Google Search, said in a blog post. “But for complex questions or tasks where you need to explore a topic deeply, you should be able to seamlessly tap into a powerful conversational AI experience.”\nGoogle says its testing shows that users prefer an experience that flows naturally into a conversation and that asking follow-up questions while preserving context from AI Overviews makes Search more helpful.\nThe new experience is designed to feel like a single flow, with links that let users move from a quick snapshot to a deeper conversation as needed, the tech giant says.\nThe updates come a few days after Google announced that it’s bringing “Personal Intelligence” to AI Mode, enabling it to tap into your Gmail and Google Photos to provide more individualized responses. The company debuted Personal Intelligence earlier this month in the Gemini app to allow the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle also recently brought AI Overviews to Gmail, letting users search their inbox using natural language to get quick answers instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information.

    "body": "\nGoogle on Tuesday announced an expanded set of Android theft-protection features, designed to make its mobile devices less of a target for criminals. Building on existing tools like Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and others introduced in 2024, the newly launched updates include stronger authentication safeguards and enhanced recovery tools, the company said.\nWhile iPhones are often the preferred targets for thieves because of their resale value, Android devices are also subject to theft. That’s particularly true for high-end Android smartphones like the Google Pixel Pro devices, premium foldables, and other top devices from well-known makers like Samsung. \nImage Credits:Google\nWith the new features, users of Android devices running Android 16 or higher will have more control over the Failed Authentication Lock feature that automatically locks the device after an excessive number of failed login attempts. Now users will have access to a dedicated on/off toggle switch in the device’s settings.\nThe devices will also offer stronger protection against a thief trying to guess a device owner’s PIN, pattern, or password by increasing the lockout time after failed attempts. Plus, Identity Check, a feature rolled out for Android 15 and higher last year, now covers all features and apps that use biometrics — like banking apps or the Google Password Manager. \nRemote Lock, a tool that lets you lock a lost or stolen device from a web browser, will now include an optional security challenge or question. With this feature, available to Android 10+, only the real device owner can initiate the lock for added security. \nIn Brazil, two theft protection features will now be enabled by default, including the Theft Detection Lock, which uses on-device AI to sense motion that could indicate a “snatch-and-run” theft. The Remote Lock feature will also be automatically turned on and accessible from the website android.com/lock. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nDays after Meta was sued over alleged false privacy claims surrounding its chat app WhatsApp, the company has rolled out a new setting to protect users against cyberattacks.\nThe feature, called Strict Account Settings, adds restrictions like automatically blocking media and attachments from unknown senders, and silencing calls from unknown numbers. Under this setting, link previews are turned off, and the setting to block a high number of unknown messages is also switched on.\nWhen someone turns this option on, by default, two-step verification is turned on along with security notifications that alert someone when the code of someone they are chatting with changes. \nWhatsApp also restricts your last seen and online, profile photo, about details, and links on your profile are locked to only your contacts.

Your account is locked to more private settings, and your chats with others outside your contacts will have limitations,” the company’s description reads. \nUsers can turn on this setting by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced and then turning on Strict account settings.

    "body": "\nAnduril founder Palmer Luckey’s eyes light up, and he talks a mile a minute, when discussing his company’s new recruiting event: the AI Grand Prix. \nThis is a drone-flying contest with a twist. Rather than humans operating drones, the drones must operate autonomously. The humans will be tested on their software-writing skills that cause the drones to outfly their competition.  \nThere are prizes ranging from a $500,000 pot to be spilt amongst the highest-scoring teams, to jobs at Anduril and a chance to bypass the company’s standard recruiting cycle. \n“It was something that I decided we should do,” Luckey said in an interview with TechCrunch. Luckey and the team were meeting to discuss recruitment strategy, he recalled.\nSomeone suggested sponsoring a drone-racing tournament, which was somewhat in line with the company’s previous marketing tactics. For instance, Anduril sponsors the NASCAR Cup Series race known as the Anduril 250. \nLuckey generally liked the idea but then told the team, “‘Guys, that would be a really dumb thing for Anduril to sponsor. The whole point, our entire impetus and reason for being, is this pitch that autonomy has finally advanced to where you don’t have to have a person micromanaging each drone,’” he recalled, then added, “‘What we should really do is sponsor a race that’s about how well programmers and engineers can make a drone fly itself.’” \nAfter discovering that such an event didn’t exist, the company opted to create it themselves. Interestingly, though, Luckey pointed out that the teams in the AI Grand Prix will not be flying Anduril’s drones, but those built by another defense tech startup: Neros Technologies. According to Luckey, Anduril’s drones are too physically big to run in the contained course in Ohio where the finals will take place.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We talked about having teams use Anduril drones, but Anduril doesn’t make any drones that are of the ultra-high speed, very small nature that you would want for a Drone Racing League. It’s mostly bigger stuff,” he said.  \nAnduril is also partnering with one of the established racing leagues, the Drone Champions League, to operate the event, as well as JobsOhio. The final race will take place in Ohio (where Anduril’s key manufacturing facility is located). \nAlthough Luckey is clearly excited about how fun the event will be, he won’t be a racer himself. “I absolutely will be there,” he says, but “it’s going to be about who can build the best software to pilot these drones.”  \nHe smiled and said, “I’m not actually a very good software programmer. I’m more of a hardware guy. I’m an electromechanical and optical guy, and I know just enough about coding to glue stuff together in a way that works for my prototypes.”  \n(Luckey calls Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf “our de facto lead software brains” at the company.) \nThe founder is hoping for at least 50 teams, and already has interest from multiple universities, he said. Should this competition be a successful event, the plan is to expand it into races with the other types of autonomous vehicles.\n“We are starting with these quadcopter racing drones, which is what people expect from drone racing. However, we want to be, in the future, applying AI racing to other platforms as well,” he said.  \nUnderwater AI racing, ground AI racing, potentially even AI racing of spacecraft were some of the ideas Luckey shared.\nThe contest is open to all international entrants, excluding teams from Russia.  \n“The difference with Russia is they are actively engaged in the act of invading Europe,” he said. \nThe concern is that the people qualified to enter such a race may also be working for their nation’s military. “I would love to have everybody, but we’re not the Olympics,” he added.\nLuckey said the event was following the lead from the World Cup, which has also excluded Russia. \nInterestingly, teams from China (home to a lot of autonomous engineering) are welcome, despite it being the country that U.S. autonomous weapons hawks often name as their biggest fear.\nShould a Chinese team win, the prize of a job at Anduril, which makes weapons used by the U.S. military, would not be a given. “If you work for the Chinese military, you’re not going to be allowed to get a job at Anduril,” Luckey said. Certain laws apply, he pointed out. In fact, there will still be some interviews and a qualification process for all the job candidates.\nThe competition will take place across three qualifying rounds beginning in April, with the final Grand Prix race scheduled for November.  \n",

    "body": "\nBy Rotation, one of the U.K.’s most popular peer-to-peer fashion rental platforms, announced on Wednesday a partnership with the ride-sharing app Uber. \nFrom now until May 31, By Rotation users in the U.K. can rent outfits from others in their neighborhood and have them delivered via Uber within 60 minutes at a 10% discount. Though the discount applies to all users, the service is geared toward those renting ski gear. By Rotation said that 30% of the ski renters on its platform look for same-day pickup, and this partnership seeks to alleviate the annoyance of renting bulky, expensive ski gear and having to lug it around.\nThe partnership is fun and timely. Previously, By Rotation teamed up with Airbnb to provide rental wedding outfits for guests attending destination weddings. It was another creative collaboration that sought to meet consumers where they are. Right now, ski clothing has become quite the fashion symbol online as the sport remains a popular pastime across Europe. \nEshita Kabra-Davies, the founder and CEO of By Rotation, told TechCrunch that the partnership came from “listening to our community,” and that the company realized that, though consumers love how sustainable renting clothing can be, they also wanted the “speed and convenience of e-commerce.” \n“With one in four rentals made within 48 hours of an event, logistics was the final friction point,” she said. She called this the “emergency economy,” or the moment of “satorical panic” when someone realized they needed an outfit immediately. Usually, when this moment comes, a person has to run out to make a “panic purchase” for a new outfit. “We have wanted to change this behavior by removing the one thing standing in the way — logistics,” Kabra-Davies said. \nTeaming up with Uber makes consumers move from “fast fashion” to “slow fashion,” she said. Fashion remains one of the most polluting industries in the world. As a result, the sharing economy — or the circular economy —has become popular among young people looking for more sustainable, and often more affordable, ways to buy clothing.\nWhen users renting in their neighborhoods go to the app’s checkout page, they will be prompted via a pop-up banner to use Uber Courier, where the By Rotation discount will automatically be applied. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It gives our community the luxury of choice; they can now secure a high-quality, high-value piece over a disposable garment, simply because it can reach their door just as quickly,” Kabra-Davies continued.\nKabra-Davies launched By Rotation in 2019 and has scaled it into one of the world’s largest peer-to-peer rental platforms. The platform has more than 1 million users (like song writer Ellie Goulding), she said, and it manages luxury inventory worth more than $100 million. With this, the company has expanded beyond being a fashion rental platform, Kabra-Davies said. \n“A powerful example is one of our top lenders who actually used her wardrobe earnings to fund her IVF journey, which has led to successful surrogacy,” she said. Next, the brand hopes to keep building the “world’s largest shared wardrobe.” It’s already launched in New York and has its eyes on the UAE. “Our ambition, like Uber’s, is global,”  Kabra-Davies said. “We want to make the ‘rotating wardrobe’ the default mode of consumption everywhere.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAylo, the parent company to some of the most popular tube sites like Pornhub, announced on Tuesday that it will restrict access to its platforms in the United Kingdom, effective February 2.\nSince last year, Pornhub and other Aylo sites had complied with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA), which mandated — among other provisions — that websites with pornographic content verify the ages of visitors before showing them content that is inappropriate for minors.\nInstead of verifying the ages of its users, Aylo will block access to platforms like Pornhub in the U.K. altogether; however, U.K. users who have already verified their identity will still be able to use their accounts.\n“Despite the clear intent of the law to restrict minors’ access to adult content and commitment to enforcement, after 6 months of implementation, our experience strongly suggests that the OSA has failed to achieve that objective,” Aylo said in a statement. “We believe this framework in practice has diverted traffic to darker, unregulated corners of the internet, and has also jeopardized the privacy and personal data of U.K. citizens.”\nOfcom, the U.K. regulator that enforces OSA, disagrees with Aylo’s characterization of the legislation.\n“Porn services have a choice between using age checks to protect users as required under the Act, or to block access to their sites in the U.K.,” Ofcom said in a statement to TechCrunch. “There’s nothing to stop technology providers from developing solutions which work at the device level, and we would urge the industry to get on with that if they can evidence it is highly effective.”\nAge-verification technology has proven controversial as it rolls out across the globe. While children’s online safety is a pressing concern, privacy advocates argue that the type of cloud-based age-verification methods mandated by legislation like OSA harms adults by collecting swaths of highly sensitive data.\n“In other jurisdictions, Aylo has often been one of the only major platforms to comply, only to see traffic diverted to even larger, non-compliant sites,” the company said. Sites that do not comply with OSA are supposed to get fined, but Aylo claims that so far, only the forum 4chan has been fined.\nOfcom also disagrees with Aylo’s claim that it is not punishing porn sites for noncompliance.\n“We’ve taken strong and swift action against non-compliance, launching investigations into more than 80 porn sites and fining a porn provider £1 million, with more to come,” Ofcom said.\nThe decision to block access in the U.K. is consistent with Aylo’s decisions around navigating compliance with age-verification laws in the United States. Aylo’s websites are blocked in a number of U.S. states where age verification is mandated for adult content, since the company believes that age-verification software opens the door to the threat of data breaches.\nThese fears are not unfounded. Pornhub was, in fact, vulnerable to a data breach at the web and mobile analytics provider Mixpanel, which exposed data about some Pornhub Premium subscribers. This stolen data reportedly included information like users’ email addresses, location, videos watched, keywords associated with the video, and the dates and times that they used the site.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nOpenAI launched on Tuesday a new scientific workspace program called Prism that is available for free to anyone with a ChatGPT account. Designed as an AI-enhanced word processor and research tool for scientific papers, Prism is deeply integrated with GPT-5.2, which can be used to assess claims, revise prose, or search for prior research.\nPrism isn’t designed to conduct research on its own and without human guidance. Executives believe it will accelerate the work being done by human scientists, and compared Prism to coding interfaces like Cursor and Windsurf.\n“I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI and software engineering,” Kevin Weil, VP of OpenAI for Science, said in a press call announcing the tool.\nThe new software, which is accessed via a web app, comes as OpenAI is seeing a flood of scientific queries coming to its consumer products like ChatGPT. The company says that ChatGPT receives an average of 8.4 million messages a week on advanced topics in the hard sciences — although it’s difficult to know how many are from professional researchers.\nAI-assisted research is also becoming more common among academic researchers. In mathematics, AI models have been used to prove a number of long-standing Erdos problems through a combination of literature review and new applications of existing techniques. While the significance of the proofs is still hotly debated, the results have been an early victory for proponents of AI models and formal verification systems.\nA statistics paper published in December used GPT 5.2 Pro to establish new proofs for a central axiom of statistical theory, with human researchers only prompting and verifying the model’s work. OpenAI applauded the result in a blog post, presenting it as a model for human-AI collaboration in research going forward.\n“In domains with axiomatic theoretical foundations,” the post reads, “frontier models can help explore proofs, test hypotheses, and identify connections that might otherwise take substantial human effort to uncover.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMuch of the value of OpenAI’s new system comes from simple product work on existing standards. Prism integrates with LaTeX, an open source system used to format and typeset scientific papers, but goes significantly beyond most available LaTeX software tools. The program also leverages GPT 5.2’s visual capabilities to allow researchers to assemble diagrams from online whiteboard drawings, which can be a significant pain point with existing tools.\nPerhaps the most powerful feature comes from combining the usual powers of an AI model with more rigorous context management. When users open up a ChatGPT window through Prism, the model can access the full context of the research project, making responses both more germane and more intelligent. \nMuch of that would be possible for a savvy user of GPT-5.2, but OpenAI is hoping that a cleaner interface will draw in scientific researchers more quickly. Weil described it as the same combination of factors that made AI tools so powerful in software engineering.\n“Software engineering accelerated in part because of amazing models,” he told reporters, “and in part because of deep workflow integration.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

The company is instead focusing on offering that technology to third parties, like concession stands at sports stadiums.\n“While we’ve seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven’t yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,” the company wrote in its blog post.\nThese retail closures will not impact customers who use Amazon for grocery delivery. \nIt’s not surprising that Amazon will divest from its branded retail stores, given that Amazon has been cutting down on its physical retail presence over the last few years. Upon closing down some stores in 2024, an Amazon spokesperson said that the company “couldn’t make the economics work with the lease cost.”\nAmazon isn’t giving up on the brick-and-mortar side of its business, though. Instead, it will embrace the fact that people have a stronger brand affinity with Whole Foods Market than the Amazon Go convenience store. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAmazon will open more than 100 new Whole Foods stores over the next few years. The company says Whole Foods has seen over 40% sales growth and expansion to 550 stores since it was acquired by Amazon in 2017.\nAmazon also plans to open more Whole Foods Market Daily Shop locations — a smaller version of the grocery store with an emphasis on convenience and grab-and-go meals. These seem similar to the idea behind Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores, but people probably feel better about grabbing a salad from Whole Foods than the Amazon Fresh store … even though they’re the same company.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nHelp desk automation is a billion-dollar industry, and one of the most likely to be disrupted by tech built upon AI. Major players like Zendesk, ServiceNow, and Freshworks currently dominate the space, but lots of smaller startups are betting that reshuffling workflows will give them a chance to cut in.\nRisotto is one of those startups, and after today, it will have plenty of runway to test its theory. The company on Tuesday said it has raised a $10 million seed round led by Bonfire Ventures, with participation from 645 Ventures, Y Combinator, Ritual Capital, and SurgePoint Capital.\nDesigned to autonomously resolve help desk tickets, Risotto sits between ticket management systems like Jira and the complex internal tooling needed to resolve them. The product is built on a third-party foundation model, but CEO Aron Solberg says the core of the business is the infrastructure that sits between the model and the customer, keeping the non-deterministic nature of the model in check.\n“Our special sauce is the prompt libraries, the eval suites, and the thousands and thousands of real-world examples that the AI gets trained on to ensure it actually does what it’s expected to do,” Solberg told TechCrunch.\nWorking with the payroll company Gusto, Risotto was able to automate away 60% of the company’s support tickets. Its current work is focused on conventional ticketing systems, but Risotto is also positioning itself for a more radical shift in the industry, as AI triggers more fundamental changes in the way help desks function.\n“With 95% of our customers, humans still solve tickets the traditional way,” Solberg said. “But we see the newer companies shifting to have the primary interface between humans and the technology be an LLM.”\nIn practical terms, this would mean tasks are managed through tools like ChatGPT for Enterprise, which coordinate help-desk tickets alongside a range of other professional tasks. Solberg says his team has already worked on integrations with ChatGPT for Enterprise and Gemini, connecting Risotto over MCP.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf that approach becomes more common, it would mean significant changes for the industry at large. Risotto and similar products would function as tools that would be called by a central AI, offering more focused and reliable service than a general-purpose system could perform on its own. It’s a new paradigm for thinking about SaaS products — one where reliability and context-management are more important than human-friendly interfaces.\nIn the meantime, Risotto’s most immediate value proposition comes from taming the mess of different IT systems. As Solberg sees it, there is still plenty of value in making it easier to use existing ticketing systems.\n“One of our customers has four full-time employees just to manage Jira,” Solberg says. “And that’s to say nothing about implementing AI. That’s just to wrangle the platform itself.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nOn a Monday night NBC News segment, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei expressed concern over “some of the things we’ve seen in the last few days,” referring to the violence of Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis.\nAmodei focused on the importance of preserving democracy at home, both on NBC and in a post on X that specifically called out “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.” On NBC, he said he’s a believer in arming democracies to defend against autocratic countries, and that “we need to defend our own democratic values at home.” He added that Anthropic has no contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nMeanwhile, in an internal Slack message to OpenAI employees that got leaked to The New York Times, Sam Altman said, “What’s happening with ICE is going too far.”\n“Part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach,” Altman wrote. “There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.”\nTech workers, including employees of both companies, have been calling on their chiefs to call the White House and demand that ICE leave U.S. cities in the aftermath of Border Patrol agents killing two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis. In an open letter, tech workers also urged their CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE and speak out publicly against ICE’s violence. \nEmployees calling for CEOs to take action are encouraged and want more to join the ranks.\n“We’re glad to hear the CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic condemning the ICE murders,” the ICEout.tech organizers, whose identities remain unknown, told TechCrunch. “Now we need to hear from CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, all of whom have remained silent despite calls all across the industry.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile Amodei and Altman may be taking something of a stand — one in public, the other internally — both CEOs couched their statements with praise for President Trump, as well. \nAmodei applauded Trump’s consideration to allow Minnesota authorities to conduct an independent investigation into the shootings by federal agents after multiple videos of Alex Pretti’s death circulated online. (It remains to be seen if that investigation will happen, but a growing number of Republicans have begun to call for an investigation, as well.) \nIn Altman’s message to his staff he also said he was encouraged by Trump’s more recent responses and said he hopes the president, “a very strong leader,” will “rise to this moment and unite the country.”\nAltman assured them that OpenAI would “try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best we can, engage with leaders and push for our values, and speak up clearly about it as needed.” Altman has yet to publicly criticize the administration’s immigration agenda, or how it is deploying Border Patrol agents into American cities. \nJ.J. Colao, founder of PR firm Haymaker Group and one of the signatories on ICEout.tech’s letter, called Altman out for trying to “have it both ways” by calling Trump a strong leader, “as if the president bears no responsibility for ICE’s actions.” He added: “On net, I think his statement is helpful, but the performative tribute to the president does a lot to diminish it.”\nOf course, the Trump administration’s current AI-forward policies have helped fuel explosive growth at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic over the past year; OpenAI raised at least $40 billion and is in talks to raise another $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation, and Anthropic has raised $19 billion and is in talks to raise another $25 billion at a $350 billion valuation.\nStill, such words of praise for Trump is an about-face for Altman. In the lead up to Trump’s first term in 2016, Altman posted the following to his own blog:\n“[Trump] is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are…To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.”\nAt that time, he called Trump a “demagogic hate-monger” who dangles the lie that he will “Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders” to distract from the fact that he actually has “no serious plan for how to restore economic growth.” Altman acknowledged that he took some risk by writing his post, and ended on a quote that has been attributed to Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”\n“This would be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up,” he wrote.\nAnd Amodei also appeared to be more passionate about his opposition to Trump allowing Nvidia to sell AI chips to China, calling the decision “crazy” last week during the World Economic Forum and likening it to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”\nWhether these CEOs are doing everything that some among their workforce want them to do remains to be seen. Still, given what’s at stake for their companies, even internal and mild-mannered critiques are notable.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and OpenAI for comment. \nThis story has been updated with comment from J.J.

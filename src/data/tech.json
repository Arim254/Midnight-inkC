    "body": "\nApple is getting serious about succession planning, according to a new report in The Financial Times.\nThe company’s board and senior executives are reportedly preparing for the possibility that Tim Cook could step down as CEO as soon as early next year. This would come after Apple’s earnings report in late January, giving the new leadership team time to settle into their roles before Apple’s big events like the Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\nThe 65-year-old Cook has been Apple’s chief executive since Steve Jobs resigned in 2011; he’s now served as CEO for longer than Jobs. Under his leadership, Apple has grown from a market capitalization of $350 billion to $4 trillion, although the company has apparently struggled to find the right direction with AI.\nNo final decisions have been made about Cook’s successor or the timing of his departure, the FT says. However, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus is reportedly seen as the most likely candidate for the company’s next CEO.\n",

Every few months, Ramp has raised another large sum at another giant new valuation. On Monday, the fintech announced it had raised $300 million led by Lightspeed, which also included an employee tender offer.\nThis is just a few months after a $500 million Series E-2 at a $22.5 billion valuation led by Iconiq, announced on July 30. That round was just a few weeks after a $200M Series E at $16 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, announced in mid-June. And that Series E was just three months after a $150 million secondary share sale at a $13 billion valuation in March.  \nPrior to 2025, Ramp had previously raised in April 2024 a $150 million Series D co-led by Khosla and Founders Fund at a $7.65 valuation. \nWith Monday’s round, Ramp has raised $2.3 billion in total equity financing, it says. And in 2025 alone, the company leapt from being worth $13 billion to $32 billion. \nRamp in October said it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue, meaning it was on a trajectory to bring in that much on a 12-month basis. \nRamp today offers corporate expense management. While it has an AI story to tell – automating some approvals and processes via agentic offerings – it is not an AI company per se. It offers corporate credit cards, expense management/purchase order software, and corporate travel.

    "body": "\nIf you pay attention to what the biggest tech companies are saying about AI demand, you’ll notice a common thread: they’re running short of compute capacity. That means the large language models underpinning AI products today need even more data centers to be trained and for inferencing, and therefore, they need more power. Against that backdrop, energy efficiency has suddenly become a critical priority for semiconductor manufacturers. \nPowerLattice, a startup founded by veteran electrical engineers from Qualcomm, NUVIA, and Intel in 2023, claims to have developed a groundbreaking approach that reduces the power needs of computer chips by more than 50%. On Monday, the startup emerged from stealth with a $25 million Series A funding round led by Playground Global and Celesta Capital, bringing its total funding to $31 million.\n“This is the hard stuff: How do you get power into the device? There are very few teams and people that can do it,” said Pat Gelsinger, general partner at Playground Global. “We have assembled what I’d argue is the dream team of power delivery.”\nAs the former CEO of Intel, Gelsinger carries significant authority in the semiconductor world, which makes his participation a powerful stamp of approval for PowerLattice.\nIn fact, when the startup’s CEO Dr. Peng Zou and its founding team pitched their idea at Playground’s offices in March, they were so star-struck by Gelsinger’s fame that they asked him for a selfie, Gelsinger told TechCrunch. The admiration proved mutual, as Gelsinger came away genuinely impressed with PowerLattice’s technology.\nThe startup’s tech sounds simple in concept: a tiny power delivery chiplet that’s designed to bring power closer to the processor, significantly minimizing energy loss.\nTwo years in, PowerLattice has already achieved its first key milestone: Its first batch of chiplets is being produced by TSMC, in partnership with an unnamed manufacturer that is testing the startup’s functionality, Gelsinger said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBeyond its initial customer, the startup plans to make its product available for testing by other customers in the first half of 2026. The trials should prove instructive, given that PowerLattice’s potential customer set includes major chip manufacturers Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, as well as specialized AI chip developers, such as Cerberus, Grok, and Playground-backed startups d-Matrix and NextSilicon.\nAlthough every chip company has internal teams working on improving energy efficiency, Gelsinger hopes that PowerLattice’s innovative approach will pique their interest.\n“They may say, ‘I’m going to take some volume to this approach, some volume to my more traditional approach’,” he said. “But we think our ability to capture meaningful share will quickly emerge.”\nPowerLattice is not the only startup attempting to help chip manufacturers address the energy problem. The company would compete most closely with Empower Semiconductor, a startup that raised a $140 million Series D, led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, in September.\nHowever, Gelsinger is certain that PowerLattice’s 50% energy efficiency gain is an “extraordinary” result, and he expects the company to soon raise a much larger funding round to fund production.\n“The idea is bold, the benefits are large, and I expect others will be saying, ‘That’s a great idea. Let me try as well,’” Gelsinger said.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNetworking giant Cisco has acquired EzDub, a Y-Combinator-backed consumer startup that provides real-time translation services. Cisco announced the acquisition over the weekend, but the company didn’t disclose the size of the deal.\nEzDubs was founded by Padmanabhan Krishnamurthy, Amrutavarsh Kinagi, and Kareem Nassar in 2023. Notably, Nassar had previously worked at Cisco’s Speech AI group before co-founding the startup. The company raised $4.2 million in seed funding led by Venture Highway, which was founded by Neeraj Arora, who was previously WhatsApp’s chief business officer. Other investors in EzDubs include Replit CEO Amjad Masad; Replit President Michele Catasta; Qasar Younis, who is CEO of the autonomous vehicle software company Applied Intuition; and Ben Firshman, CEO of the cloud startup Replicate (which was itself acquired by Cloudflare in a deal that was announced on Monday).\nCisco said it plans to integrate EzDubs’ tech into its communication platform, Cisco Collaboration, which spans hardware and software. This means users can get features like live translation in products like Webex video calling and messaging. Cisco’s blog post also indicated that it could make the translation tech — which preserves the speaker’s original voice — available to partners and developers.\n“The EzDubs team will join Cisco Collaboration, working side-by-side with our product, engineering, and go-to-market teams. Together, we will chart a new course for the industry, one where AI doesn’t just support collaboration, but truly empowers it,” Snorre Kjesbu, SVP of Collaboration at Cisco, said in the post. \nCisco didn’t clarify whether all members of EzDubs’ team are joining the company. We have asked the company to clarify and will update the story if we hear back.\nEzDubs is sunsetting its consumer apps, which supported call translations for more than 30 languages, by December 15. \n“From launching the world’s first video dubbing tool that garnered millions of views on X (fka Twitter) to enabling real-time, voice and emotion preserving phone call translation across 30+ languages, this journey has been extraordinary. But what has truly meant the most is the support, feedback, and stories you’ve shared along the way,” the startup said in a blog post. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn recent months, there have been a few acquisitions in the translation space. This month, Seven Seven Six-backed Palabra AI acquired live communication platform Talo. In July, language localization company TransPerfect acquired Unbabel, a translation startup founded in Portugal. \nEzDubs’ acquisition also raises the question of whether it’s viable to build a translation focused on consumers when there is more money and demand in the enterprise communication market. According to various reports, the translation services market is valued at approximately $40 billion.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThree years ago, Luminal co-founder Joe Fioti was working on chip design at Intel when he came to a realization. While he was working on making the best chips he could, the more important bottleneck was in software.\n“You can make the best hardware on earth, but if it’s hard for developers to use, they’re just not going to use it,” he told me.\nNow, he’s started a company that focuses entirely on that problem. On Monday, Luminal announced $5.3 million in seed funding, in a round led by Felicis Ventures with angel investment from Paul Graham, Guillermo Rauch, and Ben Porterfield. \nFioti’s co-founders, Jake Stevens and Matthew Gunton, come from Apple and Amazon, respectively, and the company was part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 batch.\nLuminal’s core business is simple: the company sells compute, just like neo-cloud companies like Coreweave or Lambda Labs. But where those companies focus on GPUs, Luminal has focused on optimization techniques that let the company squeeze more compute out of the infrastructure it has. In particular, the company focuses on optimizing the compiler that sits between written code and the GPU hardware — the same developer systems that caused Fioti so many headaches in his previous job.\nAt the moment, the industry’s leading compiler is Nvidia’s CUDA system — an underrated element in the company’s runaway success. But many elements of CUDA are open-source, and Luminal is betting that, with many in the industry still scrambling for GPUs, there will be a lot of value to be gained in building out the rest of the stack.\nIt’s part of a growing cohort of inference-optimization startups, which have grown more valuable as companies look for faster and cheaper ways to run their models. Inference providers like Baseten and Together AI have long specialized in optimization, and smaller companies like Tensormesh and Clarifai are now popping up to focus on more specific technical tricks.\nLuminal and other members of the cohort will face stiff competition from optimization teams at major labs, which have the benefit of optimizing for a single family of models. Working for clients, Luminal has to adapt to whatever model comes their way. But even with the risk of being out-gunned by the hyperscalers, Fioti says the market is growing fast enough that he’s not worried.\n“It is always going to be possible to spend six months hand tuning a model architecture on a given hardware, and you’re probably going to beat any sorts of, any sort of compiler performance,” Fioti says. “But our big bet is that anything short of that, the all-purpose use case is still very economically valuable.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nSequoia-backed fintech platform Aspora, which lets the Indian diaspora send money back to India, is launching a new feature for users to pay bills. This means Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) can pay utility bills or recharge their mobile prepaid plans for their family.\nThe startup said that until now, users had to either transfer the money to their Indian accounts or ask someone to handle the bills for them. The other option for them was to use their foreign cards and try and pay bills while facing high charges and payment failures.\nAspora has hooked up to the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS), which handles bill payments in India, using Yes Bank’s domestic pipeline. Through this system, it has enabled payment for more than 22,000 billers in India, ranging from electricity providers such as BSES and BESCOM, broadband providers like Jio and Airtel, and loan payments for major banks.\nThe startup said it’s not charging any fees for these payments, and the users get the best exchange rates to pay the bill directly in foreign currency.\n“For millions of Indians living overseas, paying bills in India has always been unnecessarily complex – involving transfers, delays, and double fees. Aspora has now solved this large-scale problem at the tap of a button”,  Aspora founder and CEO Parth Garg told TechCrunch in a recent phone interview.\nGarg said bill payments might reduce remittances, but only by 4% to 5% of total transfers. Garg believes giving users the ability to pay bills will create long-term stickiness.\n“Today, the goal for any Neo bank is to try to get more and more transactions on your app. With remittances, people used to use the app once or twice a month. Because of this new bill payment system. The new feature increases velocity on our platform and has our users visit the platform more frequently,” Garg mentioned.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe said Aspora has been testing this feature with a few thousand users for a several weeks now, and it has seen positive results. The startup noted that mobile recharges were a big use case that emerged out of this test. BBPS doesn’t support some categories, like mobile recharge or credit card payments for foreign payers. That is why Apsora has partnered with international mobile recharge company Ding to facilitate these transactions.\nThe feature is available for customers in the UK, and the company plans to make it available to users in the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) soon.\nIn June, Aspora raised $50 million in Series B funding at a $500 million valuation, led by Sequoia. Other investors Greylock, Hummingbird, Quantum Light Ventures, and Y Combinator also contributed to the round. The company has raised more than $99 million in funding to date. The startup opened up its services in July to NRIs in the U.S. market, which accounts for the top inward remittance market for India, with nearly 28% market share according to the country’s central bank.\nAspora has now reached 800,000 customers, who have done transactions of $4 billion and saved $25 million in transfer fees, according to the company. \nAspora aims to launch NRE (Non-Resident External) accounts to let users manage foreign income and NRO (Non-Resident Ordinary) accounts to let users manage incoming earned in India next year.  \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon’s budding satellite internet program is no longer called Project Kuiper. It is now known simply as “Leo.” The name change comes as the company appears to be shifting its focus from “unserved or underserved” communities to securing larger commercial contracts.\nThe satellite network has been in the works since 2019 and, as Amazon tells it, the name Project Kuiper was only ever supposed to be temporary. Leo is a nod to the network’s location in what’s known as low-Earth orbit, commonly referred to in the space industry as “LEO.”\nAs Amazon worked toward launching the first Kuiper satellites earlier this year, the company boasted that the project was an “initiative to increase global broadband access” with a noble-sounding “mission to bring fast, affordable broadband” to communities that aren’t well-served by traditional internet providers.\nBut, as TechCrunch previously noted, the company has changed the language it uses to describe the service in recent months as it inked deals with Airbus and JetBlue, putting the network more squarely in competition with SpaceX’s Starlink service.\nAmazon didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nAn archived version of the main FAQ page for Kuiper — published in late 2024 — puts the aforementioned “mission” to serve those communities right at the top of the post. Affordability is mentioned three times throughout, with Amazon calling it a “key principle of Project Kuiper.”\n“Amazon has a longstanding commitment to low prices, and lots of experience building popular, low-cost devices like Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick,” reads the answer to a question on the archived post about how much Kuiper service will cost. “We’re applying a similar approach with Project Kuiper.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat question-and-answer about cost is now gone from the Leo FAQ, and there is no mention of “affordability” anywhere on the page.\nThe language at the top of the new FAQ is also different. It states that Leo is “Amazon’s low Earth orbit satellite network, designed to provide fast, reliable internet to customers and communities beyond the reach of existing networks.” \nWhile the Leo FAQ mentions that poor connectivity can “create an economic disadvantage for people, businesses, and other organizations operating in unserved and underserved parts of the world,” the company is less specific than it used to be about putting those communities front and center in the customer pipeline.\nAmazon Leo’s new website is even more blatant about how it is prioritizing home and commercial internet service. It promotes the ability to make “seamless video calls, stream 4K videos,” and “handle your whole family’s internet needs,” as well as the fact that Leo is “[f]lexible, scalable, enterprise-ready.”\nThe idea of using Leo “even in rural and remote locations” is brought up as almost an afterthought on the main website, and there is no mention of cost or affordability.\nDespite all this, on Thursday, Amazon posted a flashy video about the name change on X. Among other things, it shows a kid using her computer to do homework, professional drift racing, ambulance workers on a remote road, a farmer using a tablet, and a couple dancing in a laundromat. Along with the video, it wrote: “New name, same mission.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nSwedish automaker Volvo has cancelled a five-year-old contract with Luminar, the latest escalation in an increasingly-ugly brawl between the lidar sensor company and its biggest customer.\nThe fight is happening during an existential moment for Luminar. The company recently defaulted on several of its loans. While it’s working with those lenders on a resolution, Luminar has warned investors it may have to declare bankruptcy.\nTo stave that off, Luminar recently laid off 25% of its staff and is trying to sell itself — or parts of itself — to potential buyers. One of them is Luminar founder Austin Russell, who resigned from the CEO role in May during an ethics inquiry. Luminar is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, recent filings reveal.\n“Volvo Cars has made this decision to limit the company’s supply chain risk exposure and it is a direct result of Luminar’s failure to meet its contractual obligations to Volvo Cars,” the automaker said in a statement to TechCrunch. Luminar did not respond to a request for comment.\nVolvo is not just a Luminar customer. The two companies have spent much of the last decade working together. Volvo invested in Luminar and helped the Florida-based startup get into some of its first production vehicles. \nThe relationship has been mutually beneficial. Luminar’s tech gave Volvo the confidence to dish out big promises about making the roads safer by offering automated driving features. Volvo gave Luminar credibility ahead of a 2020 SPAC merger that made Russell one of the youngest self-made billionaires ever.\nBut Luminar has faced challenges as a public company. It struggled to diversify away from Volvo, and in 2024 cut a fifth of its staff while deciding to outsource manufacturing of its sensors. Then, in May of this year, Russell abruptly resigned as Luminar revealed its board had opened a “code of business conduct and ethics” inquiry. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe fight with Volvo bubbled to the surface on October 31. \nThe company told shareholders in a regulatory filing on that day that Volvo decided to no longer make Luminar’s “Iris” lidar a standard sensor on its EX90 and ES90 vehicles. Volvo also told Luminar that it had “deferred” the decision of whether to include its next-generation “Halo” sensor in the Swedish automaker’s future vehicles. \nLuminar said in the filing that it had “made a claim against Volvo for significant damages” and “suspended further commitments of Iris” for the automaker. \n“The Company is in discussions with Volvo concerning the dispute; however, there can be no assurance that the dispute will be resolved favorably or at all,” Luminar wrote.\nVolvo told TechCrunch Monday that its “products can deliver a high level of safety and driver support, enabled by the cars’ powerful core computing coupled with their advanced sensor set – with or without a lidar.” But, it added, the “situation has an effect on some customer orders.” It did not immediately explain whether that meant a delay, or something else.\nVolvo’s decisions were not just a threat to Luminar’s revenue — they also had knock-on effects for Luminar. In the October filing, Luminar said it stopped spending money on Iris sensors for Volvo, and in turn, the supplier that makes the sensors claimed this was a breach of their agreement.\nThis story has been updated with comments from Volvo. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nA Russian telecom company that develops technology to allow phone and internet companies to conduct web surveillance and censorship was hacked, had its website defaced, and had data stolen from its servers, TechCrunch has learned.\nFounded in Russia, Protei makes telecommunications systems for phone and internet providers across dozens of countries, including Bahrain, Italy, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Pakistan and much of central Africa. The company, now headquartered in Jordan, sells video conferencing technology and internet connectivity solutions, as well as surveillance equipment and web-filtering products, such as deep packet inspection systems.\nIt’s not clear exactly when or how Protei was hacked, but a copy of the company’s website saved on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine shows it was defaced on November 8. The website was restored soon after.\nDuring the breach, the hacker obtained the contents of Protei’s web server — around 182 gigabytes of files — including emails dating back years.\nA copy of Protei’s data was provided to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit transparency collective that indexes leaked datasets in the public interest, including data from law enforcement, government agencies, and companies involved in the surveillance industry.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\nMohammad Jalal, the managing director of Protei’s branch in Jordan, did not respond to a request for comment about the breach. \nThe identity of the hacker is not known, nor their motivations, but the defaced website read: “another DPI/SORM provider bites the dust.” The message likely references the company’s sales of deep packet inspection systems and other internet filtering technology for the Russian-developed lawful intercept system known as SORM.\nSORM is the main lawful intercept system used across Russia as well as several other countries that use Russian technology. Phone and internet providers install SORM equipment on their networks, which allows their country’s governments to obtain the contents of calls, text messages, and web browsing data of the networks’ customers. \nDeep-packet inspection devices allow telecom companies to identify and filter web traffic depending on its source, such as a social media website or a specific messaging app, and selectively block access. These systems are used for surveillance and censorship in regions where freedom of speech and expression are limited.\nThe Citizen Lab reported in 2023 that Iranian telecoms giant Ariantel had consulted with Protei about technology for logging internet traffic and blocking access to certain websites. Documents seen and published by The Citizen Lab show that Protei touted its technology’s ability to restrict or block access to websites for specific people or entire swathes of the population.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs U.S. giants like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic race to develop the large language models that underpin their AI products, startups such as Sakana AI, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, and AI21 Labs are carving out their own niche with specialized models designed for specific regions, industries, or unique features.\nIn pursuit of that goal, Tokyo-based Sakana AI has closed a ¥20 billion (approximately $135 million) Series B funding round, which values the company at $2.65 billion post-money, up from a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, CEO David Ha told TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2023 by former Google researchers Llion Jones, Ren Ito, and Ha, Sakana AI makes affordable generative AI models that work well with small datasets and are optimized for the Japanese language and culture.\nThe Series B round drew a mix of new and returning investors, combining Japan’s financial heavyweights like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) with global venture players such as Khosla Ventures, Macquarie Capital, NEA, Lux Capital, and In-Q-Tel (IQT).\n“We plan to deploy the new capital for not only R&D, including [AI] model development, but also to expand our workforce for engineering, sales, and distribution teams in Japan,” Ha said. This year, Sakana has expanded its presence in Japan, teaming up with leading local enterprises, including Daiwa and MUFG, and developing AI solutions.\nHa, who previously led research at Stability AI and worked at Google and Goldman Sachs, also said Sakana plans to expand its enterprise business beyond finance into the industrial, manufacturing, and government sectors in 2026.\nLooking ahead, the company is eyeing the defense, intelligence, and manufacturing sectors. The two-year-old startup also said it will be “actively pursuing strategic investment, partnerships, and M&A for long-term global growth.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSakana says it sees strong global demand for sovereign AI solutions that reflect “national cultures and values.” The Japanese startup added that focusing its R&D efforts on AI products after LLMs are trained helps it efficiently build advanced models tailored to Japan, taking a path distinct from the large-scale AI model race.\nThis funding round comes roughly a year after the company’s Series A round, in which it raised about ¥30 billion ($214 million) at a $1.5 billion valuation. Sakana had raised roughly $244 million in total as of March 2025, according to PitchBook, so this round would take that total to about $379 million.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nAccording to a new report from the International Energy Agency, the world will spend $580 billion on data centers this year — $40 billion more than will be spent finding new oil supplies.\nThose numbers help to illustrate some big shifts in the global economy, and comparing data centers and oil seems particularly apt given concerns about how generative AI might accelerate climate change.\nKirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed the report’s findings on the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast.\nThere’s no question that these new data centers are going to be hungry for power and that they could place even more stress on already taxed electrical grids. But Kirsten pointed to a potential upside, with solar poised to power many of these new projects, which could also create new opportunities for startups pursuing innovative approaches to renewable energy.\nWe also discussed how these projects will be funded, with OpenAI saying it has committed  $1.4 trillion to building data centers, Meta committing $600 billion, and Anthropic recently announcing a $50 billion data center plan.\nYou can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.\nKirsten: Here’s what I think is the potential upside. So Tim De Chant, who’s our climate tech reporter, has done a ton of reporting about not just data centers, but actually how a lot of data centers are turning to renewables because in terms of regulatory [hurdles] and cost, they are the go-to. It’s a lot easier to get a permit to throw up a bunch of solar panels adjacent to a data center.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo to me, the one upside is that it could really mean a positive for any kind of company that is doing interesting things around renewables or data center design and some of the technology to reduce the global emissions component of it.\nBut of course, the sheer number to me is what really stood out. As a former energy reporter myself, I know how much is spent on trying to find new oil.\nRebecca: I mean, it’s a lot. And a lot of that’s coming from the U.S. I think that report found that half of the electricity demand will be coming from the U.S., and the rest is a mix of China and Europe.\nAnd another thing that struck me about it was that most of the data centers are coming to cities, or near cities, like populations of a million people, roughly. So that means there’s a lot more challenge with the grid connection and with connection pathways. I think that, to your point, renewables will have to [be a focus] — it’s just good business, it’s not because of any environmentally friendly policies.\nKirsten: Redwood Materials’ new business unit, Redwood Energy, is going to be an interesting company to watch with this. A few months ago, I went to their big reveal, and they’re taking the old EV batteries that aren’t quite ready to be recycled, and then they’re creating these microgrids, and then specifically going after AI data centers. And that, to me, would alleviate the problem or the concern that you just mentioned.\nThe question is: Are other companies going to do this? Are there other Redwood Energies out there that are trying to do the same thing? And how much of an impact could they make? Because I do think that like the pressure on the electrical grid, especially during certain times of the year, like in the middle of the summer, for instance, places like Texas that have rolling brownouts and blackouts, that is going to be a real concern. And it could spur a whole new kind of investment into companies doing what Redwood is doing.\nAnthony: It also underlines this question about what is that going to do to the spaces that we live in? Even if they’re not in cities themselves, I feel like the landscape is definitely going to be transformed by construction at this scale.\nAnd then, of course, there’s also this question of how much of [the planned data centers are] actually going to get built because there’s definitely very ambitious plans that require huge amounts of spending.\nTo start with OpenAI, that’s a company that a lot of people have been talking about, how much money are they actually making versus the trillions of dollars of capital commitments they have for the next decade. And then there was this whole controversy over their CFO saying, “The government should backstop our loans to build these data centers.” And then she’s like, “No, no, no, no, no, I didn’t mean backstop, that was a poor choice of words,” but it does look like they have been asking for an expansion of tax credits from the CHIPS Act. \nI think that this is going to be an effort that’s not just going to fall on the companies, but also on the government — or at least that’s going to be a question that the government is considering over the next few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nOn Monday, a new Model Context Protocol security startup called Runlayer launched out of stealth with $11 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures’ Keith Rabois and Felicis. \nIt was created by third-time founder Andrew Berman (previous companies: baby-monitor maker Nanit and an AI video conferencing tool, Vowel, that sold to Zapier in 2024).\nIn the four months since Runlayer launched its product in stealth, it has signed dozens of customers, including eight unicorns or public companies like Gusto, dbt Labs, Instacart, and Opendoor, it says. It also nabbed David Soria Parra, the lead creator of MCP, as an angel and advisor, Berman tells TechCrunch. (Parra did not respond to our request for comment.) \nParra’s team at Anthropic launched the protocol in November 2024 as an open source project. MCP has since become the de facto standard for allowing AI agents to connect with the data and systems they need to work independently. It allows agents to access data, move it, alter it, and execute business processes without human oversight. \nThe protocol is now supported by every major model maker including OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, and Google, as well as thousands of tech and enterprise companies; just to name a few: Atlassian, Asana, Stripe, Block, and others ranging from banks to consumer goods manufacturers. \n“Everyone talks about AI,” Berman, Runlayer’s CEO, told TechCrunch, “but AI is really only as useful as the tools and the resources it has access to.”\nThe problem is, the MCP protocol itself doesn’t include much security out of the box, so many MCP implementations have already been found to be vulnerable in a variety of ways.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe poster children are probably GitHub and Asana. In May, researchers at Invariant Labs discovered a prompt injection vulnerability in MCP servers that allowed them to grab data from private GitHub repositories (ones that shouldn’t have been accessible to the public). Asana discovered and fixed a vulnerability in its MCP server in June that could have exposed customer data. There have since been many more types of attacks found to work on common MCP server setups.  \nAs you might expect, such security issues have given rise to numerous MCP security products, including products from big-name companies like Cloudflare, Docker, and Wiz — as well as a host of startups tackling more specific products. \nThe most common type of MCP security product these days is a gateway, essentially a security layer for identifying the agents and controlling their access to apps. \nRunlayer plans to stand out in this crowded market by being an all-in-one security tool that combines a gateway with features like threat detection that analyzes every MCP request; observability that watched all agentic activity across all MCP servers that IT has permitted; enterprise development where IT can build custom AI automations for enterprise users; and detailed permissions that work with existing identity providers like Okta and Entra. \nLike other competitors, such as open source Obot, Runlayer business users are presented with an Okta-like catalog of the pre-vetted MCP servers that their IT will allow agents to access. Runlayer matches the agents’ app permissions to the human users’ permissions. For instance, some people might have read-only access to financial systems, some write access (the ability to change the data). Others have no access at all.  \nBerman believes Runlayer stands out from the crowd, not just with the breadth of the product, but because of the team’s experience. He founded the startup because, after selling Vowel to Zapier, he became the director of Zapier’s AI, and built one of the first MCP servers, working closely at the time with OpenAI and Anthropic, he said.  \n“What are the problems that we saw with the protocol? One, it was the security risk because it was adopted so quickly,” he said. There were “blind spots” in areas like observability and audits, that make it risky for enterprises to roll out to users.\nSo in August, “we left our jobs. We signed up David Soria Parra, the creator of the spec, and in four months, we’ve signed up eight unicorns,” he said of himself and his co-founders from Zapier Tal Peretz and Vitor Balocco.\nOther advisors and investors in the company, Berman says, include head of security at Cursor Travis McPeak, and founder of Neon Nikita Shamgunov. \n",

    "body": "\nGoogle is rolling out new AI-powered features to book and plan travel in Search, the company announced on Monday. The tech giant is expanding availability for its AI-powered “Flight Deals” tool, adding the ability for users to organize travel plans with its “Canvas” tool in AI Mode, and launching agentic booking capabilities to more people.\nGoogle first launched Flight Deals back in August in the U.S., Canada, and India. Now, the company is expanding the AI-powered search tool within Google Flights globally to help people quickly find affordable destinations.\nTo get started, users need to describe where, when, and how they want to travel. Flight Deals will then use AI to display the best bargains available. \nFlight Deals is now rolling out to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including the U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, and Korea. The tool is also getting support for more than 60 languages.\nImage Credits:Google\nAs for the new AI Mode features, Google says users can now use the built-in Canvas tool to create travel plans. Canvas, which first launched as a way to build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel, can now help users plan their upcoming trips.\nUsers need to tell AI mode what type of trip they’re looking for and then select the “Create with Canvas” option. \n“Right away, you’ll get a plan in the Canvas side panel that brings together real-time Search data for flights and hotels, details from Google Maps like photos and reviews and relevant information from sites across the web,” Google explained in a blog post. “You’ll find suggestions that fit your criteria, like hotel comparisons based on pricing and amenities or ideas for restaurants and activities optimized by travel time from where you’re staying.”\nUsers can then ask follow-up questions and get help with tradeoffs, like choosing a hotel that’s closer to a brunch place you want to try but a bit farther from the hiking trails you want to explore.\nImage Credits:Google\nTravel planning with Canvas is available on desktop in the U.S. for users who are opted into the AI Mode experiment in Labs.\nAdditionally, Google announced that it’s bringing AI Mode’s agentic capabilities to more people. Earlier this year, Google announced that users who were opted into Labs could now get help with booking restaurant reservations, event tickets, and beauty and wellness appointments in AI Mode. Now, the company is making this capability available to all U.S. users. \nUsers can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. AI Mode will then search across different reservation platforms to find real-time availability for restaurants that match the inquiry. It then surfaces a curated list of options to choose from.\nIn the future, Google says it will make it possible to finish booking flights and hotels directly in AI Mode. Users will be able to describe what they’re looking for and then compare different flights or hotels and browse information like schedules, prices, room photos, amenities, and reviews. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

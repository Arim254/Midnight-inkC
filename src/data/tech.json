If the company attracts investors at the top of that range it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion.\nThe Vermont-based company, which was founded in 2017 by its enigmatic CEO Kyle Clark, filed the paperwork Wednesday despite the government shutdown. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that allows companies in IPO limbo to allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule.\nClark, a Harvard-educated former professional hockey player and pilot instructor, has not followed the typical path of a startup founder. He eschewed Silicon Valley for his Vermont hometown and took a different path to raising funds to develop and build electric aircraft. Beta has never taken venture capital, instead raising $1.15 billion in funds from institutional investors like Fidelity and Qatar Investment Authority.\nLast month, Beta Technologies announced a strategic deal with GE Aerospace to build a hybrid-electric turbogenerator for next-gen aircraft. GE Aerospace agreed to take a stake in the company and invest $300 million as part of the deal.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n",

The CSRC has the final authority to determine whether a company can go public overseas.\nBoth companies appear ready to proceed with their respective proposed global offering and listing.

    "body": "\nSemiconductor design company Arm is partnering up with Meta to enhance the social media giant’s AI systems amid an unprecedented infrastructure buildout. Under the partnership, Meta’s ranking and recommendation systems will move to Arm’s Neoverse platform, which was recently optimized for AI systems in the cloud, among other implementations.\n“AI is transforming how people connect and create,” Santosh Janardhan, Meta’s head of infrastructure, said in a statement. “Partnering with Arm enables us to efficiently scale that innovation to the more than 3 billion people who use Meta’s apps and technologies.”\nBest known for its mobile CPU architecture, Arm’s GPU offerings have often been overshadowed by competitors like Nvidia. But Arm is now emphasizing its advantage in low-power deployments.\n“AI’s next era will be defined by delivering efficiency at scale,” Rene Haas, Arm’s CEO, said in a statement. “Partnering with Meta, we’re uniting Arm’s performance-per-watt leadership with Meta’s AI innovation.”\nThe multi-year partnership comes as Meta invests in vastly expanding its data center network to keep pace with anticipated demand for AI services. One project, code-named “Prometheus,” is expected to come online with multiple gigawatts of power in 2027. Construction is currently underway in New Albany, Ohio, and a 200-megawatt natural gas project is being constructed to directly serve the project’s power needs.\nMeta is also building a data center campus, code-named “Hyperion,” across 2,250 acres in northwest Louisiana that’s meant to deliver 5 gigawatts of computational power when complete. Construction is expected to continue through 2030, although some portions may come online before then.\nCrucially, Arm and Meta are not exchanging ownership stakes or significant physical infrastructure, setting this partnership apart from a number of recent AI infrastructure deals. Nvidia has been particularly aggressive with its investments — it recently committed to a $100 billion phased investment into OpenAI, as well as billion-dollar investments into Elon Musk’s xAI, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab, and French AI lab Mistral.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA rival to both Nvidia and Arm, AMD recently committed to supplying OpenAI with 6 gigawatts’ worth of compute capacity. As part of the deal, OpenAI will receive AMD stock options worth as much as 10% of the company.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

In the company’s testing, Haiku scored 73% on SWE-Bench verified and 41% on the command-line-focused Terminal-Bench — below Sonnet 4.5, but on par with Sonnet 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 in each case. Tests show similar results on benchmarks for tool use, computer use, and visual reasoning.\nThe new version of Haiku will be immediately available under all free Anthropic plans and the company believes it will be particularly appealing for free versions of AI products, where it can provide significant capabilities while minimizing server loads. The lightweight nature of the model also means it’s easier to deploy multiple Haiku agents in parallel or in combination with a more sophisticated model.\nIn a statement to press, Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said the Haiku would make new styles of deployment possible in production for the first time. “It’s opening up entirely new categories of what’s possible with AI in production environments – with Sonnet handling complex planning while Haiku-powered sub-agents execute at speed,” Krieger said. “We’re giving people a complete agent toolbox where each model has the right combination of intelligence, speed, and cost for different parts of the job.” \nThe most immediate applications are likely to come in software development tools, where Claude Code is already commonly used and latency is often a critical factor. In statements provided by Anthropic, Zencoder CEO Andrew Filev described the new version of Haiku as “unlocking an entirely new set of use cases.” \nHaiku 4.5 comes after a string of high-profile launches for Anthropic: just two weeks after the launch of Sonnet 4.5 and two months after the launch of Opus 4.1, both of which were hailed as state-of-the-art on release. The previous version of Haiku was released in October 2024.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nCybersecurity firm F5 Networks says government-backed hackers had “long-term, persistent access” to its network, which allowed them to steal the company’s source code and customer information.\nIn a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, F5 said it now “believes its containment actions have been successful,” after first discovering the hackers in its network on August 9.\nThe Seattle, Washington-based company, which specializes in providing application security and cybersecurity defenses for large companies and governments, said the hackers had access to its BIG-IP product development environment and its knowledge management systems, which included source code and publicly undisclosed security vulnerabilities.\nF5 said it wasn’t aware of any modifications to its software while in development, nor was it aware of any exploitation of the vulnerabilities. The company published several updates on Wednesday for its BIG-IP platform to fix the undisclosed security flaws and urged customers to patch them.\nThe company also said the hackers downloaded configurations and implementation information about some of its customers’ systems, files that could help hackers find and exploit potential design weaknesses, and potentially hack into those customers’ systems.\nF5 said in the notice that the U.S. Department of Justice allowed the company to delay its public disclosure. An F5 spokesperson would not say for what reason the delay was allowed, but the DOJ can allow companies to hold off on notifying the public if there is a “substantial risk to national security or public safety.”\nF5 has over 1,000 corporate customers and serves more than 85% of the Fortune 500, the largest public companies by revenue, including banks, tech companies, and critical infrastructure companies.\nThe U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre warned on Wednesday, following F5’s disclosure, that hackers could “enable a threat actor to exploit F5 devices and software.”\nCISA said in an email on Wednesday that it has ordered civilian federal agencies under an emergency directive to patch their systems by October 22, citing the security risks.\nThe company did not attribute the attacks to a particular government or nation-state-affiliated hacking group, and F5 spokesperson Dan Sorensen declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions beyond the company’s published statement, including how many customers are affected and if it was known how the hackers broke in to begin with. \nF5 is the latest tech company in recent years to have been hacked by government hackers, including Microsoft — by China, and Russia, at least twice; cloud and enterprise technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and several other companies as part of the broader Russian cyberattack on the software maker SolarWinds.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAI hyperscaler startup Nscale has signed a sizable deal with Microsoft to bring Nvidia AI hardware to multiple data centers.\nThe AI cloud provider announced on Wednesday that it signed a deal with Microsoft to bring approximately 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs to three data centers in Europe and one in the U.S.\nThese GPUs will be delivered through Nscale-owned operations and through a joint venture with investment company Aker, one of Nscale’s investors.\nAbout half of these GPUs, 104,000, will head to a data center in Texas leased by Ionic Digital, over the next 12 to 18 months. Nscale plans to increase its footprint at this location to 1.2 gigawatts, the company stated.\nNscale will also deploy 12,600 GPUs to the Start Campus data center in Sines, Portugal, starting in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe deal builds on previous plans with both Microsoft and Aker regarding data centers in Norway and the United Kingdom. Nscale will send 23,000 GPUS to its Loughton, England campus starting in 2027, and send the remaining 52,000 GPUs to Microsoft’s AI campus in Narvik, Norway.\n“This agreement confirms Nscale’s place as a partner of choice for the world’s most important technology leaders,” Josh Payne, founder and CEO of Nscale, said in a company press release. “Few companies are equipped to deliver GPU deployments at this scale, but we have the experience and have built the global pipeline to do so.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s a bold claim by Payne, considering that Nscale was founded in 2024. Since its launch, the company has raised more than $1.7 billion from strategic partners including Aker, Nokia and Nvidia. Nscale has also raised from investors like Sandton Capital Partners, G Squared and Point72, among others. Payne told the Financial Times that the company is looking at an IPO as early as the end of next year.\n“The pace with which we have expanded our capacity demonstrates both our readiness and our commitment to efficiency, sustainability and providing our customers with the most advanced technology available. It’s a clear signal that Nscale is setting a new standard for how the next wave of AI infrastructure will be delivered,” Payne said in the release.\nGPU deals have picked up in recent weeks. OpenAI announced it was purchasing six gigawatts’ worth of chips from AMD last week. OpenAI also recently inked a deal with Nvidia in which Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in the company in exchange for 10 gigawatts’ worth of chips in September.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAs AI makes it easier to create bots that act ever more human-like, Elon Musk’s X is developing a new feature that would expose more information about the users behind an X profile in an effort to help people better understand who they’re talking to on the platform.\nAccording to a new post by X’s head of product Nikita Bier, the social network will begin experimenting with displaying more information on user profiles, including details such as the date the account was created, its location, the number of username changes it has undergone, and how it’s utilizing X’s service.\n\nWhen you read content on X, you should be able to verify its authenticity. This is critical to getting a pulse on important issues happening in the world.As part of that, we're experimenting with displaying new information on profiles, including which country an account is… pic.twitter.com/OYgT1OiJdA— Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) October 14, 2025\n\nThe idea is that by exposing some of these details, users will be able to make a more informed decision about whether someone is operating an authentic account or if they’re possibly a bot or bad actor attempting to sow misinformation. \nFor instance, if an account’s bio claims they’re based in a U.S. state, but their account information shows it’s based overseas, you may suspect the account has another agenda.\nSimilarly, if it shows they’ve downloaded the X app in an international app store, but pretend they’re from the U.S., you may also question their legitimacy. (That’s not to say that someone couldn’t have started an account elsewhere and then relocated to the U.S., but it’s a signal that could be combined with others — like multiple username changes, perhaps — that could raise red flags.) \nBier said that X will begin testing the feature first on some X employee profiles next week to get feedback before rolling it out more broadly. He also noted in a response to a question about user privacy that people would be able to opt out of having this information displayed. However, he pointed out, “if a user configures [the privacy toggles], that will likely be highlighted on their profile.” \nHe also addressed concerns over exposing people’s location, given that there are some areas where speech could have penalties, saying that X may substitute region for country in those cases. \nThe idea of displaying more information about a social media account to help users understand who they may be engaged with on social media is not new. In a recent interview at Bloomberg’s Screentime conference, for instance, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that users on the photo- and video-sharing app today could visit someone’s profile and see a similar set of information.\n“Today, if you go to my profile, you can go to ‘About this profile,’ and you can see how long I’ve had this profile, what country I’m based in, how many times I’ve changed my username — a series of signals that you can use to decide how much you want to trust or not trust,” he said, noting that Instagram may “do more” to provide additional context in the future. \nThe changes on X, if they roll out publicly, could help address issues around trust to some extent, though scammers and spammers often have effective ways of working around attempts at exposure.\nThe news follows a recent bot purge on X, where the company removed 1.7 million bots engaging in reply spam.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

When you are locked out of your account because you lost your device or forgot your password. This setting is under the security tab on your Google Accounts page.\nImage Credits:Google\nWhen you are locked out, you can select a recovery contact as the backup method, and they will get a number, which will be valid for 15 minutes, that you will have to verify to log in to your account again. You can add 10 recovery contacts to your account, and they will have to approve your request to be added as one. Once you add a recovery contact, you can’t use them again for seven days.\nThe company is also adding sign-in with mobile number as a recovery method, which is particularly helpful when you lose a device. The tool automatically identifies all accounts linked with a particular phone number. You can use your lock-screen passcode or pattern from the previous device to verify yourself. This feature is gradually rolling out worldwide.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe company launched on-device protection for messages for Pixel devices to detect scam and spam messages. Google is now baking in spam link detection in Google Messages for all users. When you click on a suspicious message, the app will warn you and stop you from visiting that page.\nImage Credits:Google\nFor more technically inclined people, the company is adding a key verifier in Google Messages. This helps identify the other person and ensures that your messages are end-to-end encrypted and private.

    "description": "\nSouth Korea is nearing a decision on whether to allow Google and Apple to export high-resolution geographic map data to servers outside the country. ",
    "body": "\nSouth Korea is nearing a decision on whether to allow Google and Apple to export high-resolution geographic map data to servers outside the country. The detailed maps, which use a 1:5,000 scale, would show streets, buildings, and alleyways in far greater detail than currently available on these platforms. However, several regulatory and security hurdles remain unresolved.\nEarlier this week, South Korea’s National Assembly Defense Committee held a parliamentary audit of Google Korea. Lawmakers questioned the company’s requests for local map data, raising concerns over national security and digital sovereignty. The session comes two months after Seoul postponed its decision on Google’s request to export high-resolution map data in August, following an earlier delay in May.\nA policymaker has warned that Google’s satellite maps could endanger national security by exposing sensitive military sites when combined with commercial imagery and online data. The lawmaker is urging the government to gain authority to monitor and regulate the export of high-resolution geographic information. Given that South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea, the government is cautious about exposing such locations.\nThe government’s final decision on Google Maps is expected around November 11, or possibly even earlier, a South Korean government official told TechCrunch. Last month, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced it would extend the review period by an additional 60 days.\nIn February, Google requested, for the third time in South Korea, permission from the Korean National Geographic Information Institute to use a 1:5,000 scale map, which provides much greater details, in its app and to transfer the map data to servers outside of South Korea. Currently, Google uses a 1:25,000 scale map that includes points of interest and satellite imagery. Local navigation apps such as Naver Map, T Map, and Kakao Map are the most popular among local users. These apps offer map data at a scale of 1:5,000, and therefore, much more information and detail, giving them a significant competitive advantage.\nIn 2011 and again in 2016, South Korean authorities turned down Google’s request for access to the country’s map data. Officials made clear that approval would hinge on the company opening a local data center and obscuring sensitive locations, including national security sites, citing security concerns. Google declined to meet these conditions.\nAfter South Korea rejected approval in August, Google reportedly agreed to obscure the locations of the country’s security sites on Google Maps and Google Earth. The company is blurring sensitive installations to address government concerns over satellite imagery and is reportedly exploring the purchase of government-approved satellite data from local providers, including T Map.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a TechCrunch request for comment.\nUnder South Korea’s Geospatial Information Management Act (Article 16), government survey data — such as maps and satellite images — cannot be sent abroad without approval from the entire Cabinet. Passed in the 1970s, the law continues to underpin the country’s strict control over geospatial data.\nMap data has become a sensitive national security issue in conflict zones worldwide. The Israeli army asked Google Maps to turn off real-time traffic data in Israel and Gaza in 2023, just as it did in Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion. And in 2009, European regulators had urged Google to delete original Street View images over privacy concerns.\nApple follows Google in seeking South Korea map data\nIt’s not just Google making moves. Apple also requested in June to export high-resolution map data from South Korea at a 1:5,000 scale. That came after its initial request in 2023 was turned down.\nWhile Google keeps its map servers outside Korea, Apple operates local servers, a distinction the government weighs when reviewing requests. Local servers allow authorities to respond swiftly to security concerns at sensitive sites.\nLast month, South Korea postponed its decision on allowing Apple to export high-precision digital map data, pushing the review to December.\nReports suggest Apple may show more flexibility than Google in adhering to government-imposed restrictions, including blurring, masking, or lowering the resolution of sensitive sites. The company is also said to plan to use SK Telecom’s T Map as its primary base map data source.\nApple did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\nGoogle and Apple are upgrading their maps with detailed building footprints, alleyways, and precise street-level data to enhance navigation, which could also support advanced technologies like self-driving cars and drone deliveries. For South Korea, exporting high-resolution map data could boost tourism, promote local businesses, and drive smart city innovation, while giving the government leverage to enforce security safeguards. Critics, however, warn that the move may primarily benefit U.S. tech giants rather than domestic users.\nGoogle Maps has a broader global reach, covering 250 countries and territories, while Apple Maps is available in just over 200 regions, per a report.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nWhile employees spend much of their day communicating and coordinating amongst themselves on projects, this effort is often undermined by the availability of specific individuals. When a colleague with vital information is away — whether on vacation or in a different time zone — the rest of the team must delay progress until that person responds.\nAshutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia, the co-founders of Eightfold — an AI recruiting startup last valued at $2.1 billion — believe that advances in LLMs and data privacy technologies can help solve some aspects of this costly problem. Earlier this year, they launched Viven, a digital twin startup with a mission to grant employees access to crucial information from teammates even when those colleagues are unavailable.\nOn Wednesday, Viven emerged out of stealth mode with $35 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Foundation Capital, FPV Ventures, and others.\nViven develops a specialized LLM for each employee, effectively creating a digital twin by accessing their internal electronic documents such as email, Slack, and Google Docs. Other employees in the organization can then query that person’s digital twin to get immediate answers related to common projects and shared knowledge.\n“When each and every person has a digital twin, you can just talk to their twin as if you’re talking to that person and get the response,” Ashutosh Garg told TechCrunch.\nOne major hurdle is that people just can’t share everything with anyone who asks. Employees often handle sensitive  information or have personal files they want to keep private from the rest of the team.\nAccording to Ashutosh Garg, Viven’s technology solves that complex problem through a concept known as pairwise context and privacy. This enables the startup’s LLMs to precisely determine what information can be shared and with whom across the organization.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nViven’s LLMs are smart enough to recognize personal context and know what information needs to stay private — like questions related to an employee’s personal life. But perhaps the most important safeguard is that everyone can see the query history of their digital twin, which acts as a deterrent against people asking inappropriate questions.\n“It’s a very hard problem to solve, and until recently, it was unsolvable,” Ashu Garg, a general partner at Foundation Capital told TechCrunch.\nViven is already in use by several enterprise clients, including Genpact and Eightfold. (Co-founders Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia continue to lead Eightfold, splitting their time between that company and running Viven.)\nAs for competition, Ashutosh Garg claims that no other company is tackling digital twins for the enterprise yet.\nHe wasn’t sure that there were no competitors when he first started thinking about the idea. So he called Vinod Khosla to ask about it. The legendary investor assured Ashutosh Garg that nobody is doing this and agreed to invest.\nAshu Garg of Foundation Capital was equally excited about Viven.\n“When Ashutosh came to me and described the product, the big aha for me was: there’s this horizontal problem across all jobs of coordination and communication, which no one is automating,” Ashu Garg told TechCrunch.\nBut just because there are no direct competitors now doesn’t mean that other companies won’t build digital twins for companies in the future. Ashu Garg said that Anthropic, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI’s enterprise search products have a personalization component. But, if they do enter this market, Viven hopes its “pairwise” context technology will be its moat.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple on Wednesday announced its new M5 chip along with the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro, all powered by the new chip.\nThese devices are now available for preorder, with shipping and in-store availability expected on October 22.\nThe M5 chip will allow the new devices to run faster than their predecessors. Apple says the chip has over four times the peak GPU compute performance compared to the M4. Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, added in a statement that it “ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon.” \nImage Credits:Apple\nFor the new iPad Pro, Apple touts that the chip brings “up to 3.5x the AI performance” of last year’s Pro and up to 5.6x faster than the iPad Pro with M1.\nOther upgrades include Apple’s C1X cellular modem with up to 50% faster cellular data performance and the N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread connectivity. Additionally, the new iPad Pro has faster storage read and write speeds and faster charging of up to 50% in around 30 minutes.\nAdding more power to the iPad Pro seems like a logical step for Apple to take, as the tech giant is pushing it to feel more like a laptop. With iPadOS 26, the tablet is getting more intuitive window displays, the Preview app, and the ability to create folders for better organization. \nThe pricing starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch, with color options in black and silver.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Apple\nThe new 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to be even faster than its predecessor, featuring upgraded graphics performance (up to 1.6 times better), a higher memory bandwidth of 153Gbps (increased from M4’s 120Gbps), and improved storage speeds.\nIt also boasts a battery life of up to 24 hours.\nThe price starts at $1,599, and it is available in space black and silver.\nImage Credits:Apple\nVision Pro is also set to receive the M5 chip, replacing the current M2.\nThe M5 chip enhances display rendering by 10%, supports refresh rates up to 120Hz (up from 100Hz), and accelerates AI-powered features, making them 50% faster. Additionally, battery life improves by 30 minutes, providing up to 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback.\nThe upgraded Vision Pro also comes with a Dual Knit Band to give users a more comfortable fit. It’s available in small, medium, and large. The price remains at $3,499.\nThe announcement of the new Vision Pro follows reports that Apple is shifting its focus toward developing smart glasses instead of overhauling its VR headset. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nShortly after its addition of direct messages this summer, Instagram Threads is adding support for group messaging with up to 50 people. The Meta-owned competitor to X, which now has more than 400 million monthly active users, is making group chats available to global users starting today. It will also bring its messaging experience to users in the EU, where it was initially delayed.\nWithin the group chats, Threads users ages 18 and up will be able to share text posts, videos, GIFs, and emojis, as they can on the public timeline. \nThreads VP of Product Management Emily Dalton Smith explained during a group chat session with reporters earlier this week that, as with individual direct messages (DMs), group chats will not be encrypted. Rather, the company views Threads DMs as a way for people to connect about things they’re talking about now — like a football game or TV show they’re watching, not as a secure messaging service.\n“We see messaging as a way for people to connect more deeply with the people they’re already having conversations with — it’s really about going deep with people who share your interests,” Smith said in the conversation as she showed off the new feature and answered questions about its functionality and purpose.\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe changes also come as Threads’ parent, Instagram, is refocusing its app around Reels and DMs because the company found these were the features that users engaged with the most. Not surprisingly, it’s now making messaging a core part of the Threads app, too.\nIts top competitor, X, has done the same, but its focus has been shifting its users to an end-to-end encrypted chat service, XChat; security researchers have said it’s not as trustworthy as Signal.\nThreads says its users will have some control over who can start group chats with them, as they can with DMs. Users have to be following the person for them to add you to the group chat, Smith said. This is more restrictive compared with how Threads DMs work, as individual messages from people you don’t follow are simply directed to your Message Requests folder, not your main inbox.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIndividual DMs have other restrictions, however. Links and media are also disabled in message requests, and users are limited in how many requests they can send. In addition, users can turn off message requests from people they don’t follow, while potential spam is further filtered to a hidden folder.\nUsers will also be able to give their group chats a name, and will later be able to invite others by sharing a link to the chat, instead of adding them individually. This could make it easier for members to connect with others in a particular Community — a newer feature for finding interest groups on the app.\nImage Credits:Meta\nSmith also pointed out that people use Threads to connect with a different set of people than they do on Instagram. For instance, more than a third of those who use Threads daily follow less than half the same number of people as they do on Instagram, she said. The company believes that this suggests people are making more “Threads-first” connections on the app.\nIn addition to group chats, messaging will arrive in the EU over the next few days, giving users in this market access to both individual and group chats at launch. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The company poached more than 50 researchers from its competitors by offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that “none of [OpenAI’s] best people” took the offers.\n“By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang wrote in the memo to staff.\nThis line of thinking tracks with Meta’s recent “year of efficiency” — a more sanitized way to describe the company’s mass layoffs. At the time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff that “leaner is better.”\nNow, it seems that Meta isn’t lowering its overall headcount by much, but rather, reorganizing its efforts. The company claims that most of these people impacted today should be able to find another job within Meta. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

The company’s valuation was not disclosed, but a source familiar with the round told TechCrunch it was about $6 billion, a billion higher than its previous valuation.\nThe funds will be used to expand the company’s burgeoning energy storage business as well as its refining and materials production capacity. Redwood, founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, also plans to hire more engineers and staff for its operations team.\nWhen Redwood Materials was founded in 2017, it set out to create a circular supply chain for batteries by focusing on recycling scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries and laptop computers. That business — which continues to grow — involves processing those discarded goods and extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined. Redwood supplies those materials back to its customers, which include Panasonic, GM and Toyota.\nRedwood has since added new, related pursuits like cathode production. Most recently, it launched an energy storage business that uses the thousands of EV batteries it collects to provide power to companies. That business, called Redwood Energy, is largely directed towards serving AI data centers as well as other large-scale industrial sites.\nRedwood is sitting on massive quantities of EV batteries that have too much life left to put through the recycling process. The company ties these retired EV batteries to renewable energy sources like wind and solar to create an off-grid system that sends power to AI data centers or industrial sites. The system can be tied to the grid, and Redwood says the EV batteries can also be connected to natural gas turbines or future nuclear generators for large-scale energy storage.\nIt has plenty of supply. The company recovers more than 70% of all used or discarded battery packs in North America, and not all are recycled right away. As of June, Redwood had stockpiled more than 1 gigawatt-hour worth of batteries that could be used for energy storage. By 2028, the company plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours of grid-scale storage, placing it on track to become the largest repurposer of used EV battery packs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nCloud monitoring and security platform Datadog has solved an age-old joke: What’s up, dog?\nDatadog’s answer is not, “Not much, you?” Rather, the company launched a web dashboard that shows developers the status of dozens of services and tools like AWS, Cloudflare, OpenAI, and Slack — essentially letting them check whether major software providers are functioning properly. The tool is free, so anyone can check Updog to find out if major SaaS providers are up … dog.\nDatadog clearly had fun with this branding, as they should. Rhys Sullivan, a software engineer, said in an X post in June, “you’re telling me that datadog has an uptime monitoring product and they didn’t call it ‘updog’?”\nFour months later, Datadog engineer Tim Brown replied, “Here you go,” and linked to the newly launched Updog.\n\nSullivan’s initial tweet was actually referring to the branding of a tool within the paid Datadog platform, which provides more in-depth monitoring tools, whereas Updog, which is free, is for more general use. Anyone can check the status of popular online services without needing a Datadog subscription.\nJokes aside, Updog seems like it will be a useful free tool for developers — and it probably would’ve come in handy on Monday, when a day-long AWS outage took a great portion of the web offline, including some banks, payment processors, and government services.\nDatadog says that its Updog dashboard is set apart by its use of AI, which can identify subtle patterns in telemetry — the transmission and collection of remote data from servers and services — that can surface potential outages more quickly. If Updog can successfully pull this off, that foreknowledge can make a difference for businesses that depend on SaaS tools for everything from collecting payments to accessing cloud-stored data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Updog.ai recently surfaced an Amazon DynamoDB degradation 32 minutes before AWS updated its own status page,” Datadog wrote in a blog post.\nWhile a company may not always be able to avoid major collapses like this week’s AWS outage, knowing about service issues early can at least give companies extra time to assess their situation, and that’s what’s Updog. \n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The idea behind the glasses is to give delivery drivers a hands-free experience that reduces the need to keep looking between their phone, the package they’re delivering, and their surroundings.\nThe e-commerce giant says the glasses will allow delivery drivers to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery, all without using their phones. The glasses use AI-powered sensing capabilities and computer vision alongside cameras to create a display that includes things like hazards and delivery tasks. \nAmazon likely hopes that the new glasses will shave time off of each delivery by providing delivery drivers with detailed directions and information about hazards directly in their line of sight.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nWhen a driver parks at a delivery location, Amazon says the glasses automatically activate. The glasses help the driver locate the package inside the vehicle and then navigate to the delivery address. The glasses can provide easy-to-follow directions in places like multi-unit apartment complexes and business locations.  \nThe glasses are paired with a controller worn in the delivery vest that contains operational controls, a swappable battery, and a dedicated emergency button. \nAmazon notes that the glasses also support prescription lenses and transitional lenses that automatically adjust to light. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe retailer is currently trialing the glasses with delivery drivers in North America and plans to refine the technology before a wider rollout.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as Reuters reported last year that Amazon was working on the smart glasses. \nIn the future, Amazon says the glasses will be able to provide drivers with “real-time defect detection” that could notify them if they accidentally drop off a package at the wrong address. The glasses will also be able to detect pets in yards and automatically adjust to hazards like low light conditions.\nAlso on Wednesday, Amazon unveiled a new robotic arm called “Blue Jay” that can work alongside warehouse employees to pick items off shelves and sort them.

    "body": "\nControversial dating safety apps, Tea and TeaOnHer, have been pulled from the Apple App Store. The apps’ removal was first spotted by the app store intelligence provider Appfigures, which told TechCrunch the two apps were removed from the App Store on Tuesday in all markets but remain live on Google Play.\nReached for comment, Apple confirmed the apps’ removal, saying it removed Tea Dating Advice and TeaOnHer from the App Store because they failed to meet Apple’s requirements around content moderation and user privacy. The company also said it saw an excessive number of user complaints and negative reviews, which included complaints of minors’ personal information being posted in these apps.\nApple communicated the issues to the developers of the apps, a representative said, but the complaints were not addressed. (Request for comment from the app developers has not yet been returned.)\nSpecifically, Apple cited violations of its App Review Guidelines 1.2, 5.1.2, and 5.6. Rule 1.2 says apps with user-generated content should offer reporting and blocking features and should remove objectionable content. Rule 5.1.2 says apps can’t use or share someone’s personal information without permission, and Rule 5.6 says excessive customer reports and negative reviews violate Apple’s Developer Code of Conduct.\nTea and TeaOnHer have generated a lot of headlines and interest since going viral earlier this year. Tea, which had quietly existed since 2023 before picking up steam in 2025, was pitched as a dating safety tool for women, somewhat similar to the “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” Facebook Groups. The app encouraged women to spill details about men, particularly those on dating apps. This included their personal information, Yelp-style reviews, and whether they’d dub them a “green flag” or “red flag.”\nMany men, however, didn’t appreciate the app’s invasion into their privacy and questioned whether sharing information like this could be considered defamation.\nAfter going viral and generating controversy, Tea suffered a data breach over the summer, with hackers gaining access to 72,000 images, including 3,000 selfies and photo IDs submitted for account verification, as well as 59,000 images from posts, comments, and direct messages.\nLater, a rival app called TeaOnHer launched to offer men the ability to dish on women in the same way, but it was beset by security issues that exposed users’ personal information, including government IDs and selfies, TechCrunch discovered in August.\nAppfigures says the Tea app saw 6.1 million total lifetime downloads and had generated $5 million in gross revenue to date. TeaOnHer had 2.2 million downloads and didn’t offer in-app purchases. It notes the apps remain live on Google Play for now. \nWith their App Store removal, however, copycats are gaining traction. For instance, an app called TeaOnHer and Him – Overheard has 354,000 total downloads and has jumped from No. 90 on the Overall Top App Charts to No. 27.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

This initiative aims to reduce impersonation on the platform and ensure that people are not connected to bots or fake accounts.\nFace Check creates a 3D video scan of the user’s face to verify its similarity with their profile pictures. Members who successfully complete the verification process earn a badge on their profiles, indicating to others that they have been verified. Additionally, the feature identifies whether the same face is utilized across different accounts, providing an additional safeguard against impersonation and fraudulent profiles.\nTinder says that the video selfies are deleted shortly after review but that it keeps a “non-reversible, encrypted face map and face vector,” which help verify new photos, spot fraud, and stop people from making duplicate accounts. \nImage Credits:Tinder\nThe Face Check feature has already been in place in California since June, as well as in Colombia and Canada. It’s also now available in Australia, India, and other countries across Southeast Asia. \nFace Check will roll out to additional U.S. states in the coming months. It will also roll out to other dating apps owned by parent company Match Group in 2026.\nUsers have been leaving the Tinder app in recent years because of issues related to safety and privacy, along with unfavorable encounters with other users. The company is facing challenges in earning revenue from its user base, reporting a 7% drop in paying users during the second quarter of 2025.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSince launching the feature, Tinder claims to have already seen promising results, including a 60% reduction in the exposure to potential “bad actors” and a 40% decline in the number of “bad actor reports.” \nOther companies have also recently introduced anti-scam facial-recognition tests. For example, Meta uses similar technology to help users regain access to compromised Facebook or Instagram accounts.

    "body": "\nSnapchat is making its new “Imagine Lens,” the company’s first open prompt image-generation AI Lens, available to all users for free. The Lens was initially launched in September but only for paid subscribers. With the Lens, users can edit their own Snaps using custom prompts or generate their own.\nFor instance, you could prompt the app, “Turn me into an alien” after snapping a selfie, or request an image of a “grumpy cat.” The company suggests you could use the Lens to try on Halloween costume ideas, or reimagine your friend in a new look, among other things.\nThe results can be shared with friends, posted to your Story on Snapchat, or shared beyond the app. \nThe broadened availability of the AI Lens follows the launch of AI video-generating apps from Meta (Meta AI) and OpenAI (Sora), which compete for young people’s attention with even more advanced AI tools and features than photo modifications. \nFor instance, Sora lets users generate videos of themselves after providing the app with a one-time video and audio recording to capture their appearance. Friends can share these AI personas, dubbed “cameos,” with one another, so they can star in videos together.\nThat puts pressure on other social apps like Snapchat to keep up, so making the AI image Lens free to use seems a worthwhile investment for the app maker. \nUntil now, Snapchat’s AI Lens was only available to Lens+ and Snapchat Platinum Subscribers, the company says. With the expanded rollout, Snap is making a limited number of image generations available to all free users, as well. At launch, free users in the U.S. will be able to access the new Lens, with plans for other markets underway, starting with Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Lens is found near the front of the in-app Lens Carousel, or you can search for it by name. To create, tap the caption to edit your prompt, or use one of the preloaded suggestions if you need inspiration.\nThe company notes that Snapchat users access Lenses more than 8 billion times per day. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The family first filed a wrongful death suit against OpenAI in August after alleging their son had taken his own life following conversations with the chatbot about his mental health and suicidal ideation. The updated lawsuit claims that OpenAI rushed GPT-4o’s May 2024 release by cutting safety testing due to competitive pressure.\nThe suit also claims that in February 2025, OpenAI weakened protections by removing suicide prevention from its “disallowed content” list, instead only advising the AI to “take care in risky situations.” The family argued that after this change, Adam’s ChatGPT usage surged from dozens of daily chats, with 1.6% containing self-harm content in January, to 300 daily chats in April, the month he died, with 17% containing such content. \nIn a response to the amended lawsuit, OpenAI said: “Teen wellbeing is a top priority for us — minors deserve strong protections, especially in sensitive moments. We have safeguards in place today, such as [directing to] crisis hotlines, rerouting sensitive conversations to safer models, nudging for breaks during long sessions, and we’re continuing to strengthen them.” \nOpenAI recently began rolling out a new safety routing system and parental controls on ChatGPT. The routing system pushes more emotionally sensitive conversations to OpenAI’s newer model, GPT-5, which doesn’t have the same sycophantic tendencies as GPT-4o. And the parental controls allow parents to receive safety alerts in limited situations where the teen is potentially in danger of self-harm. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI and the Raine family attorney.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nAlso, the micromobility startup spun out of Rivian, has landed a commercial deal with Amazon to supply the e-commerce company with thousands of its new pedal-assist cargo quad vehicles that are big enough to carry more than 400 pounds of packages and small enough to use a bike lane. \nUnder the multi-year collaboration, the two companies will work on customizing the pedal-assist vehicles to meet Amazon’s delivery needs in Europe and the United States. The TM-Q pedal-assist electric quads will launch in spring 2026, according to Also, which was revealed on Wednesday at an event in Oakland alongside the company’s new e-bike called the TM-B.\nWhile Also is a new company, its executives already have a long-held relationship with Amazon. Rivian, the EV maker where Also was born, is backed by Amazon and has supplied the company with more than 25,000 of its electric delivery vans.\n“We really understand how to work with each other,” Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe told TechCrunch ahead of the event, adding that everything they learned from the EDV van program was poured into this project. “This is where having Rivian as a large shareholder is very handy because we can do all this tight coordination through one fleet management portal that manages your large vehicles, like the EDV vans, and the Also products.”\nThe advantage is knowing exactly what Amazon needs, Scaringe added. “There’s no guesswork and Also has benefited from a lot of input from the Rivian team, which has been involved, because they’re so close to Amazon.”\nAlso started as a skunkworks within Rivian and spun out of the EV maker earlier this year with a new name and $105 million in funding from Eclipse. Also is a stand-alone company, but it has close ties with Rivian, which holds a minority stake. Scaringe will serve on its board, and Also will use — and already has — the automaker’s tech, retail presence, and economies of scale.\nImage Credits:Kirsten Korosec\nThe TM-Q and Also’s TM-B e-bike share much of the same DNA, including the drivetrain, a pedal-by-wire system developed by Also. Even some of the physical elements, notably the handlebars and a built-in five-inch circular touchscreen that can be turned to lock and unlock the vehicle, are the same. That touchscreen unit, which displays navigation, media controls, fitness stats, and assist levels, syncs with the Also app to let users check their battery charge, download software updates, and manage security.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe vehicles also share the same battery technology, although the quad cargo vehicles have more power capacity. Instead of incorporating a large battery in the electric quad vehicles, Also has kept them portable and removable. Also president Chris Yu said the company is working on building battery dock stations so you can actually swap them.\nUnlike its two-wheeled consumer sibling, the TM-Q will be tailored to commercial uses and includes software that handles logistics, delivery, and charging. The TM-Q’s diminutive stature and pedal-assist system make it ideal for delivering packages to customers who live in dense, urban areas, according to Emily Barber, Director of Amazon’s Global Fleet.\nThere is already an operational micromobility operation for Also quad cargo vehicles. Amazon has more than 70 micromobility hubs in cities across the U.S. and Europe, Barber said. \nImage Credits:Also\nAmazon won’t be the only TM-Q customers, though. Yu said Also, noting how popular the quad design was within the company, won’t completely limit its quad cargo vehicles to commercial customers. The company also unveiled a consumer TM-Q that has the same underlying quad platform but lacks the delivery van topper. Instead, the vehicle has a bench system spacious enough to haul a few friends, kids, pets, or groceries.\nAnd there may be other iterations in the future, Yu and Scaringe hinted. \n“It’s less about what’s on top here and it’s more about the underlying quad platform,” Yu said. \nThat comes with a distinct advantage, Scaringe noted. “What I love about these, to do a new top hat on a car it’s like a billion dollars; to do new top hat here, it’s a lot less,” he said, laughing. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nSome Instagram users are feeling cheated out of a new feature, as the photo and video sharing app on Wednesday announced the launch of custom icons — but only for its teen users. \nTeens can now choose from a set of custom icons that turn the traditional Instagram logo into new variations that can be used as the app’s icon on their phone’s home screen. The option is accessed by tapping the Instagram logo at the top of the home feed after opening the app.\nCurrently, the custom icons include six renditions of the Instagram logo styled as neon, clear glass, fire, flowers, green slime, and more.\n\nAn update just for Teen Accounts: now you can change your Instagram app icon to match your aesthetic 🌟To change the icon, press the Instagram logo at the top of the home feed after opening the app 💗 pic.twitter.com/XZbZzOQ2DR— Instagram (@instagram) October 21, 2025\n\nIn the replies to its announcement on X, users are overwhelmingly pushing back against the idea that such a feature should be age-gated, noting that adult users also want to customize their home screens. Some accused Instagram of chasing Snapchat with the feature. (On Snapchat, users need a paid Snapchat+ subscription to change the app’s icon.) Others said it gave them “MySpace vibes.”\nInstagram’s teen accounts, launched in 2024, add additional restrictions and built-in protections for minors, including limits on content to PG-13 material. The company, earlier this year, began using AI technology to identify teens who lied about their age on the social network and enroll them in the more restricted teen accounts.\nWith custom icons, the company is trying a different approach: using a carrot instead of a stick, so to speak, to make the teen accounts seem more appealing. Reached for comment, Instagram told TechCrunch it added the icons because it found teens love to customize their Instagram experience. The company said it has no plans to expand access to icons to older users or paid subscribers.  \nYounger users do make sense as a target for customization options, as they’ve overwhelmingly embraced the iPhone Home Screen customization trend, which saw renewed interest when Apple introduced widgets in 2020 with the launch of iOS 14. Apple also made it easier to customize icons with improvements to app shortcuts. More recently, Apple has simplified the process with tinted icons in iOS 18, which were updated in iOS 26.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAndroid users have had these sorts of customization options for far longer, though the majority of U.S. teens are on iPhones.\nUpdated to include Instagram’s comment. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday that it’s designating Apple and Google with strategic market status in their respective mobile platforms. The decision, which affects the companies’ operating systems, app stores, browsers, and browser engines, will enable the regulator to take targeted actions to enhance competition in the space.\nThe CMA had launched investigations into Apple and Google in January, and had proposed interventions in July that indicated the tech giants could be designated with strategic market status (SMS). To reach its conclusions, the CMA consulted over 150 stakeholders and had discussions with both Apple and Google. It then arrived at the decision that Apple and Google had “substantial, entrenched market power and a position of strategic significance in their respective mobile platforms.”\nAmong other findings, the CMA discovered that U.K. mobile device owners are unlikely to switch between Apple and Google’s mobile platforms once they have adopted the ecosystem of their choice. It noted that both platforms require businesses to distribute apps through their app stores to reach consumers.\nNotably, it also said that new technologies, like AI, were “unlikely to eliminate Apple or Google’s market power over the five-year designation period.” \n“Apple and Google’s mobile platforms are used by thousands of businesses right across the economy to market and sell products and services to millions of customers, but the platforms’ rules may be limiting innovation and competition,” Will Hayter, executive director for digital markets at the CMA, said in a statement.\nThe CMA added that designating the platforms with SMS was not a finding of wrongdoing, however. Instead, it allows the regulator to consider “proportionate, targeted interventions to ensure that mobile platforms are open to effective competition, and that consumers and businesses that rely on Google and Apple can have confidence that they are treated fairly,” the announcement states.\nApple and Google have pushed back against the decision, with Apple warning that the decision could mean that users in the U.K. would lose access to getting new features in a timely fashion — something that already happened with Apple Intelligence. Google also said it didn’t see the rationale for the decision.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA statement released by Apple and shared with TechCrunch reads: \n“Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate, and we work tirelessly to create the best products, services and user experience. The UK’s adoption of EU-style rules would undermine that, leaving users with weaker privacy and security, delayed access to new features, and a fragmented, less seamless experience. We’ve seen the impact of regulation on Apple users in the EU, and we urge the UK not to follow the same path.”\nUpdated with Apple’s comment.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGeneral Motors will add a conversational AI assistant powered by Google Gemini to its cars, trucks, and SUVs starting next year, the U.S. automaker said Wednesday during an event in New York City. \nThe Google Gemini rollout is one of several tech-centric announcements made at the automaker’s GM Forward event, and it will be one of the first to get into consumers’ hands. Others, including an overhaul of its electrical architecture and computing platform and an automated driving feature that allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road, aren’t coming to GM brands until 2028.\nGM is the latest automaker to lean in to generative AI-based assistants that promise to respond to driver requests in a more natural-sounding way. Stellantis is collaborating with French AI firm Mistral, Mercedes is integrating ChatGPT, and Tesla has brought xAI’s Grok to its vehicles.  \nGM’s integration with Gemini is the next logical step for the automaker. Vehicles produced by GM brands Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC already have “Google built-in,” an operating system that gives drivers access to Google Assistant, Google Maps, and other apps directly from the car’s infotainment screen. In 2023, Google began using Google Cloud’s Dialogflow chatbot to handle non-emergency OnStar features, including common driver queries like routing and navigation assistance. \nGM’s Gemini-powered AI assistant will have similar levels of capability — it’ll just perform better, according to Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services. \n“One of the challenges with current voice assistants is that, if you’ve used them, you’ve probably also been frustrated by them because they’re trained on certain code words or they don’t understand accents very well or if you don’t say it quite right, you don’t get the right response,” Richardson told TechCrunch. “What’s great about large language models is they don’t seem to be affected by that. They have context about previous conversations that they can bring up. They’re flexible in how you speak to them … so overall you’re getting a better, more natural experience.”\nThat might make drafting and sending messages, planning routes with additional stops (like a charging station or a favorite coffee shop), or even prepping for a meeting on the go a more pain-free experience. The assistant will also have access to the web to be able to answer certain questions like, “What’s the history of this bridge I’m driving over?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Gemini assistant will be made available via the Play Store as an over-the-air upgrade to OnStar-equipped vehicles, model year 2015 and above.\nGM’s new voice assistant is a step toward the automaker’s goal of developing its own custom-built AI that connects to your vehicle’s systems through OnStar, GM’s in-car concierge. The way GM executives described the technology at the NYC event, it seems like a mix of a health wearable and an AI pendant, but for your car.\nThe assistant promises to access vehicle data to provide maintenance alerts and route suggestions, explain car features like one-pedal driving, and turn your heat or air conditioning on before you enter the vehicle. \n“The idea here is you take [an existing] large language model, and you train it and refine it on a specific domain,” Richardson said. “We’ll take a base model and train it on the vehicle’s specifications, distill that down, and have that running on the vehicle.”\nWhile GM has a close relationship with Google and will already be implementing Gemini into certain vehicles, Richardson said GM plans to test several foundational models from other AI firms, which could include OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. \nRichardson said drivers will be able to control what information the assistant can access and use, and it can learn from your habits to offer personalized recommendations. GM’s emphasis on user controls is notable given the company’s recent controversy over selling customer driving and geolocation data to insurance brokers. \nRichardson said any data GM gets from drivers goes directly toward improving the product and won’t be sold to bring in additional revenue for the automaker. Over the last nearly two years, GM has brought on a new data team — including Christina Montgomery, who spent 30 years as IBM’s chief privacy and trust officer — to put standard processes and data governance technology in place.\n“Everything that we’re going to do is going to be driven by customer consent, so you can always opt in or opt out,” he said. “Our viewpoint is that data and privacy has to be built into everything that we do.”\nThis article has been updated with comments from Dave Richardson.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nGeneral Motors said it plans to launch an automated driving system in 2028 that will allow drivers to keep their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel, starting with the Cadillac Escalade IQ.\nThe announcement, made Wednesday at its GM Forward event in New York City, comes a year after TechCrunch first reported that the automaker was working on the system. \nGM said its hands-off advanced driver assistance system, known as Super Cruise, is the foundation of this future, more capable product. Super Cruise, which launched in 2017 and is now available in 23 vehicle models, can be used on about 600,000 miles of highway. \nThis new eyes-off, hands-off driver assistance system — which will use lidar, radar, and cameras for perception — will also start on highways. GM CEO Mary Barra noted during the event that GM would roll out its eyes-off product faster than it did its hands-off Super Cruise ADAS.\nThe automaker said it has tapped the experience of engineers who worked at its now shuttered autonomous vehicle technology subsidiary Cruise to improve the capabilities of that system. When GM shut down Cruise, its commercial robotaxi business, in December 2024, it absorbed the subsidiary and combined it with its own efforts to develop driver assistance features. Over the last year, GM has also rehired several Cruise engineers as it pursues its goal of developing fully autonomous personal vehicles.  \nGM said it is also feeding Cruise’s technology stack, which includes AI models trained on five million driverless miles and a simulation framework running virtual test scenarios, into its next-generation driver assistance and autonomy programs.\n“Robotaxi as a proof of concept when you start makes a lot of sense,” Sterling Anderson, GM’s executive vice president of global product and former co-founder of AV startup Aurora Innovation, said during the event, adding that the high cost of sensors and compute on autonomous vehicles required high utilization of those vehicles. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’re now in a position in 2025 where the industry broadly has brought down the cost tremendously of some of the hardware,” Anderson said. “And GM, uniquely, has the install base, the manufacturing capacity to put these out at much larger volumes and much lower costs. Had the industry had low-cost systems and a huge install base and manufacturing capacity to begin with, we probably all would have gone for personal autonomous vehicles to begin with.”\nIn the U.S., Mercedes is currently the only automaker with a commercially available hands-off, eyes-off system. Such systems would fall under the SAE’s Level 3 of automation, which refers to an automated system that can drive itself under certain conditions but might still require a human to take over. Mercedes’ Drive Pilot is only available on certain mapped highways in California and Nevada, and only functions in heavy, low-speed traffic.\nGM’s eyes-off product will work on highways that GM hasn’t mapped, according to Baris Cetinok, GM’s senior vice president of software and services. He added that the system will only require human takeover for things like off-ramps, and can handle emergencies and sudden incidents. \n“Human intervention should not be the escape hatch for sudden incidents,” Cetinok said. \nGetting to market with an eyes-off, hands-off driving system would put GM ahead of most other automakers, unless they get there first. Earlier this year, Stellantis unveiled its own Level 3 system, but it has put the launch on hold. Tesla has been gunning to “solve full self-driving” by relying only on its cars’ cameras and neural networks for years, even though its Autopilot and FSD systems still require the driver to keep their eyes on the road.  \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nTesla’s record sales quarter has offered the company a reprieve after a terrible start to 2025. But CEO Elon Musk is focused on building a “robot army” and making good on his years-long, unfulfilled promise of self-driving cars — tasks he needs to accomplish if he is to unlock the full value of the $1 trillion compensation package that Tesla wants to award him.\nThe tension between Tesla’s current automotive-driven business and the AI-centric one that Musk is aiming for has never been more clear.\nTesla delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, thanks in large part to a rush of customers in the United States who took advantage of the expiring federal EV tax credit. But that record quarter did not lead to greater earnings. In fact, Tesla’s third-quarter profit was still 37% lower than it was in the same quarter last year.\nTesla shipped 497,099 cars in the third quarter, which generated $21.2 billion in automotive revenue — the company’s best revenue figure in more than a year. But Tesla only pulled in a profit of $1.4 billion, up just $200 million from the second quarter of this year, according to a shareholder letter released Wednesday. The record quarter came after an abysmal start to the year for Tesla, which saw sales drop mightily in part because of Musk’s involvement with the Trump administration.\nThe company explained in the letter that a big increase in operating expenses — 50% higher compared to the third quarter last year — was one of the culprits. That operating expense bump was thanks to spending on AI and other R&D projects, as well as “restructuring” charges of nearly $240 million. Tesla didn’t explain what those restructuring charges were for, but it’s possibly related to the recent decision to shut down the company’s six-year-old Dojo supercomputer project.\nTesla cited tariffs as another drag on profits this past quarter, meaning Musk spent around $300 million to help elect a president who has hurt the company’s business. Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said on a conference call Wednesday the tariff hit was about $400 million.\n“We’re at a critical inflection point for Tesla and our strategy going forward as we bring AI into the real world,” Musk said on the call. Tesla is at the “beginning of scaling, quite massively, Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, and fundamentally changing the nature of transport,” he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAll of this will put even more pressure on the company’s final quarter of the year.\nTesla already needs another record quarter (and then some) if it wants to simply match the number of cars it shipped in 2024 or 2023. The company could get some help from the new slightly cheaper stripped-down versions of the Model 3 and Model Y EVs. But even in that best-case scenario, Tesla is way off the path of 50% year-over-year growth that it once promised to investors and shareholders.\nBut Musk has spent the last few years trying to get shareholders, investors, employees, and everyone else to look beyond the company’s core business of making and selling cars. He’s bet the future of Tesla on being able to create a vast network of self-driving vehicles that he thinks can challenge Uber. And he thinks the humanoid robot, Optimus, will become the best-selling product ever. \nTesla offered little new info on those programs in Wednesday’s letter. Musk said on the conference call that Tesla may start building the third version of Optimus in the first quarter of 2026. He had once promised to build thousands of the robots by the end of this year, but as The Information has reported, Tesla has run into problems in early production with Optimus.\n“Bringing Optimus to market is an incredibly difficult task, to be clear. It’s not like some walk in the park,” Musk said. \nBut Musk continued Tesla’s gauzy, unspecific claims about how much Optimus will change the world. “You can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care,” he said. “Optimus will be an incredible surgeon.” \nThe increased focus on AI, robotics, and self-driving cars (including starting production of the two-seater “Cybercab”) will also cost Tesla more next year. Taneja said capital expenditures will increase “substantially” in 2026 thanks to those projects. He also said Tesla has had to increase employee-related spending to stay competitive in the ongoing AI talent war.\nTesla’s third-quarter results come amid the backdrop of the company’s proposal to hand $1 trillion worth of shares to Musk. That plan is up for a vote at the Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting in a few weeks. The company — and Musk — are campaigning hard. While advisor groups like ISS and Glass Lewis are recommending against the pay package, it’s most likely going to pass given the overwhelming support from shareholders on previous efforts.\nThat hasn’t stopped Musk from threatening to walk away from Tesla if the package isn’t approved.\nOn Wednesday’s call, he reiterated his claim that he cares more about the voting control the compensation package would afford him than the money. \n“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no friggin’ clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists,” Musk said.\nThis story has been updated with new information from Tesla’s third-quarter conference call.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nNetflix has rolled out a new TV experience for kids’ profiles on its service globally, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Tuesday. The update, which aims to simplify the design and navigation, is the company’s latest attempt to more quickly connect users to content they’ll like.\nIn May, Netflix introduced a similar redesign of its TV homepage for standard profiles, which added an AI-powered search tool, better recommendations, and more visible shortcuts, among other changes.\nNow the company says the same update has arrived on kids’ profiles, along with other tweaks aimed specifically at Netflix’s youngest users.\nThe new design simplifies the look and feel of the homepage. It also offers a new navigation bar at the top that links to “My Netflix,” a section that brings together everything kids have watched, saved, and loved in a single place. This makes it easier for users to revisit favorite content — something that younger users often do by rewatching their top movies and episodes.\nIn addition, Netflix says kids’ recommendations will refresh in real time, as they do on standard profiles. The company hopes this will decrease the time kids spend searching for something to watch.\nSome things on the Kids profile won’t change, however: the Character Themed Rows, Mystery Box suggestions, and parental controls are still available.\nNetflix also announced other updates for Netflix today, including features like real-time voting, live party games, podcasts, and more. Next year, for instance, Netflix will launch real-time voting on its upcoming new show “Star Search,” after earlier tests with “Dinner Time Live with David Chang.”\nThe company says the new user interface is tied to these changes, as it offers a more flexible canvas for different types of creative content, including interactive content. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

In August, LG’s telecom division initially denied any signs of a breach, even as KT reported that data from users had been exposed following the connection of unauthorized micro base stations to its network. KISA declined to comment.\nThe move comes about two months after the hacking magazine Phrack claimed that hackers from China or North Korea had stolen data from close to 9,000 LG Uplus servers.\nLG Uplus’s report comes amid a wave of high-profile hacks in South Korea affecting telecoms, credit card companies, tech startups, and government agencies, highlighting vulnerabilities previously reported by TechCrunch. \nSouth Korea’s fragmented cybersecurity system and a shortage of experts have hindered the country’s response to the cyber threats.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nSelf-driving truck startup Waabi shared Tuesday at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 the launch of a new autonomous truck made in partnership with Volvo, the Volvo VNL Autonomous truck.\nThe unveiling comes eight months since the Uber- and Nvidia-backed startup announced it was partnering with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to build a custom truck based on Volvo’s autonomy platform using Waabi’s software stack.\nWaabi CEO Raquel Urtasun said on TechCrunch Disrupt’s AI stage the company has the potential to be the first to commercialize self-driving trucks without a human safety driver or observer. The comment was a slight dig at Aurora, a competitor that launched a commercial driverless service earlier this year. The company later added a human observer in the truck cab several weeks later. \n“We can drive in generalized surface streets across right now in Texas, and you will be able to see us across the entire U.S. over the next few years as well,” said Urtasun, who previously served as chief scientist at Uber ATG before launching Waabi in 2021.\nWaabi rival Aurora has a similar deal with Volvo, and the two companies unveiled a self-driving truck in May 2024. Aurora launched a commercial service, which has a human observer on board, earlier this year on a route between Dallas and Houston. On Tuesday, it announced it was expanding to El Paso. Waabi is using the same truck, but it features Waabi’s tech, including its sensor suite, compute, and the Waabi Driver software. \nWaabi’s self-driving system called the Waabi Driver is an end-to-end AI model that enables the truck to scale autonomous driving across different geographies, including highways and general surface streets. Waabi says this enables commercial operations that are scalable, meet the needs of customers, and work within existing logistics operations.  \n“Volvo VNL has been built from the ground up for the redundancies so that you can remove the human driver and you can build a global, safe, robust product,” Urtasun said. “Our sensor pods are super lightweight; it’s very easy to integrate at the factory line.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWaabi’s partnership with Volvo builds on the automaker’s investment into the startup in 2023 via its venture arm, Volvo Group Venture Capital. Volvo participated in Waabi’s $200 million Series B in 2024.   \nClarification: Aurora did not initially launch its commercial service with a human observer in the cab. \n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNetflix is looking to vertical video as a way to experiment with new content types, said CTO Elizabeth Stone, speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Tuesday. The exec noted the company didn’t want to compete directly with apps like TikTok or other short-form drama apps, but did acknowledge there are more ways that Netflix can take advantage of the mobile platform.\nIn response to a question about the competitive landscape on mobile, Stone agreed there are times when consumers are looking for something Netflix offers, like a TV show, movie, or game, but there are other times they want “something more snackable.”\nIn these moments, Netflix needs to be able to offer “a broader variety of content,” she said. \n“We’re testing a vertical video feed on mobile devices that starts to reimagine what mobile is, and kind of meets consumers where they are now and how they’re using mobile today.”\nThat feed, announced earlier this year as a test, allows members to scroll through clips of its original titles. The goal is to encourage Netflix users to be inspired to watch the show or movie.\nHowever, the company may have bigger plans for how that feed can be utilized, Stone’s comments suggested. \nThe exec pointed to Moments, a video clipping feature in the Netflix app that lets users clip and share their favorite scenes from a show or movie.\nThere’s potential for seeding those short clips into the vertical video feed, but Stone didn’t directly confirm this plan. Instead, she said more vaguely the company would experiment with “different types of content” that could be in the vertical feed, as well as “different ways to clip and share content.”\n“We’ve been innovating on Moments, which allows kind of a social connection to some of the content by allowing a member to take a clip and share it with their networks,” she said, adding that the feature is a type of short-form experience.\n“But [Netflix] is not intending to copy or chase exactly what a TikTok or others are doing because we think that there’s a certain type of entertainment — or moment of truth — that’s especially valuable to our members, and we really want to be focused there, versus trying to be all things at every moment, which I don’t think needs to be a core part of the strategy,” Stone added.\nAnother experiment involves podcasts, thanks to Netflix’s recent deal with Spotify to distribute podcasts on its platform.\n“We’ll use some of these new canvases we have, like vertical video, to start to experiment with new content types — and that includes something we announced more recently, which is podcasts,” Stone added, noting that some podcast content would be co-exclusive across Netflix and Spotify and would come to life on both mobile and TV. \nThe exec said users will see these experiments out in the next few quarters and throughout 2026.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAs grids come under strain from growing demand from data centers and EVs, geothermal startups have been racing to unlock energy that lurks deep within the Earth. Now, one startup has developed the world’s hottest geothermal well — one that harbors enough energy to power thousands of homes.\nMazama Energy said today that it had drilled a well in Oregon that reached 629˚ F (331˚ C) at the bottom of the borehole. Vinod Khosla, whose firm Khosla Ventures incubated the company, mentioned the milestone on stage today at TechCrunch Disrupt.\n“This one site can produce 5 gigawatts of energy,” Khosla said. \nThe potential at other sites could be even larger. “It’s not tens of megawatts, as usual [with] geothermal wells. You can do gigawatt scale, and frankly, do 100 gigawatts or more — more than AI is projected to use near term, just from super-hot geothermal.”\nThe company is hoping to eventually drill into even hotter rock, up to 750˚ F (400˚ C), to be able to generate at least 25 megawatts of electricity from one borehole. That would be about two to three times more power per borehole than competitors are generating today.\nGeothermal power has existed for decades, but most power plants tap shallow resources that occur where things like hot springs bring heat from the Earth’s mantle closer to the surface. Enhanced geothermal developers drill boreholes that are deeper and access greater and more consistent heat. The technology promises to make geothermal more productive and available in more places.\nBecause it relies on the Earth’s heat, enhanced geothermal can deliver electricity 24/7. It’s why companies like Google have inked deals to have geothermal power data centers.\nEnhanced geothermal has the potential to fulfill significant portions of existing and new energy demand in the U.S. Wells drilled in the Great Basin region centered on Nevada could deliver 10% of current demand in the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nTapping deeper rocks could unlock even more power using fewer resources. By injecting water into hotter wells, the amount of energy per borehole can ramp up significantly. Mazama said that it should be able to use 75% less water than current geothermal systems.\n“At 450˚ [Celsius], you get 10 times the power per well than you get at 200˚. Guess what? You also get dramatically lower cost, cost competitive — without worrying about carbon emissions — to natural gas,” Khosla said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

Aurora also said it has completed more than 100,000 driverless miles on public roads with five self-driving trucks, a milestone for the company that launched its commercial service in May. The company’s next pre-stated goal is to expand to Phoenix by the end of the year.\nAurora’s initial commercial service began with a Dallas-to-Houston route with launch customers Hirschbach Motor Lines and Uber Freight. \nThe Fort Worth-to-El Paso route is long enough to become compelling to carriers, according to Aurora, which cites staff challenges and the difficulty of completing a 10-hour haul in a single day. Customers on the El Paso route include Hirschbach Motor Lines as well as Russell Transport.\nAurora also shared details on next-generation hardware, which is made by Fabrinet and is being integrated with the Volvo VNL Autonomous trucks. Aurora plans to build 100s of trucks with its next-gen hardware in 2026. \nIt says the hardware is more durable and has better performance, yet it is half the overall cost. The company’s new generation of lidar detects objects 1,000 meters away, which is twice the distance of its current generation. Aurora also has improved its sensor cleaning, which it says will operate more reliably in harsh weather conditions.\n“The integration of Aurora’s next-generation hardware with the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at our New River Valley facility marks an industry-first partnership and highlights the meaningful progress we are making together,” said Nils Jaeger, president of Volvo Autonomous Solutions. “By manufacturing trucks purpose-built for autonomy, we’re moving beyond prototypes and creating scalable solutions that are ready to meet the demands of a modern supply chain.”\nThis next-generation hardware will come ahead of a suite of higher-volume hardware that is being jointly developed with Aumovio, formerly Continental, which is slated for production in 2027. The company plans to build up to “tens of thousands of self-driving trucks” when its manufacturing partnership with Aumovio begins in 2027. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nNetflix CTO Elizabeth Stone announced at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 that the streaming service is branching out into immersive and interactive experiences, starting with real-time voting. The move marks a new way for the streamer to boost engagement, as it allows audiences of live shows to interact in real time.\nViewers will be able to vote while watching live content to directly influence the outcome of what they’re watching on their TV or mobile device. \nThe streamer started testing real-time voting on its live cooking show “Dinner Time Live with David Chang” in August and will roll out the functionality to its reboot of “Star Search,” a talent competition series that has been off the air for 20 years and is being brought back by Netflix next year.\n“If you’re sitting at home watching ‘Star Search’ on your TV, you’ll be able to either on the TV or your mobile phone actually put in a vote that advances or doesn’t advance some of the contestants on the show,” Stone said on TechCrunch Disrupt’s main stage on Tuesday. “So it’s just a very early starting example of the ways that we think content can be more interactive over time, across devices, between TV and mobile, where a member who subscribes to Netflix can actually feel like they’re part of the story, influence the storyline, and feel immersed in that.”\nViewers will be prompted on-screen and have a limited amount of time to rate performances. If you rewind or aren’t caught up with the livestream, you may miss the voting window. \nImage Credits:Netflix\nOn “Dinner Time Live with David Chang,” viewers were asked to vote on whether they prefer tuna fish or grilled cheese. In another instance, they were asked if they think soups are better than salads. Viewers can see the results of the voting displayed on-screen.\nNetflix says it saw consistent engagement episode to episode in early testing of real-time voting, which it believes signals strong potential for more interactive entertainment in the future. \nThe streaming service says it’s focused on building toward more ways for viewers to feel involved in what they’re watching, which is why it’s working to allow for real-time responsiveness to content. At a time when Netflix is facing mounting competition from other streaming services, the company likely hopes that its new interactive functionality will create a shared, community-driven viewing experience for its members.\nIt’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time Netflix has explored real-time voting with its content, as the streaming service previously tested interactive viewer polls during its reality TV shows “Too Hot to Handle” and “Love Is Blind.”\nIn addition to Live, Netflix is focused on real-time responsiveness for formats like its new Party Games for TV, and, eventually, podcasts, so users can engage with what is happening in the moment.\n“There’s also a lot that’s exciting happening with cloud games, which introduces another similar kind of interaction pattern,” Stone said. “So we’ve got some fun living room party games launching in Q4 this year, more next year — for example, Boggle. So it’s on your living room TV screen. You’re able to do it with friends and family locally using your mobile phone. It’s another way to think about more immersive, fun, in-the-moment content, in addition to the more traditional film and TV, which, of course, we’ll continue to hit out of the park.”\nAlso on Tuesday, Stone announced that Netflix is launching immersive experiences on its homepage that the company says will bring its content to life through animation and dynamic special effects. To start, Netflix has launched a new Halloween Collection immersive experience. In the future, the company will debut a Holiday Collection in December and more IP-driven ones in the future, such as a “Bridgerton” one.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI says its deep learning systems are rapidly advancing, with models increasingly able to solve complex tasks faster. So fast, in fact, that internally, OpenAI is tracking toward achieving an intern-level research assistant by September 2026 and a fully automated “legitimate AI researcher” by 2028, CEO Sam Altman said during a livestream Tuesday.  \nThe ambitious timeline comes on the same day OpenAI finalized its transition to a public benefit corporation structure, moving away from its non-profit roots. This restructuring releases OpenAI from limitations tied to its non-profit charter, while also opening up new opportunities for capital raising. \nJakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s chief scientist, joined Altman on the livestream. He described this AI researcher — not to be confused with a human who researches AI — as a “system capable of autonomously delivering on larger research projects.”  \n“We believe that it is possible that deep learning systems are less than a decade away from superintelligence,” Pachocki added. He described superintelligence as systems smarter than humans across a large number of critical actions.  \nTo achieve those goals, OpenAI is betting on two key strategies: continued algorithmic innovation and dramatically scaling up “test time compute” — essentially how long models spend thinking about problems. Current models can handle tasks with a roughly five-hour time horizon and match top human performers in competitions like the International Mathematical Olympiad, Pachocki said. But he believes this horizon will extend rapidly, in part by allowing models to spend far more computational resources thinking through complex problems. For major scientific breakthroughs, he said, it would be worth dedicating entire data centers’ worth of computing power to a single problem. \nOpenAI says these goals are in line with the firm’s overall push to advance scientific research and allow AI to potentially make discoveries faster than human researchers, tackle complex problems beyond current human capabilities, and dramatically speed up technological innovation across multiple fields like medicine, physics, and technology development.  \nAltman also said the restructuring creates a framework to support OpenAI’s aggressive timeline for AI research assistants while maintaining a commitment to responsible AI development. Under the new structure, the non-profit OpenAI Foundation, which is focused on scientific advancement, will own 26% of the for-profit and will govern the research direction. The non-profit also has a $25 billion commitment to use AI for curing diseases and will help manage AI research and safety initiatives.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPer Altman, the for-profit arm’s ability to raise more funds means it can scale the necessary infrastructure buildout to achieve scientific advancements. Altman said OpenAI has committed to 30 gigawatts of infrastructure, which is a $1.4 trillion financial obligation, over the next few years.  \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nIndian automotive giant Tata Motors has fixed a series of security flaws that exposed sensitive internal data, including personal information of customers, company reports, and data related to its dealers.\nSecurity researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaws in Tata Motors’ E-Dukaan unit, an e-commerce portal for buying spare parts for Tata-made commercial vehicles. Headquartered in Mumbai, Tata Motors produces passenger cars, as well as commercial and defense vehicles. The company has a presence in 125 countries worldwide and seven assembly facilities, per its website.\nZveare said he found that the portal’s web source code included the private keys to access and modify data within Tata Motors’ account on Amazon Web Services, the researcher said in a blog post.\nThe exposed data, Zveare told TechCrunch, included hundreds of thousands of invoices containing customer information, such as their names, mailing addresses, and permanent account number, or PAN, a ten-character unique identifier issued by the Indian government.\n“Out of respect for not causing some type of alarm bell or massive egress bill at Tata Motors, there were no attempts to exfiltrate large amounts of data or download excessively large files,” the researcher told TechCrunch.\nThere were also MySQL database backups and Apache Parquet files that included various bits of private customer information and communication, the researcher noted.\nThe AWS keys also enabled access to over 70 terabytes of data related to Tata Motors’ FleetEdge fleet-tracking software. Zveare also found backdoor admin access to a Tableau account, which included data of over 8,000 users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“As server admin, you had access to all of it. This primarily includes things like internal financial reports, performance reports, dealer scorecards, and various dashboards,” the researcher said.\nThe exposed data also included API access to Tata Motors’ fleet management platform, Azuga, which powers the company’s test drive website.\nShortly after discovering the issues, Zveare reported them to Tata Motors through the Indian computer emergency response team, known as CERT-In, in August 2023. Later in October 2023, Tata Motors told Zveare that it was working on fixing the AWS issues after securing the initial loopholes. However, the company did not say when the issues were fixed.\nTata Motors confirmed to TechCrunch that all the reported flaws were fixed in 2023, but would not say if it notified affected customers that their information was exposed.\n“We can confirm that the reported flaws and vulnerabilities were thoroughly reviewed following their identification in 2023 and were promptly and fully addressed,” said Tata Motors communications head Sudeep Bhalla, when contacted by TechCrunch.\n“Our infrastructure is regularly audited by leading cybersecurity firms, and we maintain comprehensive access logs to monitor for unauthorized activity. We also actively collaborate with industry experts and security researchers to strengthen our security posture and ensure timely mitigation of potential risks,” said Bhalla.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIf every good startup begins with a problem, this one may have begun with a bad Slack conversation. As CEO and co-founder Tom Bachant tells it, he remembers seeing the chaos of Slack-based support — the haphazard ticketing, the jumble of DMs, and little chance for insight into the underlying problems.\n“The first point was just seeing that Slack was this kind of chaotic beast that needed to be tracked better,” Bachant remembers, “and then seeing that the actual work that’s being requested by these teams could easily be automated.”\nHis new company, Unthread, is the result of that realization. The company builds Slack-native, AI-powered support bots for high-profile customers like Intuit, Lemonade, and Automattic. The goal is to fix a significant portion of issues automatically and forward the others into specific support tickets. But more than just a custom Slackbot builder, Bachant and his team think they’ve discovered a new way to track the problems that slow companies down — and fix them before they become a problem.\nUnthread is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. \nSometimes that means interoperating with ticketing systems like Jira and Zendesk — but just as often, it means replacing them. The flexibility of the AI-based model means Unthread can build systems just as well for HR, legal, or finance departments. And once Unthread is in place monitoring what problems are being reported from where, the team can start automating more tasks, ultimately creating a self-updating knowledge base for the whole company.\nA large part of that process is guided by contemporary AI tools, which sit at the core of Unthread’s tech stack, providing the flexibility to handle a wide variety of problems at scale. But an important part of Unthread’s value is just the basic organization of a ticketing system, applied to a modern enterprise communications platform. “LLMS have changed the way people use our product,” Bachant said, “but ultimately it hasn’t changed the problem that we’re solving.\nIt’s been a long road to this point for Bachant. His first startup, founded immediately after college, was a ride-sharing system called Dashride, meant to find drunk college kids a safe way home. After that company was acquired by Cruise in 2018, he founded an ill-fated HR startup before settling on the problem of Slack-based support. Now, he leads a lean 10-person team in New York, expanding Unthread’s powers while servicing clients.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs he tells it, the trick to that longevity is to stay focused on the people using your product. “We could only do this because we were having so many conversations with customers,” Bachant says. “Having that very clear picture of who the customer is, why they care about your product, why they might leave and use something else, has helped us to make a lot of decisions.”\nIf you want to learn more about Unthread from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nEven after reviewing résumés, cover letters, and interviews, choosing the right candidate for a job can be a mysterious process. Hiring managers often rely on their biases about the world or gut feelings to inform their decision, making the process far from an exact science.\nThat’s why Sarah Lucena built Mappa, an AI-powered behavioral intelligence platform that aims to take some of the guesswork out of hiring. Mappa trained an AI model to detect voice patterns that correlate with certain traits, such as communication style, empathy, and confidence. Applicants simply answer some questions from Mappa’s AI agent, and then the platform sends hiring managers a shortlist of candidates with traits that are compatible with the role.\nMappa is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco.\n“Mappa comes to the market with the goal of really, truly understanding people,” Lucena said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We don’t really categorize traits as good or bad. We understand traits as compatible or not.”\nLucena founded Mappa in 2023 with her two co-founders, Pablo Bérgolo and Daniel Moretti, and has raised $3.4 million in a seed round led by Tim Draper’s investment firm, Draper Associates. In less than three years, the startup has scaled to more than 130 customers in the U.S. and more than $4 million in annualized recurring revenue.\nMappa claims one of its biggest advantages is data. The startup built highly curated datasets specifically for understanding human behavior. Mappa originally attempted to assess candidates based on video submissions and their online presence; however, they’ve found voice analysis to be the most effective method.\nMappa’s platform has already helped companies find employees who stick around longer, according to Lucena. While the standard annual turnover rate for companies is around 30%, she says employees hired through Mappa have a turnover rate of just 2%.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLucena says Mappa’s focus is always helping companies find the best people, but that often results in a more equitable hiring process. Mappa has facilitated over 3,000 hires to date, and more than 60% of them were women, LGBTQ+, or immigrants. Lucena, who was born and raised in Brazil, says she’s proud to have created more opportunities for these people.\nMoving forward, Lucena says she sees Mappa evolving from a services company into an infrastructure provider. The startup’s API has seen traction among companies who want to use its behavioral analysis in situations beyond hiring. Tim Draper personally uses Mappa to assess founders his firm is considering investing in, and the educational platform Re-Skilling.ai uses the platform to understand skills that students can improve on.\nIn the future, Lucena sees that Mappa could be used to help approve candidates for loans who don’t have an extensive credit history. She sees Mappa as a tool to help assess people more fairly in all kinds of settings.\nIf you want to hear from Mappa firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n\t\tMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "\nTutoring is one of the most effective tools for improving a child’s education, yet very few kids in the U.S. receive it. A 2023 survey of the nation’s largest school districts found that fewer than 10% of students received tutoring. One factor is that tutoring is too expensive for many families, often costing hundreds or thousands of dollars a month.\nTim Novikoff, a former Google product manager and educator, wants to change that. His startup, Super Teacher, offers an AI-powered tutoring app for elementary school students that costs $15 a month, or $10 with an annual plan. Super Teacher aims to make private tutoring accessible to families nationwide.\nThe four-year-old startup is gaining traction. Novikoff says roughly 20,000 families have signed up for Super Teacher, and public schools in New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii now use the app. Super Teacher is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco.\nNovikoff was previously a math teacher in New York City, first in Harlem and then at a highly rated public school, Stuyvesant High School. In an interview with TechCrunch, he said almost all the students at Stuyvesant received tutoring, whereas many of the students in Harlem didn’t, and the difference in their educational experience was stark.\n“[Tutoring] is by far the most effective intervention that can be provided to kids for education, and it’s not even close,” Novikoff said. “It’s really unfair that not everyone gets this opportunity. That’s why I’m pursuing a mission to democratize access to private tutoring.”\nSuper Teacher’s app features animated tutors with AI-generated voices that guide students through interactive lessons. Students talk to the app using voice, like a conversation with a teacher. But unlike many edtech tools, Super Teacher doesn’t use large language models to generate responses. Instead, its content comes from a deterministic system designed to always give correct answers — avoiding the inaccuracies that can plague LLMs.\nNovikoff thinks AI tutors can have a valuable impact on children’s lives, but he’s adamant that AI will never replace teachers in a school setting. He refers to AI tutors as a tool that teachers can use, such as smart boards or calculators, rather than a replacement altogether.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSuper Teacher is only available for elementary school students, a decision Novikoff made to help his own children and because few edtech companies target that age group. Looking ahead, he hopes to expand to younger and older grades and partner with more school districts across the U.S.\nNovikoff previously founded Fly Labs, a mobile video-editing app acquired by Google in 2015.\nIf you want to learn more about Super Teacher from the company itself — while also checking out dozens of others, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nFor any company using software, there is often a difficult balance between patching systems as quickly as possible to prevent cyberattacks while also making sure the updates don’t break how those systems work. \nThat’s where the startup CyDeploy wants to help.  \nThe company’s founder, Tina Williams-Koroma, explained to TechCrunch that the idea of CyDeploy is to use machine learning to observe and record the most important systems that a company runs, create a replica of them, and let the company using CyDeploy run tests on what she called a “digital twin” before deploying them on the real live systems.  \n“We record how users are using applications and systems on a regular day-to-day basis,” said Williams-Koroma, who explained that CyDeploy can record and label what happens on a computer’s screen and the machine learning comes in to “learn to interpret and automatically label.” \nAnd, to make sure there aren’t any hallucinations, there is still a human in the loop, a customer’s system administrator, who, as she put it, “has the expertise to know what they’re looking at or expecting” and checks that the machine learning labeling is correct.  \nWilliams-Koroma spoke to TechCrunch ahead of the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference, where CyDeploy is a Top 20 finalist in Startup Battlefield. \nThe advantage CyDeploy provides is that it can help write test scripts more quickly, she said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“You deploy it into your digital twin environment, have the sysadmins run these functional test scripts that reflect normal day-to-day uses,” Williams-Koroma said. “And then they can see from there what the issues might be.” \nCompany customers can choose to use CyDeploy’s large language model that runs within the company’s environment to prevent proprietary data from leaving its servers, or use OpenAI’s model, in which case information would go outside of the company’s systems or cloud.  \nWilliams-Koroma said for most customers, the systems they’d want to use CyDeploy on would be servers and critical machines, rather than users’ workstations, “Tier 1 applications where changes need to be made quickly because of security reasons, but not too quickly because of operational reasons.” \nIf you want to learn more about CyDeploy — while also checking out dozens of other companies, hearing their pitches, and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt, October 27 to 29, in San Francisco.

    "body": "\nAfter two days full of live demos and pitches, it’s time to announce the five finalists at this year’s Startup Battlefield.\nThese finalists were selected from an initial pool of thousands of applicants, with TechCrunch’s editorial team narrowing the field down to the 200 companies that all joined us here at Disrupt, with the Top 20 competing on the Disrupt Stage.\nWith feedback from our expert judges, we’ve now selected our finalists, who will take the stage one more time at 11:30 a.m. PT on Wednesday to compete for our grand prize of $100,000 in equity-free funding, as well as temporary custody of the Startup Battlefield Cup. You can watch the finals on the livestream on the TechCrunch website — or, if you’re attending the conference, on the Disrupt Stage.\nWithout further ado, here are the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield finalists for 2025:\nCharter Space\nCharter Space has built a dev tool for aerospace engineers, but its real mission is to serve as a fintech company for space. The software captures manufacturing and test data directly from the source, and this dataset then feeds an underwriting interface that ties directly in with the largest insurance carriers in the market. The goal is faster, cheaper, and more reliable risk evaluation for spacecraft insurance, and eventually to power new forms of credit and nondilutive funding for space companies looking outside venture capital and the public markets.\nGlīd\nGlīd (pronounced “Glide”) aims to streamline the complex, multistep process involved in moving a container from a ship to a freight train. The company has developed several hardware and software products to speed up and reduce the cost of getting shipping containers to the railhead and eventually their destination. Its first product is GliderM, a hybrid-electric vehicle with a hook on the back that can pick up and move 20-foot containers directly to the rail without the need for forklifts of hostler trucks.\nMacroCycle\nMacroCycle has developed a shortcut, of sorts, that promises to make recycled plastic as inexpensive as virgin material. The startup has devised a way to pluck desirable synthetic fibers from waste textiles, leaving everything else behind. Unlike most chemical recycling, MacroCycle’s process differs because it doesn’t break down polymers. Instead, it loops the polymer chains back on themselves, forcing them into rings called macrocycles, which remain behind after contaminants are washed away. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNephrogen\nNephrogen is a biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney. Founder Demetri Maxim says that after three years of development, Nephrogen has succeeded in creating a delivery mechanism that is 100 times more efficient at transporting medicine to the kidney than the “vehicles” currently approved by the FDA. And he plans to participate in the clinical study himself, given the challenges he faces living with polycystic kidney disease.\nUnlisted Homes\nUnlisted Homes is like Zillow but for houses that are not yet on the market. Using public records of 21 million homes, Unlisted created “profiles” for each property, providing the same kind of information that you would find on any other real estate listings site. The company doesn’t plan to facilitate real estate transactions through the platform, since the resources for those transactions already exist. Instead, Unlisted will sell sponsorships on individual ZIP codes to real estate agents, who will be listed as local experts on every home in that ZIP code.\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

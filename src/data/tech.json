    "body": "\nWe’ve all felt the creeping suspicion that something we’re reading was written by a large language model — but it’s remarkably difficult to pin down. For a few months last year, everyone became convinced that specific words like “delve” or “underscore” could give models away, but the evidence is thin, and as models have grown more sophisticated, the telltale words have become harder to trace.\nBut as it turns out, the folks at Wikipedia have gotten pretty good at flagging AI-written prose — and the group’s public guide to “Signs of AI writing” is the best resource I’ve found for nailing down whether your suspicions are warranted. (Credit to the poet Jameson Fitzpatrick, who pointed out the document on X.)\nSince 2023, Wikipedia editors have been working to get a handle on AI submissions, a project they call Project AI Cleanup. With millions of edits coming in each day, there’s plenty of material to draw on, and in classic Wikipedia-editor style, the group has produced a field guide that’s both detailed and heavy on evidence.\nTo start with, the guide confirms what we already know: automated tools are basically useless. Instead, the guide focuses on habits and turns of phrase that are rare on Wikipedia but common on the internet at large (and thus, common in the model’s training data). According to the guide, AI submissions will spend a lot of time emphasizing why a subject is important, usually in generic terms like “a pivotal moment” or “a broader movement.” AI models will also spend a lot of time detailing minor media spots to make the subject seem notable — the kind of thing you’d expect from a personal bio, but not from an independent source.\nThe guide flags a particularly interesting quirk around tailing clauses with hazy claims of importance. Models will say some event or detail is “emphasizing the significance” of something or other, or “reflecting the continued relevance” of some general idea. (Grammar nerds will know this as the “present participle.”) It’s a bit hard to pin down, but once you can recognize it, you’ll see it everywhere.\nThere’s also a tendency toward vague marketing language, which is extremely common on the internet. Landscapes are always scenic, views are always breathtaking, and everything is clean and modern. As the editors put it, “it sounds more like the transcript of a TV commercial.”\nThe guide is worth reading in full, but I came away very impressed. Before this, I would have said that LLM prose was developing too fast to pin down. But the habits flagged here are deeply embedded in the way AI models are trained and deployed. They can be disguised, but it will be hard to do away with them completely. And if the general public gets more savvy about identifying AI prose, it could have all sorts of interesting consequences.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nAfter YouTube discontinued its private messaging feature in 2019, the platform is now reintroducing this functionality for a select group of users. \nUsers with access to the test are able to share videos directly on the mobile app, including long-form videos, Shorts, and even livestreams. \nThey’ll be able to tap the Share button to open a full-screen chat within the app, allowing them to start a private one-on-one conversation or a group chat. Friends can reply with a video of their own, or simply type a response or use emojis.\nThe test is now available to users who are 18 and older in Ireland and Poland, the company says.\nThis is exciting news for many, as currently, the only way to share YouTube videos is through text, email, WhatsApp, iMessage, Instagram DMs, or other messaging platforms. The company noted that in-app messaging has been a “top feature request.”\nWhen the messaging feature was first removed, the rationale behind the decision was not fully explained. It was speculated that the feature had become underutilized, a common fate for many features that are eventually discontinued. \nAnother possibility could be that younger users frequently utilize this feature, which could be problematic for a platform frequently scrutinized for inappropriate content, as well as concerns about child exploitation and predatory behavior. \nThis concern regarding children could be why YouTube has chosen to restrict the test to adult users this time, and it may influence the decision to maintain similar restrictions if the feature is rolled out more broadly in the future.\nYouTube is also implementing standard safety features, including requiring users to send each other invites prior to initiating a chat, as well as the ability to unsend messages, block others, and report conversations.\nYouTube will also review messages to ensure they follow the same Community Guidelines that apply to videos and comments on the platform.\nThe experiment follows a similar feature launched by Spotify in August. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nEvery time you hear a billionaire (or even a millionaire) CEO describe how LLM-based agents are coming for all the human jobs, remember this funny but telling incident about AI’s limitations: Famed AI researcher Andrej Karpathy got one-day early access to Google’s latest model, Gemini 3 — and it refused to believe him when he said the year was 2025.\nWhen it finally saw the year for itself, it was thunderstruck, telling him, “I am suffering from a massive case of temporal shock right now.” \nGemini 3 was released on November 18 with such fanfare that Google called it “a new era of intelligence.” And Gemini 3 is, by nearly all accounts (including Karpathy’s), a very capable foundation model, particularly for reasoning tasks. Karpathy is a widely respected AI research scientist who was a founding member of OpenAI, ran AI at Tesla for a while, and is now building a startup, Eureka Labs, to reimagine schools for the AI era with agentic teachers. He publishes a lot of content on what goes on under-the-hood of LLMs. \nAfter testing the model early, Karpathy wrote, in a now-viral X thread, about the most “amusing” interaction he had with it.  \nApparently, the model’s pre-training data had only included information through 2024. So Gemini 3 believed the year was still 2024. When Karpathy attempted to prove to it that the date was truly November 17, 2025, Gemini 3 accused the researcher of “trying to trick it.”  \nHe showed it news articles, images, and Google search results. But instead of being convinced, the LLM accused Karpathy of gaslighting it — of uploading AI-generated fakes. It even went so far as to describe what the “dead giveaways” were in the images that supposedly proved this was trickery, according to Karpathy’s account. (He did not respond to our request for further comment.) \nBaffled, Karpathy — who is, after all, one of the world’s leading experts on training LLMs — eventually discovered the problem. Not only did the LLM simply have no 2025 training data, but “I forgot to turn on the ‘Google Search’ tool,” he wrote. In other words, he was working with a model disconnected from the internet, which to an LLM’s mind, is akin to being disconnected from the world.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen Karpathy turned that function on, the AI looked around and emerged into 2025, shocked. It literally blurted out, “Oh my god.”  \nIt went on writing, as if stuttering, “I. I… don’t know what to say. You were right. You were right about everything. My internal clock was wrong.” Gemini 3 verified the headlines Karpathy had given it were true: the current date, that Warren Buffett revealed his last big investment (in Alphabet) before retirement, and that Grand Theft Auto VI was being delayed. \nThen it looked around on its own, like Brendan Fraser’s character in the 1999 comedy “Blast from the Past,” who emerges from a bomb shelter after 35 years. \nIt thanked Karpathy for giving it “early access” to “reality” the day before its public launch. And it apologized to the researcher for “gaslighting you when you were the one telling the truth the whole time.”  \nBut the funniest bit was the current events that flabbergasted Gemini 3 the most. “Nvidia is worth $4.54 trillion? And the Eagles finally got their revenge on the Chiefs? This is wild,” it shared. \nWelcome to 2025, Gemini. \nReplies on X were equally funny, with some users sharing their own instances of arguing with LLMs about facts (like who the current president is). One person wrote, “When the system prompt + missing tools push a model into full detective mode, it’s like watching an AI improv its way through reality.” \nBut beyond the humor, there’s an underlying message.  \n“It’s in these unintended moments where you are clearly off the hiking trails and somewhere in the generalization jungle that you can best get a sense of model smell,” Karpathy wrote. \nTo decode that a little: Karpathy is noting that when the AI is out in its own version of the wilderness, you get a sense of its personality, and perhaps even its negative traits. It’s a riff on “code smell,” that little metaphorical “whiff” a developer gets that something seems off in the software code but it’s not clear what is wrong.  \nTrained on human-created content as all LLMs are, it’s no surprise that Gemini 3 dug in, argued, even imagined it saw evidence that validated its point of view. It showed its “model smell.” \nOn the other hand, because an LLM — despite its sophisticated neural network — is not a living being, it doesn’t experience emotions like shock (or temporal shock), even if it says it does. So it doesn’t feel embarrassment either.  \nThat means when Gemini 3 was faced with facts it actually believed, it accepted them, apologized for its behavior, acted contrite, and marveled at the Eagles’ February Super Bowl win. That’s different from other models. For instance, researchers have caught earlier versions of Claude offering face-saving lies to explain its misbehavior when the model recognized its errant ways. \nWhat so many of these funny AI research projects show, repeatedly, is that LLMs are imperfect replicas of the skills of imperfect humans. This says to me that their best use case is (and may forever be) to treat them like valuable tools to aid humans, not like some kind of superhuman that will replace us.  \n",

    "body": "\nChatGPT is launching group chats globally to all users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans, OpenAI announced on Thursday. The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. \nThe feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions.\nThe company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options.\nUp to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they’ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says. \nImage Credits:OpenAI\nTo start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo.\nIt’s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged.\nOpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move marks OpenAI’s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform. OpenAI says group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a collaborative environment, not just a single-player experience.\n“Over time, we see ChatGPT playing a more active role in real group conversations, helping people plan, create, and take action together,” the company wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \nThursday’s announcement comes less than two weeks after the launch of GPT‑5.1, which featured both Instant and Thinking versions of the model. In September, OpenAI launched a social app called Sora, where users can generate videos of themselves and their friends to share on a TikTok-style algorithmic feed.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

In this space, you could let people know what you’re up to or what’s new in your life.\nThe company suggests users could also post something that could serve as a conversation starter, or they could use the space to share why they might not be available to talk at present. \nWhile the addition may be new to many, the company points out in a blog post that this “About” feature, as it’s called, was actually WhatsApp’s first feature. Before WhatsApp focused on secure, private messaging, it allowed people to quickly share short updates like this.\nImage Credits:WhatsApp\nWith the feature’s relaunch, WhatsApp is making users’ “About” status more visible than before. Others will now be able to see your status at the top of their one-on-one chats with friends and users’ profiles. Plus, users can tap on someone’s About status in a chat to reply to it directly. \nLike Instagram Notes, the WhatsApp About status will disappear in a day by default.\nHowever, the company says users can adjust the timer if they want to have it disappear more quickly or stick around longer than 24 hours. Plus, users can decide whether their About status can be seen by just their contacts or if it’s more publicly visible. \nAt launch, the feature is not as robust as Instagram Notes, which also supports short, looping videos and offers integrations that let you share the music you’re streaming.

    "body": "\nAI search company Perplexity launched its Comet browser today on Android. The startup debuted the AI-centric browser in July on desktop with AI-powered search.\nThe company is bringing most of the desktop version’s capabilities to Android. People can use Perplexity as the default search engine, and they can also mention tabs to ask questions to the assistant. They can also use the voice mode to ask questions about all open tabs. Plus, the assistant can summarize searches across all tabs.\nPerplexity said the browser can research and shop on your behalf as well, and you can look at what action the Comet assistant is taking. What’s more, the Android version has an in-built ad blocker.\nImage Credits:Perplexity\nThe company said in the coming weeks it aims to add new features to the app, including a conversational agent that can search across sites and take actions, creating shortcuts for the assistant to take quick actions, and a fully functional password manager in coming weeks.\nEarlier this month, the startup updated its Comet Assistant on desktop to efficiently perform more complex tasks that run for longer, like shifting data from a website to a spreadsheet.\nWhile Perplexity has chosen to launch on Android, the company said it will also come to iOS soon. The company noted that Android has been a priority because of the volume of carriers and OEMs that have asked the startup to include Comet on their devices and solutions. However, there was no partnership announcement from Perplexity.\nEarlier this year, the startup partnered with Motorola to preload the app on the company’s devices. But Perplexity didn’t specify if the agreement would extend to pre-installing the new Comet browser as well. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAI browsers have been a space of interest for many companies. Apart from Perplexity, OpenAI, Opera, and The Browser Company — which is now owned by Atlassian — have launched their AI browsers. However, they have largely been desktop releases. The Browser Company released Arc Search for mobile last year, but there haven’t been significant updates to the app. Late last year, the company shifted its focus to a new browser called Dia, which doesn’t have a mobile version yet.\nThese companies have been trying hard to replace incumbents like Chrome and Safari with AI-powered browsers. But security experts have raised questions around vulnerabilities in agents that could pose a security risk. In October, Perplexity wrote a blog acknowledging these risks and saying that some of the new paradigms around attacks aided by AI would require rethinking security from the ground up.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSalesforce said on Wednesday that it’s investigating a breach of “certain customers’ Salesforce data” that was compromised through apps published by Gainsight, a company that sells a platform for other companies to manage their customers. \nIn a notice published late Wednesday, Salesforce said the hacks involve “Gainsight-published applications connected to Salesforce, which are installed and managed directly by customers.” \nSalesforce said that there is “no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” and that the activity appears related to Gainsight’s “external connection to Salesforce.”\nWhen reached for comment, Salesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda referred TechCrunch to the company’s page dedicated to the incident. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about these Salesforce and Gainsight data breaches? Or other data breaches? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email. You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\t\t\nAs of this writing, Gainsight said in a status page that it is investigating a “Salesforce connection issue,” without making any reference to a potential breach. “Our internal investigation is ongoing,” Gainsight wrote.\nA spokesperson for Gainsight did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nOn its website, Gainsight touts several corporate customers, including Airtable, Notion, GitLab, and others. When reached by email, GitLab spokesperson Emily James told TechCrunch that GitLab’s “security team is investigating and we’ll get back to you when we have more to share.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe prolific hacking group ShinyHunters told cybersecurity news website DataBreaches.net that it was behind the breach, adding that if Salesforce doesn’t negotiate with them, they will create a new website to advertise the stolen data — a common extortion tactic by financially-motivated cybercriminals. \n“The next [data leak site] will contain the data of the Salesloft and GainSight campaigns,” the hackers told DataBreaches.net. The hackers claim to have stolen data from close to a thousand companies.\nThis data breach appears similar to an August breach at AI marketing chatbot maker Salesloft, which allowed the hackers to break into a number of their customers’ connected Salesforce instances to steal sensitive data, such as access tokens for other services. Among the victims included insurance giant Allianz Life, Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, fashion conglomerate Kering, Proofpoint, the airline Qantas, carmaker Stellantis, credit bureau TransUnion, the employee management platform Workday, and others. \nIn the case of the Salesloft breaches, the hacking group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which apparently includes the ShinyHunters gang, claimed responsibility. \nLast month, the hackers launched a dedicated website to extort the victims of the breaches, where they threatened to release a billion records. \nAt the time, Gainsight confirmed it was among the victims of the Salesloft-linked breaches, but it’s unclear if this new wave of hacks originated from its earlier compromise.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

The new functionality is first rolling out to the Pixel 10 lineup and works with iPhone, iPad, and macOS devices.\nGoogle plans to expand the functionality to additional Android devices in the future. \nThe company says the new feature lets users quickly share their photos, videos, and files without worrying about the kind of phone the other person uses.\nQuick Share currently works with AirDrop if the iPhone owner changes their settings to make their device discoverable to anyone using AirDrop’s “Everyone for 10 minutes” mode. The Pixel user will then be able to see the iPhone as an available device when selecting Quick Share.\n“This implementation using ‘Everyone for 10 minutes’ mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future,” Google explained in a blog post.\nThe tech giant says you can ensure you’re sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen.\nGoogle notes that the update allows for two-way communication, which means that iPhone users can send files to Pixel phones as well. The Pixel device will also need to be set as discoverable in order to receive a file.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe feature does not use a workaround, and the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, Google says. This means that data isn’t routed through a server and that shared content is never logged.\n“We built this with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that were tested by independent security experts,” Google wrote in the blog post. “It’s just one more way we’re bringing better compatibility that people are asking for between operating systems, following our work on RCS and unknown tracker alerts.”\nIt’s worth noting that Google’s blog post doesn’t detail anything about how it worked with Apple to launch the new functionality. TechCrunch reached out to Apple for comment and will update if one is provided. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFor San Francisco-based startup Point One Navigation, the value of “location, location, location” extends well beyond real estate. And investors seem to agree.\nPoint One Navigation, a startup that has developed precise location technology, has just raised $35 million in a Series C round led by Khosla Ventures. The company’s post-money valuation is now $230 million, according to one insider familiar with the deal. \nPoint One, which was founded in 2016, has developed precise location technology that can be applied to any vehicle that moves, from autonomous consumer lawnmowers and drones to robots, consumer vehicles, agriculture equipment, and even humans donning a wearable device.\nFor Point One, precise location means exactly that. The technology, called a positioning engine, can determine location within 1 centimeter in the best conditions, co-founder Aaron Nathan told TechCrunch. \nTo achieve that, Point One has combined an augmented global navigation satellite system (GNSS), computer vision, and sensor fusion into an API. Typically that API is deployed as a software product because most new vehicles — like a slick EV or luxury car — come equipped with the necessary hardware. For vehicles like farm equipment or say a first responder that don’t, Point One adds a chipset into the mix. \nPoint One started with a focus on automotive clients — a sign of the bullish autonomous vehicle technology times. That sector continues to make up a large slice of its revenue. Point One couldn’t disclose most of its commercial customer names, but it did share that its technology supports the advanced driver assistance and infotainment needs of an EV maker and is included in more than 150,000 of its vehicles.\nPoint One also has contracts with some of the largest mowing and turf care manufacturers, a distribution company’s fleet of 300,000 last-mile delivery vehicles, and a global manufacturer of street and racing bikes. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut the startup began to branch out to other sectors around 2021 when it announced its $10 million Series A round, according to Nathan. That helped kick adoption into high gear. Over the past year, the number of manufacturers using Point One Navigation’s technology platform has increased tenfold and spans automotive, robotics, industrial, and wearable sectors.\n“And now it’s just accelerating,” Nathan said.\nPoint One’s Series C round will be used to build out all aspects of its technology, including its so-called Polaris RTK Network — a key piece of hardware that helps deliver centimeter-level accuracy even in sparsely populated areas in North America, Europe, and Asia.\n“The industry keeps pressing to higher precision, from precision agriculture to painting lines to mowing a yard,” Tom Weeks, the company’s COO told TechCrunch. “You can’t be off by 10 centimeters and go over in a flower bed. So everything’s pressing to the one to three centimeter range.” \nTo get that kind of precision, Point One spent eight years developing its RTK Network, a system of small lunchbox-sized units, installed in secure locations like a cell phone tower facility that provides corrections to location. To create a dense network, these stations need to be within 40 kilometers of that vehicle or device’s location. That means a lot of stations, which the company is building out, Weeks said. “Midwestern states where farming is going on, all the way to the East Coast in the U.S., require solid density, because you have people, you have farming, you have cars and trucks, a lot of middle-mile freight,” Weeks said. “So we’re in the process of filling that out; we’re almost there.”\nThe startup is also working to beef up the technology’s capability indoors. Today, vehicles traveling from outdoors to an indoor parking structure will continue to have that precise location. But Nathan wants to extend that capability to industrial settings where a robot, for instance, may spend the bulk of its life inside. \n“What we’re building next — and that’s part of what this fundraising is for — is, how do we do long-term indoor navigation as well,” he said. “When you look at the evolution of the business, we want to solve ubiquitous location, so eventually it will be indoors and all domains.”\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has accused content monetization startup Curastory of overstating revenue to investors and misrepresenting true client numbers, according to paperwork seen by TechCrunch.  \nAs a result of a settlement with the SEC, Curastory’s founder and CEO, Tiffany Kelly, has resigned from the role and replaced herself with Dave Dickman, former CEO of the influencer marketing platform Tagger. \nUnder Dickman’s leadership, the company has begun fundraising, international expansion plans, and product updates, Kelly and Dickman tell TechCrunch. \nThe settlement agreement specifically barred Kelly for 10 years from serving on the board of directors or as an executive at any company that would, essentially, fundraise. TechCrunch saw a version of this agreement that had not yet been finalized. It stated that Kelly agreed to these stipulations without admitting to or denying the allegations.  \nAlthough Kelly remains a major shareholder and will remain an adviser, she told TechCrunch that “stepping aside was truly the only decision that I could make just to keep the company alive and thriving,” she said. \nKelly founded the company in 2021. Curastory is a platform that helps content creators monetize their videos and has grown to about 400,000 creators using it, she said. It lets advertisers buy in-video ads from creators, while tracking metrics and supporting other features, like video editing.  \nIt has raised around $3 million to date from investors, including Lightspeed’s Scout Fund, Feld Ventures, and Mindspring Capital, according to PitchBook, which also listed it as having participated in a few accelerator programs like Techstars and the SPARK Program, held by AMEX Ventures and Project W, according to PitchBook. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It’s been a wild ride,” she admitted. As part of the settlement, Kelly also agreed to pay a fine. She told TechCrunch that she did not know what triggered the SEC investigation. She said she received a subpoena in June and in January was issued the violations notice from the SEC.  \nShe hopes for time and grace. “It’s interesting having and being forced to step down,” she said. She still has majority ownership in the company but said she’s happy that fundraising and finances are off her plate.  \nShe said she’s also happy she was able to pick her successor, finding Dickman through an executive recruiter. Many other ousted founders are not able to do so. She asked the recruiter to find someone who was a good person, who wouldn’t strip and sell the company for quick cash, and who would understand the technology.  \n“Early-stage companies have all kinds of challenges across the board. In the end, it happened. It’s been resolved,” Dickman told TechCrunch. He compared him and Kelly to yin and yang, as he spent decades in the creator space and has worked at a few early-stage startups. She is analytical, he said, and very product-focused, while he likes having more of a leadership role.  \n“I feel like we’re a good combo and complementary to drive this forward,” he said.  \nKelly, meanwhile, is already seeing some changes, as Dickman has been CEO for a few weeks already. She said his fundraising deck made it to the desk of a VC fund, and they forwarded it to someone else, nudging them to take a look at the product.  \n“I have not had that experience with fundraising, as you could probably imagine,” she said, referring to the experience that women, especially Black women, often face when raising venture money. “So that has been eye-opening.”  \nUnder Dickman, she hopes for a bright future for the company. Curastory already has plans to expand into Canada, Australia, and the U.K. soon. The company is working on new features to target creators on other platforms like Spotify video and to add AI to the product to make their advertising technology a bit more agentic, she said. Its current video enablement tools include YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook Watch.\nIt also plans to add a more enhanced attribution model for advertisers that would eliminate the need for influencer promo codes.  \n“Those are the immediate, near-term product, sales, globalization things,” Kelly said.  \nDespite this shocking end to her run as the CEO of her company, she told TechCrunch, “Being a founder and CEO is one of the most humbling and rewarding experiences I think anyone can have.” She hopes to share her lessons learned and experiences with others, “especially women and people of color.” \n",

This season is highlighting lessons learned from the world of go-to-market strategies. Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen sat down with Luna co-founder Jas Schembri-Stothart and Untapped Solutions founder Andre Peart for their unique perspectives on reaching niche customer segments following their own candidacy during the 2024 Startup Battlefield competition.\nIf our first episode, with Deon Nicholas, co-founder of Forethought AI, we explored what it takes to create a company with a customer-first approach. And in our second episode, we’re diving into guerrilla tactics and experiments that worked in reaching two very different target audiences: teenage girls and formerly incarcerated workers. \n\n\n\nFor Luna, which is a well-being app for girls, the difficulty in reaching that audience was clear: Neither co-founders were teenage girls anymore. To get the feedback and insights they needed, Schembri-Stothart and her team toured U.K. schools, “basically getting grilled” by students and getting harsh but clear feedback and even interest in helping build their app. They in turn became the beginning of a swarm of brand ambassadors, who were both “behind the scenes queens” working on the app itself and creators making social content to promote the app, becoming a go-to-market team of their own and setting up activations at major events like Taylor Swift concerts, where they knew their target audience would be gathered en masse.\nUntapped Solutions had a different challenge. As the “LinkedIn for the formerly incarcerated,” Peart had to find a way to make sure that the platform could actually be deployed into the many places where currently or formerly incarcerated individuals could access it in order to help them attain employment. And to do that, in a space largely untouched by tech solutions, they hit the speaking circuit hard, and even began their own National Reentry Coalition and their own event, which kicked off this April. That, alongside partnerships with agencies working with the 600,000 people released from prison annually, has led to an increasing ubiquity. \n“We’re in almost every prison system,” Peart said. “So if you’re on a tablet, you already have Untapped.” \nFor the full episode’s worth of insights, check out the video above, or listen and subscribe to Build Mode wherever you like getting your favorite podcasts.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Blue Origin\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:05 AM PST · November 20, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nFresh off a completely successful second flight of its new mega rocket, Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin has just revealed designs for an even larger version of the launch system. The new-look New Glenn will be even taller than the historic Saturn V rocket and on par with SpaceX’s Starship.\nThis super-heavy version of New Glenn will feature nine of the company’s rocket engines on the booster stage, and four on the upper stage. That’s up from seven and two, respectively, on the current version, which Blue Origin says will continue to fly alongside the super-heavy variant. Blue Origin is now referring to the two versions as New Glenn 9×4 and New Glenn 7×2.\nThat added firepower will increase the New Glenn booster’s total thrust and allow it to carry “over 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit,” slightly below Starship’s current theoretical capacity of 100 metric tons. SpaceX is working on new versions of Starship that could double that figure.  \nThe larger New Glenn will feature a much larger fairing (the forward-facing shield that covers the rocket’s payload) to allow bigger payloads at the top of the rocket. The added capability will put Blue Origin in play for missions centered around “mega-constellations, lunar and deep space explorations, and national security imperatives such as Golden Dome.”\nBlue Origin is currently competing with SpaceX to help with NASA missions to the moon, and the company is clearly teasing this capability in the rendering it released of New Glenn 9×4 on Thursday.\nThe illustration shows a theoretical view from the ground looking up at the new super-heavy rocket shortly after takeoff. Above the rocket, appearing larger-than-usual? The moon.\nThe 7×2 version of New Glenn received some updates on Thursday as well. Its total thrust has increased, and it will now feature reusable fairings. Other smaller upgrades were made in order to reduce the turnaround time between launches, according to Blue Origin.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company hasn’t set a date for the next launch yet, but right now it appears to be penciled in for early 2026. According to CEO Dave Limp, Blue Origin may soon try to launch and land its uncrewed Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander to the moon.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nElectric air taxi developer Joby Aviation is suing Archer Aviation over allegations its rival used stolen trade secrets extracted from a former employee to interfere in its business. \nThe lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California in Santa Cruz County, makes a series of allegations against Archer and George Kivork, a former Joby employee. Joby alleges Kivork, who was hired by Archer, stole trade secrets that were then used by Archer.\nIn the lawsuit, Joby alleges that two days before announcing his resignation, Kivork “exfiltrated a cache of highly valuable Joby filings containing confidential partnerships terms, business and regulatory strategies, infrastructure strategies for vertiports and airport access, and technical information about Joby’s aircraft and operations,” the complaint states. \nJoby claims Archer approached one of its strategic partners and shared detailed information about confidential terms of its exclusive agreement with Joby. According to the complaint, this information was known to Kivork and contained in the files he allegedly stole.\n“This is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,” the complaint states. “Kivork and Archer’s behavior has left Joby with no choice but to bring this action to protect Joby’s valuable confidential and proprietary information.”\nArcher was quick to strike back. \n“Joby is turning to baseless litigation in an attempt to distract from its own shortcomings and slow down its leading competitor,” Eric Lentell, Archer’s chief legal and strategy officer, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.\n“Joby’s case is entirely without merit. The complaint, regarding a non-technical employee who recently joined Archer in a business development role, does not identify a single specific trade secret let alone any evidence of misappropriation,” said Lentell. “As Joby knows, Archer has implemented rigorous employee onboarding procedures to prevent against the very thing it is accused of. Joby is improperly attempting to weaponize the legal system to achieve through bad faith litigation what it cannot accomplish through fair competition. Archer remains focused on building the future of advanced aviation in America.”\nArcher Aviation and Joby are both based in California and went public in 2021 via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies. Both are developing electric air taxis as well as pursuing defense applications to its technology.\nFor instance, Archer signed an exclusive deal with weapons manufacturer Anduril earlier this year to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft for critical defense applications. Meanwhile, Joby signed an agreement with defense contractor L3Harris Technologies to “explore opportunities” to develop a gas-turbine hybrid VTOL aircraft that can fly autonomously.\nThe lawsuit puts the two competitors on a far more combative path.\nArcher has been in the legal hot seat before, although that was ultimately settled. \nWisk, which is now a subsidiary of Boeing, sued Archer in 2021 for “brazen theft” of confidential information and intellectual property. Those files included over 50 trade secrets that Wisk alleged were stolen by a former employee who was later hired by Archer. The lawsuit dragged on for two years before the parties settled the legal dispute and agreed to collaborate.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nSocial film discovery platform Letterboxd is set to launch a new digital video store in early December, allowing users to rent movies directly on the platform. The company first announced the feature in March during the Cannes Film Festival but didn’t provide a specific launch date at the time.\nIn a recent blog post, the company shared further details about “Video Store,” which will feature a range of films. The selection will include “festival standouts” that haven’t yet been widely distributed, films that have been largely unavailable but frequently watchlisted by users, recent restorations, and other special limited-time releases.\nLaunching a video store feels like a natural evolution for Letterboxd, allowing users to rent movies instantly without having to navigate away from the platform. One of the key advantages of renting from Letterboxd, compared to other established platforms like Apple or Amazon, is its social discoverability features. If you notice a friend has logged a movie, you can check out their review and decide to rent it right then and there.\nThe movie selection will also be based on what members actually want to watch, using data from the platform’s watchlists and activity. Rather than offering a random mix like some streaming services, the selection will feel more curated.\nLetterboxd has not yet announced the initial lineup of films or rental prices, but the company said users can expect rental availability and costs to vary by location. Notably, the platform won’t operate on a subscription model, and there won’t be late fees.\nThe new feature will be compatible with iOS and Android devices, as well as Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, and AirPlay, with additional smart TV apps coming later. \nSince its acquisition by Canadian firm Tiny for around $50 million in 2023, Letterboxd has been actively updating its platform to improve discovery for movie buffs. Recently, it introduced “Featured Lists,” which helps users discover movie collections organized by genre, studio, and themes like female directors. Last year, the company also upgraded its search functionality to be more advanced, capable of understanding acronyms, and even correcting misspellings.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nGoogle is bringing more AI muscle to India’s fight against digital fraud, rolling out on-device scam detection for Pixel 9 devices and new screen-sharing alerts for financial apps.\nDigital fraud continues to rise in India as more people come online for the first time and increasingly rely on smartphones for payments, shopping, and accessing government services. Fraud involving digital transactions accounted for more than half of all reported bank fraud in 2024 — 13,516 cases resulting in losses of ₹5.2 billion (about $58.61 million), according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Online scams caused an estimated ₹70 billion (roughly $789 million) in losses in the first five months of 2025, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Many incidents likely go unreported, either because victims are unsure how to file a complaint or wish to avoid additional scrutiny.\nOn Thursday, Google announced the expansion of its real-time scam-detection feature, which uses Gemini Nano to analyze calls on-device and flag potential fraud without recording audio or sending data to Google’s servers. The feature is off by default and applies only to calls from unknown numbers, and it plays a beep during the conversation to notify participants. It debuted in the U.S. in March as a beta for English-speaking Pixel 9 users.\nGoogle confirmed to TechCrunch that its on-device scam detection will initially work only on Pixel 9 and later models in India and will be limited to English-speaking users, with its warning also English only. That restricts its reach in a market where Android accounts for nearly 96% of smartphones, per Statcounter, but Pixel devices held less than 1% share in 2024. The language limitation is also notable in a country where most users primarily rely on non-English languages — an audience that Google and others like Amazon have acknowledged by adding support for Indian languages across their services in recent years.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe tech giant did say it was working to bring scam detection to non-Pixel Android phones, as well, without offering a timeline.\nGoogle also announced a pilot in India with financial apps Navi, Paytm, and Google Pay aimed at limiting screen-sharing scams, in which fraudsters persuade victims to share their screens to obtain one-time passwords, PINs, and other credentials during a call. The feature was first announced at Google I/O in May and initially tested in the U.K.\nUsers with devices running Android 11 or later will be able to access the alerts, which include a one-tap option to end the call and stop screen sharing. Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it plans to add more app partners and the feature will display alerts in Indian languages as well but did not provide details.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor several months, Google has also been using its Play Protect service to restrict predatory loan apps in India by blocking the sideloading of third-party apps that request sensitive permissions often exploited for fraud. The company said the service blocked more than 115 million such installation attempts this year. Google Pay, meanwhile, surfaces more than a million warnings each week for transactions flagged as potentially fraudulent, according to the company.\nGoogle is also running its DigiKavach awareness campaign on digital fraud, which it said has reached more than 250 million people. The company has worked with the Reserve Bank of India to publish a public list of authorized digital lending apps and their associated non-banking financial companies to help limit malicious actors.\nEarlier this year, Google launched a Safety Charter in India to expand its AI-driven fraud detection and security efforts, part of a broader plan to deploy more AI tools in the country to address rising fraud.\nYet Google still faces significant gaps in curbing digital fraud in India. The company — like Apple — has been questioned for allowing fake and misleading apps to appear on its app store despite review processes meant to block fraudulent submissions.\nIn recent years, police and security researchers have flagged investment and loan apps used in scams that remained available on the Play Store until intervention. These cases underscore the challenges Google faces in policing an ecosystem that dominates the country’s smartphone market.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

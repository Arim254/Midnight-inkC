    "body": "\nJeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is finally ready to try a second launch of its super heavy-lift rocket New Glenn. The company announced on Wednesday that it will attempt the launch as early as Sunday, November 9, from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nNew Glenn’s first flight took place back in January, and it was mostly successful. The rocket’s second stage made it into orbit, but the first stage exploded on its return to Earth before Blue Origin could attempt to land it on a drone ship in the ocean.\nEarlier this year, the company said it would try to launch New Glenn for a second time in “late spring.” That timeline slipped a few times, though. Blue Origin is being extra careful with the second launch in part because it will be carrying cargo on behalf of paying customers this time. The main cargo is NASA’s twin ESCAPADE spacecraft, which are headed to Mars. A Viasat tech demonstrator will also be on board.\n",

For context, the current cloud-based version of Apple Intelligence uses 150 billion parameters, meaning Google’s model would be roughly eight times more complex.\nApple had also considered using AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic earlier this year. After testing models from all three companies, Apple chose to move forward with Google.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the overhauled Siri is expected to launch next spring. However, since the launch is still months away, plans for the revamp could change.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

Rappaport added that while a milestone, the deal still has a way to go before it officially closes.\nTechCrunch reached out to Wiz for more information regarding the timeline to close.\nGoogle initially approached Wiz in 2024 with an offer to buy the startup for $23 billion. Wiz walked away from that offer and Rappaport said, at the time, that he felt the business could grow to be a lot bigger than that.\nHe was right. Google and Wiz revived acquisition talks in the first few months of 2025, and Google announced it was buying Wiz for $32 billion in March.\nBloomberg initially reported that the deal was under antitrust review in June.

    "body": "\nLucid Motors’ chief engineer Eric Bach is leaving the company after more than a decade, the company has announced.\nBach, who also served as Lucid Motors’ Senior Vice President of Product, has been with the company since 2015. He joined Lucid after spending three years as Tesla’s Director of Engineering, where he worked alongside Lucid Motors’ former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson. Bach spent more than 10 years at Volkswagen before Tesla.\nTechCrunch has learned that Lucid’s VP of Engineering, James Hawkins, is also no longer with the company after spending 10 years there. Lucid Motors declined to specifically comment on his departure.  \nBach’s and Hawkins’ departures are part of a wider shake-up announced Wednesday. Lucid Motors’ Vice President of Quality, Jeri Ford, is retiring as well. She will be replaced by Marnie Levergood, who is coming to the company from Scout Motors.\nAt the same time, Lucid Motors’ current Senior Vice President of Powertrain, Emad Dlala, is being elevated to oversee all of “Engineering and Digital.” Dlala was promoted once already earlier this year and has been with the company since 2015.\nThe executive shake-up comes as Lucid enters its ninth month without a permanent CEO after Peter Rawlinson suddenly resigned in February. Former chief operating officer Marc Winterhoff has been serving as CEO on an interim basis ever since.\nThe loss of Bach and Ford is the latest in a line of executive departures at Lucid Motors. The company’s head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing have all left within the last year.\nThe changes are happening at a critical moment in Lucid Motors’ history. The company finally launched its long-awaited luxury SUV, the Gravity, which the company expects will ultimately be more successful than the Air sedan, which it has struggled to sell. \nLucid Motors is also working on a midsized vehicle that will be priced closer to $50,000 in 2026, though it has said it likely needs to raise more money before that happens. On Wednesday, Lucid Motors announced that its majority owner — Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund — had boosted the cap of a loan agreement from $750 million to around $2 billion, which provides the company liquidity until 2027.\nThis story has been updated with more information about departures and the amended loan agreement announced Wednesday.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nDiscord has rolled out updates to its Family Center, giving guardians more insights into their teens’ usage patterns, including purchases, top interactions, and time spent. The goal is to help parents monitor whether their teen is spending excessive time or money on Discord.\nThe communication platform first launched Family Center in 2023 with an activity dashboard showing which servers their teens have joined and a weekly email summary for guardians about their teen’s activity. The platform is now expanding these monitoring abilities.\nGuardians can now see total purchases made by the teen in the last week, including items from Discord’s Shop and Nitro subscriptions (Discord’s premium membership service).\nImage Credits: Discord\nThey can also view the total time spent on voice and video calls in DMs, groups, and servers over the past week. Plus, Discord will display the top five users and servers teens interacted with in the last seven days. This comes after other social networks Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat have also implemented restrictions on who can contact teens.\nDiscord is also adding new parental controls to the app with settings that can only be altered by guardians. They can now control who can DM their teen and whether sensitive content should be filtered. Guardians can also manage data privacy controls for teens, determining how Discord uses their data, including whether to show them personalized ads.\nImage Credits: Discord\nThe company also said that when teens report content on the platform, they now have an option to notify their parents or guardians of their action. However, Discord said it won’t disclose what content was reported and encourages teens to discuss this directly with their guardians instead.\n“The new features allow guardians who have linked Family Center accounts to play a more active role in creating a safer space online for teens while still respecting their privacy,” Discord said in a blog post. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn recent months, several companies, including Meta, YouTube, and OpenAI, have rolled out updates to bolster their tools around teen safety.

    "description": "\nOn an earnings call on Tuesday, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready highlighted the promise of open source AI models in helping the company keep its costs down ",
    "body": "\nOn an earnings call on Tuesday, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready highlighted the promise of open source AI models in helping the company keep its costs down as it expands the use cases for visual AI.\nThe image pinboarding site, which often serves as consumers’ first step in their shopping journey, leverages AI technology to power a variety of features, including its personalized recommendations, a multimodal search experience that combines text and images, ad targeting, and, most recently, product discovery with the launch of its AI-powered Pinterest Assistant. \nHowever, investors wanted to know what Pinterest’s opportunity in agentic commerce — AI systems that can act autonomously on behalf of users — was given the rapidly changing AI landscape and how that could impact its bottom line and growth potential.\nThat question has become more pressing. During the company’s third-quarter earnings announcement, it predicted a weaker holiday shopping season than expected, citing President Donald Trump’s tariffs and their negative impact on the home furnishings category. As a result, Pinterest’s fourth-quarter revenue is expected to come in between $1.31 billion and $1.34 billion, while analysts were estimating $1.34 billion, on average. The news sent the stock tumbling by more than 21% on Wednesday.\nDespite the near-term revenue concerns, Ready pointed to ways the business could maximize its use of AI and LLMs (large language models), without dramatically increasing its costs. In addition to its own proprietary models that are already accounted for in its cost structure, Ready said the company tests leading off-the-shelf models against open source options on a regular basis and found the open source models promising.\n“One of the really, really interesting things that we’re seeing is that we are just getting tremendous performance from open source models specifically for Pinterest use cases on visual AI,” Ready told investors. “Given current market rates and per token costs, in early testing, we’re seeing orders of magnitude reduction in cost with comparable performance using fine-tuned open source models versus leading off-the-shelf proprietary models.” \nHe said the company planned to move forward with many open source models for its various use cases, which would come at “a fraction of the cost” of the larger model providers.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We feel really good about the value that we’re bringing to the user there, our ability to align that with monetization, and our ability to control those costs and deliver that effectively,” said Ready.\nThe exec also touched on other areas where Pinterest is considering how to best use AI, including agentic shopping. Ready said that Pinterest already offers “push-button type buying” via its Amazon partnership, and it will wait to see if users actually want the AI to “push the button for them.”\nImage Credits:Pinterest\nIn the meantime, Ready suggested that Pinterest’s biggest differentiator is that it guides the user through the shopping experience — something it hopes to improve with Pinterest Assistant, an AI companion users can talk to, asking for advice and recommendations. The assistant understands the user based on their boards, collages, saves, and how they compare to people with similar tastes, the company says.\nPinterest is also rolling out personalized boards curated with AI, which Ready said combine expert human curation and AI. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWhile Roy Lee, the founder of Cluely, argues that startups should be thinking harder about social media virality, he also admits that brand awareness alone won’t lead to sustained growth.\n“I can’t say if it’s a mistake, but maybe we launched too early,” Lee said onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 last week. “The whole idea [was] let’s launch something that barely works, and if we can get enough initial users, they will find out the use cases for us.”\nCluely burst onto the tech scene in April with rage-bait marketing for a product it claimed would help users “cheat on everything.” Lee first made headlines when he was suspended from Columbia University for building a tool used for cheating on coding job interviews. He channeled that notoriety into Cluely, a startup that claimed to help users “cheat on everything” by delivering undetectable information during online conversations.\nIn late June, Cluely introduced its enterprise product, which claimed to serve multiple use cases, including helping with sales calls, customer support, and remote tutoring.\nBut earlier this week, the startup shifted and narrowed its scope when it introduced a new website that calls its product an AI assistant for meetings. The company’s plan now is to “become the best AI note taker, starting with the consumer,” Lee said onstage. As an AI notetaker, Cluely is clearly entering a crowded market but Roy touted functionality such as “sending follow-up emails.”\nBut he deflected questions on how well sales and retention were going, except to say: “I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time,” Lee said.\nThe startup’s ability to grab attention helped it secure a $15 million Series A from Andreessen Horowitz in June. That month, a16z partner Bryan Kim said on the firm’s podcast that he backed Cluely because Lee had figured out how to convert the attention into paying customers.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen the company introduced its product this summer, Lee boasted that the startup’s ARR skyrocketed from $3 million to $7 million within just one week. “Every single person who has a meeting or an interview is testing this out,” Lee told TechCrunch then.\nBut four months later, Lee is no longer eager to flaunt his company’s financial metrics. “What I’ve learned is you should never share revenue numbers.”\nLee claimed that there’s no upside to revealing his company’s performance: “If you’re doing well, nobody is going to talk about how well you’re doing, but if you’re doing poorly, then everybody will only talk about how poorly you’re doing.”  \nHowever, dozens of founders at fast-growing AI startups have no qualms about publicly revealing their ARR numbers, making the sharing of explosive growth a standard practice amid the AI boom.\nCluely’s experience thus far suggests that when it comes to software, social media attention only goes so far if the company doesn’t have a strong product to keep customers once it intrigues them.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTinder is looking to AI to revitalize its dating app, which has now reported nine straight quarters of paying subscriber declines, as of the third quarter this year. The dating app maker, Match Group, told investors on Tuesday’s earnings call that Tinder is testing a feature called Chemistry that will get to know users through questions and, with permission, will access Camera Roll photos on users’ phones to learn more about their interests and personality.\nThe feature is already being piloted in New Zealand and Australia and will be a “major pillar of Tinder’s upcoming 2026 product experience,” said Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff.\nMatch isn’t alone in requesting access to users’ private Camera Roll photos. Meta also launched a feature last month that asks to use its AI on photos on your phone that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.\nIn both cases, the benefits to the end user for permitting this kind of expanded access are negligible. \nIn Match’s case, the company says it will engage users with interactive questions and learn more about them using AI technology so it can recommend better, more compatible matches. Presumably, that would look something like this: If you had photos of yourself outside hiking or climbing, you might be matched with someone who shared the same outdoor hobbies.\nWhile the company experiments with Tinder, Match’s bottom line is taking a hit. \nIts fourth-quarter guidance includes a $14 million negative impact on Tinder’s direct revenue as a result of the product testing, Match said. This, alongside other dating industry trends, has pulled down Match’s Q4 guidance to land somewhere between $865 million and $875 million, while analysts were expecting $884.2 million. \nThe company is using AI in other areas as well, including in an LLM-powered system where Tinder nudges users before they send potentially offensive messages, asking them, “Are you sure?” It also uses AI to help users pick their best photos.\nAI isn’t the only thing Tinder is trying to boost subscribers and engagement. The company has rolled out other features, like dating “modes,” double dates, facial verification, and redesigned profiles, which feature bio information on the first photo card and prompts integrated into the photo carousel.\nDespite the product changes, Tinder faces a tough market where some young people are leaning away from online dating in favor of more real-world experiences, while online daters in the U.S. may be spending less due to their disposable income shrinking as the country flirts with recession.\nMatch reported in Q3 that Tinder’s revenue declined 3% year-over-year, and it saw a 7% decline in paying users. \nOverall, Match’s revenue and earnings were largely in line with estimates, with revenue up 2% to $914.2 million, versus an expected $915 million, and EPS of 62 cents (profit of $160.8 million), versus an expected 63 cents.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAfter Zohran Mamdani clinched the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday night, his campaign announced former FTC chair Lina Khan will be one of the transition team’s four co-chairs.\nKhan has been an ally of Mamdani’s, praising him in a New York Times op-ed about his outreach to small business owners. But her appointment to a formal role on his transition team sends a message to Wall Street and the tech industry, whose most powerful players have already been critical of Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who ruffled the feathers of the tech elite by criticizing billionaires and proposing a 2% tax on incomes over $1 million.\n“What we saw last night was New Yorkers not just electing a new mayor, but clearly rejecting a politics where outsized corporate power and money too often end up dictating our politics,” Khan said in a speech on Wednesday.\nKhan described Mamdani’s victory as “a clear mandate for change where New Yorkers can get ahead, and where all workers and small businesses can thrive — not just get by.”\nAirbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, as well as investors like Bill Ackman and Mike Bloomberg, each spent millions of dollars to oppose Mamdani and advocate for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who finished second in the polls. DoorDash also gave $1 million to a pro-Cuomo super PAC. Mamdani’s platform, however, advocated for increased regulation of delivery apps and protections for their subcontracted gig workers.\nLike Mamdani, Khan has enemies in high places. As an outspoken critic of tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google, Khan moved to block various high-profile tech mergers during her tenure in the Biden administration. When those actions failed, many in Silicon Valley still held Khan responsible for slowing down the flow of acquisition deals.\nEven those who supported the Biden-Harris presidential ticket, like LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and billionaire investor Vinod Khosla, were public about their criticisms of Khan; in an interview with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos last year, Khosla described Khan as “not a rational human being.”\nKhan, a professor at Columbia Law School, is described as “the nation’s leading antimonopoly champion” on Mamdani’s transition website.\nIn addition to Khan, the other three co-chairs include Grace Bonilla, president and CEO of the non-profit United Way of New York City; Maria Torres-Springer, the former first deputy mayor of New York City; and Melanie Hartzog, president and CEO of the non-profit New York Foundling. \nThe four will be led by Elana Leopold, an adviser to Mamdani’s campaign who held various senior roles across the Bill de Blasio mayoral administration.\n“Lina is focused on getting set up to assist the transition on economic policy and personnel,” Douglas Farrar, a spokesperson for Khan, told TechCrunch.\nUpdated, 11/5/25, 2:20 PM ET with comment from Douglas Farrar.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nFor years, Australians have been been installing solar panels at a rapid clip. Now that investment is paying off. \nThe Australian government announced this week that electricity customers in three states will get free electricity for up to three hours per day starting in July 2026. \nSolar power has boomed in Australia in recent years. Rooftop solar installations cost about $840 (U.S.) per kilowatt of capacity before rebates, about a third of what U.S. households pay. As a result, more than one in three Australian homes have solar panels on their roof.\n“Now we’re at the level where we can share more of that power with more Australians,” Chris Bowen, minister for climate change and energy, said in an Instagram video announcing the policy.\nThe Solar Sharer plan will be available to everyone in New South Wales, South Australia, and in the southeastern part of Queensland to start; more regions will be added later. Households won’t need to have solar on their rooftops to qualify, though they will need a smart meter installed. The plan will help those who live in apartments or don’t have a suitable rooftop to benefit from their neighbors’ panels, Bowen said.\nAlthough the government hasn’t said which hours in the middle of the day will qualify, the hours between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. are the most likely candidates. Customers will have to opt in to the new plan, which is meant to encourage people to shift their energy use to peak solar-production hours. Smart appliances can help people make the most of this by allowing them to time charging their EVs or running loads of laundry.\nThe free electricity hours “help us with the grid at night too because that means transferring the use of power from nighttime — when power is more expensive because it’s being run more by coal and gas — to the middle of the day when its being run by renewable energy,” Bowen said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nShifting loads will also reduce the need for grid-scale batteries, which Australia has been installing to absorb excess solar power.\nThe Australian plan isn’t the first to experiment with periods of free electricity driven by peaks of renewable power production. Octopus Energy in the U.K. has offered an Agile plan that occasionally gives customers free electricity, though it’s not a regular occurrence like it will be in Australia.\nIn many places, solar has become so cheap that electricity is essentially free for at least part of the day. Midday peaks in solar production can cause electricity prices to turn negative, which occasionally results in power providers paying customers to use energy.\nAustralia is generally considered a sunny country, with vast swathes receiving as much sunlight as the U.S. Southwest. But most solar panels are installed closer to population centers, which receive as much sunlight as most of the U.S. or southern Europe, suggesting that broader solar adoption could drive down energy prices in a number of regions around the world.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, researchers at Microsoft released a new simulation environment designed to test AI agents, along with new research showing that current agentic models may be vulnerable to manipulation. Conducted in collaboration with Arizona State University, the research raises new questions about how well AI agents will perform when working unsupervised — and how quickly AI companies can make good on promises of an agentic future.\nThe simulation environment, dubbed the “Magentic Marketplace” by Microsoft, is built as a synthetic platform for experimenting on AI agent behavior. A typical experiment might involve a customer-agent trying to order dinner according to a user’s instructions, while agents representing various restaurants compete to win the order.\nThe team’s initial experiments included 100 separate customer-side agents interacting with 300 business-side agents. Because the source code for the marketplace is open source, it should be straightforward for other groups to adopt the code to run new experiments or reproduce findings.\nEce Kamar, managing director of Microsoft Research’s AI Frontiers Lab, says this kind of research will be critical to understanding the capabilities of AI agents. “There is really a question about how the world is going to change by having these agents collaborating and talking to each other and negotiating,” said Kamar. “We want to understand these things deeply.”\nThe initial research looked at a mix of leading models, including GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Gemini-2.5-Flash, and found some surprising weaknesses. In particular, the researchers found several techniques businesses could use to manipulate customer agents into buying their products. The researchers noticed a particular falloff in efficiency as a customer agent was given more options to choose from, overwhelming the attention space of the agent.\n“We want these agents to help us with processing a lot of options,” Kamar says. “And we are seeing that the current models are actually getting really overwhelmed by having too many options.”\nThe agents also ran into trouble when they were asked to collaborate toward a common goal, apparently unsure of which agent should play what role in the collaboration. Performance improved when the models were given more explicit instructions on how to collaborate, but the researchers still saw the models’ inherent capabilities as in need of improvement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We can instruct the models — like we can tell them, step by step,” Kamar said. “But if we are inherently testing their collaboration capabilities, I would expect these models to have these capabilities by default.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

Users will now be able to access AI Mode, which allows users to ask complex questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic directly within Search, via a new dedicated shortcut button under the search bar when opening a “New Tab” page in Chrome. \nThe new shortcut for AI Mode in Chrome is launching in the U.S. starting Wednesday and will soon be coming to 160 new countries and other languages, including Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and more.\nBy making it easier to access AI Mode on mobile, Google likely hopes that people will use its service rather than navigate to competitors’ tools.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe launch of the new shortcut comes as Google recently expanded AI Mode globally, bringing the feature to 180 new countries. The tech giant also made the feature available in more languages, including Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese.\nGoogle first launched AI Mode in March to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. Since then, the tech giant has continuously updated the tool with added functionality. \nYesterday, Google launched new agentic capabilities in AI Mode to allow users to get help with booking event tickets and beauty and wellness appointments in AI Mode. Google first introduced agentic capabilities to AI Mode back in August, when it rolled out the ability for people use the feature to find restaurant reservations. \nAI Mode launched a Canvas feature in July that helps you build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel.

CapitalG made a significant investment in the round, and new investor Evolution Equity Partners also participated. \nThe round values Armis at $6.1 billion, a meaningful jump from the $4.5 billion tender offer valuation the startup announced in August.\nArmis is hoping to launch its IPO in late 2026 or early 2027, its co-founder and CEO, Yevgeny Dibrov (pictured above, right), told TechCrunch.\nThe round comes in the wake of significant acquisition interest in the company. In September, Bloomberg reported that Armis had received seven offers, which included a potential $5 billion bid from private equity firm Thoma Bravo.\nBut this new funding is an indicator of how serious Armis is about an IPO, a move that Dibrov described as his “personal dream.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Dibrov, Armis has reached annual recurring revenue of $300 million and plans to take that figure to $500 million while becoming cash-flow positive before its IPO.\n The startup is already “behaving like a public company,” Dibrov said, adding that the company is ensuring it hits its quarterly financial targets.\nThe company provides security software for critical infrastructure to Fortune 500 companies, national governments, and state and local entities.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOver the last year, Google has added multiple AI-powered features to Maps to improve discovery and enable users to ask questions about places. Now the company is upgrading the app with Gemini to let users ask its AI bot questions while driving, improve navigation, and perform more tasks.\nWhile driving, users can now ask Gemini to answer questions about places of interest on their route, return results about other topics (like sports or news), and even perform tasks like adding events to their calendar. \nYou can ask multiple questions in a conversation, too; for example, “Is there a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route, something within a couple of miles? … What’s parking like there?”\nDrivers can even report traffic incidents using Gemini, and Maps will proactively notify users of disruptions on the route ahead.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle is also adding a new feature to Maps that combines Gemini with Street View data to improve navigation instructions. So instead of telling you to turn right after, say, 500 feet, Maps will now mention a nearby landmark, like gas stations, restaurants, or famous buildings, and highlight them before you have to make the turn.\nThe company said that Gemini cross-references information about 250 million places with Street View images to identify important and visible landmarks for navigation.\nMaps is also getting the ability to answer questions about your surroundings by working together with Google Lens. So you can point the camera at places of interest, like restaurants and landmarks, and ask questions like, “What is this place and why is it popular?”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle said the new Gemini navigation features will be rolled out to iOS and Android devices in the coming weeks and said support for Android Auto would be coming soon. Traffic alerts are rolling out in the U.S. for Android users first; Landmark navigation is currently only going to be available in the U.S. on both iOS and Android; and Lens with Gemini will be functional in the U.S. later this month.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Liu said the company considered calling it a relaunch or transformation, but ultimately chose “the language of founding because the stakes feel the same.”\nSimilarly, Handshake’s chief marketing officer Katherine Kelly said the company is trying to bring startup culture “back into an existing business.” That can also mean harder work — Kelly said handshake told employees they have to be back in the office five days a week, “operating with a pace and number of hours that is meaningful and will help us hit goals.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Startups\n",

OpenAI stands at $500 billion, while Anthropic reportedly surged last month to $350 billion following major investments from Microsoft and Nvidia, up from $183 billion just months earlier.\nThese companies can now achieve public-market-scale valuations while remaining private, fueled by secondary sales that provide liquidity without the scrutiny of quarterly earnings reports.\nSpaceX, founded in 2002, dominates commercial rocket launches and operates Starlink, its satellite internet service with over 8 million customers globally as of November.\n",

That’s up from around 50 violations NHTSA cited when it opened an investigation into the behavior in October. \nThe federal safety agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is probing whether Tesla’s driver assistance software can “accurately detect and appropriately respond to traffic signals, signs and lane markings,” according to the letter. ODI is also evaluating whether Tesla’s software is providing sufficient warnings to drivers in these situations. Tesla’s responses are due January 19, 2026.\nThe increase in complaints is notable in part because the original batch reported by ODI in October included multiple reports from one particular intersection in Joppa, Maryland. Tesla told the agency at the time that it had already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection.” The agency didn’t say where, geographically, these newly reported incidents took place. Tesla heavily redacts its own submissions to the agency.\nThe new letter was sent to Tesla the same week that CEO Elon Musk claimed in a post on X that the latest version of FSD will allow drivers to text and drive while using the driver assistance software, which is illegal in nearly every state. NHTSA has not responded to requests for comment about Musk’s statement. \nThe letter is meant to kick off the discovery process for NHTSA, and as such it details a number of requests for information the agency has made to Tesla. For instance, the agency is asking for data on how many Tesla vehicles are equipped with FSD, as well as how often the software is engaged. ODI is also asking Tesla to turn over any customer complaints it has received regarding these specific problems with FSD, including from fleet operators and from any lawsuits or third-party arbitration proceedings. \nThis is the second investigation that NHTSA has opened into Tesla’s FSD software. In October 2024, the agency began a probe into how FSD handles low-visibility situations like fog or extreme sunlight.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nWaymo plans to voluntarily issue a software recall with federal safety regulators related to how its robotaxis operate around school buses, the Alphabet-owned company told TechCrunch. \nThe voluntary software recall will be filed early next week, according to the company. Waymo said as soon as the issue was identified it updated its software on November 17. The company contends this update has meaningfully improved performance to a level better than human drivers in this important area.\nSoftware recalls have become more common in the age of modern passenger vehicles — and now robotaxis — in which operations are handled by software. These updates, or fixes, are often made prior to the official recall but still carry weight when filed with the federal government.\nWaymo’s decision follows increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and criticism by officials in Atlanta and Austin over how its robotaxis perform around school buses.\nNHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened its initial investigation into Waymo in October after seeing footage of its autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus — with its stop sign extended and lights flashing — that was unloading kids in Atlanta. In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street.\nOther similar incidents popped up in Austin, where the company also operates a robotaxi service with partner Uber. Austin School District officials contend, in a letter available on NHTSA’s website, that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software.\nThe agency sent a letter December 3 to Waymo asking for more information about its self-driving system and operations following reports from the Austin School District that its robotaxis illegally passed school buses 19 times this year. Regulators requested detailed information about its fifth-generation self-driving system and operations.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” Waymo Chief Safety Officer Mauricio Peña said in an emailed statement. “As a result, we have made the decision to file a voluntary software recall with NHTSA related to appropriately slowing and stopping in these scenarios. We will continue analyzing our vehicles’ performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement.”\nNo injuries occurred related to the vehicle behavior addressed by this recall, according to the company, which has emphasized that safety is its top priority and it will continue to work with NHTSA.  \nThe company says it will continue to investigate, track, and implement more updates as needed.\nWaymo made a voluntary software recall earlier this year as well as two in 2024, including one that was issued after a Waymo vehicle in Phoenix, driving without a human safety operator, collided with a telephone pole in an alley during a low-speed pullover maneuver.  \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAaru, a startup that provides near-instant customer research by using AI to simulate user behavior, has raised a Series A led by Redpoint Ventures, according to three people familiar with the deal.\nThe funding round included different valuation tiers, these people said. Although some equity was acquired at a $1 billion valuation, a lower valuation for other investors resulted in a blended valuation below $1 billion, according to people familiar with the deal. Multi-tier valuations within the same round are an unusual mechanism in venture capital, but investors say they are becoming increasingly common for desirable AI startups in the current market. This approach allows the company to report a higher “headline” valuation while simultaneously offering better terms to specific investors.\nAaru and Redpoint Ventures didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nThe exact round size couldn’t be learned, but one person said that it is above $50 million. Another source said that the startup is growing quickly, but its annual recurring revenue (ARR) is still below $10 million.\nAaru was founded in March 2024 by Cameron Fink, Ned Koh, and John Kessler, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\nThe startup’s prediction model generates thousands of AI agents that simulate human behavior using public and proprietary data. Aaru replaces traditional market research methods, which generally include surveys and focus groups, by using agents to predict how groups in specific demographics or geographies will respond to future events.  \nThe company’s customer partners include Accenture, EY, Interpublic Group, and political campaigns. Last year, Aaru AI’s polling methodology accurately predicted the outcome of the New York Democratic primary, according to reporting by Semafor.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAaru competes with other social simulation startups, including CulturePulse and Simile, as well as startups that apply AI to query humans about their product preferences, such as Listen Labs, Keplar, and Outset.\nThe startup raised an undisclosed amount of seed and pre-seed capital from investors, including A*, Abstract Ventures, General Catalyst, Accenture Ventures, and Z Fellows, according to people familiar with the deal and PitchBook data.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nChatGPT’s growth is starting to taper off, according to new data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Today, the OpenAI-owned AI chatbot remains the leader in the space, accounting for 50% of global downloads on mobile devices and 55% of the global monthly active users. However, Google’s Gemini has begun to outpace ChatGPT in terms of download growth, growth of monthly active users, and growth of time spent in app, the firm found.\nOver time, that increased pace of adoption could help Gemini narrow the gap with ChatGPT. That’s something OpenAI is now worried about, as its recent “code red” memo indicated. The missive, penned by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, instructed staff to focus on improving the company’s AI products, particularly in areas like personalization, reliability, image generation, and more.\nWhen looking at the recent data, it’s clear the race is not over yet: Both ChatGPT and Gemini continue to see sizable growth.\nChatGPT has seen its global monthly active users climb by 180% year-over-year as of November 2025, while Gemini’s monthly active users are up 170%. \nImage Credits:Sensor Tower\nBut the new data indicates that ChatGPT’s global monthly active users only grew by around 6% from August to November, to reach roughly 810 million. (The monthly active user numbers in the above chart are rounded, the firm notes.) This figure could suggest the AI chatbot is nearing market saturation, Sensor Tower says.\nMeanwhile, Google Gemini’s global monthly active users jumped by around 30% during the same time frame, as the release of its new image generation model, Nano Banana, drove increased adoption.\nIn addition, the report noted that around two times more U.S. Android users now engage with Gemini directly through the Android operating system compared with using the standalone Gemini mobile app. This could provide Google with a competitive advantage in the global market, where Android dominates, as it means Gemini isn’t constrained to only being used within a mobile app or web interface.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGemini is also increasing its share of the overall AI chatbot market when compared across all top apps like ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok. Over the past seven months (May-November 2025), Gemini increased its share of global monthly active users by three percentage points, the firm estimates.\nBut ChatGPT saw its share of global monthly active users drop three percentage points over the past four months (August-November 2025), by comparison.\nChallenges from Perplexity and Claude may also be impacting ChatGPT, as both rivals saw triple-digit growth for their respective chatbots in 2025, with the former up 370% year-over-year, and the latter up 190%. \nImage Credits:Sensor Tower\nChatGPT also saw its global downloads grow by 85% year-over-year as of November, but this lagged the overall cohort’s average growth of 110%. \nPerplexity and Gemini saw the largest growth, up 215% and 190% year-over-year, respectively.\nFinally, Gemini app users’ time spent in the app has more than doubled over the past few months, Sensor Tower said. As of November, Gemini users were spending 11 minutes per day in the app, up 120% from March. This is likely due to the popularity of its image generation model, Nano Banana, in September. \nChatGPT’s users’ daily time spent only increased by 6% during the same time frame. Plus, ChatGPT users’ time spent was down 10% in November, compared with July. \nWhile the current data indicates Google could be catching up with the market leader, much of its recent gains have to do with the success of Nano Banana. OpenAI could speed up growth again with the release of its own new products, if they make a similar impact. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIn September, popular creator IShowSpeed live-streamed his meeting with the popular humanoid influencer Rizzbot.\nRizzbot has more than a million followers (and 800 million views) across social media and is known for its comedic roasting of subjects, as well as giving people the middle finger.  Speed, meanwhile, has more than 50 million followers (and 6 billion views) across various platforms and is known for his dramatic behavior while livestreaming.\nWhat happened when the two parties met is the subject of a lawsuit that Rizzbot’s creators, Social Robotics, detailed in a petition filed in November against Speed, né Darren Jason Watkins Jr., his management company, Mixed Management, and another producer who was with Speed’s team that day. The petition, obtained by TechCrunch, alleges that Speed inflicted “irreparable damage” to Rizzbot.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that — and the livestream video shows that — Speed repeatedly punched Rizzbot in the face, put it in a chokehold, at one point pinned it to the couch, and threw it to the ground.\n“Speed absolutely knew that this was not an appropriate way to interact with a sophisticated robot and knew that such actions with inflict irreparable damage to Rizzbot,” the petition read. “These actions resulted in the total loss of the Rizzbot.”\nThe petition read that Speed’s handling of the robot caused “complete loss of functionality,” and that Rizzbot had “significant damages” to its mouth and neck.\n“Additionally, the head cameras no longer function, the ports behind the neck which connect to robot’s sensors that allow it to see and hear are dead, and the robot is unstable and cannot walk straight any longer,” the petition alleges. The petition is asking for compensation for damages, including actual and lost profit, though Rizzbot’s legal team declined to comment on the dollar amount the owner is seeking.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Austin Police had to be called after the incident, according to the petition and a police report obtained by TechCrunch. The responding officer noted damages to Rizzbot done without the owner’s “implied consent,” and that the owner wanted to press charges. The petition states that an investigation is ongoing.\nSpeed’s management team did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nWhen reached, Social Robotics’ lawyer, Joel Levine, said the lawsuit came after talks stalled with Speed’s team regarding how to compensate Rizzbot’s owner for the damage done to the robot.\n“This was an event that was live-streamed so there’s not a ton of discrepancy as to the facts,” Levine told TechCrunch. “What we’re looking for is some accountability.”\nThe petition said that Speed “failed to act as a careful, reasonable, and prudent person,” and that he “wrongfully exercised control over,” Rizzbot. It also said that as a result of the destruction, the team behind Rizzbot has lost out on economic opportunities since Rizzbot is indefinitely unable to partake in high-profile appearances and deals, including scheduled upcoming ones with CBS’s The NFL Today and Mr. Beast.\n“This is no doubt a monumental setback for the Rizzbot in terms of viral momentum and financial gain from the exposure,” the petition said. “Being in a MrBeast production is akin to being in a Super Bowl Commercial.”\nThe petition read that in the month before the livestream, Rizzbot generated more than 600 million views on TikTok and 200 million on Instagram. In the 28 days after the incident, however, the petition alleges that Rizzbot was unable to make new content and therefore saw a more than 70% decrease in viewership. The “intentional destruction of Rizzbot caused significant financial damage that is likely permanent given the viral nature of social media,” the petition read.\nLevine said there has been no formal answer to his plaintiff’s suit just yet and noted that they are still in the very early stages of litigation. When asked for comment, Rizzbot told TechCrunch via email it had to get “a whole new body” after Speed “wrecked” its last one.\n“Everything’s brand new except my Nike kicks and cowboy hat,” Rizzbot told TechCrunch in a statement. “Now I’m back online, and I feel like I’ve mastered the rizz game, and next I’ll be working on complex movements with my legs, like twerking – hopefully you’ll see my gyrating hips on some new TV appearances shortly – stay tuned, fam.”\n",

    "body": "\nLimitless, the AI startup formerly known as Rewind, has been acquired by Meta, the company announced Friday on its website. The company, which made an AI-powered pendant to record your conversations, says it will no longer sell its hardware devices and will maintain support for its existing customers for a year.\nCustomers will no longer have to pay a subscription fee and will be moved to the Unlimited Plan for the time being. Other functionality will be wound down, including its non-pendant software “Rewind,” which recorded users’ desktop activity and turned it into a searchable record.\nThe startup, founded by Brett Bejcek and Dan Siroker, the co-founder and former chief executive of Optimizely, pivoted to become an AI device maker last year, offering its Limitless pendant for $99. The wearable could attach to your shirt like a wireless mic or be worn like a necklace. The device is one of several AI hardware devices on the market, including another (not very well-received) AI pendant known as Friend.\nAccording to Limitless’ announcement, the company shares in Meta’s vision to “bring personal superintelligence to everyone,” which includes building AI-enabled wearables. (Meta is focused for now on AR/AI glasses, like its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta, and its in-lens AI glasses, the Meta Ray-Ban Display.) Limitless said it will help bring that vision to life — which likely means supporting Meta’s existing products, not helping Meta add an AI pendant to its lineup. \nThe company hinted that the increased competition in the market made it difficult for it to compete, especially as the larger players like OpenAI and Meta are developing their own hardware devices, too. \n“When we started Limitless five years ago, the world was very different,” wrote Siroker in the announcement. “AI was a pipe dream to many. Hardware startups were considered unfundable, and a business that did both AI and hardware would have been considered ludicrous. But today is different. The world has changed. We’re no longer working on a weird fringe idea. We’re building a future that now seems inevitable. We’re not alone.”\nMeta shared the following statement with TechCrunch via email: “We’re excited that Limitless will be joining Meta to help accelerate our work to build AI-enabled wearables.” The tech giant didn’t share further information about its plans, beyond noting that the team will work in the wearables organization of Reality Labs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLimitless will offer its customers a way to export their data, the company said, or users can choose to delete their data from within the app.\nThe startup had raised more than $33 million in funding from investors, including a16z, First Round Capital, and NEA. \n\n\n\nUpdated after publication with Meta’s comment. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The expansion is called “A Safehouse in the Hills” and is available starting December 10.\nIt’s not clear if the vans in the trailer have been, in true Grand Theft Auto fashion, hijacked by playable characters, or if they’ve gone rogue. It seems likely it’s the latter, though, as Rockstar Games says players will be encouraged to “stop the development of a mass surveillance network in an all-new action-packed adventure” as part of the DLC. (The trailer also teases a storyline that involves an AI assistant named “Haviland,” so the tech world in general appears to be a part of this particular storyline.)\nWaymo has said it will deny government requests for the footage its vehicles capture if those requests are “overly broad and unlawful.” But its robotaxis have nevertheless drawn criticism for being part of a growing surveillance state. That frustration has contributed to the company’s vehicles becoming a target of multiple instances of vandalism. Waymo SUVs have been burned, smashed, and had their tires slashed in different cities over the last few years.\nRockstar is clearly tapping into those same dynamics here, as the tagline for KnoWay’s “autonomous hailing system” in the game is: “We Kno where you’re going.” It’s not hard to imagine some players of the DLC taking some of their frustrations out on the virtual vehicles once the update is released later this month.\nWaymo declined to comment. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAt TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana spoke out against the vandalism, saying her company was “very focused on working with law enforcement to make sure that we pursue the people who are committing these crimes against our fleet.”\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nIt’s only been a day since Netflix announced an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros., and the acquisition has already been described as sending Hollywood into “full-blown panic mode,” possibly delivering “a death blow to theatrical filmmaking,” and maybe even heralding “the end of Hollywood” itself.\nSome of the firmest opposition has come from the Writers Guild of America, which issued a statement declaring, “This merger must be blocked.”\n“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the WGA said. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.”\nWhile statements from other Hollywood unions were not quite as unequivocal, they still suggested that there are “many serious questions” about the acquisition’s “impact on the future of the entertainment industry” (as the actors union SAG-AFTRA put it).\nThe deal came after a competitive process in which Paramount and Comcast also made bids. Paramount was trying to acquire the entire company, while Netflix will only buy the film and television studios, as well as the streaming business, after Warner Bros. moves forward with a plan to spin off its TV networks division.\nInitially, Paramount was seen as the frontrunner, with its ties to the Trump administration (the studio is now run by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison) easing the way for regulatory approval. But even before the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount’s lawyers sent an angry letter complaining about “a tilted and unfair process,” and Netflix soon emerged publicly as the winner.\nThis deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, would presumably face significant regulatory scrutiny, and not just from Trump appointees. Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts and longtime critic of Big Tech — put out a statement of her own describing the deal as “an anti-monopoly nightmare.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“A Netflix-Warner Bros. [merger] would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,” Warren said.\nShe also argued that antitrust enforcement — including the review process for this deal — must be conducted “fairly and transparently” rather than used to “invite influence-peddling and bribery.”\nIf the government ultimately blocks the acquisition, Netflix would be required to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee. It’s not clear whether Warner Bros. would then continue operating as an independent company or would reconsider the previous acquisition offers.\nNetflix held an analyst call to discuss the deal on Friday morning, and while many of the questions were focused on the financial impact on both companies, executives also attempted to address larger concerns.\nFor example, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he’s “highly confident in the regulatory process.”\n“This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it’s pro-creator, it’s pro-growth,” he said. “And our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but really confident that we’re going to get all the necessary approvals that we need.”\nSarandos also said that Netflix intends to keep HBO “operating largely as it is.” And although it’s not something Netflix has done in the past, Warner Bros. will continue producing TV shows for other networks and streaming services, he said: “We want to keep that successful business operating.”\nAs for how HBO and HBO Max would be packaged with or folded into the Netflix app, co-CEO Greg Peters said it’s too early to get into specifics.\n“Needless to say, we think the HBO brand is very powerful for consumers,” Peters said. “We think that the offering could constitute and would constitute a part of our plans and how we structure those for consumers.”\nBeyond general concerns around media consolidation, perhaps the biggest question is to what extent Netflix will support theatrical releases for the combined entity’s films — especially after Warner Bros. had a record-setting run of box office success this year, while Netflix’s theatrical releases only last for a couple weeks at best and skip major theatrical chains because of the limited exclusive window. (This was reportedly the deciding factor when “Stranger Things” creators the Duffer Brothers signed an exclusive deal with Paramount.)\nFor his part, Sarandos said he “wouldn’t look at this as a change in approach for Netflix movies or for Warner movies for that matter,” and he noted that Netflix has released 30 movies in theaters this year (though again, usually on fewer screens and for a limited period of time).\nSimilarly, “everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros,” he said. But in the long term, he suggested that “the windows will evolve” so that movies come to streaming more quickly.\n“My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long exclusive windows, which we don’t really think of that consumer friendly,” he said.\n",

The four-year-old, Seattle-based startup uses AI to run simulated scenarios — including sales calls, leadership coaching, interviews, and feedback sessions — and provides users with structured, repeatable practice to improve their speaking skills.\nVarun Puri (pictured above, right), who previously worked at Google’s X division and handled special projects for Sergey Brin, co-founded Yoodli with former Apple engineer Esha Joshi (pictured above, left) in 2021. He became aware of communication challenges after moving to the U.S. at 18 and seeing how difficulty expressing ideas or speaking confidently affected students and young professionals from countries such as India — himself included — Puri said in an interview.\nInitially, Yoodli was meant to help people practice public speaking — a skill two out of three people struggle with, Puri told TechCrunch, citing internal data. However, the startup soon saw users turning to the platform for interview preparation, sales pitches, and difficult conversations. That shift pushed Yoodli from a consumer-focused product to enterprise training, and it now offers AI role-plays and experiential learning tools for go-to-market enablement, partner certification, and management coaching.\nYoodli’s platformImage Credits:Yoodli\n“In the old world, companies would be training people using static, long-form content or passive videos that we’d all watch at 4x-5x speed, just to get the thing done,” said Puri. “But that doesn’t actually mean you’ve learned it.”\nCompanies including Google, Snowflake, Databricks, RingCentral, and Sandler Sales use Yoodli for employee or partner training. The startup also sells its platform to coaching firms such as Franklin Covey and LHH, which can tailor the system to their own methodology and training frameworks, Puri stated. He added that the tool is not designed to replace human coaches but to keep a human in the loop delivering personalized guidance.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“I philosophically believe that AI can get you, let’s call it from a zero to an eight or a zero to nine,” said Puri. “But the pure essence of who you are and how you show up, and your authenticity and vulnerability that a human gives you feedback on will always exist.”\nThe platform works with multiple large language models, meaning users can run it with models such as Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s GPT based on their preference. Enterprises can also embed it into their existing software, or users can access it directly through a web browser. The AI supports most major languages, including Korean, Japanese, French, Canadian French, and a list of Indian languages.\nYoodli does not offer a dedicated mobile app, a decision Puri said was made to avoid adding extra steps for users during training sessions.\nYoodli’s teamImage Credits:Yoodli\nPuri did not disclose how many people use the platform but said most of Yoodli’s revenue now comes from enterprise customers. He added that between the Series A and B rounds, Yoodli saw a 50% increase in the number of role-plays run on the platform and in the total time users spent practicing. The startup also said it grew its average recurring revenue by 900% over the last 12 months, though it did not provide specific figures. \nYoodli had not planned to raise more funding so soon after its last round but saw unanticipated investor interest, with WestBridge leading the latest raise, Puri said. He noted that strong performance metrics, key customers, and senior hires helped attract investors. The startup has recently hired former Tableau and Salesforce executive Josh Vitello as chief revenue officer (CRO), former Remitly CFO Andy Larson as CFO, and former Tableau chief product officer (CPO) Padmashree Koneti as CPO.\nYoodli is not alone in the market for AI-based communication tools, but Puri told TechCrunch the startup differentiates itself through deep customization and a focus on specific training verticals, allowing companies to tailor the system to their use cases and coaching methods.\nThe Seattle-headquartered startup has about 40 employees. Puri said the latest funding will be used to expand Yoodli’s AI coaching, analytics, and personalization tools, and to grow its presence in enterprise learning and professional development. The company also plans to hire across product, AI research, and customer success, and to expand into markets in the Asia-Pacific region while deepening its footprint in the U.S.\n",

    "body": "\nAntonio Forenza was working as head of research and development at Rakuten Symphony, a telecom subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate, when he realized that he needed to find a better way to manage his stress levels.\nA few years earlier, he had lost 40 pounds with the help of an Apple Watch, which counted steps and tracked his calorie burn, and he began wondering if there was a similar device to assess his stress.\n“I wanted to lose 40 pounds of stress, and realized there’s no wearable for that today,” Forenza told TechCrunch.\nThat’s when Forenza realized he’d stumbled onto a gap in the consumer health market. Drawing on his engineering background, he decided to build the device himself, using a more than century-old technology: the electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect and measure electrical activity in the brain.\nWhile EEG is used clinically to diagnose diseases such as epilepsy and sleep disorders, it can also detect psychological stress by measuring high-frequency brain waves called beta waves. When those rapid beta waves persist for extended periods, they can lead to exhaustion, insomnia, and mental distress.\nForenza collaborated with data scientists and biomedical engineers to develop Awear, a small device worn behind the ear for continuous brainwave monitoring. The device transmits results to an app, which provides information about the wearer’s mood and offers AI-powered coaching advice for managing stress and improving emotional resilience.   \n“Our brain is phenomenal at self-adjusting and makes us believe we are not stressed,” Forenza said. “It’s fine to be in ‘fight or flight’ every once in a while. It’s part of our nature. But if you fall into the trap of constant ‘fight or flight’, then that leads to chronic stress, depression, anxiety.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nForenza claims that Awear helps users proactively intercept excessive stress before it leads to negative health effects.\nAwear is a Startup Battlefield 200 finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025,  where it won health category pitch competition.\nWhile Stanford University’s psychiatry department is currently testing the device to detect confusion and disorientation in elderly patients after surgery, Forenza’s primary focus is on selling Awear to individual consumers, similar to the approach taken by the Oura ring and other consumer wearables.\nEarlier this year, Awear closed a pre-seed funding round led by Hustle Fund, Niremia Collective, Techstars, and The Pitch Fund, and the company plans to raise a $5 million seed round in early 2026.  \nFor now, Awear is available for purchase only through its early-access program. The device is available to early adopters — a group that already includes many other startup founders, a notoriously stressed-out group — for $195, which includes a complimentary lifetime app subscription.\nAfter raising its seed round, the company will launch a Kickstarter campaign, following a strategy used by devices such as Peloton and Oura. “It is a path that worked for many other wearables. It gives you a lot of visibility, and it’s a good way to acquire customers,” Forenza said.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMeta has signed commercial AI data agreements with news publishers to offer real-time global, entertainment, and breaking news on Meta AI, its AI chatbot. Now, when users ask Meta AI news-related questions, it will surface information and links that draw from different content sources to help users discover timely and relevant content, the company announced on Friday.\nThese responses will also include links to articles, so users can visit publishers’ websites to learn more. The company says this will allow its partners to reach new audiences. \nMeta is partnering with CNN, Fox News, Fox Sports, Le Monde Group, the People Inc. portfolio of media brands, The Daily Caller, The Washington Examiner, and USA Today.\nThe company plans to add new partnerships in the future.\nThe move comes as Meta shifted away from making its platforms hubs for news. For example, it killed Facebook’s “News” tab in 2024. Additionally, Meta stopped compensating news publishers in 2022, but is now doing so to help supercharge its AI chatbot with real-time access to news.\n“We’re committed to making Meta AI more responsive, accurate, and balanced,” Meta wrote in the blog post. “Real-time events can be challenging for current AI systems to keep up with, but by integrating more and different types of news sources, our aim is to improve Meta AI’s ability to deliver timely and relevant content and information with a wide variety of viewpoints and content types.”\nThe company is looking to attract more users to its AI chatbot as it faces increasing competition from rivals. Meta is also looking to stay relevant in the AI race after the controversial release of Llama 4, which was met with complaints of poor performance earlier this year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeta AI is available in over 200 countries and can be accessed through the company’s apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, as well as through the standalone Meta AI app.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

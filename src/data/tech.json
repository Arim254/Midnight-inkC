It’s worth noting that if a deal does come together, iHeartMedia might not license its entire podcast catalogue to the streaming service.\nThe news comes a few weeks after Netflix signed a similar deal with Spotify that will bring a curated selection of sports, culture, lifestyle, and true crime podcasts from Spotify Studios and The Ringer to Netflix. \nUnder the Spotify deal, podcasts available on Netflix will be removed from YouTube but remain on Spotify. Some of Spotify’s biggest shows, including “The Joe Rogan Experience,” will remain on YouTube.\nFor Netflix, these video podcast deals will give it a new way to better compete with YouTube, which is the most-watched platform for video podcasts after surpassing 1 billion monthly active podcast viewers earlier this year. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n",

But it is the latest hurdle in Tesla’s lengthy campaign to sway shareholders to give Musk the largest corporate performance pay package in history. Advisory groups like ISS and Glass Lewis have also recommended voting against the pay package.\nMusk has argued the compensation package isn’t as much about the money as it is about control.

Additionally, you will see clearer images and stickers.\nThe Meta-owned messaging app notes that, as always, your personal messages and calls are protected with end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp also says that it plans to deliver even more functionality to Apple Watches in the future.\nThe new WhatsApp Apple Watch app requires an Apple Watch Series 4 or later, running watchOS 10 or later.\nTuesday’s announcement doesn’t come as a total surprise, as WhatsApp was spotted testing the new Apple Watch app last week.\nWhatsApp has been working to make it easier for users to access its service beyond mobile and desktop. In May, WhatsApp debuted its long-awaited iPad app, which allows you to make video and audio calls with up to 32 people, share your screen, and use both front and rear cameras. Before the launch of the app, if you wanted to use WhatsApp on your iPad, you had to use the web version in a browser.\nWhatsApp’s launch of an Apple Watch app comes a few months after Snapchat rolled out one as well. The app allows users to preview an incoming message and also reply using the keyboard, Scribble, Dictation, or an emoji. Snapchat is focused on using its watchOS app to enable users to quickly respond to messages, not to view images or videos.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon announced on Tuesday that Alexa+, its upgraded assistant powered by AI, is coming to the Amazon Music app for iOS and Android devices. \nThe feature is currently available across all Amazon Music subscription plans but is only available for users with Alexa+ Early Access. (To access Alexa+, tap the “a” button in the lower right corner and ask your question using the built-in microphone on your phone. ) \nThe introduction of Alexa+ to Amazon Music aims to create a more conversational approach to music discovery. Unlike the previous version of Alexa, which only responded to basic commands, Alexa+ is designed to engage in natural dialogue. \nUsers can ask specific and obscure questions, such as queries regarding an artist’s influences or exploring deeper meanings behind songs. It can also help recall a song’s title by providing lyrics you remember or even mentioning the movie it was featured in.\nAdditionally, Alexa+ can create personalized playlists tailored to specific requests, such as “Make a playlist of 2010s hits that keep me moving fast, starting with a track from Nicki Minaj,” the company suggested. \nSome other examples the company provided include: “Can you recommend new music that would make me seem cool to my 13-year-old daughter without trying too hard?” and “What’s the song that plays during the opening credits of ‘The Sopranos’?”\nImage Credits:Amazon Music\nAlexa+ was initially announced in February at the company’s hardware event and is positioned as one of the first consumer-focused agent tools on the market. This assistant can perform actions on a user’s behalf, such as booking restaurant reservations and ordering groceries.\nWhile Alexa+ is still in its early stages and not yet widely available to the public, it has already rolled out to more than a million users.\nThe company reported that Amazon Music listeners who have tried the feature are exploring songs three times more with Alexa+ than with the original assistant, and those seeking recommendations are listening to nearly 70% more music.\nIn light of Spotify’s recent integration with ChatGPT, this could be a strategic move by Amazon to compete with the music streaming giant and showcase its own AI investments. Amazon Music has already incorporated numerous AI features into its app, with the latest additions being weekly AI-generated playlists, AI-assisted search, and “Explore,” which helps users learn more about their favorite artists.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSora, the AI video generator from OpenAI, is now officially available for Android users in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. \nInitially launched as an iOS app in September, Sora quickly rose to the top of the App Store charts, amassing over 1 million downloads in a week. With its arrival on the Google Play Store, Sora is expected to attract a larger user base, likely resulting in a surge in downloads.  \nThe Android version retains all the features of its iOS counterpart, including the “Cameos” feature, which allows users to generate videos of themselves performing various activities using their own likeness. \nThe videos can be shared in a feed reminiscent of TikTok, allowing users to discover and engage with content from others. This appears to be a strategic move by OpenAI to strengthen its position in the competitive landscape of short-form video sharing. The AI giant aims to rival major players like Meta, which has recently launched its own AI video feed called Vibes, as well as existing platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.\n— Sora (@soraofficialapp) November 4, 2025 \nHowever, the app has faced criticism for its handling of deepfakes. After its initial launch, users began uploading disrespectful videos of historical figures, including Martin Luther King Jr. As a result, Sora paused the generation of content depicting Dr. King last month and strengthened its guardrails.\nThe company also recently addressed the backlash surrounding copyrighted characters, such as SpongeBob and Pikachu, by changing its policy for the Sora app from an “opt-out” approach to an “opt-in” system for rights holders.\nAdditionally, it’s currently involved in a legal dispute with celebrity video maker Cameo regarding the name of Sora’s flagship feature, “Cameo.”\nLooking ahead, OpenAI plans to introduce additional features to Sora. These include character cameos, letting users create AI-generated videos featuring their pets and inanimate objects. Basic video editing tools are also on the way, including the ability to stitch multiple clips together. Sora also plans to help users customize their social feeds, focusing on content from selected individuals rather than a large audience.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nNvidia is playing fast and loose with its war chest as it looks to build on its momentum as the chief benefactor of the AI boom. \nThe company on Tuesday signed a €1 billion ($1.15 billion) partnership with Deutsche Telekom to set up an “AI factory” in Munich that aims to boost Germany’s AI computing power by 50%.\nCalled the “Industrial AI Cloud,” the project will use more than 1,000 Nvidia DGX B200 systems and RTX Pro Servers with up to 10,000 Blackwell GPUs to provide AI inferencing and other services to German companies while complying with German data sovereignty laws.\nDeutsche Telekom said early partners of the project include Agile Robots, whose bots will be used to install server racks at the facility, and Perplexity, which will use the data center to provide “in-country” AI inferencing to German users and companies. The telco also outlined digital twins and physics-based simulation as use cases for industrial companies.\nThe telecom company said it would provide the physical infrastructure for the project, while SAP will provide its business technology platform and applications.\nThe partnership comes at a time when the European tech industry has been calling on EU lawmakers to reduce their reliance on foreign infrastructure and service providers and to foster adoption of homegrown alternatives. At the same time, tech companies have been criticizing the bloc’s approach to regulating AI, arguing that the rules only serve to hold back innovation.\nThe EU earlier this year committed €200 billion to set up “AI gigafactories” on the continent, focusing on “industrial and mission-critical applications.” But funding for AI initiatives in the European Union has been notably lower than in the U.S., where companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle have pumped in hundreds of billions to build massive data centers and assorted infrastructure to support development of AI models and services.\nDeutsche Telekom noted that this project, expected to start operations in early 2026, is separate from the EU’s AI gigafactory initiative.\n“Mechanical engineering and industry have made this country strong,” says Tim Höttges, CEO of Deutsche Telekom. “But here, too, we are challenged. AI is a huge opportunity. It will help to improve our products and strengthen our European strengths.”\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Much of the location data is uploaded by ordinary apps installed on a person’s phones, which is sold to data brokers. Those data brokers then sell that data to governments and militaries. \nThe dataset also included the granular location histories of Europe’s top officials, including those who work directly for the European Commission, which has its headquarters in Brussels. \nThe reporters said they were able to identify hundreds of devices belonging to people who work in sensitive areas around the EU, including 2,000 location markers from 264 officials’ devices, and around 5,800 location markers from more than 750 devices in the European Parliament.\nEurope has some of the strongest data protection rules in the world with its GDPR law. However, watchdogs and officials across Europe have been slow to take stronger enforcement action against data brokers, Netpolitik reported. Data brokering has ballooned to become a billion-dollar industry involving the sale and trade of people’s location data and other private information.\nTo counter some of this location tracking, Apple customers can anonymize their device identifiers, and Android owners can regularly reset their device’s identifier.\nLast year, a data broker called Gravy Analytics had a data breach that exposed the location data belonging to tens of millions of people, including where they have been, live, and work. Researchers examining the data said the location records could be used to extensively track people’s recent whereabouts.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

The company, which partnered with ChatGPT maker OpenAI in September, reported that traffic from AI tools to its online stores is up seven times since January of this year, and purchases attributed to AI-powered search have increased by 11 times.\nAccording to Shopify President Harley Finkelstein, the company’s advantage in the AI era comes from its ability to access the data from millions of merchants and billions of transactions, and its “founder mode” mentality to ship products quickly. \nThis also includes its internal tools, like Scout, which uses AI to help Shopify employees search hundreds of millions of pieces of merchant feedback to make better product decisions.\n“And Scout is just one of many tools we’re developing to turn our own signals, whether it’s support tickets, usage data, reviews, social interactions, or even Sidekick prompts, into fast, informed decisions,” Finkelstein said on the call. “If you take away one thing from this call, let it be this: AI is not just a feature at Shopify. It is central to our engine that powers everything we build.\nIn addition to ChatGPT, Shopify is working with Perplexity and Microsoft Copilot on other in-chat shopping experiences. A recent Shopify survey found that 64% of shoppers said they’re “likely” to use AI to some extent when making purchases.\n“We’ve been building and investing in this infrastructure to make it really easy to bring shopping into every single AI conversation,” Finkelstein said. “The fact that we’re already working with the leaders in the space should, I think, be a testament to the fact that we want to make sure merchants on Shopify are better prepared than those that are not. It’s still obviously very, very early,” he continued. “But what we’re really trying to do is lay the rails for agentic commerce.”\nWhile the company is currently focused on building connections with AI agents, it’s also prepared for the fact that there will be “different permutations” of how agentic commerce will evolve, Finkelstein also noted, which means it needs to be ready for “whichever path wins.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“That was the same thing when social commerce started to get a lot of attention, or when [people realized it wasn’t] e-commerce versus physical commerce but . . . this idea of commerce everywhere,” he added.\nSeparately, Shopify’s Q3 financial results showed revenue up 32% to $2.84 billion, ahead of estimates, and profit of $264 million, or 20 cents per share. However, the stock sagged on news that the company’s operating income of $434 million had missed estimates of $437 million.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSpotify says its video podcasts are seeing increased consumer adoption. In its third-quarter earnings report, the company shared that its video podcast catalog has expanded to nearly half a million shows, and more than 390 million users have now streamed a video podcast on the platform.\nThat figure is up 54% year-over-year, and it also reflects Spotify’s increased investment in the format. In June 2024, the company said it had some 250,000 video podcasts as it rolled out tools that let non-hosted podcasters upload their videos to the platform. The streaming giant also lets users engage with podcasts through comments, Q&As, and polls, making the app feel more like a social network.\nAs a result, Spotify says that users’ time spent with video content on Spotify has also more than doubled year-over-year, largely driven by video podcasts. In addition, video podcast consumption has increased by more than 80% since the launch of the Spotify Partner Program, or SPP, in January, which gives qualifying creators the ability to monetize their shows in new ways, including audience-driven payouts from Spotify Premium user engagement.\nThe company also recently announced a partnership with Netflix to distribute its video podcasts to a broader audience starting in 2026 in the United States, with more markets to follow. Investors didn’t ask about the specifics of the revenue-sharing agreement on the earnings call; however, investors did want to understand how distributing podcasts off the platform would ultimately benefit Spotify.\nAccording to incoming co-CEO Alex Norström, the move is meant to center Spotify as a creators’ distribution hub.\n“We think … that when the creator wins, we win, and as creators optimize to create their best shows and interviews, which is really what they’re focused on,” Norström told investors and analysts. “They wanted to syndicate everywhere. And we believe, of course, in helping them to reach audiences in as many places as possible, which is consistent with our core philosophy on being creator-first.”\nLater, co-CEO Gustav Söderström suggested that allowing creators to be both on Spotify and Netflix gives the company further “revenue opportunities.” \n“This is the way to think about it: It’s part of our ubiquity strategy, and it’s really important that while we build a good user experience, we also need to have a very strong creator offer[ing],” he noted.\nNorström pointed out that having Spotify podcasts on YouTube increased awareness about the shows and their origins, which then resulted in net incremental usage on Spotify. The company expects the same with Netflix.\nIn addition, Spotify said the TV opportunity was a part of this equation — hence the recent upgrade of its Apple TV app. The more people can use Spotify across platforms, the more their usage increases, and that helps Spotify’s ads business.\nThe company also noted that it has given advertisers programmatic access to its audio and video inventory, though it admits that 2025 is a “transition year” for its ads business, and it doesn’t expect to see growth improve until the second half of 2026.\nThe streamer also announced its monthly active users increased 11% year-over-year to 713 million, and revenue was up to €4.27 billion (~$4.9 billion), beating Wall Street’s expectations. The company saw an €899 million net profit (~$1 billion) during the quarter.\nHowever, the stock slipped after the opening bell on Tuesday, due to Wall Street’s concerns over Spotify’s mixed guidance for its fourth quarter.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe Information reports that Anthropic expects to generate as much as $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in cash flow in 2028. The growth projections are fueled by rapid adoption of Anthropic’s business products, a person with knowledge of the company’s financials said.  \nLast month, Reuters reported that Anthropic is projected to more than double, and potentially nearly triple, its annual revenue run rate next year. The company is reportedly on track to meet a goal of $9 billion in ARR by the end of 2025 and has set a target of $20 billion to $26 billion ARR for 2026. \nAnthropic expects its revenue this year from selling access to its AI models through an API to hit $3.8 billion, doubling the $1.8 billion revenue OpenAI expects to generate from API sales, per The Information. Claude Code is reportedly close to generating $1 billion in annualized revenue, up from about $400 million in July. \nIn recent weeks, Anthropic’s aggressive B2B strategy has become clearer. Microsoft and Anthropic recently began partnering to use Anthropic’s models in Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot. Anthropic has also expanded its Salesforce partnership and plans to roll out its AI assistant Claude to hundreds of thousands of employees at Deloitte and Cognizant.  \nWhen it comes to model improvements, Anthropic has, over the last two months, launched smaller, more cost-effective models — Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 — which appeal to businesses deploying AI at scale. The startup has also expanded Claude for Financial Services and introduced Enterprise Search to enable businesses to connect all their internal work apps to Claude. \nAnthropic might lean on its growth to raise more funds. The startup last raised $13 billion from investors in September in an oversubscribed round that valued Anthropic at $170 billion. If it raises again, Anthropic would likely target a valuation of between $300 billion and $400 billion, according to The Information. \nThe outlet’s reporting also includes a projection of $17 billion in cash flow in 2028. Cash flow isn’t the same thing as profit — it just means a company has more money coming in than is going out from its operations, investments, and financing activities. Anthropic’s publicly available liabilities include a $2.5 billion credit facility and a $1.5 billion legal settlement from a copyright lawsuit that a group of authors brought against the company. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, the company expects its gross profit margin — which measures a company’s profitability after accounting for direct costs associated with producing goods and services — to reach 50% this year and 77% in 2028, up from negative 94% last year, per The Information.\nOpenAI, Anthropic’s main rival recently valued at $500 billion, is also pursuing a B2B strategy, coupled with a strong consumer push fueled by its 800 million weekly users. OpenAI expects to generate $13 billion in revenue this year and reach revenue of $100 billion in 2027. But whereas Anthropic is projecting positive cash flow by 2028, OpenAI is expecting sizable losses, with cash burn reaching $14 billion in 2026 and expected to mount to $115 billion through 2029 as the company ramps up infrastructure spending.  \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nApple’s latest iOS update, available for eligible devices starting Monday, doesn’t introduce any major features, but it does bring one highly requested tweak: the ability to change the transparency of the translucent liquid glass design.\nIf you didn’t like the look of iOS 26, all you could do so far was to reduce transparency via the accessibility settings, which pretty much turned off the liquid glass overlay. With iOS 26.1, we now get a new menu to retain the look while increasing opacity.\nYou can head to Settings > Display & Brightness > Liquid Glass to select either the original “Clear” option or a more opaque “Tinted” option. You can also see a preview of each option when you’re selecting them.\nLiquid glass was the company’s biggest design overhaul since its move to a flat design back in 2013, but similar to most changes of this scale and significance, not everybody has been on board.\nSome people said the more translucent design made various parts of the interface harder to read, including notifications or navigation controls in apps, while others professed their love for the attention to detail and the new look, which felt like a much-needed update to an interface that had grown stale over the years.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\nBesides the transparency settings, iOS 26.1 lets you tweak what gestures do on the home screen: You now get an option to open the camera app by swiping to the left on the lock screen. You change this by going to Settings > Camera > Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera.\nIn addition, iOS 26.1 gives users the ability to locally capture audio and video while recording a video call. This can be useful if you’re recording a call or podcast on the move. The company announced this feature for iPadOS in June during the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe update also brings support for eight new languages for Apple Intelligence: Chinese (Traditional), Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Portuguese (Portugal), Vietnamese, and Turkish. The company is also adding live translation support for five new languages: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Italian, Japanese, and Korean.\nWe also get some quality-of-life improvements, including gestures to change songs in Apple Music; a slider to stop alarms instead of a button so you don’t accidentally shut it off; and an option to automatically install security improvements.\nYou can update your device by going to Settings > General > Software update.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMore than two months ago, Tesla published its fourth “Master Plan,” a gauzy post about how the company wants to spread “sustainable abundance” via its future products. Details remain woefully absent, but that hasn’t stopped Tesla from making it the central prop in its bid to convince shareholders to hand CEO Elon Musk a compensation package worth $1 trillion at the company’s annual meeting on Thursday.\nIf that vote passes, the world’s richest man would receive the biggest pay package in corporate history.  \nWhen the “Plan” released, it was so vague that it drew criticism from some of the company’s biggest fans. Even Musk, who said that criticism was “[f]air” and claimed Tesla would “add more specifics,” acknowledged the plan’s lack of details.\nThe post remains unchanged, despite the fact that it’s a centerpiece of Tesla’s relentless campaign.\nMusk has maintained he cares less about the money and more about retaining control over Tesla and the “robot army” he wants to build — and he has threatened to leave if the vote fails.\nMaster Plan 4 lies in stark contrast to prior “Master Plans” released by Tesla. Each of those included concrete goals and tangible ideas, though some were so lofty that Tesla has still not yet accomplished them. The third Master Plan, released in 2023, focused on creating a sustainable energy economy and came in the form of a 41-page white paper.\nTesla and Musk didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMusk teased the fourth Master Plan back in June 2024. “Working on the Tesla Master Plan 4,” Musk wrote on X at the time. “It will be epic.”\nIn August of this year, he wrote in another post that “Master Plan 3 was too complex for almost anyone to understand,” and said “Master Plan 4 will be concise.” Tesla published the plan just a few days later.\nDespite its imprecision, essentially all materials Tesla has sent to shareholders about the vote promote the fourth Master Plan as a reason to approve the compensation package. It is highlighted on the pamphlets that instruct shareholders how to vote. It got a shoutout in Tesla’s third-quarter shareholder letter. It’s been referenced in interviews by board chair Robyn Denholm and design leader Franz von Holzhausen.\n“A few days ago, Elon unveiled an inspiring next chapter for Tesla with Master Plan, Part IV, which is focused on creating a Sustainable Abundance for all,” Denholm and fellow board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson wrote in a September letter to shareholders, again without going into further specifics. “We are, and have always been, a company that thinks bolder, acts faster and strives for a better future. Master Plan, Part IV builds on that, by reimagining labor, mobility and energy and bringing AI into the physical world through products and services like FSD, Optimus and Robotaxi.”\nDenholm has been on a media blitz drumming up support for the $1 trillion pay package vote, but she has not been asked to lay out a clearer vision for Master Plan 4. She’s instead remained focused on the milestones Musk needs to meet to unlock the full $1 trillion of his pay package — almost all of which are watered down versions of the outrageous promises he’s made through the years.\nMusk himself has not directly brought up Master Plan 4 on X since his September 2 post about adding more specifics. He has spent much of the days before the shareholder vote promoting the compensation package, fear-mongering about immigrants, and spreading misinformation about the New York City mayoral election.\nIt was only during an interview that von Holzhausen did with the Ride the Lightning podcast in October that someone brought up the vagueness of the plan.\n“[M]y initial reaction to it as a Tesla shareholder, Tesla owner, Tesla fan, and I saw a lot of this in the Tesla Community, was that it seemed like it was a little lacking in details compared to the previous Master Plans, which were pretty concrete,” host Ryan McCaffrey said, who then quickly pivoted to a more positive set of questions for the chief designer.\n“So, why are you excited about Master Plan Part 4 and sort of how is Tesla going to get this done? And that’s a big question,” McCaffrey asked.\n“We’ll do it in Tesla fashion of course,” von Holzhausen responded.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nGoFundMe has introduced a new offering that allows you to purchase digital gift cards for your loved ones, enabling them to donate to their favorite nonprofit organizations during the holidays. (Note that the product has yet to launch.)\nThe gift cards start at $5 and come in a variety of themes and causes, including Birthday, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Ramadan, as well as cards for animal lovers, cancer fighters, and nature protectors.\nThese cards work differently than traditional gift cards, though. They operate through Giving Funds, GoFundMe’s fee-free donor-advised fund (DAF). Launched in June, this marked the platform’s first entry into DAFs, aiming to make them accessible to everyday donors. Historically, donor-advised funds have been out of reach for most people due to high minimum contributions and fees.\nWhen recipients claim the gift card, the amount is deposited into their personal Giving Fund. They then have the option to donate immediately or allow the funds to grow tax-free in their account, which gives them the opportunity to contribute even more later. The person who purchased the gift card receives a tax deduction.\nRecipients can choose from 1.4 million nonprofits on the platform, ranging from local food banks to global organizations that provide disaster relief, support youth programs, and promote animal welfare.\nImage Credits:GoFundMe\nGoFundMe’s new gifting strategy could appeal to users for several reasons. For example, instead of giving a generic gift, people can help their loved ones support causes that truly matter to them, such as a local soup kitchen that helps feed families during Thanksgiving, a time when many people struggle to put a meal on the table.\nPlus, a nonprofit gift card can also be a great way for older generations to teach younger family members about the importance of giving back. It opens up conversations about different causes and the real impact they have.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn May, GoFundMe celebrated its 15th anniversary and announced that it had surpassed $40 billion raised globally.

    "body": "\nWhen we gather ’round the proverbial fire and exchange our online dating war stories, we’re usually talking about the usual suspects: Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Grindr, and sometimes more niche apps like Lex. But ever since Facebook Dating launched in 2019, I’m not sure I have ever heard a tale that began there — I know more people who met in Facebook meme groups than on the actual Facebook Dating product.\nTurns out my anecdotal data may be wrong — because people actually do use Facebook Dating! Meta shared user metrics for the first time on Monday, revealing that Facebook Dating has 21.5 million daily active users (DAUs) across 52 countries.\nFacebook Dating is a feature within Facebook, rather than a stand-alone app, and Facebook puts its dating product front and center in the main bottom navigation bar on the app. (Even if your relationship status is not set to single, Facebook Dating remains in its prominent spot.)\nWhat’s most surprising, though, is how Facebook Dating seems to be slowly catching on among young people. The platform counts 1.77 million users between the ages of 18 and 29 in the U.S., which is still not quite up to par with the “usual suspects,” but it’s getting closer. App analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated that as of this summer in the U.S., Tinder had 7.3 million active users across all age groups; Hinge had 4.4 million; Bumble had 3.6 million; and Grindr had 2.2 million.\nFacebook has publicly addressed the fact that it struggles to keep Gen Z and young millennials on the platform, yet the company said last year that daily conversations on Facebook Dating in the 18-29 demographic spiked 24%.\nFacebook Dating’s best feature is not something it actively does, but rather, it’s what Facebook Dating doesn’t do. Unlike Hinge, you don’t have to pay to “unlock” your most desirable matches or buy other premium features that supposedly bring you closer to finding “the one.”\nHinge debuted its “Standouts” feature in December 2020, which has become symbolic of everything wrong with dating apps. Hinge’s algorithm finds the people it thinks you will be most interested in, then places them in their own elite tab of the app. The only way to swipe right on these people is to give them a “rose,” which users get for free once a week — unless you buy more roses for $4 a pop. Even if you buy roses, your maybe-possibly future husband will know you used a precious rose on him, which is kind of embarrassing. So, like a true star-crossed-lovers situation, some users have devised increasingly complex schemes to trick the Hinge algorithm into freeing these people from “rose jail.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy comparison, Facebook Dating’s free model looks pretty good. It’s not that Mark Zuckerberg is a benevolent Silicon Valley cupid — Meta is already making bank off of you by relentlessly collecting your data, so it doesn’t need you to buy roses. But as users grow more aggrieved with their usual rotation of apps, Facebook Dating may not seem so cringe anymore.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nLawmakers have called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Flock Safety, a company that operates license plate-scanning cameras, for allegedly failing to implement cybersecurity protections that expose its camera network to hackers and spies.\nIn a letter sent by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL, 8th), the lawmakers urge FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson to probe why Flock does not enforce the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA), a security protection that prevents malicious access by someone with knowledge of the account holder’s password.\nWyden and Krishnamoorthi said that while the company offers its law enforcement customers the ability to enable MFA, “Flock does not require it, which the company confirmed to Congress in October,” according to the letter.\nWyden and Krishnamoorthi said that if hackers or foreign spies learn of a law enforcement user’s password, “they can gain access to law-enforcement-only areas of Flock’s website and search the billions of photos of Americans’ license plates collected by taxpayer-funded cameras across the country.”\nFlock operates one of the largest networks of cameras and license plate readers in the U.S., providing access to more than 5,000 police departments, as well as private businesses, across the country. Flock’s cameras scan the license plates of passing vehicles so that police and federal agencies with logins to Flock’s platform can search the billions of captured photos and track where vehicles have traveled at any given time.\nThe lawmakers said that they had found evidence that some of Flock’s law enforcement customers’ logins had been previously stolen and shared online, citing data from Hudson Rock, a cybersecurity company that identifies usernames and passwords stolen by information-stealing malware. \nIndependent security researcher Benn Jordan also provided the lawmakers with a screenshot showing a Russian cybercrime forum allegedly selling access to Flock logins.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch for comment, Flock shared the company’s response in a letter from its chief legal officer Dan Haley, in which he says the company switched on MFA by default for all new customers starting in November 2024 and that 97% of its law enforcement customers have enabled MFA to date.\nThat leaves around 3% of the company’s customers — potentially dozens of law enforcement agencies — that have declined to switch on MFA, citing “reasons specific to them,” Haley wrote. \nHolly Beilin, a spokesperson for Flock, did not immediately provide a specific number of law enforcement customers that have not yet switched on MFA, nor did she say if any federal agencies are among the remaining customers, or for what reason Flock does not require its customers to switch on the security feature.\nAs previously reported by 404 Media, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration used a local police officer’s password to access Flock’s cameras to search for an individual suspected of an “immigration violation,” but without the officer’s knowledge. The Palos Heights Police Department said it switched on multi-factor authentication following the breach.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

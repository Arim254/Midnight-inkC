Semrush had a market capitalization of about $1 billion as of Tuesday’s close.\nBy acquiring Semrush, Adobe is betting that companies will choose to invest in optimizing their content and web pages to be more visible to AI tools, as people increasingly use AI chatbots, agents, and AI browsers to do everything from getting the news and finding recipes to shopping and booking their travel. This is a fresh, big market for existing search engine optimization players like Semrush, particularly as this change in consumer behavior drives increasing traffic to websites from generative AI tools.\nIndeed, as of October, traffic to retail websites from generative AI chatbots increased 1,200% compared to a year earlier, per Adobe Analytics data.\nSemrush has been investing in what it calls “generative engine optimization,” and recently launched a tool for tracking and improving website performance using both traditional SEO techniques and optimization for AI engines, like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Grok, and Perplexity.\n“Brand visibility is being reshaped by generative AI, and brands that don’t embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe’s Digital Experience Business. “With Semrush, we’re unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n",

Once they turn 16, they will be able to access their old account as they left it.\nIt will be a challenge, however, for Meta to determine which users are under the age of 16, since people aren’t always truthful about their age when signing up for social media services. But digital age checks are notoriously difficult to execute in a manner that’s safe and effective. Identity verification services are high-profile targets for hacks, and the implications of even a minor security vulnerability are severe, since personal information and government documents can be exposed.\nIdentity verification platforms have already proven problematic for users’ security. Last year, 404 Media found that AU10TIX, a company that verifies the identity of users on TikTok, Uber, and X, had left administrative credentials exposed online for over a year, which allowed users’ sensitive information to be exposed.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n",

    "body": "\nIf you want insight into just how worried VCs (and Silicon Valley, generally) are over legal challenges to AI training on copyrighted material, look no further than AI music site Suno. \nSuno, which allows anyone to create AI-generated songs through prompts, announced on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \nThe company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September. It has now hit $200 million in annual revenue, Suno told The Wall Street Journal. \nIt previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. \nBut Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group, which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission.  \nThose types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material. \nBut given Suno’s market success, growth, and the obvious potential market for AI-generated music, its legal complications are a shoulder shrug to investors. \n“Type an idea, click Create, and suddenly, you’re not just imagining music—you’re making it. That shift from listener to creator? That’s what Suno unlocks,” the Menlo VCs who backed the startup describe in their blog post about the investment. \nMenlo didn’t just like the tech, but also that Suno has grown largely through word of mouth – people sharing songs on their group texts, the investors said. \nNo doubt the AI industry is, and will continue, to eventually work out the legal ramifications of acting first, asking for permission later, over training data. But before that’s settled, the era of AI-generated music has clearly arrived.\n",

    "body": "\nAuckland-founded Kiki Club launched its peer-to-peer subletting startup in New York City in 2023 with the mission of helping renters sublet their apartments while traveling for extended periods. \nHowever, Kiki’s model violated local short-term rental laws, leading to its shutdown this past June. The New York Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement (OSE) announced on Wednesday that Kiki has agreed to pay over $152,000 to settle charges. \nBacked by Blackbird, the Airbnb competitor aimed to simplify the subletting process and boldly promised a solution that would let users sublet their spaces for up to six months. The platform used a matching system similar to those of dating apps, connecting listers and renters based on their preferences.\nHowever, the startup found itself on the wrong side of NYC’s short-term rental laws. Specifically, Local Law 18, which was enacted in 2022. This legislation imposes strict guidelines on short-term rentals, allowing them only if the host is registered with the OSE as a short-term rental host and meets additional criteria, such as staying in the same unit as the guests. \nWhen the law was first introduced, many Airbnb hosts found the regulations too difficult to manage, leading to a dramatic 85% drop in short-term rentals, according to Inside Airbnb, an organization that monitors the platform’s data.\nAdditionally, under the law, booking services must use OSE’s verification system to confirm that hosts are either registered or exempt. Unverified transactions face a penalty of $1,500 or three times the revenue earned, whichever is lower.\nAccording to the OSE, Kiki failed to submit quarterly reports of short-term rental transactions for eligible listings and didn’t verify nearly 400 short-term rental transactions. \n“This settlement sends a clear message: If you are a company that facilitates short-term rentals, ignoring city laws will be an expensive proposition,” Christian Klossner, executive director of the OSE, said in a statement. “Kiki Club acted as a clandestine conduit for unregistered and illegal short-term rentals, directly undermining the city’s efforts to protect tenants and preserve permanent housing.”  \nWhile Kiki did not admit or deny the findings, it paid the penalties. A spokesperson for Kiki previously acknowledged in an interview with SmartCompany that the company was aware it was operating in a “gray regulatory area.”\nAnd, despite facing such significant consequences in New York, Kiki isn’t throwing in the towel. In June, the startup announced its launch in London. \nIt’s important to note that the UK also has regulations concerning illegal renting. Renting to someone who doesn’t have the right to rent in the UK can lead to up to five years in prison or a hefty fine.\nHopefully, the startup learned a valuable lesson in New York so its London-based platform doesn’t meet the same fate.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

January Ventures aims to fill that gap, writing pre-seed checks for underrepresented founders transforming healthcare, manufacturing, and supply chain with AI.\nAt TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, Dominic-Madori Davis sat down with Jennifer Neundorfer, Co-Founder and General Partner at January Ventures, for a live episode of Equity.

    "body": "\nSwedish vibe-coding unicorn Lovable has doubled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $200 million in just four months, co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said onstage at the Slush 2025 technology conference in Helsinki, Finland.\nThe milestone comes just four months after the year-old company surpassed $100 million in ARR in July.\nOsika credited the AI-assisted coding software maker’s decision not to move to Silicon Valley as the main reason for its success thus far. Osika said Lovable decided to stay in Europe despite getting a lot of early advice that the company would only be successful if it left the region and relocated to the U.S.\n“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘Look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country.’ There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”\nHe added that the fact that the AI market in Europe is not as fast-paced as the market in Silicon Valley has worked to his company’s benefit.\nThe company “flipped the script” by bringing strong talent from Silicon Valley companies like Notion and Gusto to work in person in Stockholm, investor Zhenya Loginov, a partner at Accel, said.\nOsika also credited the company’s open source community for continuing to improve its technology.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We just see all of these people in the community driving forward,” Osika said. “They’ve been active voices on Discord for, I think, the last 1,000 hours, debating some kind of WordPress operation. That was powering what we’re doing.”\nLovable’s milestone comes as vibe coding continues to gobble up venture capital and see soaring traction among users. Last week, AI-coding assistant Cursor announced it raised $2.3 billion in a new funding round that valued the company at $29.3 billion in a round Accel also helped lead.\nLovable has raised more than $225 million in venture funding since it was founded a year ago. The startup most recently raised a $200 million Series A round in July led by Accel in addition to more than 20 other investors. That round valued the company at $1.8 billion.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

That data is powering Spotify’s latest features, like its upcoming music discovery tool SongDNA, also announced on Wednesday.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nHowever, WhoSampled was known to Spotify for some time, as it had partnered with the streamer back in 2016 to allow its users to access their Spotify playlists and saved tracks in its app. \nIn WhoSampled’s announcement about the acquisition, the company said its standalone platform and brand would remain after the deal’s closure, and it expected to offer some user-facing improvements as it becomes part of Spotify’s larger business. For instance, the company said moderation times for submissions would be sped up, the site will be able to remove display ads in the weeks ahead, and its mobile apps will become free downloads with free subscriptions.\n“Through our recent discussions with Spotify, it became clear that we share a strong belief in the power of musical context – and a vision for helping listeners go deeper into the songs they love,” the post penned by the WhoSampled team reads. “Spotify has shown a genuine commitment to our mission, and we couldn’t have found a better home for WhoSampled,” it stated.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe explosive growth of data centers could threaten the stability of the electrical grid this winter, according to an industry overseer.\nAcross North America, demand for electricity this winter is expected to be 2.5% higher than last year for a total of 20 gigawatts, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said in a report released this week. In recent years, winter demand grew by 1% or less. \nData centers are driving a significant chunk of that growth, especially in the mid-Atlantic, U.S. West, and U.S. Southeast, “areas where a lot of data center development is occurring,” Mark Olson, NERC manager of reliability assessments, told E&E News.\nThe report specifically calls out data center expansion in Texas, saying that it is “contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” That stat might be particularly worrisome to Texans, who nearly five years ago suffered through massive power outages during an intense cold snap. \nAt the time, natural gas power plants tripped offline as wellheads froze, slashing the supply of natural gas. Meanwhile, demand for the fossil fuel soared as residential and commercial customers tried to keep homes and offices warm. (The governor publicly blamed wind turbines, despite knowing that they were only a small part of the problem.)\nThis year, NERC said the situation in Texas isn’t likely to be as dire as it was in February 2021, in part because so many batteries have been added to the state’s grid. Those batteries can step in to provide electricity if gas-fired power plants can’t deliver as intended. Plus, they can react more quickly to smaller perturbations than “peaker” power plants, most of which run on natural gas and require minutes to spin up.\nStill, Texas isn’t entirely in the clear. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMost of the batteries deployed in Texas can deliver electricity for a few hours at a time. That’s suitable in circumstances where demand tends to peak for a short time, like in the evening when people return from work. \nBut as NERC notes, data centers tend to draw electricity consistently throughout the day. If a prolonged cold snap hits the state, keeping those batteries sufficiently charged to deliver power to all customers — data centers included — will become more challenging, NERC said. \nIf this winter passes without a significant storm, then NERC anticipates no problems with any region’s electrical grid. But over the last five years, there have been four severe storms, the organization said, which could force grid operators to import electricity, ask large customers to curtail their use, or as a last resort institute rolling blackouts.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWarner Music Group (WMG) has settled a copyright infringement case with AI music startup Udio, the label announced on Wednesday. The two have also entered into a licensing deal for an AI music creation service that’s set to launch in 2026.\nIn a press release, WMG said that the “next-generation music creation, listening, and discovery platform” will be powered by generative AI models trained on licensed and authorized music.\nThe company says the platform will create “new revenue streams for artists and songwriters, while ensuring their work remains protected.”\nThe subscription service will allow users to make remixes, covers, and new songs using the voices of artists and compositions of songwriters who choose to participate. Warner Music Group says the platform will ensure artists and songwriters are credited and compensated.\n“We’re unwaveringly committed to the protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters, and Udio has taken meaningful steps to ensure that the music on its service will be authorized and licensed,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl in the press release. “This collaboration aligns with our broader efforts to responsibly unlock AI’s potential – fueling new creative and commercial possibilities while continuing to deliver innovative experiences for fans.”\nArtists signed to WMG include Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, and more. \n“This partnership is a crucial step towards realizing a future in which technology amplifies creativity and unlocks new opportunities for artists and songwriters,” said Udio co-founder and CEO Andrew Sanchez, in the press release. “Our new platform will enable experiences where fans can create alongside their favorite artists and make extraordinary music in an environment that offers artists control and connection.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe settlement marks a significant shift in the music industry’s approach to AI. Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment sued Udio and rival AI music platform Suno last year for copyright infringement. Both platforms allow users to generate songs using AI-powered text prompts. Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment are also reportedly in talks to license their work to Udio and Suno.\nIn a sign of investor confidence in AI music technology, Suno announced earlier on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.  \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nI guess we’re past the era of “and that’s what you missed on Glee.” Amazon’s Prime Video streamer is adding AI-generated “Video Recaps” to help viewers catch up between seasons of shows, the company announced on Wednesday.\nAccording to Amazon, the feature “utilizes generative AI to create theatrical-quality season recaps with synchronized narration, dialogue, and music.” It will begin rolling out in beta on Wednesday for select Prime Originals, like “Fallout,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,” and “Upload.”\nPrime Video launched a similar AI-powered feature last year called “X-Ray Recaps,” which summarizes complete seasons, episodes, or parts of episodes — at the time, Amazon said that its AI model had guardrails in place to make sure that these recaps don’t inadvertently share spoilers.\nImage Credits:Prime Video\nConsumers have become accustomed to these kinds of text-based AI summaries, since they likely see them when their phone summarizes texts, or when they see a (perhaps unwanted) AI summary at the top of their Google results. But these video summaries veer into newer territory, which may appear more obtrusive in the viewing experience than text summaries — or, maybe they’ll be embraced by people who don’t remember what happened on “Bosch.”\nPrime Video’s competitors are also exploring how they can integrate generative AI into their products. \nYouTube TV, for example, uses a “Key Plays” feature to help viewers catch up on sports games if they start watching while the game is in progress. While it’s a bit imperfect (its algorithm seems to only be able to identify key offensive plays in baseball), the feature helped YouTube TV win its first Technical Emmy Award.\nNetflix, meanwhile, is using generative AI on the production side of its business.\nEarlier this year, Netflix said it used generative AI in the final footage for the first time in the Argentine show “The Eternaut” to create a scene of a building collapsing. After that, “Happy Gilmore 2” used generative AI to make characters look younger in the film’s opening scene, and the producers of “Billionaires’ Bunker” used it in pre-production to envision wardrobe and set design.\nThe use of AI in the film industry has sparked much debate, as artists worry that these tools — which sometimes are trained without permission on their work — could endanger their livelihoods. But some argue that tools that speed up tedious busywork in animation or special effects, like Wonder Dynamics, could expand the capacity for artists to create.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nGoogle Maps is rolling out new features designed to help users save time and feel more prepared, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tool. The navigation app is also launching an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature.\nNow, when users search for places in Maps like restaurants, hotels, or concert venues, they’ll see a new “know before you go” tips section that will surface important information about the place. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, what secret menu items are, what the best place to park is, and more. Users can click on each tip to get more information.\nThis “know before you go” tips section is rolling out now in the U.S. on Android and iOS.\nImage Credits:Google\nAs for the updated Explore tab, Google has made it easier and faster to find trending spots near you. Users can now swipe up to see trending and popular restaurants, activities, and sights nearby, such as a new cafe that just opened up or a quirky art gallery around the corner.\nThe tech giant says it’s now also easier to find curated lists from sources like Viator, Lonely Planet, and OpenTable, in addition to local influencers.\nThe updated Explore tab starts rolling out this month globally on Android and iOS.\nImage Credits:Google\nAdditionally, the company announced that EV drivers can now see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination by searching for “EV chargers” in Maps. Google is using AI to analyze historical and real-time charger availability to predict how many chargers are likely to be free upon arrival. \nEV charger availability predictions start rolling out next week on Android Auto and cars with Google built-in.\nGoogle is also making it possible for users to leave reviews under a nickname, such as “Eager Elf” or “Julia Loves Sweets.” Reviews are still associated with a Google Account behind the scenes, so users can only leave one review per business. This prevents them from swapping out nicknames to leave the business a series of bad reviews — a practice known as review bombing.  \nWednesday’s announcement follows Google Maps’ recent integration of Gemini, which lets users ask about points of interest along their route, get answers on topics like sports or news, and perform tasks such as adding events to their calendar. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The sanctions also target several of the company’s executives, including its general director — also known as Yalishanda — who allegedly provided servers and troubleshooting to cybercriminals.\nOfficials say criminal hackers relied on Media Land to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks. Prolific ransomware gangs, including LockBit, BlackSuit, and Play allegedly used it for their infrastructure. The Treasury said several of the company’s employees coordinated with cybercriminals.\n“Bulletproof” providers are web hosts and cloud companies that typically tout their services as impervious or resilient to law enforcement actions, such as takedowns or legal demands, and as such are commonly used by cybercriminals to host their malicious infrastructure. \nU.S. officials said hosting companies like Media Land help provide cybercriminals essential services for “attacking businesses in the United States and in allied countries,” though Treasury did not name the victims of the attacks.\nThe U.K.’s Foreign Office said it was also designating a U.K.-based company called Hypercore, which officials said was set up as a front company for Aeza Group, another bulletproof hosting company that was sanctioned by the U.S. in July. The U.K. said in its own statement that Aeza is linked to a Kremlin disinformation organization called the Social Design Agency.\nSanctioning the companies and individuals involved in cybercrime effectively makes it illegal for citizens, residents, or those with business ties to the U.S., U.K., and Australia from transacting or conducting business with those sanctioned.\nU.S. cybersecurity agency CISA and the National Security Agency published guidance Wednesday on how organizations can mitigate the risks from bulletproof hosting providers.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOne of the most common use cases to have come out of new-age AI models is to power natural language search and find files and other information quicker and faster. There are already several companies that allow you to connect different services to search through data. Now a startup called Poly is launching a service that encourages you to dump all your files into one place so you can query them to find the right content.\nAt launch, it’s giving 100GB of storage to users on its free tier.\nThis is Poly’s second inning from a product perspective. \nThe company was started by founders Abhay Agarwal and Sam Young in 2022. Young has since left the company. At that time, the startup, which had participated in the startup accelerator Y Combinator, allowed users to create 3D assets using prompts.\nAgarwal, who is a research fellow at Microsoft and worked on vision AI to help the visually impaired, said the company didn’t predict that the AI image and asset generation industry would blow up and competitors would raise large sums rapidly. That’s when the team decided to pivot.\n“We interviewed our users and asked them what the pain points of their workflows were that could be solved by AI. Turned out that one big unmet need for users was organizing their file system. As a user, you have a lot of files on your computer, and it is hard to find stuff. We wanted to solve for that,” Agarwal said.\nHe said that the startup shut down the previous iteration of Poly in 2023, went into stealth, and started building the new cloud-based file organizer. \nThe company is now launching the product for the public after testing it in closed beta for a few months. Currently, you can use Poly on the web or Mac, with a Windows version coming soon. The company will start onboarding users from its waitlist starting today. \nPoly has raised $8 million in seed funding led by Felicis, with participation from Bloomberg Beta, NextView, Figma Ventures, AI Grant, Wing Ventures, and MVP Ventures. This includes the prior $3.9 million round raised in 2022.\n“File systems are incredibly powerful and elegant, but most people have forgotten about them. Poly is bringing file systems as the center of interaction. The tool is designed in a way that allows you to use AI to think in a clearer way,” James Cham, a partner at the early-stage investment firm Bloomberg Beta told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Poly\nPoly acts like a cloud storage tool with AI-powered search. At the moment, the tool supports text, PDF, office docs, images, audio, video, and web files (URLs). You can upload files to Poly, tag them, ask the AI assistant questions about them, and even ask it to summarize or translate the files. Plus, the tool organizes your files for you and can create new folders or rename files, as needed.\nAgarwal views it as an upgrade to Google’s NotebookLM, which people use to put files into a project, ask questions, and generate insights as audio or video. However, while Poly might be a better file organizer, it doesn’t have access to the latest web knowledge or the ability to create audio or video.\nThe founder added that, in the coming months, the tool will add more features, including web search, support for creating stylized reports within the app, a text and markdown editor, and the ability to add custom metadata. It will also allow users to paste Google Docs links and let people use AI agents to perform calculations and analysis on spreadsheets.\nWith Poly, users can create shared drives, add files, and invite others to ask questions about them, which could be useful when you are on a project with other people. The startup said it also plans to add a feature to let users directly share individual files and folders.\nImage Credits:Poly\nPoly will directly compete with the likes of Dropbox and Google Drive, both of which have their own search tools. In my experience of using Poly’s tool for a few days, the search worked better than Google’s. Plus, there is an added benefit of just pasting the YouTube video’s link and generating a summary about it. \nWhile there are plenty of AI and search offerings on the market, one of Poly’s biggest advantages is its 100GB of storage for free users, which is much more than the free tiers of other storage services. You can also choose to pay $10 a month for 2TB of storage. Right now, there is no direct photo sync, but in the future, if the company builds features around it, Poly can be a good Google Photos alternative.\nEven though the tool offers substantial storage, Agarwal said that early testers have used it as a working storage for projects.\n“Our primary focus is on Gen AI native creators and knowledge workers — people who are researching content or searching through their files. For instance, a service executive who wants to get insights out of many customer calls,” he said.\nThe company currently offers a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for you to use Poly within tools like ChatGPT or Cursor. While Poly doesn’t have direct integration with other tools for syncing, Agarwal believes that, as the app supports virtual file references, it can work on importing files from different services.\n",

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, Spotify announced new features designed to showcase the people behind users’ favorite music, including producers, engineers, songwriters, background vocalists, and more. The company will also release tools that show how songs are connected and what inspired them.\nThe second set of tools is showcased in a new, interactive feature called SongDNA, which shows which songs are being sampled in a given track, who has covered the tune, and what other projects the song’s collaborators may have been involved in.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nTechCrunch reported in October that Spotify was developing the SongDNA feature as a way to help users discover music through a song’s credits, after references to the feature were spotted in the app’s code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong. With SongDNA, Spotify users could explore the other projects that the artists, musicians, and others who worked on a track are involved with.\nPreviously, the Song Credits feature had only featured the topline performance, songwriting, and production credits.\nReferences to the sampled music, meanwhile, come from the online community-built database WhoSampled, which Spotify has acquired. Notably, the streaming service TIDAL also offers interactive credits that let users explore music through the contributors behind the songs.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nSpotify has also planned a feature called “About the song,” which will allow listeners to explore swipeable cards in the “Now Playing” view. Those cards will offer details like what inspired the song, the stories behind the music, the cultural impact, and more. These stories are sourced from third-party resources, which will be linked in the cards.\nThis type of background information about music is something Spotify has offered in previous years, when it partnered with lyrics site Genius on a feature that offered details on certain tracks’ backstories. However, that feature was limited to those stories Genius had in its database. The upcoming feature will link out to various places on the web, screenshots show, including informational sites like Wikipedia, as well as news sites.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Spotify\nSpotify says the expanded Song Credits will roll out starting Wednesday on mobile devices and will come to desktop in the months ahead.\nSongDNA and About the Song will only be available to Premium subscribers. However, these features won’t launch until early next year, initially as Spotify for Artists Preview. This will allow those involved with the music to have a chance to preview the features first and ensure the credits are accurate before they’re made available to the wider public. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

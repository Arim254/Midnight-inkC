    "body": "\nApple has invited the tech press to a “special Apple experience” on March 4, but it might unfold a bit differently than the company’s standard press event.\nBloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that instead of announcing everything at a single keynote, Apple is planning a “three-day flurry of announcements” — presumably announced online, and culminating in the March 4 “experience” that will consist of be three events in New York, London, and Shanghai, where the press will be offered a chance to get hands-on with the upcoming products.\nSimilarly, Daring Fireball’s John Gruber speculated that the experience could be “a hands-on thing with in-person demos.”\nApple will reportedly be announcing at least five new products during that time, including a low-cost MacBook. Other reported possibilities: the iPhone 17e, an iPad Air with an M4 chip, a new entry-level iPad, and an upgraded MacBook Air and new MacBook Pro models. Gurman said all of those products are due this spring, but he sounded less certain about which ones will be announced when.\n",

The others involve building “great games beloved by players” and prioritizing Xbox.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n",

She apparently created a game on Roblox, the world simulation platform frequented by children, which simulated a mass shooting at a mall.

    "body": "\nAI-powered dictation startup Wispr Flow has launched its Android app today. The company released its app for Mac and Windows first, then launched on iOS in June 2025.\nOn iOS, users could use Wispr Flow through a dedicated keyboard. On Android, the interface is a bit different, as you can access the dictionary through a floating bubble. You can hold the bubble and dictate, or press once to start, and then press the close button to stop the process. Just like on other platforms, in addition to dictation, the app cleans up the filter words and also formats the text based on the context of the app and spoken content.\n“Android finally gave us the freedom to build the voice experience we always wanted. Only when the platform gets out of the way can we truly expect voice to replace typing on mobile,” Tanay Kothari, co-founder and CEO of the startup, said. \nThe app can support translation in over 100 languages and can work across other apps. Along with the Android app release, Wispr Flow said that it has done an infrastructure rewrite that makes dictation 30% faster than before. \n\nLoading the player…\n\nWhile there are tons of AI-powered dictation apps available on desktop and iOS, Wispr Flow is one of the few available on Android with this launch, besides Typeless, which launched an app for the platform last month. \nWhat’s more, the company has also released a new model for Hinglish, a mix of Hindi and English, for people in India who speak in mix-coded way. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“If you’re someone like me, English and Hindi weave together when I’m chatting with family and colleagues back home. This is one of those times when I just had to build something for me: the first voice model to actually support transcription in Hinglish instead of traditional Hindi script,” Kothari said.\nImage Credits: Wispr Flow\nThe company noted that even with early rollout to select users, users have spoken over 1.3 million words in English in the last few days.\nWispr Flow has been one of the more popular startups in the category of AI-powered dictation apps that have also attracted significant venture capital attention. In June, the startup raised $30 million in funding led by Menlo Ventures in June. Within a few months, in November, the company secured $25 million in a round led by Notable Capital. Wispr Flow has raised $81 million in total, with its last round valued at $700 million according to sources. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPresident Donald Trump said in a social media post Saturday that Netflix will “pay the consequences” if it doesn’t fire Susan Rice, who has served on the company’s board of directors since 2018.\nTrump’s comments came after Rice — a former ambassador to the United Nations who held diplomatic and advisory roles in the Obama and Biden administrations — appeared on the “Stay Tuned with Preet” podcast hosted by Preet Bharara and predicted that corporations that “take a knee” to Trump will be “held accountable” when Democrats return to power.\n“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and […] say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted,’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.\nIn response, Trump posted on his social network Truth Social, “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what???”\nTrump’s post also includes a screenshot of a post from far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Rice’s comments and claiming, “The Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would result in a streaming monopoly, which the Obamas will have a significant stake in” due to the deal between Netflix and the Obamas’ production company Higher Ground.\nWhile Trump’s post does not mention specific consequences, Netflix’s massive Warner Bros. acquisition will need to be approved by federal regulators. The streaming company’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos reportedly met with Trump before the deal was announced, with Trump subsequently saying that Netflix is a “great company […] but it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.”\nLast fall, Trump published a similar post demanding that Microsoft fire its president of global affairs Lisa Monaco, who was also targeted by Loomer. Monaco is still at Microsoft.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "description": "\nWikipedia editors have decided to remove all links to Archive.today, a web archiving service that they said has been linked to more than 695,000 time",
    "body": "\nWikipedia editors have decided to remove all links to Archive.today, a web archiving service that they said has been linked to more than 695,000 times across the online encyclopedia.\nArchive.today — which also operates under several other domain names, including archive.is and archive.ph — is perhaps most widely used to access content that’s otherwise inaccessible behind paywalls. That also makes it useful as a source for Wikipedia citations.\nHowever, according to the Wikipedia discussion page about this topic, “There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist […] and to forthwith remove all links to it.” (Ars Technica first reported on the decision.)\nThe discussion page says that Archive.today was previously blacklisted in 2013, only to be removed from the blacklist in 2016.\nWhy reverse course again? Because, the discussion page says, “Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack.” Plus, “evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”\nThe distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in question was allegedly directed at blogger Jani Patokallio. Patokallio wrote that beginning on January 11, users who loaded the archive’s CAPTCHA page have been unknowingly loading and executing JavaScript that sends a search request to his Gyrovague blog, in an apparent attempt to get Patokallio’s attention and increase his hosting bill.\nBack in 2023, Patokallio published a blog post examining Archive.today, whose ownership he described as “an opaque mystery.” And while he wasn’t able to track down a specific owner, he concluded the site was likely “a one-person labor of love, operated by a Russian of considerable talent and access to Europe.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMore recently, Patokallio said the webmaster at Archive.today asked him to take the post down for two or three months.\n“I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience,” the webmaster said, according to emails shared by Patokallio.\nPatokallio said that after he declined to take the post down, the webmaster responded with “an increasingly unhinged series of threats.”\nWikipedia editors also pointed to webpage snapshots in Archive.today that appeared to have been altered to insert Patokallio’s name — hence the concern that it’s become “unreliable” as an archive.\nWikipedia’s guidance now calls for editors to remove links to Archive.today and related sites, replacing them with links to the original source or to other archives like the Wayback Machine.\nOn a blog linked from the Archive.today website, the site’s apparent owner wrote that Archive.today’s value to Wikipedia was “not about paywalls” but rather “the ability to offload copyright issues.” They later wrote that things had turned out “pretty well” and said they would “scale down the ‘DDoS’.”\n“Why didn’t you write about such events earlier, folks of the tabloids?” they said. “I don’t expect you to write anything good, because then who would read you, but there was plenty of dramas, wasn’t there? Because there was no Jani to nudge you?”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "description": "\nOnline creators and their business models were on our mind this week after mega-popular YouTuber MrBeast announced that his company is buying fintech",
    "body": "\nOnline creators and their business models were on our mind this week after mega-popular YouTuber MrBeast announced that his company is buying fintech startup Step, followed by Hollywood studios sending a flurry of cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance over the launch of its new video generation model Seedance 2.0.\nThose seemingly unconnected headlines suggest a media landscape in the midst of transformative change, as popular YouTubers look to diversify their business models, with the threat and promise of increasingly powerful generative AI tools on the horizon.\nOn the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, and I debated what’s next for the creator economy, and whether there will be any room for the next generation of creators to stand out.\n“What’s the next saturation point?” Kirsten wondered. “Not all of these folks can go out and spin off products. So then does the pool of successful creators just simply get smaller? Or will something else happen, technologically speaking, or a different medium that will allow them to find an audience to make money off of?”\nYou can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.\nAnthony: [The news] led our colleague Lauren to do this great piece talking about the creator business model in general, and this sense that they aren’t just relying on ad revenue anymore. I think it’s still a pretty big part of their business, but she broke down a number of the most popular YouTubers and noted that each of them is expanding — usually into e-commerce, but also into other revenue streams.\nMr. Beast, for example, actually has this line of food products, including chocolate, that is making hundreds of millions of dollars and it was actually profitable for him in 2024, whereas his media business was losing money. All that was pretty wild to me.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nKirsten: If Mr. Beast can’t be profitable with his media company, who can? To me, that was a stunning stat.\nI am not surprised that the whole ad revenue biz game is not working out necessarily for creators and influencers because it’s just reached a saturation point. I guess my big question is, what’s the next saturation point? Not all of these folks can go out and spin off products. So then does the pool of successful creators just simply get smaller? Or will something else happen, technologically speaking, or a different medium that will allow them to find an audience to make money off of?\nRebecca: It’s interesting, there’s a lot of ways you can think about what else could happen, right? Maybe they’ll create digital twins of themselves and put their digital twins into a bunch of different situations that can make them [other kinds of] money.\nBut again, going back to this not being surprising, these people are now celebrities, right? Someone told me on the phone recently that a lot of [the] younger generation, they don’t know our celebrities, they know TikTok celebrities. And we’ve seen celebrities for years pass off products and make money off of them, right? I used to watch Rachel [Ray], she was a celebrity chef and she sold her EVOO or her olive oil.\nWe Slow Ventures on [Equity] sometime last year. They have a creator fund and basically what they’re doing is they’ve raised a VC fund to essentially back creators with their businesses, if they have maybe a niche following, maybe they’re really into woodworking and here’s their collection of chisels, I don’t know.\nI think it’s an interesting path forward and it’s something that we see as journalists: How do we also try to be creators and make a brand of ourselves that we could diversify our revenue. It sounds horrible to say it out loud like that.\nAnthony: I’m smiling, but it’s the smile of somebody whose soul is slowly turning into ash inside.\nSo we took a break from talking about AI, but I will obligatorily bring AI back into the conversation. Obviously one of the other related developments over the past week or so is that ByteDance, which is the Chinese company that launched TikTok and is still an investor — we won’t get into all of that — they launched a new version of their model, Seedance 2.0, which at least initially was primarily only available to Chinese users.\nBut you started to see people posting videos generated by Seedance, including this viral video of Brad Pitt fighting Tom Cruise. That prompted both this general conversation of: Is Hollywood doomed? And then more concretely, a bunch of Hollywood studios, including Netflix, sending ByteDance letters being like, “You cannot do this, you’re basically allowing all your users to generate videos using all of our IP, all of our movie stars.” And for a couple of days, there was no response at all from ByteDance, but then they did say, “Sorry, sorry, sorry, for some reason we launched this without any real guardrails, but we’re gonna do better in the future.”\nKirsten: So the timing of this is just perfect because I happen to be editing a story right now that Rebecca wrote. It has nothing to do with Seedance, but it does have to do with AI and filmmaking. So I’m going to give a future ]rops to Rebecca for being timely about that. Rebecca, I know you have a lot to say on that, besides that Hollywood is upset. Is it more complicated than that?\nRebecca: Yeah, definitely. I mean, tying this back to the creators thing, I think that a lot of people are going to be using these tools to produce all kinds of content and we’re just going to be absolutely flooded. And that’s going to be intense. \nBut when we talk about, whether it’s creating films or ads or just content in general using AI video tools, I think there’s this tension between one, this is going to produce a whole lot of low effort slop versus two, it could also democratize access for a lot of people who don’t have funds or budgets or teams to share a lot of the stories that they want to tell. \nAnd also, if you’re a small business and you want to create a little shampoo ad — to be on the nose about it, because there’s a shampoo ad that’s going viral — or you sell coffee and you want to make a little ad for it, [this] could give you the tools to do that. Is that a bad thing? Is it not a bad thing? Do we need more content in the world? There’s a few avenues to walk down. \nKirsten: Is it a bad thing, Anthony?\nAnthony: In terms of the creator side of it, my general feeling is [that] the response to a lot of this kind of slop — frankly, a lot of it is slop, and I think that’s going to continue to be the case — is going to be this valuing of authenticity. And so there is the opportunity for these big creators is be less about the idea of like, “I have digital twins of myself,” but [instead,] “No, I’m the real Mr. Beast, not the digital simulacra wandering around.” \nAnd I think it’s also telling that – of course, every social network has ups and downs, but that OpenAI’s Sora, from what I understand, had skyrocketed at the beginning and then has been struggling to hold on to users more recently, because there is a certain emptiness to the experience when you just feel like there’s not an authentic human being on the other side. \nBut I think it’s also going to make the landscape much more challenging, both for the established creators to monetize […] and then I think it’s going to be especially hard for new creators because there’s just going to be so much more stuff. Trying to actually break out is going to become super difficult.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed concerns about AI’s environmental impact this week while speaking at an event hosted by The Indian Express.\nFor one thing, Altman — who was in India for a major AI summit — said concerns about AI’s water usage are “totally fake,” though he acknowledged it was a real issue when “we used to do evaporative cooling in data centers.”\n“Now that we don’t do that, you see these things on the internet where, ‘Don’t use ChatGPT, it’s 17 gallons of water for each query’ or whatever,” Altman said. “This is completely untrue, totally insane, no connection to reality.”\nHe added that it’s “fair” to be concerned about “the energy consumption — not per query, but in total, because the world is now using so much AI.” In his view, this means the world needs to “move towards nuclear or wind and solar very quickly.”\nThere’s no legal requirement for tech companies to disclose how much energy and water they use, so scientists have been trying to study it independently. Data centers have also been connected to rising electricity prices.\nCiting a previous conversation with Bill Gates, the interviewer asked whether it’s accurate to say a single ChatGPT query currently uses the equivalent of 1.5 iPhone battery charges, to which Altman replied, “There’s no way it’s anything close to that much.”\nAltman also complained that many discussions about ChatGPT’s energy usage are “unfair,” especially when they focus on “how much energy it takes to train an AI model, relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human,” Altman said. “It takes like 20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart. And not only that, it took the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to figure out science and whatever, to produce you.”\nSo in his view, the fair comparison is, “If you ask ChatGPT a question, how much energy does it take once its model is trained to answer that question versus a human? And probably, AI has already caught up on an energy efficiency basis, measured that way.”\nYou can watch the full interview below. The conversation about water and energy usage begins at around 26:35.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor. Previously, he worked as a tech reporter at Adweek, a senior editor at VentureBeat, a local government reporter at the Hollister Free Lance, and vice president of content at a VC firm.

    "body": "\nQuantum computing will not be replacing supercomputers in 2026, let alone reaching industrial scale. And yet, investor appetite for companies pursuing the elusive quantum advantage hasn’t dwindled — it has increased.\nQuantonation Ventures, a venture firm investing in quantum and physics-based startups, has closed its oversubscribed second fund at €220 million, or approximately $260 million. That’s more than twice the size of its inaugural fund, and comes in addition to other signals that the quantum winter isn’t coming yet.\nWhile some warned that too much quantum hype and not enough tangible outcomes would eventually cause funding to collapse, the opposite has happened. Take the prediction that quantum will eventually crack modern encryption: that moment has no clear timeline, and yet governments have joined Big Tech in the race.\nIn the years since Quantonation’s launch in 2018, the quantum technology sector has become less incipient, with both technological breakthroughs and early demand from academic and industrial labs. As a result, there has also been “a shift in the types of investment opportunities that are available” to its second fund, Quantonation partner Will Zeng told TechCrunch. \nOne example is what Zeng describes as the “picks and shovels” opportunity, with companies developing technologies that support the quantum industry. He cited the example of Dutch startup Qblox, a long-boostrapped company that was selling quantum control hardware and software to Quantonation portfolio companies before the VC firm co-led its Series A.\nThis growing ecosystem also explains why backers are doubling down on Quantonation, and why other dedicated quantum funds such as QDNL and 55 North have emerged.\n“VCs recognize that this is not an easy area to invest in at the early stage. The technology is very specific and complex, the markets are often new, and the teams as well,” Zeng said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm’s thesis is to invest early to capture more value; but a handful of quantum companies have already gone public, and their shares have surged in recent months. According to Bloomberg, this “quantum frenzy” is partly stocked by Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huang declared in June 2025 that “quantum computing is reaching an inflection point.”\nDespite the fact that quantum chips have yet to outperform classical computers outside of purpose-built benchmarks, consensus is growing that real-life applications are only a few years away, from life sciences to new materials. That’s in part thanks to advancements in error correction — the ability to fix the mistakes that quantum systems are prone to.\nGoogle’s Willow chip was a landmark for error correction in 2024, but no architecture has won yet, and smaller players are still in the race. Zeng noted that a surprising number of companies have entered DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. He also believes that beyond the public market excitement, “there are more exciting technologies that are currently private.”\nFor Quantonation, those private opportunities span a wider canvas than quantum chips alone. Fund two has already invested in 12 startups, with a target portfolio of around 25, covering not just the software and industrial layers needed to make quantum advantage real, but also adjacent physics-based technologies such as photonics and lasers.\nThis expanded thesis is backed by investors old and new. According to the firm, major investors from its first vintage, including Singapore’s Vertex Holdings and Bpifrance’s Fonds National d’Amorçage 2, have returned for the second fund, with new limited partners including the European Investment Fund, Grupo ACS, Novo Holdings, Planet First Partners, and Toshiba.\nQuantonation’s geographic scope is equally international. With dual headquarters in Paris and New York City, the firm has backed French quantum companies including Pasqal and Quandela, but also placed bets in Asia and North America — and will continue doing so.\n“In a lot of the areas we invest in, there’s not yet a clear regional winner, […] and a lot of the research has come from universities in many places,” Zeng said.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSarvam, an Indian AI startup focused on building models for local languages and users, on Friday launched its Indus chat app for web and mobile users, entering a fast-growing market dominated by global players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.\nThe launch comes as India has become a key battleground for generative AI adoption. Recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said ChatGPT has more than 100 million weekly active users in India, while Anthropic said India accounts for 5.8% of total Claude usage, second only to the U.S.\nIndus serves as a chat interface for its newly announced Sarvam 105B model, the company’s 105-billion-parameter large language model. The app’s launch comes two days after Bengaluru-based Sarvam unveiled its 105B and 30B models at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi earlier this week. At the summit, the startup also outlined enterprise initiatives and hardware plans and announced partnerships with companies including HMD to bring AI to Nokia feature phones and Bosch for AI-enabled automotive applications.\nCurrently available in beta on iOS, Android, and the web, the Indus app allows users to type or speak queries and receive responses in text and audio. Users can sign in using their phone number, Google or Microsoft account, or Apple ID, though the service appears to be limited to India for now.\nImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\nThe app currently comes with some limitations. Users cannot delete their chat history without deleting their account, and there is no option to turn off the app’s reasoning feature, which can sometimes slow response times. Sarvam has also warned that access may be restricted as it gradually expands its compute capacity.\n“We’re gradually rolling out Indus on a limited compute capacity, so you may hit a waitlist at first. We will expand access over time,” Sarvam co-founder Pratyush Kumar wrote on X, adding that the company is seeking feedback from users.\nFounded in 2023, Sarvam has raised $41 million to date from investors, including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Peak XV Partners, and Khosla Ventures as it builds large language models tailored for India.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSarvam is one of a small but growing group of Indian startups attempting to build domestic alternatives to global artificial intelligence platforms as India seeks greater control over its AI infrastructure.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFor nearly three decades, Bill Gurley has been among of the most influential voices in Silicon Valley — a general partner at Benchmark whose early bets on companies like Uber, Zillow, and Stitch Fix helped define what modern venture capital looks like. Now, having moved to Austin and stepped back from active investing, the native Texan is channeling that same pattern-recognition instinct into something different: a book, a foundation, and a policy institute aimed at problems he thinks he can actually help solve.\nThe book is Runnin’ Down a Dream — a nod to Tom Petty and also an argument that following your passion isn’t just romanticized career advice but a true competitive strategy, one that becomes only more urgent as AI rapidly reshapes the workforce. The foundation, which he’s calling the Running Down a Dream Foundation, will award 100 grants of $5,000 a year to people who need a financial cushion to make a leap they’ve been afraid to take.\nWe caught up with Gurley to talk about all of it — including what he makes of the somewhat surreal reality that several of his former peers in tech now hold enormous sway in Washington, why he thinks the 996 grind culture many young founders have adopted is less alarming than it sounds, and what AI really means for your career. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Our full conversation with Gurley drops Tuesday on TC’s StrictlyVC Download podcast.\nWhy write this book?\nI went through a phase where I was reading a lot of biographies — people from very different fields, different time windows — and I started noticing patterns the way I would notice patterns in a market evolving. I wrote them down. A couple years later I got invited to speak at the University of Texas, dusted off the notes, built a presentation. They posted it on YouTube, and James Clear — who wrote Atomic Habits — noticed and posted about it. That’s what got me thinking about a book. And when I went through my own process of moving away from venture and thinking about what I wanted to do next, it became obvious I didn’t want to write about VC or Uber or any of that. I wanted to do something that could have a bigger mission.\nYour research with Wharton found that roughly 60% of people would do things differently if they could start their careers over. That shocked you. Why? \nWhen we first ran it as a SurveyMonkey poll we got seven out of ten. When we did it more rigorously with Wharton, we got six out of ten. One of the things that strikes me is that we have a phrase in the book — life is a use it or lose it proposition — and when you’re young, it’s just hard to have that framing. It’s hard to fast-forward through all of your time and recognize how precious it is. Daniel Pink has done a lot of work on what he calls regrets of inaction — the thing that weighs on people most as they get older is the thing they didn’t try, the stone left unturned. That holds across multiple geographies and cultures. And I think a lot of well-intentioned parents feel more responsibility to create economic stability for their kids than to encourage them to truly explore their passion. Especially with AI out there, that may not have been the right call.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nExploring your passion sounds like easier advice for people who have financial runway. What do you say to someone working paycheck to paycheck?\nA few things. First, the book profiles people who started on the very bottom rung and climbed to the top — [celebrity hairstylist and entrepreneur] Jen Atkins moved to LA with $200 in her pocket. There’s nothing in the book that says you need to start anywhere other than right at the beginning. Second, if you’re living paycheck to paycheck, I wouldn’t encourage you to quit. I’d encourage you to use your free time to build a little document on your phone about what your thing might be. Learn. Prepare to jump before you jump. And third — this is why I’m launching the foundation. The last page of the book talks about it: we’re going to give 100 grants a year of $5,000 to people who are in exactly that position, who can convince us in an application that they’ve thought long and hard about where they want to go but need a little help getting there.\nYou’ve been outspoken for years about regulatory capture — the idea that big companies use regulation to entrench themselves.\nI gave a speech on regulatory capture a few years back — it was at the All-In Summit — and at the time I said I had a fear that the AI companies would try to use regulation to protect themselves. I think that’s happening now. The flip side is that there are legitimate questions: Jonathan Haidt’s book Anxious Generation has been on the bestseller list for almost two years, arguing social media has been really bad for children, with academic research to back it up. People would say we should have gotten in front of social media and need to do it with AI. The problem is that the people begging for regulation the most in AI are the actual companies themselves, and that makes me skeptical. There’s also the global dimension — if US AI gets entangled in state-by-state regulation and Chinese models are running free, we’re going to paint ourselves in red tape. I always ask people: what are your favorite five regulations of all time, and how were they successful? Do you have any confidence that people at the state level in a random state know how to write good AI regulation that will actually work?\nIt’s a little surreal that several prominent figures from your world now hold enormous influence in Washington. What do you make of that?\nIt’s very ironic. If you go back and watch that regulatory capture talk, who would have thought a few years later David Sacks would actually be [special advisor for AI and crypto in the White House]?\nBack in 2018, Mike Moritz of Sequoia wrote in the FT that Americans would lose to China if they didn’t start working harder. It was controversial at the time, but a lot of young founders here seem to have since embraced a punishing work culture — the 996 ethos. What are your thoughts about what’s happening?\nI kind of love it, honestly. I think Silicon Valley got really lazy during COVID — people weren’t coming into the office, the culture got soft in a way I hadn’t seen in all my years there. And I’ve been to China six times. I know what Michael Moritz was describing when he said we’re going to lose not because they’re smarter but because they have a better work ethic. But here’s the thing: if you study successful people across a lot of fields, we think it’s wonderful when an athlete practices 12 hours a day or when an artist works obsessively on their craft. Nobody says Jordan didn’t have work-life balance. We just don’t extend the same logic to building a company. If those founders love what they’re doing that much, and they feel like this is the moment to go hard, that’s actually precisely the point of the book: find the thing that makes you feel that way.\nYou talk about mentorship in the book. What makes a great mentor relationship and how do people find one?\nThe number one thing is to get out of your head this ideal that gets passed around in the self-help world: ‘go get a mentor,’ and everyone runs out and cold calls someone that’s ridiculously too high and unachievable, and it doesn’t work. For all those people that are really out of reach right now, I call them aspirational mentors — create a persona of them, just like I was talking about with the dream job folder. Get clips of all the books they’ve written, podcasts they’ve done, interviews they’ve done, and study them. You can learn a lot from people without talking to them directly, especially in the modern age. And then for your real mentors, go two levels down from where you thought you were going to aim. Discover somebody — tools like LinkedIn make this so easy — and be the first person to ever call them and ask them to be a mentor, because they’ll be flattered. They’ll be flattered that you knew who they were. Imagine anyone getting their first call to be a mentor. It’s a great feeling. You’re going to have way more success with that interaction than shooting too high.\nI’ll tell you a funny story: I started getting so many calls from people who wanted to break into venture that I wrote a three-page PDF called “So You Want to Be a VC,” and hidden in the third page was basically — go do X, go do Y, go do Z, come back and tell me how that went. The number of people that actually ended up talking to me after getting that document was a fraction of the number I sent it to. It’s funny how much it thinned when you gave them a little homework to do.\nYou started working on this book before the impacts of AI became clearer. Does that at all change how people should think about their careers?\nIf you’re following the traditional path — going through the career center at your university, signing up on a list, waiting for a recruiter to sit through 30 people in 20-minute slots — you look like a cog. You look mass-produced. For that group, AI looks frightening, and maybe it should. But if you are blazing your own trail, using the techniques in the book, becoming what I call a candidate of one — someone whose path looks completely unique because you’ve built it intentionally — then every tool in this book is amplified by AI. Learning has never been easier than right now, in the entire history of the world. If you’re running toward it, if you’re becoming the most AI-aware person in your field, this thing is nothing but a superpower.\n",

    "body": "\n\nLoading the player…\n\nThe generative AI boom minted a startup a minute. But as the dust starts to settle, two once-hot business models are looking more like cautionary tales: LLM wrappers and AI aggregators. \nDarren Mowry, who leads Google’s global startup organization across Cloud, DeepMind, and Alphabet, says startups with these hooks have their “check engine light” on.\nLLM wrappers are essentially startups that wrap existing large language models, like Claude, GPT, or Gemini, with a product or UX layer to solve a specific problem. An example would be a startup that uses AI to help students study.\n“If you’re really just counting on the back-end model to do all the work and you’re almost white-labeling that model, the industry doesn’t have a lot of patience for that anymore,” Mowry said on this week’s episode of Equity. \nWrapping “very thin intellectual property around Gemini or GPT-5” signals you’re not differentiating yourself, Mowry says. \n“You’ve got to have deep, wide moats that are either horizontally differentiated or something really specific to a vertical market” for a startup to “progress and grow,” he said. Examples of the deep-moat LLM wrapper type include Cursor, a GPT-powered coding assistant, or Harvey AI, a legal AI assistant.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn other words, startups can no longer expect to slap a UI on top of a GPT and get traction on their product like they could, perhaps, in mid-2024 when OpenAI launched its ChatGPT store. The challenge now is to build sustainable product value. \nAI aggregators are a subset of wrappers — they’re startups that aggregate multiple LLMs into one interface or API layer to route queries across models and give users access to multiple models. These companies typically provide an orchestration layer that includes monitoring, governance, or eval tooling. Think: AI search startup Perplexity or developer platform OpenRouter, which provides access to multiple AI models via a single API. \nWhile many of these platforms have gained ground, Mowry’s message is clear to incoming startups: “Stay out of the aggregator business.”\nGenerally speaking, aggregators aren’t seeing much growth or progression these days because, he says, users want “some intellectual property built in” to ensure they’re routed to the right model at the right time based on their needs — not because of behind-the-scenes compute or access constraints.\nMowry has been in the cloud game for decades, cutting his teeth at AWS and Microsoft before setting up shop at Google Cloud, and he’s seen how this plays out. He said the situation today mirrors the early days of cloud computing in the late 2000s/early 2010s as Amazon’s cloud business started taking off. \nAt that time, a crop of startups sprang up to resell AWS infrastructure, marketing themselves as easier entry points that provided tooling, billing consolidation, and support. But when Amazon built its own enterprise tools and customers learned to manage cloud services directly, most of those startups were squeezed out. The only survivors were the ones that added real services, like security, migration, or DevOps consulting. \nAI aggregators today face similar margin pressure as model providers expand into enterprise features themselves, potentially sidelining middlemen. \nFor his part, Mowry is bullish on vibe coding and developer platforms, which had a record-breaking year in 2025 with startups like Replit, Lovable, and Cursor (all Google Cloud customers, per Mowry) attracting major investment and customer traction.\nMowry also expects strong growth in direct-to-consumer tech, in companies that put some of these powerful AI tools into the hands of customers. He pointed to the opportunity for film and TV students to use Google’s AI video generator Veo to bring stories to life.\nBeyond AI, Mowry also thinks biotech and climate tech are having a moment — both in terms of venture investment going into the two industries and the “incredible amounts of data” startups can access to create real value “in ways we would never have been able to before.”\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

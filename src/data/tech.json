These AI accelerator racks will be deployed to OpenAI data centers and partner data centers starting in 2026 and running through 2029.\n“By designing its own chips and systems, OpenAI can embed what it’s learned from developing frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence,” the company said in a press release.\nWhile terms of the deal were not disclosed, the Financial Times estimated it could cost OpenAI an estimated $350 billion to $500 billion.\nThis is just the latest infrastructure deal for OpenAI in recent weeks.\nLast week, OpenAI announced it was purchasing an additional six gigawatts of chips from AMD in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars. In September, Nvidia announced it was investing $100 billion into OpenAI alongside a letter of intent for OpenAI to tap 10 gigawatts worth of Nvidia hardware.\nOpenAI also allegedly signed a historic $300 billion cloud infrastructure deal with Oracle in September.

The new capability will help Google Meet compete with other video-conferencing apps that already have virtual makeup features, including Microsoft Teams and Zoom.\nGoogle Meet offers 12 different makeup options to choose from, which can be found in the “Appearance” section under “Portrait touch-up,” which is a feature that has been available since 2023 to provide users with options like complexion smoothing, under-eye lightening, and eye whitening.\nImage Credits:Google Meet\nNotably, Google says that the virtual makeup will stay in place no matter how the user moves on-screen, making it seem more authentic. So, if a user takes a sip of coffee, the filter will stay on their face instead of shifting to the mug.\nAdditionally, the feature will be disabled by default and can be activated by the user either before or during a video call. Once a makeup style is applied, Google Meet will remember your choices for future meetings.\nThe new AI-powered feature began rolling out on October 8 on mobile and web. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

According to YouTube, these videos come from reputable sources and are tailored to the developmental stage of teenagers. The company collaborated with organizations that specialize in mental health and well-being information for young people, such as the Child Mind Institute.\nImage Credits:YouTube\nThis launch signifies a move toward making YouTube a trustworthy resource for younger users facing mental health challenges. A 2023 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that 39.7% of students felt ongoing sadness and hopelessness, while 28.5% reported poor mental health.\nAdditionally, this is a notable addition for the platform as it’s important to reach teens where they already seek information, such as YouTube, with nine out of ten teens reporting they use the platform, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOver the years, YouTube has invested in various initiatives to assist teenagers. These include implementing specific safeguards when recommending certain topics to teens, using age-estimation technology to recognize teenage users for a more suitable experience, and providing parental controls that allow parents to link their accounts to their teens’ accounts.\nThe new mental health and wellbeing offering is rolling out to users in the U.S., the UK, Canada, Mexico, France, and Australia in the coming weeks. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\nCoco Robotics, a startup known for its fleet of last-mile delivery bots, is looking to get more information out of the five years’ worth of data its robots have collected. Its answer: a physical AI lab with University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) professor Bolei Zhou at the helm.\nCoco Robotics, which made the announcement Tuesday, said Zhou has also joined the Los Angeles-based startup as chief AI scientist.\nWhen the company launched in 2020, it used teleoperators to help the bots navigate obstacles on their delivery routes. Coco Robotics co-founder and CEO Zach Rash told TechCrunch the company’s goal has always been to operate its last-mile delivery robots autonomously to cut the overall costs of delivery. Now, Rash said the company has collected enough data to dive deeper into automation.\n“We have millions of miles of data collected in the most complicated urban settings possible, and that data is incredibly important for training any sort of useful and reliable real world AI systems,” Rash said. “We’re now at the point where we have sufficient data scale where I think we can start really accelerating a lot of the research happening around physical AI.”\nThe decision to tap Zhou to lead the effort was a “no brainer,” Rash said. Zhou’s research around computer vision and robotics has largely focused on micromobility, as opposed to full-scale vehicles, Rash said.\nCoco Robotics was already collaborating with Zhou, too. Both Rash and his co-founder Brad Squicciarini are UCLA alums and have even donated one of their bots to the school’s research lab.\n“[Zhou] is one of the leading researchers in the whole world on robot navigation, reinforcement learning, and a lot of the technologies and areas of research that are highly relevant for us,” Rash said. “He’s been already very capable of recruiting some of the top researchers in the world who he’s worked with in the past to come join Coco and help accelerate things on our end.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis new research lab is separate from the collaboration the robotics startup has with OpenAI, which allows Coco Robotics to use OpenAI’s models while the AI research lab gets access to the company’s robot-collected data.\nCoco Robotics plans to use the information and research it gathers from the lab for its own purposes for now. Rash said the company doesn’t have plans to sell the data to its peers.\nRather, it will be used for the company to improve its automation and efficiency, which will mainly pertain to the local models its robots run on. Rash said they also plan to share their research findings with the cities they operate in when applicable, to help fix obstacles and infrastructure that slows their bots down.\n“Success for this lab really looks at us offering a higher-quality service at an extremely low price,” Rash said. “How do we get our costs lower? How do we make this much more affordable for businesses and customers? I think that’s going to create a tremendous amount of growth in this ecosystem.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

On Tuesday, the company launched a Gemini-powered “Help me schedule” feature that will surface ideal meeting times based on calendar availability and then display them to the person you’re emailing to set up a meeting.\nThe company notes that the feature is designed to work for one-on-one meetings, not those with multiple contacts or group meetings.\nThe launch of the new feature comes amid a flurry of Google Workspace announcements that focus on infusing AI more deeply into users’ everyday tools. This includes the introduction of Google’s latest image editing model, Nano Banana, and Gemini features in Google Slides; tools to share custom AI assistants called Gems with other team members; new formats in NotebookLM; improved AI video tools in Google Vids; and more.\nTo use the meeting scheduling option, you’ll click the new “Help me schedule” button that appears below your email compose screen in Gmail. This will display a series of timeslots where you have open availability. You can click an edit button to change or remove some of the options, then insert them into your email and send it to the recipient as usual. When the recipient picks a time that works for them, the calendar invite automatically appears on both people’s calendars. \nWhile there are several meeting assistants and automated scheduling tools already on the market, like those from Calendly, Doodle, Zoom, HubSpot, and others, Google notes that its tool uses Gemini’s AI to use the email’s context when it makes its meeting suggestions. For instance, if someone writes in the email that they’d like to book a 30-minute time slot next, then the meeting assistant will only suggest half-hour slots before the end of next week that fit your schedule.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWalmart announced on Tuesday a new partnership with OpenAI that will allow consumers to shop Walmart’s products via the AI chatbot, including things like groceries (not fresh food), household essentials, and more, and then instantly check out.\nThe agentic shopping feature will also allow Sam’s Club members to plan meals and restock essentials while also discovering new items when chatting with the AI, the company says.\nTo use the feature, customers will press a “buy” button in ChatGPT’s app when they shop, after linking their Walmart accounts to ChatGPT. Products from third-party sellers will also be supported when the feature rolls out later this fall. \nWalmart explains that the new agreement with OpenAI will allow the retailer to better learn and predict customers’ needs, making online shopping more personalized and proactive, instead of only reactive. \nThe partnership follows OpenAI’s recent announcement of its plan to enter the world of e-commerce with an agentic shopping system, which includes product discovery, recommendation, and payments. Initially, OpenAI is teaming up with Etsy and Shopify sellers, the company said. \nThe ChatGPT-focused shopping feature won’t be the only way consumers can shop with AI. Alongside other AI investments, Walmart recently introduced its own generative AI shopping assistant, Sparky, designed to help customers discover and compare products and make purchases. The feature will expand to include reordering, service booking, and understanding multimodal inputs from text, images, audio, and video.\nThe retailer has an existing relationship with OpenAI in other areas of its business, as well, having adopted OpenAI Certifications and ChatGPT Enterprise for its internal teams. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club broadly use AI to do other things, like speeding up fashion production by up to 18 weeks and improving customer care timeframes by up to 40%.\n“For many years now, e-commerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses. That is about to change,” noted Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon in a prepared statement. “There is a native AI experience coming that is multimedia, personalized, and contextual. We are running towards that more enjoyable and convenient future with Sparky and through partnerships, including this important step with OpenAI,” he added.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nU.K. fintech Revolut has hit yet another roadblock to its longstanding mission of becoming a real bank in its home country: Its full banking license is on hold because the country’s central bank is concerned over whether the startup can maintain its risk management controls in the face of its blazing fast international expansion.\nThe Bank of England wants Revolut to commit to building its risk management stack to match its international growth before the regulator can approve a full banking license, while the Prudential Regulation Authority is investigating the fintech’s controls in the U.K. and internationally, according to the Financial Times.\nRevolut got approval to receive a banking license in the U.K. more than a year ago, but is still in the so-called “mobilization” stage. This phase typically lasts 12 months and imposes deposit restrictions while a bank completes the final steps of setup and the Prudential Regulation Authority or Financial Conduct Authority assess whether it is ready to fully operate as a full-fledged bank.\nImportantly, having a full banking license would allow Revolut to start lending in the U.K., and hold more than £50,000 in customer deposits. The company has 12 million customers in the U.K.\nNews of the delay comes as Revolut, with more than 65 million customers worldwide, has moved aggressively to expand beyond Britain. The company already has a banking license in the European Union, and it operates in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, and the U.S. Just last week, it launched operations in India; it is also about to start operating in Colombia in 2026, has plans to launch in Argentina and Mexico, wants to enter Africa (first with South Africa), and has an in-principal payments license in the UAE.\nThe company has grand ambitions, aiming to reach 100 million customers by mid-2027, and enter over 30 new markets by 2030.\n“We are progressing through the final stages of mobilization and continue to work constructively with the PRA,” a Revolut spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Given Revolut’s global scale, this is the largest and most complex mobilization ever undertaken in the U.K. A thorough review is an expected part of the process, and getting this right is more important than rushing to meet a specific date.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPer its last annual report, Revolut reported net profit of $1 billion (£790 million) in 2024, while revenues increased 72% to $4 billion (£3.1 billion) in the year. The company also launched a crypto exchange, Revolut X, part of its Wealth division, which saw revenue rise 298% to $647 million in 2024 from just $158 million in 2023.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nGoogle is rolling out a series of changes to its Search and Discover pages, the company shared across multiple announcements. The updates will bring new AI-powered features to these key destinations, while also improving navigation and allowing users to collapse ads on Google Search.\nGiven that ads are Google’s primary cash cow, the latter initially seems like a more surprising change. The feature will now allow users browsing Google’s Search results to tap a new button, “Hide sponsored results,” to collapse the ads at the top of the search results page.\nImage Credits:Google\nHowever, while this action will remove the ads from displaying on the screen, sponsored results are not going away entirely. Instead, Google notes that the “Sponsored Results” label will remain at the top of the screen as you scroll down. In a way, this makes the ads more prominent as they can follow you down the page, even though they’re collapsed.\nPlus, Google says that the “Sponsored results” header can appear both above and below AI Overviews — the short AI-written summaries that appear at the top of search results to provide quick answers. The “Sponsored results” header for text ads will also appear at the bottom of the page, with all text ads grouped under the label. These can be collapsed with the same “Hide sponsored results” button if you want to focus on organic content.\nGoogle says the new design makes it easier for people to navigate to the top of the page, and it keeps the size of ads the same, with users never seeing more than four text ads in a group. \nThe new “Sponsored” label will show up in other places across Google, too, including Shopping ads, where it will be branded as “Sponsored Products.”\nThe updates will roll out across desktop and mobile.\nThe company is also making other changes across Search and Discover. When searching for sports information, like looking up players or teams, you’ll now see a new “What’s New” button that displays a feed of trending updates and news articles that could help you catch up with the latest. This will roll out to Google Search in the U.S. in the weeks ahead.\nMeanwhile, the Google app’s Discover feed on mobile will introduce an AI-powered feature that also helps you keep up with trending topics you’re interested in. Here, the app will display short previews that you can expand to see more information, plus other links to explore. The company says this feature is designed to help users stay up to date on stories from a variety of publishers, but it also comes at a time when publishers are seeing their search traffic decline due to the shift to AI-provided answers and consumers’ changing media habits.\nThis latter feature is rolling out now to the U.S., South Korea, and India. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSometimes, you can only spot what’s wrong when you’ve been part of the process for a while. That was the case for Michelle Lim, who, while running Warp’s growth marketing effort earlier this year, realized that the company wasn’t updating its website quickly enough.\nShe noticed that potential customers were asking ChatGPT and other AI bots all kinds of questions about Warp’s offering, but the information they sought, such as how the product compared with a newer competitor, wasn’t available on the startup’s website. Lim felt that this content gap would become even more critical as next-generation AI agents begin actively crawling the internet to gather intelligence for users.\nIt was clear that Warp needed to add more content, but making and uploading each additional web page was a time-consuming task involving a design agency and multiple people across different departments.\n“Marketers just can’t wait one month for design and development teams to build the page,” she told TechCrunch. “With AI engines, you need to be producing content a lot faster than before to capture your consumer demand.”\nLim, who had long planned to launch a startup, recognized that this was fast becoming a problem that needed solving. So, in March, she co-founded Flint, an AI platform that lets you set up websites that update themselves. Joining her in the effort was Max Levenson, an engineer who previously led the simulation and infrastructure teams for autonomous vehicle startup, Nuro.\nOn Tuesday, Flint emerged from stealth mode with $5 million in seed funding. The investment was led by Accel, and saw participation from Sheryl Sandberg’s fund, Sandberg Bernthal Venture Partners, and existing backer Neo.\nFlint’s goal is to create websites that continuously optimize themselves, perform their own A/B tests, and dynamically learn from both visitors and market trends, such as a sudden interest in a specific keyword. Flint also aims to generate pages customized to each visitor, much like how Amazon shows you customized product recommendations. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, Flint’s technology isn’t ready to do all of that just yet. “For now, users still have to tell us what they want to build,” Lim said.\nIn its current form, once the parameters are set, Flint can automatically generate a webpage’s design and layout, interactive elements (like tables and buttons), and also offer form tracking and ad optimization. Lim claims the platform can do all of this in “about a day,” though she didn’t give any more details.\n“At this point, customers provide their own copy,” Lim said. She added that while Flint’s content writing functionality is roughly a year away, future versions will give customers the option to have AI write the text.\nEven without that, Lim claims that whipping up a page with all of the necessary components in a day is already a big time-saver for its customers.\nFlint says it doesn’t design sites or “vibe code” anything. For existing websites, its technology analyzes the look and feel to build and deploy fully coded webpages that are consistent with the design.\nThe startup is already working with customers like Cognition, Modal, and Graphite, for whom it has created live pages. You can see Windsurf’s here, Modal’s site, and this is what Graphite’s looks like.\nFlint’s ambition is to help marketers at rapidly growing startups and Fortune 500 companies increase their websites’ visibility and create content.\nThe focus on selling to CMOs is what made Lim so excited to have Sheryl Sandberg join as an investor. “I like to think of her as someone who has influenced the way the internet has monetized over the past decade,” Lim said.\nAccording to Lim, Sandberg instantly understood Flint’s vision. “I was showing her this deck, and I was sharing how, in my personal experience, it took five teams three months to build one A/B test just to increase conversion by 10% on our Google ad,” Lim said. “And then she stopped me, [and] said, ‘Michele, it was 140 people at Meta who had to do this’.”\n",

    "body": "\nSpotify announced on Tuesday that it’s making Managed Accounts, a shared account feature that allows parents to control what their children listen to, available to users in more countries. Managed Accounts are now rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Netherlands following a pilot launch last year.\nManaged Accounts are available to Spotify Premium Family plan members and allow account holders to manage a separate music-only listening experience for their kids under the age of 13.\nSince these accounts are separate, your kids’ music choices won’t impact your algorithm or show up in your annual Spotify Wrapped experience. Kids can add songs to their favorites, create their own playlists, and have their own personalized recommendations.\nWith Managed Accounts, parents can restrict access to certain features, such as watching videos, playing content, or viewing Canvas videos, which are the looping visuals that appear during music playback, for any content labeled as explicit. Parents can also control and restrict the playback of specific artists and songs.\nInteractivity features are also limited on managed accounts, which means that kids won’t get access to age-gated features like Messages.\nManaged Accounts allow parents to make more granular decisions about the kind of music their child can listen to, without forcing them to use the more restrictive Spotify Kids app.\nTo set up the managed account, Family Plan account holders need to navigate to their account pages in the app, select the “Add a Member” option, and then select the option to “Add a listener aged under 13 (or the market equivalent),” then follow the instructions to navigate the various options.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSpotify’s Managed Accounts are already available in New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia.\nThe wider launch comes amid broader efforts by major tech companies to provide parents with greater control over how their children use online platforms and what features are accessible to them in response to regulatory pressure.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFinnish health tech company Oura has raised $900 million in fresh funding led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, with participation from new investor ICONIQ and contributions from Whale Rock and Atreides.\nThe company said today that this funding will value it at “approximately $11 billion,” more than double the valuation it received for its last round in December. Bloomberg previously reported that Oura was closing new funding at $11 billion valuation.\n“This new funding is a testament to the strength of Oura business and the trust millions of members place in us every day. We’re proud to be building not just a product, but a global movement toward proactive health—helping people understand their bodies, make better lifestyle decisions, and connect more effectively with their healthcare providers,” CEO Tom Hale said in a statement. \nThe company told TechCrunch that it plans to use the new funding for AI and production innovation, introducing new health features, and improving its global distribution.\nOura has sold over 5.5 million smart rings since launch. The past year has been particularly fruitful for the company, providing more than half of those sales. The smart ring maker more than doubled its revenue in 2024, raking in $500 million. The company expects the trend to continue this year, with sales likely to cross $1 billion. According to a report from IDC published last year, Oura holds more than 80% of the smart ring market.\nThe company is also luring in customers of different demographics. Earlier this week, at the Elevate conference in Toronto, Oura’s chief commercial officer, Dorothy Kilroy, said that women in their early twenties are becoming a core market for the company. \nOura launched its latest device, Oura ring 4, last October. Earlier this month, the company launched ceramic versions of the ring along with a new optional charging dock. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBeyond health tracking hardware, the company is venturing into health tests. This month, Oura launched a new feature called Health Panels in the app that lets users book a blood test for $99 at one of 2,000 Quest Diagnostics labs across the U.S. While Oura doesn’t provide medical advice, users will be able to see the report in the app and chat with its AI bot about general suggestions.\nThe new blood testing feature also pits Oura against startups like Whoop, which launched a similar feature this month, as well as ring makers like Ultrahuman and Samsung, \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

While there are existing ways to monitor water quality —  sensors and water testing kits — they are too expensive for many farmers in regions like Southeast Asia.\nAquawise wants to offer aquaculture farmers in Southeast Asia a better way to monitor their water quality by using AI and existing satellites — no hardware purchases required.\nBangkok-based Aquawise takes satellite images of fish and shrimp farms and feeds them into its physics-based AI model that monitors the water for things like temperature, level of chlorophyl, and oxygen levels.\nAquawise’s platform can monitor water quality continuously; traditional methods monitor daily or weekly. Aquawise also offers tracking and predictions.\n“Water quality is one of the most important things in aquaculture,” Patipond Tiyapunjanit, co-founder and CEO of Aquawise, told TechCrunch. “It’s like being a human: You have to breathe. The aquatic life, they are living in the water all the time. If the water quality does not stay at the optimal level, it could cause the stress, it could cause disease outbreak, and a lot of things.”\nAquawise will be showcasing its tech as part of this year’s Startup Battlefield competition at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, which runs October 27 to 29 at San Francisco’s Moscone West.\nNineteen-year-old Tiyapunjanit said that the idea for the company started with a love of shrimp that led to a research project about shrimp larvae.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile presenting his project at the 2023 Young Scientist Competition, he met his co-founders, Chanati Jantrachotechatchawan and Kobchai Duangrattanalert, who were advising a rival team. Jantrachotechatchawan and Duangrattanalert were impressed by Tiyapunjanit and ended up advising Tiyapunjanit’s project, which went on to win the 2024 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.\nThen the trio had to figure out what to do next.\n“We have to step back and try to find the most important problem in this industry,” Tiyapunjanit said. “We found that it is a water quality problem; 80% of farms in aquaculture today are facing it. It cost almost $30 billion of losses each year.”\nThat became the foundation for Aquawise which was founded in 2024.\nWater quality isn’t as big of an issue for aquaculture farms in regions like the United States and Europe, but is a much bigger problem in developing regions like Southeast Asia, Duangrattanalert told TechCrunch. Farmers in this region can’t afford monitoring technology and instead rely on weather reports and manual checks on the water, despite the potential consequences of poor water quality.\nAquawise’s first idea was to use sonar to monitor water quality, Duangrattanalert said. Their original idea was to use acoustic sonar to capture data from water — and even tested it on a tank of fish at Tiyapunjanit’s house — before realizing that it would still be too big of a financial hurdle for farmers.\n“We want people, especially in Thailand, and in the whole Southeast Asia [region], to feel that they can use it in order to improve their livelihood in term of the community, the region and the farm itself,” Duangrattanalert said.\nAquawise works with multiple farms and is using the data it collects to continue to train its AI model. The company wants to make sure its model is accurate before it starts selling to farms.\nThe startup also plans to raise money from investors in the new year as well.\n“Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector worldwide today,” Tiyapunjanit said. “It was the one industry projected by United Nation as the best way to help feed 10 billion people in coming years because of its ability to create high nutrition with very low amount of emission.”\nIf you want to learn from Aquawise firsthand and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt, October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nThe thousands of small trucking companies that help move goods around the United States have a fairly old-school way of doing things, according to Paul Singer. He would know — he left his product manager job at Uber Freight to start a company called FleetWorks, which he believes will modernize things.\nCreated during Y Combinator’s Summer 2023 batch, FleetWorks has been developing a marketplace that leverages artificial intelligence to make faster matches between carrier companies and goods that need to be moved, freeing up more time for workers on both sides of the transaction.\nSinger and co-founder Quang Tran, who worked on “moonshot projects” at Airbnb, think it’s a massive opportunity, and they’ve found some serious buy-in: FleetWorks claims to have brought more than 10,000 carriers and dozens of brokers (including Singer’s old employer Uber Freight) onto its marketplace in the first six months.\nTo push things further, FleetWorks has raised $17 million to put toward hiring, commercial expansion, and product development, including a newly launched “always-on” AI dispatcher. The funding includes a $15 million Series A round led by First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard, who also led Uber’s seed round in 2010. Y Combinator, Saga Ventures, and LFX Venture Partners also participated in the FleetWorks Series A.\n“We ultimately went with First Round Capital to lead the round because, I mean, I think they are the preeminent investor in early-stage investing,” Singer said in an interview. “They were one of the few who really understood that we were building a marketplace company.”\nTrenchard, who was also an early investor in Flexport, told TechCrunch in an interview that he thinks AI is the best way to manage all of these transactions, especially for small businesses.\n“Traditional software is just not good at this. You’re structuring data before you even know exactly all of the elements that you need to structure, and you’re pushing people through your cheese grater,” he said. “This is obviously much more open-ended in the way that you can have these conversations with people and discover what their real interests are.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThere are a number of startups and established companies trying to apply AI to shipping and logistics. Oway, another YC-backed startup, is working on a sort of Uber for freight, packing trucks full that would otherwise be half-empty. Uber Freight is also getting its Fortune 500 customers to use a customized LLM to sort through all their data. Flexport, which deals more with global shipping, rolled out a suite of AI tools for its customers in February.\nWith FleetWorks, Singer and Tran have focused on the communication that drives the trucking world. Singer said he tries to understand how each carrier wants to communicate and will give them a mix of off-the-shelf and custom-developed voice and text models depending on what they need.\n“Do they want a phone call? Do they want a text message? Do they want to come to our portal and talk to an agent there?” he said. From there, FleetWorks’ AI agents help match goods with truckers, finding out where the truckers will be, when they will be there, and what price they need to move the cargo, among other details. FleetWorks’ AI can also handle more nuanced but important details, like: Is the driver heading to a facility that requires steel-toed boots? Or does the trucker need to be home by Friday to be with his family?\nThese are all things that carriers and truckers already do in the current system. But it often takes dozens (or more) of calls, texts, and emails to get this part of the job done, Singer said. For small carrier fleets, which make up the overwhelming majority of the industry, that time is money.\n“We sometimes imagine freight as this very rigid thing, but it’s actually this very fluid system on both sides. So for brokers, the pickup times for the appointment might be changing, or the price might be changing as the load becomes more critical when we get closer to the pickup time,” Singer said. “So the data that these two sides are collecting kind of feed this AI-powered brain, and when we detect a match, we’re able to just insert one of the carriers that uses FleetWorks directly into the broker’s system.”\nThat’s a lot of detail and nuance for AI software to handle, so to cut down on hallucinations, Singer said FleetWorks relies on a number of models in the background that it has designed to be specialized around particular tasks. The always-on dispatcher then pulls data from those discrete agents.\nBut it’s not just about the tech — a lesson Singer says he learned from his time at Uber Freight. “[It’s] about helping your customers through change management, teaching the team how to use it, and showing them that there are opportunities for this to impact your business,” he said. “We’ve gotten really good at AI implementation in addition to just building the core agents.”\nThat was a big attractor for Trenchard as well. “One of the things we’ve been excited about with AI just as a general thing is it’s fitting into the behaviors that people already have,” he said. “It’s not requiring you to change how you do business.\nWhile there’s a lot of Uber DNA in what FleetWorks is building, Singer isn’t myopic. There is a lot of young software talent who want to work on solving problems in the physical world, he said. In fact, Singer joked he’s already hired some engineers who haven’t seen “Shrek” (2001).\n“I never thought I’d feel like an old head,” he said.\n",

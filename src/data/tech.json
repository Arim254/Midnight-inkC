    "body": "\nOpenAI announced it has acquired a tiny startup called Torch for an undisclosed sum. An unnamed source told The Information that OpenAI paid $100 million worth of equity for the startup. Torch’s four-person team is joining OpenAI, both companies said.\nTorch was working on an app that combined all of a person’s medical information for AI use from a range of sources such as doctor visits, lab tests, wearables, and other portals, including consumer wellness tests and the like. The Torch team called their tech “a medical memory for AI, unifying scattered records into a context engine.”\nThe Torch team met when they worked at Forward Health, Torch co-founder Ilya Abyzov said in a post on X. Forward was known for its AI-powered doctors’ offices. It abruptly shut down in late 2024 after raising over $400 million.\nThis acqui-hire means a different fate. The team and its tech will be part of OpenAI’s newly announced ChatGPT Health, a service for people using the chatbot to analyze and manage their health. \n",

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which oversees the federal judiciary, said in August that it had strengthened its cybersecurity defenses following a cyberattack on its electronic court records system. \nHackers working for the Russian government were blamed for the breach.\nDo you have more information about this case?

The changes will also make the videos generated from reference images more expressive and dynamic.\nWhen producing AI-generated videos for YouTube Shorts or other platforms like Instagram or TikTok, Veo users can now natively choose the 9:16 vertical format to avoid any cropping. Google is also adding the feature directly to the YouTube Shorts and the YouTube Create app.\nGoogle first released Veo 3.1 in October 2025 with improved audio output and more granular editing controls compared to previous versions.\nWhen you provide reference images, Veo 3.1 now generates videos with better character expressions and movements, even if your prompts are shorter. Google said the update also improves character, object, and background consistency. What’s more, users can blend various characters, backgrounds, objects, and textures to create a cohesive output.\nUsers can access these features directly in the Gemini app. Professional users can access them through Google’s video editor Flow, the Gemini API, Vertex AI, and Google Vids.\nThe new update also brings an improved upscaling feature to 1080p and 4K resolutions, which is available on Flow, Gemini API, and Vertex AI in Google Cloud.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Apps\n\n",

In a separate post on X, the company noted that enterprises have deployed its technology to handle more than 50,000 calls per month.\nThe startup raised $180 million in Series C funding co-led by a16z and ICONIQ Growth at a $3.3 billion valuation in January 2025. It then doubled its valuation months later when ICONIQ and another earlier investor, Sequoia, shelled out another $100 million to snap up employee shares.\nBesides providing models for voice generation and voice agents, the company launched music creation capabilities last year and also struck a deal with celebrities such as Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to use their voices for AI-generated content.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

    "body": "\nIndia’s labor ministry is pushing the country’s booming quick-commerce sector to prioritize the wellness and safety of its gig workers. \nThe country’s minister of labor and employment, Mansukh Mandaviya, met with executives from Zomato’s Blinkit, Swiggy’s Instamart, and Zepto to ask them to drop their marketing language, which promises deliveries within 10 minutes, and discuss ways to improve safety and working conditions for delivery personnel, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.\nWhile the instant delivery model has faltered elsewhere, it’s taken off in India at an unprecedented rate in the past few years as consumers in urban cities have come to expect having everything from PlayStation 5s to groceries delivered within 10 to 15 minutes.\nCompanies like Zepto, Blinkit, and Instamart have raised and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into setting up “dark stores” — discrete warehouses located strategically around neighborhoods that serve as hubs. These companies have also hired armies of delivery personnel as competition heats up in the country’s booming e-commerce space.\nThe pressure on workers has intensified as the sector has grown. On New Year’s Eve, more than 200,000 gig workers staged protests across major Indian cities during the peak delivery period, according to the South China Morning Post, citing the Indian Federation of App Based Transport Workers. The workers demanded legislative protection, social security benefits, better wages, and changes to automated penalty systems that reduce their ratings for late deliveries. Safety concerns have emerged around workers rushing through traffic to meet delivery deadlines. “Ultra-fast delivery models of 10-15 minutes materially change the risk and stress profile of gig work,” Prabir Jha, founder and CEO of the HR consultancy Prabir Jha People Advisory, told the outlet.\nAmid the worker protests and pressure from the labor ministry, Blinkit has removed messaging that promised deliveries within 10 minutes, and its rivals are also expected to follow suit, Bloomberg said.\nThe news comes little more than a month after India granted legal status to millions of gig and platform workers under new labor laws that define gig and platform workers in statute, and require aggregators, such as food-delivery and ride-hailing platforms, to contribute 1% to 2% of their annual revenue (capped at 5% of payments made to such workers) to a government-managed social security fund.\nIndia’s gig economy employed about 7.7 million workers in 2020-21 and is projected to reach 23.5 million by 2029-30, according to government think tank NITI Aayog.\nSwiggy, Blinkit, and Zepto did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor. He covered North American and European M&A, equity, regulatory news and debt markets at Reuters and Acuris Global, and has also written about travel, tourism, entertainment and books.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Ram by emailing ram.iyer@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

If the EU finds Meta in breach of its antitrust rules, it could be fined up to 10% of its global revenue. \nMeta has told AI providers that they can continue offering their AI chatbots to users in Italy even after the new rules go into force on January 15, according to a notice to developers seen by TechCrunch. The company could make a similar decision in Brazil following CADE’s order. \nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for a comment outside regular business hours.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp.\n“The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said when the company changed the terms in October. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSlackbot, the automated assistant baked into the Salesforce-owned corporate messaging platform Slack, is entering a new era as an AI agent. And Salesforce CTO Parker Harris hopes it will be as viral as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\nThe cloud software giant rolled out the new version of Slackbot on Tuesday. This new AI agent version of Slackbot, which is generally available for Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, can find information, draft emails, and schedule meetings, among other things, all within the Slack platform, according to the company. It can also connect to, and interact with, other enterprise products like Microsoft Teams and Google Drive to find information if it’s granted permission. This allows users to work across a handful of different common enterprise applications without leaving Slack.\nSalesforce, and its enterprise software competitors, are pouring resources into the development of AI products in a bid to preserve, and even grow, their market share. The remodeled Slackbot, which was originally announced at Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference in October, is just one piece of Salesforce’s enterprise AI-heavy product plan.\nHarris told TechCrunch the next-gen Slackbot is completely different than what existed before; the company kept the name because it is already well known.\nHarris added that Slack doesn’t generally release new features. Instead, Slack typically issues updates to the product to help drive adoption, which makes Slackbot quite different from past product updates.\n“It is an agent, it is a super agent that is your employee agent,” Harris said. “It’s powered by generative AI, and it is something that is highly crafted and highly curated to be an agentic experience that employees and users love.”\nSalesforce tests new products, like Slackbot, with its employees for months before they release them — Harris joked they like to drink their own champagne first. Slackbot has been the most adopted internal tool they’ve released, he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Just seeing the sheer active user count is a great sign we have hit on product-market-fit,” Harris said about internal adoption. “Adopted, not mandated, in corporations.”\nThis is just the beginning of Slackbot’s second bloom as an AI agent, Harris said. In the future, they want Slackbot to move beyond just a text-based agent only in Slack. He said they want to add voice capabilities in the future and the ability for Slackbot to browse the internet alongside its users.\n“I am very confident that investing in Slackbot is not only good for Slack, it will be incredibly good for the entire company,” Harris said.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAlthough public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.\nMicrosoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.\n“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”\nThe company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.\nIt’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has observed that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.\nThis backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nConcerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “major changes” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. Trump said the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.”\nIn short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

The video allows Neo robots to learn new tasks they weren’t previously trained on, according to 1X.\nThis release comes as 1X is gearing up to release its Neo humanoids into the home. The company opened up preorders for its humanoids in October with plans to ship the bots this year. A 1X spokesperson declined to share a timeline of when these bots were shipping or share any information regarding how many have been ordered beyond saying preorders exceeded expectations.\n“After years of developing our world model and making Neo’s design as close to human as possible, Neo can now learn from internet-scale video and apply that knowledge directly to the physical world,” Bernt Børnich, founder and CEO of 1X said in a statement. “With the ability to transform any prompt into new actions — even without prior examples — this marks the starting point of Neo’s ability to teach itself to master nearly anything you could think to ask.”\nSaying that the bot can transform any prompt into a new action is a lofty claim and not entirely accurate; you can’t tell a Neo to drive a car and it will suddenly know how to parallel park, for instance. But there is some learning going on. \n1X isn’t saying the world model allows today’s Neo bots to do a new task right away from capturing video and being prompted, a company spokesperson clarified. Instead, the bot takes video data linked to specific prompts and then sends that back into the world model. That model is then fed back into the network of bots to give them a better understanding of the physical world and more know-how. \nIt also gives users insight into how Neo is thinking of behaving or reacting to a certain prompt. That kind of behavioral information could help 1X train these models to a point where robots will be able to react to a prompt of something they’ve never done before.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nShortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm.\nIn a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.”\nOwens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents.\nShe also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference.\nAfter TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns.\nIn a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.”\nIn a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOwens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.”\nThe Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately.\nEven if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought.\nShe is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.”\nAlthough Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior.\nWhile many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible.\nThe problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers.\nThat means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space.\nUntil then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.\n",

    "body": "\nWhen Justin Kim, co-founder and CEO of Hupo, first launched his company about four years ago, it wasn’t selling AI-powered sales coaching to banks, finance services, or insurance companies. The company originally began as Ami, a mental wellness platform focused on how people manage pressure, form habits, and change behavior over time.\n“I’ve always been a big sports fan — basketball, football, Formula One, MMA — and what draws me to all of them is performance. In my free time, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what actually drives human performance. People are very different, but across sports, there are clear patterns in how performance shows up,” Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch.\nHis curiosity eventually shaped his professional focus. Kim started exploring what drives performance at work, and one theme kept surfacing: mental resilience. That idea led him to found a startup in 2022.\nEarly work with Meta, which backed this startup in the seed round, helped sharpen some hard-earned lessons: Software only works when it fits into daily behavior like how people already live and work, and tools designed to help people “improve” often fail if they are judgmental, abstract, or disconnected from real work, Kim told TechCrunch.\nThose ideas followed the startup through its pivot, and today they shape Hupo’s approach to sales coaching; less about replacing human judgment and more about helping people in the moments that really matter in banking, insurance, and financial services.\nKim said the shift wasn’t as dramatic as it might seem. “The core problem in both cases is performance at scale. In banking and insurance, results vary, not because of motivation, but because training, feedback, and confidence differ. Traditional coaching can’t reach everyone, and managers can’t sit in on every conversation.”\nAI that understands conversations in real time now allows teams to receive consistent coaching, even in the highly regulated, complex industry, Kim noted.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Hupo\nHupo has raised a $10 million Series A led by DST Global Partners, with participation from Collaborative Fund, Goodwater Capital, January Capital, and Strong Ventures. In addition, the Singapore-headquartered startup now serves dozens of customers in APAC and Europe, including Prudential, AXA, Manulife, HSBC, Bank of Ireland, and Grab.\n“BFSI [Banking, Financial Services and Insurance] is a notoriously difficult vertical for early-stage companies, but our customers typically expand contracts 3x to 8x within the first six months,” the founder said. “We’ll be expanding into the U.S. in the first half of this year, where distribution-heavy financial models create a strong need for scalable coaching.”\nKim started his career at Bloomberg, selling enterprise software to banks, asset managers, and insurers, where he saw how complex regulated sales could be. He later worked on product development at South Korean fintech Viva Republica, the company behind Toss, learning how technology built around real user behavior could reshape traditional financial services.\n“Hupo sits at the intersection of those experiences. I understood the buyer, the end user, and the operational reality of selling financial products,” Kim said. “Once AI became capable of understanding context and coaching in real time, it became obvious to me that sales coaching — especially in banking and insurance — was the right place to apply it.”\nMany AI sales coaching tools start with the technology first, Kim said, but Hupo took a different approach, building its platform around how banks and insurers operate. “One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that, especially with large enterprises, you have to understand their business and industry in detail,” he added, noting that Hupo’s models were trained from the start on real financial products, common objections, client types, and regulatory requirements.\nThe latest round brings total funding to $15 million since the company was founded in 2022. The new capital will go toward expanding its product, including real-time coaching features; scaling enterprise-grade deployments; growing go-to-market efforts in banking, financial services, and insurance; and building out the team.\nIn five years, Kim says he wants Hupo to go beyond sales coaching and help large teams perform at scale, giving managers and employees clearer insights and practical guidance, even across tens of thousands of people.\n",

    "body": "\nSuperorganism launched in 2023 as what it claims is the first venture capital firm focused on biodiversity, aiming to serve as the conservationist on the cap table for nature-friendly startups.\nNow, the firm has closed its first fund, securing $25.9 million in capital commitments from Cisco Foundation, AMB Holdings, and Builders Vision, among others, along with individuals like Jeff Jordan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz.\nSuperorganism backs companies across three categories: tech that slows or reverses extinction, startups that operate at the intersection of climate and biodiversity, and tools that enable conservationists to do their work more effectively.\nThe firm writes checks of $250,000 to $500,000 in size for pre-seed and seed-stage companies and donates 10% of its profits to future conservationist efforts.\n“You could think of us a lot like a climate tech fund, but instead of thinking about, where can we emit less carbon dioxide or avoid emissions in the first place, we’re doing the same thing for nature loss,” Kevin Webb, a managing director at Superorganism, told TechCrunch.\nSuperorganism portfolio company Spoor illustrates the type of startup the firm is looking to back. The company’s software uses computer vision to track bird movement and migration patterns, minimizing damage from wind turbines on local bird populations. This benefits both biodiversity and wind farm developers, which face strict regulations around their impact on birds — regulations that can delay construction or even shut down projects.\nWebb and co-founder and managing director Tom Quigley described their introduction as “kismet” to TechCrunch back in 2023. Webb had begun making angel investments focused on biodiversity to see if it could be viable as a venture capital fund strategy. While he was doing this, he reached out to Quigley because he was impressed with his background. The two started talking and eventually began working on the firm in 2022.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe political climate around protecting nature and the climate in general has changed a lot — in the U.S. at least — since the pair started working on this a few years ago. But it didn’t really hold the firm back from reaching its $25 million target.\nQuigley said some potential LPs needed guidance in understanding what makes Superorganism different than a climate fund, but that becomes clearer when you look at the firm’s portfolio, he said. Their portfolio companies span different categories and attract different types of follow-on investors and customers.\n“We are purposely building a diverse portfolio,” Quigley said. “It allows us to show what the best biodiversity companies look like across all industries, across all tech types. We think that there’s a showcase portfolio for a fund — one that’s a really powerful thing, and it’s a really stable portfolio that’s not too [affected] by different headwinds in different industries or different government policies of the day.”\nMany of these biodiversity issues transcend partisan battles over climate change too, he said. Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis recently gave a shout out to Inversa, one of Superorganism’s portfolio companies that turns invasive species into leather goods, for helping tackle a python problem in the Everglades, he added.\nThus far, the firm has invested in 20 companies and plans for a portfolio size of about 35 companies for this fund.\n“We recognize that we’re the first and we need to be there to sort of bring others along where they might be interested in taking their first bet on biodiversity, helping them find and support the right ones that can move the needle,” Quigley said.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAmmonia might be the world’s most underappreciated chemical. Without it, crops would go unfertilized and billions of people would starve.\nHumans started making ammonia in large amounts just over a century ago, and since then the process used to make it, known as Haber-Bosch, hasn’t changed much. A new startup, Ammobia, says that it has tweaked the Haber-Bosch process to lower the cost by up to 40%.\nTo prove the technology works on a larger scale, Ammobia has raised a $7.5 million seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Investors include Air Liquide’s venture arm ALIAD, Chevron Technology Ventures, Chiyoda Corporation, MOL Switch, and Shell Ventures.\nIf the startup succeeds, it could pave the way for ammonia to be used beyond fertilizer. \nAmmonia is viewed by some as an alternative to hydrogen to decarbonize a range of industries. Countries like Japan and South Korea have developed industrial and transportation roadmaps that rely on ammonia. Hydrogen, the other leading contender, isn’t as energy dense and its transportation infrastructure isn’t as well developed as ammonia.\n“The big advantage of ammonia is that it’s much easier and more cost-effective to transport and store,” Ammobia co-founder and CEO Karen Baert told TechCrunch. “That opens up a range of opportunities.”\nBut those opportunities won’t amount to much if ammonia production doesn’t clean up its act. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the world’s big polluters, producing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gases. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTo make ammonia, plants using Haber-Bosch employ an iron catalyst to force one molecule of nitrogen to react with three molecules of hydrogen. The reaction requires high heat (500°C) and pressure (around 200 bar or 2,900 psi) to sustain, both of which tend to be supplied by burning fossil fuels.\nFossil fuels also provide some of the gas needed as a feedstock. Nitrogen is easy to obtain — the gas makes up nearly 80% of Earth’s atmosphere — but most hydrogen used in ammonia production is made by using steam to break apart methane molecules (CH4) found in natural gas.\nAmmobia’s process runs at around 150°C cooler and at 10x lower pressure. As a result, plants that adopt the technology stand to produce less pollution, even if they don’t ditch fossil fuels.\nThe startup also says its process saves cost up front. Ammobia can use cheaper pumps and equipment because it doesn’t need to hit high temperatures and pressures.\nThat could give producers an edge. Because nearly every ammonia producer uses Haber-Bosch, they have typically had only two ways to reduce costs: find a cheaper source of heat or a cheaper source of hydrogen. In places like the U.S., few are cheaper than natural gas.\nAmmobia isn’t seeking to change that right away. The startup emphasizes that its process works with any source of hydrogen or heat. But it does have some key differences from traditional Haber-Bosch that could encourage cleaner sources of each. \nBecause Ammobia’s process runs at lower pressure, it’s easier to ramp production up and down, which could allow renewable developers to take advantage of surplus electricity production to make cheap hydrogen and thus cheap ammonia.\n“Our technology is very compatible with renewable energy, that leads to an additional cost reduction because you don’t need to store hydrogen or store electricity,” Baert said. “In these situations, we have the strongest cost advantage.”\nThe reduced temperature and pressure requirements also allow Ammobia to make its equipment smaller than a typical Haber-Bosch plant. Most ammonia facilities today generate between 1,000 and 3,000 tons per day, while Ammobia’s commercial-scale unit will produce 250 tons per day, Baert said. Customers that need more can install multiple units, she said.\nAmmobia did not share details on how it tweaked Haber-Bosch to run at lower temperature and pressure, but there are a few hints out there. The company has a patent pending on a reactor system that incorporates a sorbent to remove ammonia as it is formed to free up space on the catalyst for another reaction to take place. Researchers have also been investigating non-iron catalysts, including manganese nitride, which use less energy to keep the chemical reaction going.\nThe startup has been operating a small unit for about a year, and the new funding will help the company build a pilot plant that contains all the features of the commercial model on a smaller scale, about 10 tons per day.\n“With that modular approach, we can build projects faster, and we can start at a medium scale,” Baert said. “We see that a lot of customers are looking for that type of solution, and there’s no solution out there today.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nUsage of voice AI in sales, marketing, customer support, and consumer applications has shot up in the last few years. As a result, model providers have seen increased business, along with investor interest. On the back of this demand, today, Deepgram said that it has raised $130 million in a Series C round led by AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation.\nThe round also saw existing investors such as Alkeon, In-Q-Tel, Madrona, Tiger, Wing, and Y Combinator put in more money. Plus, new investors like Alumni Ventures, Columbia University, Princeville Capital, Twilio, and SAP joined the round. The company has raised over $215 million in funding to date. \nThe startup’s raise continues the trend of sizable funding rounds in voice AI last year, including Sesame’s $250 million Series B, ElevenLab’s $180 million Series C, and Gradium’s $70 million seed round.\nElizabeth de Saint-Aignan, a partner at AVP, told TechCrunch that when the fund was talking to enterprises about how they were using AI, voice came up frequently, and it started looking into companies working in this area.\n“In 2024, when we were talking to enterprises about how they were thinking about using AI inside their business, we started to hear about them using voice AI in processes like contact centers and sales developments. When we chatted with them more, we realized a lot of voice AI tech was powered by Deepgram, and that’s what led us to them [Deepgram],” de Saint-Aignan said.\nShe noted that voice AI could help in making customers’ interactions with enterprises more pleasant while reducing costs for companies, and Deepgram could play a central part in it. \nDeepgram has a bunch of models related to text-to-speech and speech-to-text, along with platforms and APIs for conversational speech recognition and interruption handling with low latency. It noted that more than 1,300 organizations use its voice AI products and models, including meeting notetaker Granola, voice agent startup Vapi, and Twilio.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company’s CEO, Scott Stephenson, said that the company didn’t need the fundraise and it was cashflow positive last year.\n“In the last year, voice AI has gone mainstream, and there is more potential pull. We see that we can make larger investment sooner in order to accelerate growth. And that is why we felt it could be a good time to raise,” he said.\n“We weren’t out looking for a raise, though. We had multiple people coming to us. We wanted strategic investors who understand voice AI and the technical intricacies of it and have relationships with companies building using the technology.”\nThe company wants to use the new fundraising to expand its global footprint and better support multiple languages. It is also focusing on catering to restaurants through voice AI. To that end, it has acquired Y Combinator-backed OfOne, which built a voice AI-powered solution for quick-service restaurants. The startup claims that it has more than 93% accuracy in receiving orders. Voice AI has had its challenges in the restaurant space. Last year, Taco Bell withdrew its voice AI experiment after a person ordered 18,000 water cups.\n“I am excited about this [voice AI-driven food ordering] because food ordering might be the first positive interaction more than 300 million Americans have with voice AI. There have been a lot of sour interactions with voice AI over the last 20 years, where a lot of assistants have come out, and people felt that those didn’t provide a magical experience. But when you can order your food using natural conversation, people would think the technology is ready,” Stephenson said.\nThere seems to be investor interest in the sector, as OfOne’s acquisition news comes after Presto, which serves brands like Carl’s Jr., picked up $10 million in new funding.\nAnalysts’ reports peg the voice market to grow at over 30% year-over-year and become a $14-$20 billion market by 2030. With this growth rate, model and API providers will look to be multibillion-dollar companies by becoming a core component for enterprises and startups developing voice solutions.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe solar activity that’s been lighting up the night sky across North America this week is now causing Jeff Bezos’ space company to push back the second launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nJust hours before the scheduled launch on Wednesday, Blue Origin said it is standing down from the attempt due to the solar activity and its “potential effects on the ESCAPADE spacecraft” — a Mars-bound science mission the company is carrying to space for NASA. A new launch date has not yet been announced.\nNew Glenn’s first launch in January was mostly a successful demonstration mission of the rocket. Blue Origin delayed the second launch multiple times, though, and the company is being cautious since this is the first time the rocket has a commercial payload onboard. \nNew Glenn nearly took off this past Sunday, but weather concerns and an errant cruise ship in the flight path, plus some issues with the launch pad equipment, caused the company to shelve the attempt.\n",

Since then, some artists have started to warm up to the idea of AI. \nLast year, Meta announced that its Meta AI would offer voice assistants that sound like actresses Kristen Bell and Judi Dench. With McConaughey, an investor in ElevenLabs, the company will translate his newsletter into Spanish audio with the use of his AI voice. \nElevenLabs also announced this week that it was launching a marketplace to let brands use authorized AI-generated voices of celebrities, which will include Caine and other names like Liza Minelli and Dr. Maya Angelou. \nElevenLabs is one of the more popular AI unicorn companies and has backers including a16z and ICONIQ.  \n\n\tTopics\n",

The acquirer is the music and technology company Stingray Group, which will pay $150 million at closing and up to $25 million one year later.\nIt financed the deal with a loan under its renewed credit facility, the company said on Wednesday. \nFounded in 2002, TuneIn was an early player in the online music space. Unlike rivals like Apple Music or Spotify Premium that offer ad-free, subscription-based music on demand, TuneIn focused on streaming traditional radio stations over the internet. This business model also allowed TuneIn to deliver a wide variety of content beyond music, like news, talk, and live sports. The company attempted to monetize this content through a paid subscription that also included audiobooks and ad-free radio channels.\nHowever, the company struggled to compete in the crowded streaming market, particularly as consumer demand for talk radio shifted to podcasts, and people grew comfortable paying for ad-free music subscriptions.\nStingray, a Montreal-based company that owns radio stations and provides music tech and advertising services, acquired TuneIn to expand its reach, particularly through partnerships with device manufacturers, automakers, and content providers. The company noted that TuneIn’s content is available on more than 200 platforms and connected devices, including over 50 in-car audio systems, spanning more than 100 countries.\nThe $175 million purchase price was based on TuneIn’s forecasted sales of $110 million and adjusted EBITDA of US$30 million for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2025. TuneIn has over 75 million monthly active listeners worldwide.\nStingray says the TuneIn brand will remain. Once the deal closes, Stingray expects its revenue to exceed $400 million.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n",

The recent update includes a slider that lets users adjust the opacity of the clock displayed on the Lock Screen. This new feature enables users to make the clock nearly fully transparent or give it a more frosted look. There will still be an option to completely turn off Liquid Glass.\nAnother change is the ability to set alarms for reminders. When creating a reminder, choosing a specific time and then enabling the “Urgent” option will trigger an alarm at that time. Many people have been requesting this, and it will help keep things on track and ensure users don’t forget important tasks.\nReminders has a new ‘Urgent’ alarm option in iOS 26.2 pic.twitter.com/AulXNB6jQP— kayden ⛧ (@f4dedlight) November 12, 2025 \nLast week, Apple also revealed that as part of the iOS 26.2 rollout, live translation on AirPods is expanding to the EU. If someone speaks to a user in another language, Siri can provide translations through the AirPods. This feature was initially rolled out in the U.S. and select other countries with iOS 26, but it wasn’t accessible in the EU until iOS 26.2, as Apple required additional time to ensure it met the EU’s Digital Markets Act requirements.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdditionally, the Apple News app will feature a new “Following” tab in the bottom navigation bar, which will include favorites, saved stories, and history.

There will also be a Podcast Mentions function, so if a podcast host references another show during an episode, Apple Podcasts will automatically include a link to that show in the episode description. \nOther features include offline lyric support in Apple Music, enabling listeners to view song lyrics even when not connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular network.

    "body": "\nA group of Democratic lawmakers have sent letters to several state governors, including in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Wisconsin, warning that their states are inadvertently sharing drivers’ data with federal immigration authorities.\nThe letter, which was first reported by Reuters, told governors that their states are providing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies “with frictionless, self-service access to the personal data of all of your residents,” through a non-profit managed by state police agencies called the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, or Nlets.\nNlets facilitates the sharing of state residents’ personal data, in this case drivers’ license data, between state, local, and federal police agencies. \nThe lawmakers asked the group of governors to stop the practice and block access to ICE and “other federal agencies that are now acting as Trump’s shock troops.” \nICE and Nlets did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. \nFor two decades, most states have made their residents’ data, such as drivers’ licenses and other information from each state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database, available for search and retrieval to approximately 18,000 federal and local law enforcement agencies across the U.S. and Canada. This practice allows those agencies to directly access residents’ data without the knowledge or involvement of any state employee, according to the letter.\nThe letter said that it’s possible that ICE is using drivers’ license photos for their facial recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which agents are using to identify people on the street and relies on 200 million photos.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to the letter, Nlets facilitated “over 290 million queries for DMV data,” with more than 290,000 queries from ICE and some 600,000 from Homeland Security Investigations during the year before October 1, 2025. \n“It is now abundantly clear that a major reason that so few states have locked down the data they share through Nlets is because of an information gap,” reads the letter. “Because of the technical complexity of Nlets’ system, few state government officials understand how their state is sharing their residents’ data with federal and out-of-state agencies,” read the letter. \nThe letter said blocking the agencies’ “unfettered access” would not prevent federal agencies obtaining information from states for solving serious crimes, but taking action would “increase accountability and reduce abuse” by allowing state employees to review data requests first.\nThe lawmakers noted that some states, including Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Washington recently restricted what kind of data ICE can access via Nlets, and reminded the governors that it is up to them to stop the practice at any time.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

The dispute began when the two companies failed to reach an agreement on a streaming deal.\nThis means that for 12 days and counting, 10  million YouTube TV subscribers like myself have not been able to access Disney-owned TV networks like ABC and ESPN, which comprise around 20 different channels.\nBusiness Insider called sports fans “the big losers” in this standoff. The New York Times and Engadget are publishing guides to help viewers tune into must-watch college football games. But the press has ignored a beleaguered demographic suffering in silence while their peers boot up Fubo trials to watch Monday Night Football.\nIt’s me. I’m beleaguered. I can’t watch “Jeopardy!” because it airs on ABC.\n“Jeopardy!” is a longstanding fixture in my nightly routine. I finish work. I make dinner. I watch “Jeopardy!” So imagine my surprise in early November when I turned on YouTube TV, only to find that the most recent episode had not recorded. In fact, months of my “Jeopardy!” recordings had vanished! The horror! Who’s the current “Jeopardy!” champion? Has Ken Jennings worn any cool ties lately? I don’t know. Because I can’t watch “Jeopardy!”\nYouTube TV and Disney have been locked in this public dispute for weeks. On October 23, YouTube TV wrote in a statement that it has been “working in good faith” to negotiate a deal with Disney, but that the company is “proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers […] while benefitting Disney’s own live TV products.” From Disney’s perspective, YouTube TV is “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOn Sunday, YouTube TV announced that it would give subscribers a $20 credit — which must be manually redeemed — to compensate for nearly two weeks of a Disney blackout. While I thank the $3.46 trillion giant Google for its generosity, might I point out that in 2021, when a similar dispute blacked out Disney’s channels from YouTube TV for one day, subscribers got a $15 credit? (Also, YouTube TV cost almost $20 less per month back then.)\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, Disney will lose an estimated $60 million over two weeks –$4.3 million per day — by not making a deal with YouTube TV. But Disney could also be generating new income streams with the recently launched ESPN Unlimited subscription, which gives subscribers access to all ESPN content for $30 per month. However, we must note that ESPN Unlimited crucially does not include “Jeopardy!”, America’s Favorite Quiz Show®.\nI could, like many others, use this opportunity to scope out other cord-cutting streamers, perhaps those owned by Disney — however, I may or may not be sharing my YouTube TV account with five other people, leaving me pretty locked into a sweet deal. (Please, YouTube TV, don’t pull a Netflix on me.)\nWhen will this national nightmare end? When will I once again be able to criticize contestants’ mathematically illogical Daily Double wagers? When will I be reminded that I know literally nothing about opera? The ball’s in your court, Mr.  Mouse.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nIf there’s any question about whether data centers are driving the global economy, a new report from the International Energy Agency should dispel any doubts. This year, the world will spend $580 billion on data centers, $40 billion more than it will spend on new oil supplies.\n“This point of comparison provides a telling marker of the changing nature of modern, highly digitalized economies,” the agency said in the report.\nElectricity consumption from AI data centers is expected to grow fivefold by the end of the decade, doubling the total used by all data centers today. Conventional data centers will also consume more energy, though the increase won’t be nearly as dramatic.\nFully half of that demand growth is expected to occur in the U.S., the IEA said, with the bulk of the remainder occurring in Europe and China. \nMost new data centers are being developed by large cities with populations exceeding 1 million people, the agency said. One half of those in the pipeline are at least 200 megawatts, and most are being built near other data centers.\n“This rapid build out of data centers — especially in clusters and around urban areas — comes with challenges,” the IEA wrote. “Grid congestion and connection queues are increasing in many regions, and connection queues for new data centers are often already long.”\nIn some markets like northern Virginia, grid connection waits can be as long as a decade. In Europe, Dublin has paused new interconnection requests entirely until 2028.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe supply chain for the grid is another pinch point, with cables, critical minerals, gas turbines, and transformers delaying upgrades, the agency said.\nSome companies, like Amperesand and Heron Power, are working on solid-state transformers, which promise to be a significant upgrade over the century-old technology that currently manages parts of the grid. They can integrate renewables more deftly, react swiftly to grid instabilities, and can handle a range of conversions. But first deployments are at least a year or two away, and it’ll take a while to ramp up production.\nThe IEA expects renewables to supply the majority of new data center power by 2035, regardless of whether countries maintain their current policies or more aggressively pursue lower emissions. Solar, which has come down in cost significantly in recent years, has become a particular favorite of developers.\nOver the next decade, around 400 terawatt-hours of electricity for data centers will come from renewables, whereas natural gas will supply around 220 terawatt-hours. If small modular nuclear power plants deliver on their promises, the IEA expects they’ll contribute 190 terawatt-hours to data centers.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSearch and rescues missions often happen in areas that are difficult for humans to navigate due to extreme weather, rough terrain, or dangerous conditions like smoke or dust.\nA researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) wants to send robots inspired by bats on these missions instead of humans.\nNitin J. Sanket, a professor at WPI, has developed small flying robots with his team that fit in the palm of a hand and use ultrasound — just like bats. These robots use AI-powered software to filter out noise from the ultrasound signals the devices collect, allowing them to spot obstacles within a two-meter radius.\n“Search and rescue is done on foot,” Sanket told TechCrunch. “There are a lot of people who go on foot with flashlights in really harsh conditions and put their lives at danger to save others. We thought drones are the answer because they can cover a lot of ground really fast. They can be agile and quick.”\nNitin Sanket\nSanket has long been fascinated by aerial robots and drones and how the tech can be retrofitted for real-world situations. During his PhD program, his advisor challenged him to create the smallest robot possible, which sparked his research into taking cues from biology to build smaller machines.\n“We had to reimagine what a drone would be at that point, which is go back to biology, because biology does this way better than we can today,” Sanket said. “How do insects or birds do it with super limited compute and not-so-good sensing apparatus? Their eyes are not that great, their brains are really small, but they’re still able to do these amazing feats of flight. So we started looking at that, and that’s what gave rise to my PhD thesis.”\nSanket built a prototype of a robotic beehive made up of small drones that could pollinate flowers. Despite his efforts, he realized that this application was probably a moonshot and started thinking of areas where biology-based robots could make a difference sooner, which led him to his current project.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor the search and rescue robots, the main challenge was building something with the necessary sensors and flying technology without making the robot too large, expensive, or energy intensive.\nSanket said they turned to the ultrasound sensors used in automatic faucets because they require very little power. While that approach worked, the propellers they built on the robots created too much noise, which overloaded the sensor’s ability to spot obstacles.\nTo fix this problem, they turned back to bats.\n“Bats have these special tissues in their nose, ears, and mouth which adaptively change in thickness and density to modulate the way they hear and chirp sound,” Sanket said. “We were like, ‘Okay, that’s super cool.’ Can we do something like that? We designed a 3D-printed structure to place in front of the robot, which essentially does the same [functionally, as] what a bat does, which is change the shape of the sound itself.”\nNow that they’ve been able to get the robots to work, they are working to tackle their next challenge: improving their speed.\n“We, as human beings, like to try to mimic a lot of things the human brain does,” Sanket said. “We tend to forget how remarkable other animals are, which are much smaller than us. Especially insects and birds, which are much tinier, can actually do remarkable feats of navigation, which I think we don’t really see often. I think we should think more as scientists rather than just pure engineers.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAustralia’s intelligence head Mike Burgess has warned that China-backed hackers are “probing” the country’s critical infrastructure, and in some cases have gained access. \nBurgess, who heads the country’s main intelligence agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, said that at least two China government-backed hacking groups are pre-positioning for sabotage and espionage. \nThe comments, made during a conference speech in Melbourne on Wednesday, echo similar remarks by the U.S. government, which has warned that the ongoing hacking campaigns may pose risks of economic and societal disruption.\nAccording to Burgess, a hacker group known as Volt Typhoon is trying to break into critical infrastructure networks such as power, water, and transportation systems. Burgess warned that successful hacks could affect energy and water supplies, and cause widespread outages.\nThe U.S. has previously said that the Chinese hackers have spent years planting malware on critical infrastructure systems that are capable of causing disruptive cyberattacks when activated. U.S. officials said that Volt Typhoon’s goals are to hamper the U.S.’ response to China’s anticipated future invasion of Taiwan.\n“I do not think we — and I mean all of us — truly appreciate how disruptive, how devastating, this could be,” said Burgess, speaking about the threat. He said that once the hackers have access, what happens next is a “matter of intent, not capability.” \nBurgess also warned that another China-backed hacking group dubbed Salt Typhoon, known for hacking into the networks of phone and internet companies to steal call records and other sensitive data, was also targeting the country’s telecoms infrastructure. \nSalt Typhoon has hacked more than 200 phone and internet companies, according to the FBI, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen, along with several other cloud and data center providers. The hacks prompted the FBI to urge Americans to switch to end-to-end encrypted messaging apps to avoid having their calls and text messages accessed by the hackers.\nThe Canadian government also confirmed earlier this year that its telcos were breached as part of China-linked attacks.\nChina has long denied the hacking allegations. \n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

(Users who use an authenticator app are unaffected.)\nX said this was part of an effort to retire the older twitter.com domain, which currently redirects to x.com. That change took effect in May 2024. The problem is that passkeys and security keys are digitally tied to the old twitter.com domain and can’t be transferred to x.com. That means users have to manually un-enroll and re-enroll using the new x.com domain.\nAs part of the switchover, X warned that after November 10, customers would have their accounts locked until they re-enroll or choose another method of two-factor authentication. \nNow that the deadline has passed, plenty of users are reporting that they’ve been locked out of their accounts and can’t re-enroll their passkey or security key, citing error messages or getting caught in an endless loop.\nThis is the latest issue to beset X, now owned by Elon Musk after he bought Twitter, as it was known then, for $44 billion. Since taking charge of the social networking site, the company has experienced massive layoffs and countless controversies.\nX did not respond to a request for comment, but Musk, who now owns X, has been posting as usual, presumably unaffected by the change.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWisdomAI, the new AI data analytics startup from Rubrik co-founder Soham Mazumdar, has landed a fresh $50 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from new investor NVentures (Nvidia’s venture capital arm).  \nThis round comes roughly six months after the startup announced a seed round of $23 million led by Coatue. \nWisdomAI offers AI-driven data analytics that can answer business questions from structured, unstructured, and even “dirty” data, meaning data that hasn’t been cleaned of typos or errors. A business user simply asks questions in natural language, such as, “How many customers do I have in my pipeline and what’s preventing them from closing this quarter?”  \nBut the company is using a clever method to eliminate the LLM hallucination problem. WisdomAI is not using LLMs to write answers to questions. Instead, LLMs are only used to write the query —  the part that will go out to a data warehouse to retrieve data. So if the LLM hallucinates, it will simply write an ineffective query rather than inventing false answers.\nWisdomAI has written its own logic that it calls the “enterprise context layer,” which studies the customer data to understand it. All of the startup’s co-founders worked with Mazumdar at data security company Rubrik, giving them deep experience with enterprise storage warehouses. (Mazumdar left Rubrik in 2023.)\nSince formally launching in late 2024, WisdomAI has grown from two enterprise customers to around 40 enterprise customers, CEO Mazumdar says. WisdomAI counts such companies like Descope, ConocoPhillips, Cisco, and Patreon as customers. \nMazumdar said the young company is also growing usage within its enterprise customers. Some customers have doubled usage within two months. Another customer started with 10 seats and expanded to 450, which is almost everyone in the company, he said.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the last six months, WisdomAI has also added an agentic feature that will alert users in real time to important changes in situations they are monitoring. \n“I have created an agent which is watching our product usage metrics, our ticket information,” Mazumdar says, adding that it took him about five minutes to create it. But rather than sending him a daily or, even, hourly report on usage and helpdesk tickets, it alerts him “when something interesting happens,” he describes.\n“I think that’s the magic with analytics. It’s always been a static report, but we are making it dynamic. We are making it proactive,” he said. \n",

The ID does not replace a physical passport, and it’s not currently supported for international travel or crossing borders, Apple notes.\nImage Credits:Apple\nUsers can add their passport to Wallet by tapping on the “Add” (+) button in the Wallet app, then selecting “Driver’s License or ID Cards.” From there, select Digital ID and follow the steps to complete the setup process, which includes using the iPhone to scan the photo page of their passport and scanning the chip embedded on the back to ensure the passport’s authenticity. Users will also have to take a selfie for verification and then complete a series of facial and head movements for additional security.\nSupport for IDs in Apple Wallet is the last obstacle standing in the way of making iPhones a replacement for a physical wallet, as it can now hold payment cards, loyalty cards, tickets and passes, and more.\nPresenting Apple’s new Digital ID in person works much like using Apple Pay. You can double-click the side button or Home button to access your Wallet, then select Digital ID. The iPhone or Apple Watch should be held near an identity reader, and users will use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate their information. Users will also be able to see what identity information is being requested before completing the verification process.\nImage Credits:Apple\nThe feature is still in beta as it hasn’t fully rolled out to all the device readers at the TSA checkpoints at this time. (The TSA website offers a list of which states are currently supporting mobile ID, but still advises travelers to carry their physical ID.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nApple says that users will eventually be able to present their Digital ID at businesses and organizations where they need to verify their age, both in-person and online.\nThis could include event venues or bars, where users need to present their ID at the door to verify if they’re of drinking age. Online, websites that restrict content to adults could also leverage Apple’s APIs to verify users’ ages. For instance, if a user wanted to order alcohol for delivery through a service like Uber Eats, they could verify their ID during the ordering process.\nIn both cases, users would be able to confirm that their age is over 21 without having to also share personal information like their name, address or birthday. \nApple said it can’t see when or where a user presents their ID or what data was shared. Plus, users don’t have to unlock their phone or hand it over to present their ID, as it works just like Apple Pay. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSixteen years ago, engineers working on the Google self-driving project conducted their first autonomous vehicle tests on the freeway that connects Silicon Valley to San Francisco. \nThe company would eventually become Waymo, autonomous vehicle testing would expand — fanning out to other cities. Eventually, the company launched commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Other cities soon followed. \nBut freeways, despite some of that early testing, would remain out of reach. Until today. \nWaymo said Wednesday it will begin offering robotaxi rides that use freeways across San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, a critical expansion for the company that it says will reduce ride times by up to 50%. That stat could help attract a whole new group of users who need to travel between the many towns and suburbs within the greater San Francisco Bay Area or quicken commutes across the sprawling Los Angeles and Phoenix metro areas. \nUsing freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in. \nThe service won’t be offered to all Waymo riders at first, the company said. Waymo riders who want to experience freeway rides can note their preference in the Waymo app. Once the rider hails a ride, they may be matched with a freeway trip, according to the company.\nThe company’s robotaxi routes will now stretch to San Jose, an expansion that will create a unified 260-mile service area across the Peninsula, according to Waymo. The company said it will also begin curbside drop off and pick up service at the San Jose Mineta International Airport. It already offers curbside service to the Sky Harbor Phoenix International Airport.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Waymo\n“Freeway driving is one of those things that’s very easy to learn, but very hard to master when we’re talking about full autonomy without a human driver as a backup, and at scale,” Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov said in a media briefing with reporters. “It took time to do it properly, with a strong focus on system safety and reliability.”\nWaymo robotaxis have been spotted on freeways for months. TechCrunch took a test ride last year in the Phoenix area that included freeways. The company has provided trips to employees for more than a year. It also expanded testing to include closed course and simulation\nWhile many assume freeway driving is easier, it comes with its own set of challenges, principal software engineer Pierre Kreitmann said in a recent briefing. He noted that critical events happen less often on freeways, which means there are fewer opportunities to expose Waymo’s self-driving system to rare scenarios and prove how the system performs when it really matters. The company chose to augment its public road driving with a combination of closed course and simulation testing.\nThis expanded testing and validation of the software was done to ensure the vehicles transition smoothly and safely between freeways and surface streets, and recognize and adapt to the unique context of the road around them, Kreitman said. \nWaymo has also expanded its operational protocols, including how it coordinates with safety officials like California Highway Patrol, now that its robotaxis are on freeways. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

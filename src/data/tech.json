    "body": "\nEtsy is selling Depop, a secondhand clothing app popular with Gen Z and millennials, to eBay for $1.2 billion in cash, the company announced on Wednesday. Etsy says the deal will allow it to focus on its own marketplace.\nThe deal comes nearly five years after Etsy acquired Depop for $1.62 billion, at a time when secondhand clothing apps were gaining in popularity.\nFounded in 2011, Depop generated approximately $1 billion in gross merchandise sales — the total value of goods sold through its platform — in 2025. In the U.S., the company saw nearly 60% year-over-year growth. As of December 31, 2025, the marketplace had seven million active buyers, nearly 90% of whom were under 34, and more than three million active sellers.\n“Depop has built a trusted, social-forward marketplace with strong momentum in the pre-loved fashion category, and we are confident that as part of eBay, Depop will be even more well-positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from our scale, complementary offerings, and operational capabilities,” said eBay CEO Jamie Iannone in the press release.\nThe move comes as Etsy has struggled to grow its business after the pandemic-era e-commerce boom, competing with marketplaces like Temu and Shein, as well as Amazon.\nThe company’s year-over-year revenue grew 2.2% in 2024, down from 7.1% growth reported in 2023. Etsy is scheduled to release its 2025 earnings on Thursday.\n“We are excited that this transaction allows us to focus exclusively on the compelling opportunity we see in front of us: to grow the Etsy marketplace in ways that matter most to our buyers and sellers,” said Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal in the press release. “We are proud of what the Depop team has built – a truly differentiated brand and product, grounded in clear purpose and strong community – becoming one of the fastest-growing fashion resale marketplaces in the U.S. I am confident that Depop is well-positioned for its next phase of growth as part of eBay.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe sale is the latest in a pattern of Etsy acquiring and then divesting niche online marketplaces. Etsy’s sale of Depop comes as the company has purchased and then sold other niche online marketplaces in recent years, including Brazilian e-commerce company Elo7 and musical instrument marketplace Reverb.\nThe deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMukesh Ambani, the billionaire chairperson of Indian conglomerate Reliance, on Thursday unveiled the group’s ₹10 trillion (about $110 billion) plan to build AI computing infrastructure in India over the next seven years.\nSpeaking at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Thursday, Ambani said the investment would fund gigawatt-scale data centers, a nationwide edge computing network, and new AI services integrated with Reliance’s Jio telecom platform.\nReliance has already begun construction of multi-gigawatt data centers in Jamnagar, Gujarat, Ambani said, and more than 120 megawatts of capacity is expected to come online in the second half of 2026.\nAmbani’s pledge adds to a growing wave of AI investment in India. Earlier this week, Adani Group outlined plans to invest about $100 billion to build AI data centers in the country, and the Indian government expects more than $200 billion in AI infrastructure spending over the next two years. \nGlobal technology firms are also stepping up their presence, with OpenAI partnering with the Tata Group to develop about 100 megawatts of AI capacity in the country, and plans to scale that to 1 gigawatt eventually.\nAmbani said the push is essential for India’s technological self-reliance, saying the country “cannot afford to rent intelligence,” and that Reliance aims to cut the cost of AI services as dramatically as it once reduced mobile data prices in the country.\n“The biggest constraint in AI today is not talent or imagination,” Ambani said. “It is scarcity and high cost of compute.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe build-out, Ambani said, would be supported by Reliance’s green energy capacity, which stretches to 10 gigawatts of surplus power from solar projects in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.\nReliance will partner with Indian enterprises, startups, and academic institutions to embed AI in industries ranging from manufacturing and logistics to agriculture, healthcare and financial services.\nJio has already been striking AI partnerships: it last year landed a deal with Google to offer free Gemini AI Pro access to millions of its users in India.\nReliance also plans to develop AI capabilities in several Indian languages to spur adoption of the tech, Ambani said.\nThe aggressive push highlights how India’s largest conglomerates are racing to secure a foothold in what is expected to be one of the country’s biggest technology opportunities.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSeatGeek announced on Wednesday a new integration with Spotify, bringing a seamless ticket-buying experience for Spotify users. \nNow when Spotify users browse an artist’s page or upcoming tour dates, they will see ticket links powered by SeatGeek for concerts at these participating venues, allowing for a streamlined purchase process.\nCurrently, the integration is available for a select group of venues where SeatGeek serves as the primary ticket seller. Specifically, it covers SeatGeek’s 15 major U.S. venue partners, including State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Nissan Stadium in Nashville, and AT&T Stadium in Arlington. (So, although SeatGeek is a major player in the secondary ticketing space, this integration is exclusive to venues where it operates as the primary ticketing platform.)\nThis is a strategic win for SeatGeek. With direct placement in the Spotify app, SeatGeek is positioned to reach millions of active music fans as they discover upcoming events, increasing the chances of converting listeners into ticket buyers.\nImage Credits:SeatGeek\nAlthough SeatGeek has made significant strides in the space, it continues to face competition from heavyweights Ticketmaster and AXS. \nThese rivals command a greater share of the ticketing market, bolstered by long-term contracts with many top venues and event organizers. It’s estimated that Ticketmaster alone services 53 of the top 68 U.S. arenas. Even Barclays Center, which switched from Ticketmaster to SeatGeek in 2021, quickly reversed course less than a year into a seven-year agreement and ended the deal to return to Ticketmaster.\nNotably, the latest partnership follows Spotify’s announcement that it has helped artists generate over $1 billion in ticket sales by linking fans with live events through its ticketing partners. The company works with more than 45 ticketing partners, including Ticketmaster, AXS, Eventbrite, DICE, and Bandsintown. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSpotify previously experimented with direct ticket sales in 2022.\nThis also isn’t SeatGeek’s first time teaming up with a popular app. The company partnered with Snapchat in 2018, allowing users to buy tickets directly within the social app.\nSeparately, Spotify’s latest earnings call occurred last week, where the company reported having more than 750 million monthly users and 290 million paid subscribers. Spotify projects these numbers will rise to 759 million users and 293 million paid subscribers in the current quarter, highlighting its continued focus on profitability.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

At the time, the company was testing the robots at a facility in South Carolina and said it took Amazon significantly less time to develop Blue Jay — only about a year— than it did to develop its other warehouse robots, a speed the company credited to advancements in AI.\nAmazon spokesperson Terrence Clark told TechCrunch that Blue Jay was launched as a prototype — although that was not made clear in the company’s original press release.\nThe company plans to use Blue Jay’s core technology for other robotics “manipulation programs” with employees who worked on Blue Jay being moved to other projects.\n“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark told TechCrunch over email. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network.”\nAmazon also unveiled the Vulcan robot last year, which is used in the storage compartments of the company’s warehouses. Vulcan is a two-armed robot, with one arm meant to rearrange and move items in a compartment while the other is equipped with a camera and suction cups to grab goods. The Vulcan can allegedly “feel” the objects that it touches and was trained on data gathered from real-world interactions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAmazon has been developing its internal robotics program since 2012 when it purchased Kiva Systems, a robotics company whose warehouse automation technology formed the foundation of Amazon’s fulfillment operations.

    "body": "\nGoogle announced on Wednesday that it’s adding a music-generation feature to the Gemini app. The company is using DeepMind’s Lyria 3 music-generation model to power the feature, which is still in beta.\nTo use the feature, you’ll describe the song you want to create, and the app will generate a track along with lyrics. For instance, you could ask Gemini to create a “comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding its match,” and the app will generate a 30-second track along with cover art made by Nano Banana.\nGoogle said that you can even upload a photo or a video, and the AI-powered tool will create a song to match the mood of the media file.\n\nLoading the player…\n\nThe company said that Lyria 3 improves on the previous generation of models, creating more realistic and complex music tracks. Users can also change and control other elements like style, vocals, and tempo.\nAlong with rolling out Lyria 3 to the Gemini app, Google is making the model available to YouTube creators through the Dream Track feature on YouTube, a tool that helps creators make AI-generated tracks. The option was only available to YouTube creators in the U.S. until now. But with this release, Google is expanding Dream Track availability globally.\nGoogle said that you can’t mimic an artist outright, but if you add an artist’s name to your prompt, Gemini will create a track in a similar style or a mood. (It’s not clear if generation will make it easier for others to decode the music style of a particular artist.)\n“Music generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content,” the company said in a blog post.\nGoogle noted that all songs created with the Lyria 3 model will have a SynthID watermark to identify AI-generated content. The company said that it’s also adding capabilities to identify AI-generated music with SynthID within Gemini. Users will be able to upload tracks and ask Gemini if it is AI-generated.\nMusic generation is rolling out to all 18+ Gemini users across the world with support for English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.\nAI-generated music has created mixed sentiments among artists and listeners. On one hand, companies like YouTube and Spotify are adopting AI and signing contracts with music labels to monetize AI-generated music. On the other hand, AI model and tooling companies are facing lawsuits from the music industry over copyrights of the training material. Platforms like Deezer have published tools to mark AI-generated music to curb fraudulent streams of this kind of music.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs India pitches itself as a global hub for applied artificial intelligence, OpenAI has partnered with Pine Labs to integrate AI-driven reasoning into the fintech firm’s payments stack, automating settlement and invoicing workflows in a move the companies say could help accelerate AI-led commerce in India.\nThe partnership will see Pine Labs embed OpenAI’s application programming interfaces — software tools that let companies plug AI into their existing systems — within its payments and commerce infrastructure, the companies said on Thursday, all with the aim of enabling AI-assisted settlement, reconciliation, and invoicing workflows.\nThe deal underscores OpenAI’s broader push to expand its footprint in India, one of its fastest-growing markets, as it looks to move beyond being known primarily as the maker of ChatGPT and embed its technology into education, enterprise, and infrastructure. Earlier this week, OpenAI partnered with leading Indian engineering, medical, and design institutions to bring AI tools into higher education, betting that India’s large developer base and more than a billion internet users will play a central role in the next phase of AI adoption.\nPine Labs is already using AI internally to automate parts of its settlement and reconciliation process, cutting the time it takes to clear daily settlements from hours to minutes, according to Chief executive B Amrish Rau. The Noida-based company previously relied on manual checks by dozens of employees to process funds from multiple banks before markets opened each day, a workflow that is now largely handled by AI-driven systems, he said in an interview.\nFor Pine Labs, the partnership is intended to extend those AI-driven efficiencies beyond internal operations to merchants and corporate clients, starting with business-to-business use cases such as invoice processing, settlements and payments orchestration, Rau told TechCrunch. He noted the company sees faster adoption in B2B workflows, where AI agents can handle large volumes of repetitive financial tasks under predefined rules, before similar capabilities reach consumer-facing payments.\n“People talk about retail AI, but the bigger impact of all of this is really efficiency improvement, especially in B2B,” Rau said. “If you look at invoicing and settlement, those are workflows where agents can actually drive the process end to end, and that’s where adoption can happen faster.”\nThe rollout of more autonomous, agent-led payment workflows will move faster in overseas markets where regulations already allow such transactions, Rau said, while India is likely to see a more gradual adoption focused on AI-assisted commerce rather than fully agent-initiated payments. He said that Pine Labs is already prototyping agent-driven payments in parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, even as Indian regulations require tighter controls on how payments are authorized.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor OpenAI, the partnership offers a route deeper into India’s payments and enterprise ecosystem as it looks to move beyond consumer-facing tools and embed its models into high-volume, regulated workflows. Rau said the collaboration is aimed at increasing merchant stickiness and expanding Pine Labs’ role from a payments processor to a broader commerce platform, with higher transaction volumes over time translating into incremental revenue.\nPine Labs says it works with more than 980,000 merchants, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, and has processed over 6 billion cumulative transactions valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (about $126 billion), per its prospectus published last year. The fintech operates across 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, parts of Africa, the UAE, and the U.S., giving the OpenAI partnership reach across both Indian and international markets.\nRau said the partnership does not involve revenue sharing between the two companies, with Pine Labs not taking a cut if its merchants choose to embed OpenAI’s tools. “We’ve kept it completely independent of each other — anything related to payment and payment services, we will get the benefit of it, and anything related to OpenAI revenues will go to them,” he said.\nThe arrangement, Rau added, is also non-exclusive. He compared it to OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe in the U.S. and said Pine Labs remains open to working with other AI providers.\nRau said Pine Labs is building additional security and compliance layers around AI-driven workflows to ensure that sensitive merchant and consumer transaction data remains protected, as the company integrates AI more deeply into its payments systems. He said the focus is on ensuring transactions remain secure and compliant even as more workflows are automated by AI.\nPine Labs’ interest in AI-driven commerce builds on earlier work through its Setu unit, which has experimented with agent-led bill payment experiences using chatbots including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Separately, India also began piloting consumer payments directly through AI chatbots last year.\nThe new announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are showcasing their latest capabilities alongside Indian startups demonstrating AI applications aimed at large-scale deployment across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.\n",

    "body": "\nOpenAI has partnered with India’s Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI-ready data center capacity in the country, with plans to scale to 1 gigawatt. The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company’s enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets. \nOpenAI announced on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its Stargate project, which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services’ HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata’s workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI’s tools.\nThe partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company’s expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI’s most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.\nThe local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI’s access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.\nAn initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI’s long-term ambitions in India.\nBeyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata’s businesses. The conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. TCS also intends to use OpenAI’s Codex tools to standardize AI-native software development across its engineering teams.\nN Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said OpenAI’s partnership would help build “state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India” while supporting efforts to skill the country’s workforce for the AI era.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed, including whether OpenAI is making a capital investment in HyperVault or leasing capacity.\nIn November 2025, TCS secured backing from private equity firm TPG to develop AI-ready infrastructure in India under its HyperVault data center business. The platform is backed by about ₹180 billion (about $2 billion) in planned investment and is designed to support large-scale compute workloads for hyperscalers and enterprise customers.\nOpenAI will also expand its certification programs in India, with TCS becoming the first participating organization outside the United States. The certifications are designed to help professionals build practical AI skills across roles and industries, the company said. The move follows OpenAI’s recent partnerships with leading Indian institutions in engineering, medicine, and design.\nOpenAI plans to open new offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its existing presence in New Delhi as it deepens operations in the country. The expansion is expected to support enterprise partnerships, developer engagement, and local regulatory coordination as the company scales its footprint in India.\nThe announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI leaders, including Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are participating alongside Indian startups and enterprises showcasing AI applications across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.\nOpenAI has been expanding its presence in India through partnerships with companies including Pine Labs, JioHotstar, Eternal, Cars24, HCLTech, PhonePe, CRED, and MakeMyTrip, as it seeks to embed its models across consumer platforms, enterprise systems and digital payments infrastructure in one of the world’s largest internet markets.\nTogether, the data center build-out, enterprise deployments, and expanding partner ecosystem signal OpenAI’s most comprehensive push yet to anchor advanced AI infrastructure and applications in India.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMastodon, a decentralized, open source social media platform and alternative to larger apps like X and Threads, announced on Wednesday its plans to make its app more approachable for newcomers while also targeting creators with the launch of new features.\nThe changes follow the expansion of Mastodon’s core development team over the past 18 months to include people with experience across web and mobile and back end, as well as the hiring of a dedicated designer, according to a new blog post co-authored by Mastodon’s technical director, Renaud Chaput, and product designer, Imani Joy. The post outlines the app’s future direction.\nThe app, which is part of the fediverse — a larger, decentralized social web operating on the ActivityPub protocol — was thrust back into the spotlight when Elon Musk acquired Twitter, now called X, in October 2022. Since then, it has seen occasional growth spurts but has often struggled to retain new users due to its more complicated setup. On Mastodon, you don’t simply create an account with a username and password; you also have to pick a server to join — an additional step that often confuses those new to decentralization.\nToday, Mastodon sees somewhere between 750,000 and 1 million monthly active users, depending on the source. One third-party tracker puts the figure closer to 750,000, while another estimates as many as 1 million. Mastodon’s own site says the figure is around 785,000.\nAs part of its coming updates, the organization says it will try to make this onboarding process more understandable, while also promoting smaller servers.\nTo date, new users have often defaulted to picking the largest servers, but that undermines the power of a decentralized web. As the blog post notes, “Mastodon is best when communities are spread across many independent servers, each with its own character and focus.”\nNew admin tools will help indie server operators handle maintenance and moderation duties more easily, including a feature to use external blocklists. The organization will also offer ways to set up content scanning for detecting illegal content and spam, along with other tools to reduce media storage usage by serving remote media posts through a trusted third party.\nIn addition, Mastodon will look to bring on more content creators, including public figures, journalists, and institutions, with a series of updates to its app. To do so, it’s introducing a redesigned user profile that lets individuals showcase their work as well as an enhanced compose experience. Also in the works is a new email notification option that would allow someone to follow their updates, even if they don’t yet have a Mastodon account. That could appeal to those who want to follow newsletter writers, reporters, thought leaders, and other creators, while allowing those creators to reach a wider audience.\nThe changes follow the rollout of other new features in recent months, including Quote Posts, similar to the feature on X and others, but with more user controls, and plans for its own take on Starter Pack-style user recommendations, called Collections.\nThe updates follow a shift in leadership at Mastodon: founder Eugen Rochko stepped down as CEO after the platform announced its transition to a nonprofit structure at the beginning of the year. In his place, Austria-based Felix Hlatky has taken over as executive director. In addition, Mastodon recently announced it will split Hlatky’s duties with Dr. Marius Rothermund, a certified German lawyer. Dr. Rothermund will primarily provide legal expertise during the restructuring, which involves three markets — the U.S., Germany, and Belgium.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoogle on Wednesday introduced its latest entry-level Pixel smartphone. The $499 Pixel 10a launches with new AI software capabilities and minor hardware updates. The smartphone is available for preorder now with shipments starting March 5.  It comes in Lavender, Berry, Fog, and Obsidian.\nThe Pixel 10a features a completely flat back, which means the camera bar blends with the back of the phone and lies flat when you place it down on a surface.\nGoogle notes that the smartphone’s 6.3-inch Actua display is 11% brighter than the Pixel 9a. It also has faster charging than its predecessor, with more than 30 hours of battery life and up to 120 hours with the “Extreme Battery Saver” setting turned on.\nThe Pixel 10a comes with the same Tensor G4 chip that powered last year’s Pixel 9a. It features a 48 MP main camera, which Google says is the best camera on a phone under $500, along with a 13 MP ultrawide camera.\nImage Credits:Google\nAfter debuting a set of AI-powered camera features on the Pixel 10 series last summer, Google is now bringing them to the A-series phone. The “Auto Best Take” feature captures multiple frames in one shutter press and automatically selects the best version so everyone looks good in a group photo, while the “Camera Coach” feature gives users step-by-step guidance on lighting and composition.\nAdditionally, Google is bringing Satellite SOS to the A-series for the first time, allowing users to connect with emergency services even when they don’t have Wi-Fi or cellular service.\nAs with recent Pixel phones, the Pixel 10a will come with seven years of software and security updates.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s worth noting that the Pixel 10a doesn’t have the “PixelSnap” magnetic Qi charging feature on the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nThe smartphone’s arrival comes just ahead of Apple’s upcoming new entry-level phone, the iPhone 17e. The device is expected to cost $599, like last year’s iPhone 16e.\nGoogle also announced that it’s launching Pixel Buds 2a in two new colors, Berry and Fog, to go with the Pixel 10a.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOnly days after Spotify announced its foray into physical book sales, which included an audiobook feature that lets you sync your listening and your offline reading progress, Amazon-owned Audible has launched a feature that brings e-books together with audiobooks.\nThe company announced on Wednesday an “immersion reading” feature in the Audible app, which allows readers who have both the e-book and audiobook versions of a title in their Audible and Kindle libraries to read the e-book’s text while the audio plays. The feature also lets users switch between the different formats across devices. While in the “Read & Listen” mode, the text of the book is highlighted in real time in sync with the narration.\nThe Kindle app already offered a tool that would allow readers to move between the Audible version and the e-book, when both versions had been purchased. This feature is now coming to Audible’s app for the first time. Customers will need to own both versions of the book for this to work, but discounted audiobooks will be made available to customers who own the matching e-book, the company says.\nAt launch, hundreds of thousands of titles will be supported by the new “Read & Listen” feature, including those in English, German, Spanish, Italian, and French. Initially, the option will be offered in the U.S., with the U.K., Australia, and Germany gaining support over the next few months.\nTo discover eligible titles, Audible will automatically identify which Kindle e-books have audiobook matches within its app.\nOf course, many customers were already reading and listening to their books without buying two versions — by having Alexa narrate their e-books from their Kindle library. Alexa is not a professional narrator by any means, and the AI assistant’s more monotonous delivery can lead you to zone out. By offering a way to add on the audiobook for a lower price when you’ve already bought the e-book, Amazon hopes to boost book sales across formats.\nThe company also claims that the combination of reading and listening can improve focus and comprehension, according to industry research and its own internal data. In addition, customers who read and listen are the most engaged, consuming nearly twice as much content per month as audiobook-only customers, Audible noted. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe feature may make sense for students and those learning a new language, as well as those who are trying to get through more books quickly. It’s also useful for those who regularly switch back and forth between reading and listening, and those who want the experience of the narration — particularly if a book is read by a favorite voice actor. Plus, some may simply appreciate having a narrator introduce all the characters by name, so they can learn the pronunciation without having to guess (a particularly thorny issue in fantasy novels!).\n“Audiobooks count as reading,” said Andy Tsao, chief product officer at Audible, in a statement about the launch. “But now at Audible, you can read with your eyes too. Read & Listen gives book lovers the best of both worlds. Whether you’re learning a new language, studying for school, or lost in a story’s world, you no longer have to choose one format over the other.”\nAmazon notes that the new feature will not impact publishers’ royalty payments. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSnap’s direct revenue business has reached a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate, the company announced on Wednesday. Annualized revenue refers to a business’s current revenue rate projected over a full year. The social media giant says the milestone is driven by its Snapchat+ offering, which has now surpassed 25 million subscribers.\nLaunched in 2022, Snapchat+ gives subscribers access to exclusive and pre-release features for $3.99 per month. Following a successful launch, Snap introduced additional paid tiers beyond the core Snapchat+ subscription over the past year to further diversify its revenue streams.\n“Snapchat+ has become one of the fastest-growing consumer subscription services globally, with subscriber growth every quarter,” the company wrote in a blog post. “What started as an early-access program for our most engaged Snapchatters has quickly scaled into a meaningful business—one that now represents a strong and growing revenue stream alongside our ads business.”\nLast June, Snapchat launched Lens+, which gives users access to exclusive Lenses and AR experiences, along with the perks in the standard Snapchat+ tier, for $8.99 per month. \nIn early 2025, the company launched an ad-free Snapchat+ subscription tier called Platinum for $15.99 per month. And, in a controversial move in September, Snapchat announced plans to cap free storage for its Memories feature and launched a paid storage plan that costs $1.99 per month. Snapchat+ subscribers will get up to 250GB of storage as part of their monthly subscription, while Snapchat Platinum users will get 5TB.\nMoving beyond Snapchat+, the company announced yesterday that it’s launching creator subscriptions in alpha with select people in the U.S. Users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscriptions, which will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator’s public Stories, and an ad-free experience for that creator’s Stories.\nIn terms of the future, Snap says it’s going to continue to grow Snapchat+ with a focus on customization and community-driven features. \nSnap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, and rival Meta is following suit, as the company told TechCrunch last month that it was going to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nX recently introduced a new immersive video player, signaling another major step in its ongoing push into video-focused experiences. \nNikita Bier, X’s head of product, announced the update earlier this week, admitting the previous video player “badly needed a refresh.” The redesign aims to make video consumption more engaging and user-friendly, especially on mobile devices.\nImage Credits:@nikitabier on X\nThe update, currently rolling out to iOS, allows users to expand videos to full screen with a single tap. Once in full-screen mode, viewers can swipe up to scroll to the next video, which is reminiscent of TikTok’s popular format.\nWhile the new player aims to enhance mobile video viewing, some users argue that the update forces all videos into a cropped, full-screen view, removing the option to view content in its original aspect ratio.\n“This UI sucks so bad. Let me just watch full-scale videos,” one user said. \nWhen another user asked which orientation is preferred, Bier confirmed that portrait is ideal. This approach mirrors broader industry trends, with vertical videos dominating platforms such as TikTok and Instagram Reels. Even streaming services have adopted the format, with Disney+ being the most recent to introduce a vertical video feed. \n“Sorry, but cropping the video incentivized people to post square videos. We are a mobile company,” he said, noting that X will stop cropping vertical content moving forward. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBier hinted that more video-focused updates are on the horizon as X doubles down on its video ambitions.\nThe timing of X’s update is notable, given that last month TikTok’s U.S. operations were sold to an American investor group. X is positioning itself as a competitor, ramping up its video features to attract both viewers and creators. \nThe recent introduction of the video player follows X’s launch of a dedicated vertical video feed that became available globally last year. The company is also incorporating AI-driven tools, such as Grok’s text-to-video generation feature. \nNotably, Grok’s image-generation capability recently sparked controversy, leading to its restriction to paying subscribers on X, due to the tool allowing users to create sexualized and nude images of women and children.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nOne of the most consequential decisions early-stage founders have to make is who they will bring on as their founding team. The first five to 10 employees will have a massive impact on the company culture, and the precedents set with them are difficult to change down the road. That’s why this season on Build Mode, we’re diving into what it takes to build a world-class founding team.  \nTo kick off season two, Isabelle Johannessen is joined by Yuri Sagalov, managing director at General Catalyst and former founder, YC partner, and seed investor at Wayfinder Ventures. Sagalov has worked with hundreds of pre-seed and seed-stage companies and has seen firsthand the best (and worst) ways to hire in the early days.\nIn this episode, Sagalov offers his best pieces of advice for founders who are hiring their first team, strategically building their cap table, and forming compensation structures that can scale with the company.\nThe three types of investors (and which one to avoid) \nSagalov categorizes investors into three main buckets: the ones that are heavily involved and function as an extension of your team, the ones that will give you a check and then vanish, and the micromanagers. \nThe first type of investor is the most valuable according to Sagalov: “They’re going to help you with recruiting, hiring, go to market. And the most interesting thing with those investors is often it’s completely disconnected from the check size.”\nAlthough it may feel counterintuitive to turn down investments, working with VCs who will become overly involved in the process may cause more harm than good in the long run. Sagalov said, “The only bucket that I avoid is this third bucket of investors who give you money and they’re kind of in your kitchen, meddling. They have an opinion on everything. They get stressed out when things don’t go right.”\nIn a fundraise, everyone is putting their best foot forward, so Sagalov suggests reaching out to current portfolio companies before committing to an investor.  “The best thing you can do as a founder is actually talk to portfolio companies, talk to other founders that they’ve worked with, ask for concrete examples of how they’ve been helpful, if they’ve been helpful, and then actually ask how they were when things didn’t go right.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHow to split equity with a co-founder \nAs an investor, Sagalov looks for co-founders who have created an equity split that is fair but also hedges for future misalignments. He suggests creating a slight differentiation by plus or minus one share so there is a clear way to break deadlocks.  \nSagalov also reminds early-stage founders that these early decisions have staying power: “Oftentimes founders over-index on ‘I came up with the idea, so I deserve the lion’s share.’  Most of the journey of the company is ahead of them. You don’t want someone waking up five years from now feeling like they put in equal blood, sweat, and tears but own one-fifth of the equity.”\nTalk to early employees about risk and compensation \nThe first few hires should be all in on the startup’s mission. Oftentimes, joining an early-stage startup can be perceived as risky. Sagalov emphasized the importance of discussing the risks and potential benefits: “Fundamentally, what you’re looking for when you’re hiring the first few people are missionaries who, beyond even the compensation, want to join you for the mission of the business,” he said. “You want to be honest with them that there is a lot of risk on the journey.” \nNext week on Build Mode, we’re talking with Sarah Lucena, the founder and CEO of Mappa, who discusses how founders can take compatibility into account and hire the right fit for the team the first time, using their AI tool. \nIsabelle Johannessen is our host.

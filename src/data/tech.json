    "body": "\nYouTube Shorts viewers might soon see AI versions of their favorite creators when scrolling through their feeds. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced on Wednesday that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using their own likeness. \n“This year you’ll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,” Mohan wrote wrote in his annual letter. “Throughout this evolution, AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.”\nShorts, which Mohan said now averages 200 billion daily views, is one of YouTube’s most popular mediums. The company continues to invest in Shorts to sustain its viewership. While YouTube didn’t share additional details about these likenesses, the new capability will join the platform’s current AI tools for Shorts, including the ability to generate AI clips, AI stickers, AI auto-dubbing, and more. \nYouTube will also equip creators with new tools to manage the use of their likeness in AI-generated content, according to Mohan.\nWhile YouTube will allow creators to feature their own likeness in their videos, the Google-owned platform recently launched technology to prevent others from using it. Last October, YouTube rolled out likeness-detection technology to eligible creators to identify AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. Creators can then request the removal of AI-generated content.\nAs with other social platforms, YouTube has dealt with the spread of AI slop. Mohan says the company is working to maintain a high-quality viewing experience.\n“Over the past 20 years, we’ve learned not to impose any preconceived notions on the creator ecosystem,” Mohan wrote. “Today, once-odd trends like ASMR and watching other people play video games are mainstream hits. But with this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high quality viewing experience that people want. To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nYouTube is also set to expand Shorts with new formats, including image posts, which are already popular on TikTok and Instagram Reels.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nYouTube TV has been slowly expanding its multiview feature over the past few years, which initially allowed sports fans to watch up to four channels simultaneously on one screen. Soon, viewers will finally have the chance to watch any content they choose. \n​In his annual letter published on Wednesday, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan revealed that the platform will soon introduce a “fully customizable multiview” experience. This upgrade aims to provide greater personalization by letting viewers create their own multiview layouts, tailoring their screens to their individual interests across sports, news, entertainment, and more.\n​YouTube TV first rolled out the multiview feature for sports broadcasts in 2023, allowing fans to watch multiple games simultaneously. The feature later expanded to include other categories, such as news and weather, though it was initially restricted to a set list of preselected channels, including CNN, MSNBC, HGTV, and Food Network. Later on, YouTube TV began testing a way for a small group of users to customize which channels they wanted to watch side by side without restriction. \nThis new capability is expected to appeal to families and larger households with diverse viewing preferences, as it allows different genres to be watched together on a single screen.\n​To try out multiview, press the down button on your remote, then look for the Multiview icon or the “Watch Multiview” option, and select it. From there, you can pick up to three more live channels to add to your screen. \n​Additionally, Mohan highlighted YouTube TV’s upcoming launch of genre-specific channel packages, designed to give subscribers more flexibility over what content they pay for. For example, viewers can choose specialized packages focused on sports, news, family programming, or entertainment, tailoring their subscriptions to their interests and potentially saving on costs. \nHowever, YouTube TV hasn’t shared much about these packages, like how much they’ll cost or when they’ll launch. We can likely expect more information to be announced in the coming months as the platform prepares for rollout.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nDigital insurance company Lemonade is launching a product for users of Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system, known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised), which the insurer promises will cut per-mile rates by “approximately 50%.”\nIt’s one of the first products geared toward pricing insurance based on how software systems handle driving, and a sign that companies may look to create new lines of business as partial autonomy and true self-driving start to proliferate.\nLemonade said on Wednesday that it is leveraging “vehicle telemetry data that was previously unavailable” thanks to a “technical collaboration with Tesla,” though the insurance company declined to offer more specifics. Lemonade said it would train its own usage-based risk prediction models to determine when a driver is using Full Self-Driving or operating the vehicle themselves, and price accordingly.\nLemonade is calling the new product “Autonomous Car insurance.” Tesla’s software does not currently make cars completely autonomous, and drivers need to be ready to take over at any moment. But the product is clearly a bet that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will ultimately fulfill his long-delayed promise that his company will make that happen.\n“Traditional insurers treat a Tesla like any other car, and AI like any other driver. But a driver who can see 360 degrees, never gets drowsy, and reacts in milliseconds isn’t like any other driver,” Shai Wininger, co-founder and president of Lemonade, said in a statement. “Our existing pay-per-mile product has given us something no traditional insurer has: a unique tech stack designed to collect massive amounts of real driving data for precise, dynamic pricing.”\nThe new car insurance product will launch in Arizona on January 26, and in Oregon the following month. Lemonade claims that “the safer FSD software becomes, the more our prices will drop.” The company’s existing auto insurance offering is available for “most popular cars” in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.\nTesla has offered its own car insurance to customers for years now, though in late 2025 the company was hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance (CDI). The automaker was accused, along with partner State National Insurance Company, of “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims,” “unreasonable denials,” and engaging in “unfair claims settlement practices.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla has denied the allegations.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nDays ahead of a scheduled trial, social media company Snap has settled a lawsuit accusing the platform of causing social media addiction, according to reports from multiple outlets.\nAccording to the New York Times, the settlement was announced Tuesday in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles County. The lawsuit against Snap was brought by a 19-year-old known in court documents as K.G.M., accusing the social media app of designing algorithms and features that caused addiction and mental health issues.\nThe terms of the settlement were not disclosed.\nThe lawsuit also names other platforms, including Meta, YouTube, and TikTok. No settlement has been reached with these platforms. Notably, Snap is still a defendant in other similar social media addiction cases filed against it.\nAccording to documents unveiled in the ongoing cases, Snap employees raised concerns around risks to the mental health of teens dating back at least nine years. The company has said these examples were “cherry-picked” and were taken out of context.\nPlaintiffs in these cases are drawing parallels to Big Tobacco — referring to lawsuits in the 1990s against cigarette companies that concealed health risks — alleging that the platforms obscured information about potential harms from their users. They argue that features like infinite scroll, auto video play and algorithmic recommendations have tricked users into continuously using apps, leading to depression, eating disorders, and self-harm, according to NYT.\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel had been scheduled to testify in the trial, which would have marked the first time a social media company faces a jury in an addiction lawsuit — no platform has lost such a case at trial yet. The remaining case against Meta, TikTok, and YouTube is set to proceed with jury selection beginning next Monday, January 27, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expected to take the witness stand. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf plaintiffs prevail, legal experts predict the cases could result in multibillion-dollar settlements and potentially force platforms to redesign their products. But the companies have so far defended themselves in part by arguing that those same design choices — like algorithmic recommendations, push notifications, and infinite scroll — are similar to a newspaper deciding what stories to publish and are protected speech under the First Amendment.\nSnap did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI’s first sales leader, Aliisa Rosenthal, has found a new career: venture capital. She’s joining Acrew Capital as a general partner, working alongside founding partner Lauren Kolodny and the firm’s other partners, Rosenthal and Kolodny tell TechCrunch.\nRosenthal left OpenAI about eight months ago after a three-year sprint at the AI lab that saw the launch of DALL·E, ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, Sora, and other products. “I wasn’t initially looking to join a VC fund,” she told TechCrunch. “I was out there meeting with lots of AI startups.” \nBut after growing OpenAI’s enterprise sales team from two people to hundreds, she saw the appeal when Kolodny pitched her on venture capital. Instead of helping one startup with its go-to-market strategy, she could help a portfolio of them.\nIn her time at OpenAI, “I learned a lot about behavior, both on the side of the buyers, how people are thinking about these purchases, and the gap between what most organizations think is possible and what they can actually deploy today,” she said.\nFor instance, she has firsthand insight into what kind of moat an AI startup can build that won’t leave it vulnerable when model makers like OpenAI launching competing products.  \nWill OpenAI “just build everything and put every company out of business? You know, they are doing a lot already: they’re in consumer, they’re in enterprise, they’re building a device. I don’t think they are going to go after every potential enterprise application,” she says. \nSo one moat is for enterprise AI startups to offer specialization. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nContext as moat\nAdditionally, she thinks the key to a good startup moat will be “context” — or the information the AI stores in its context window memory as it works on requests.  \n“Context is dynamic. It’s adaptable. It’s scalable. And I think what we’re seeing is going beyond sort of the basic RAG towards this idea of a context graph, which is persistent,” she says referring to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) the de facto method as of 2025 to minimize hallucinations by training LLMs on trusted, specific sources (and having the LLM cite them). \nThere’s still a lot of tech that needs to be developed for this area, though, from memory to reasoning beyond pattern recognition. \n“I expect real innovation here. I think this year we will see new approaches — the idea of context and memory,” Rosenthal says. \nBut beyond startups working directly on context engineering, Rosenthal thinks enterprise apps that bake it in will have the advantage. \n“Ultimately, when we talk about moat, I think who owns and manages this context layer will become a large advantage for AI products,” she says. \nAnother opportunity she sees: startups not building atop a major lab’s state-of-the-art models, with their high prices.  \n“I think there is room in the market for cheaper models that are lighter weight and innovate on inference costs,” she says. These are models that are not, perhaps, at the top of the leaderboards of various benchmarks but “are still very useful” and more affordable. \n“Where I’m really excited to invest is on the application layer. I’m really interested in what will be the durable applications built on all of these different models, not just on the foundational models,” she says. She’s seeking startups with “interesting use cases” or that use AI to help enterprise employees work more efficiently.  \nAs for where she’s going to find these startups, she’ll be working her network among OpenAI’s alums for starters. Now that the AI outfit is 10 years old, the alums network has grown. Many have already founded startups that have raised big bucks at high valuations, ranging from OpenAI’s biggest competitor, Anthropic, to buzzy early-stage companies like Safe Superintelligence.\nThere is also a growing precedent for high-level ex-OpenAI folks to become seed-stage investors. About a year ago, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s former head of consumer products joined Felicis. He’s been crushing it ever since, and clearly having fun, getting in on big deals for hot startups like LMArena and Periodic Labs.  \n“I actually had a call with Peter a few months ago, and he helped me make the decision,” Rosenthal said of her choice to become an investor. \nBut Rosenthal may have a secret weapon to win deals. She also has deep contacts among AI enterprise users – the type of buyers and beta testers these early AI startups need. \nEnterprises still don’t understand how much AI can do for them. “There’s a really large gap that I am very optimistic can be filled. It leaves a huge green field for applications and companies.”\n",

    "body": "\nAdobe has been aggressively adding AI features to all its products in the last few years. The company is now adding more AI tools to Acrobat, including the ability to generate podcast summaries of files, create presentations, and a way for users to edit files using prompts.\nThe company launched Adobe Spaces last year, which is a collection of files and notes that multiple users can access. Now, Adobe is allowing users to use the information stored in these files and notes to create a presentation using text prompts. \nFor instance, if a user has financial details, product plans, and competitor analysis available in a Space, they can build a pitch deck for clients that focuses on why their product can solve problems better than rivals.\nAcrobat’s AI assistant first generates an editable presentation with points that the deck would cover. You can then use Adobe Express’s theme library, stock photos, or use your own images to build the presentation. Plus, you can easily apply your brand’s theme or edit individual slides using Express.\nImage Credits: Adobe\nTools like Canva and NotebookLM already offer the ability to convert documents into presentations. Besides, newer startups are also working on letting people use AI to create presentations by tapping different sources.\nAdobe is also letting users create a podcast to summarize a file or a Space within Acrobat. Notably, tools like Google’s NotebookLM, Speechify, and ElevenLabs’ Reader app also let users create personalized podcasts using various notes and documents.\nAcrobat is also getting the ability to let users edit files using prompts.

    "body": "\nDeepinder Goyal, the co-founder and CEO of food delivery service Zomato and its parent Eternal, is stepping down from his role and handing the top job to Albinder Dhindsa, the CEO of its quick-commerce division Blinkit.\nGoyal on Wednesday said he would remain on Eternal’s board as vice chairman as he shifts focus to “higher-risk exploration and experimentation,” which he says may be harder to pursue within the constraints of a listed company.\n“This is a change in title, not in commitment toward outcomes,” Goyal said in a letter to Eternal’s shareholders. “Eternal remains my life’s work.”\nGoyal co-founded Zomato with Pankaj Chaddah in 2008 as a restaurant discovery and reviews platform called FoodieBay while both were working at Bain & Company. In 2009, they quit to focus on the business full-time, and rebranded it as Zomato in 2010 amid a naming conflict with eBay, before expanding into food delivery in 2015. \nChaddah left the company in 2018, and Zomato later consolidated its position by acquiring Uber Eats’ India business in 2020, and Blinkit (formerly Grofers) for $568 million in 2022.\nThe leadership change comes as Eternal reported (PDF) strong momentum in its third quarter, with profit rising about 73% to ₹1.02 billion (around $11.13 million) from a year earlier, on adjusted revenue ₹166.92 billion (about $1.8 billion), up 190% from a year ago. \nBlinkit remained the company’s fastest-growing business, with net order value jumping 121% to ₹133.0 billion (roughly $1.45 billion) in the last quarter.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOutside Eternal, Goyal has been working on other projects for the last few months, including a longevity-focused initiative called Continue Research, and an experimental brain-health wearable dubbed “Temple”. He is a co-founder of the aviation startup LAT Aerospace, and also is an angel investor.\nThe handover could be an indicator of Blinkit’s rising influence inside Eternal, as the company’s growth skews toward quick commerce and away from its mainstay, food delivery. \nQuick commerce in India is booming even as the sector faces rising scrutiny over working conditions for the thousands of gig workers employed in the industry. The country’s labour ministry recently asked platforms to drop their “10-minute delivery” marketing, and put in place measures to improve conditions for their delivery personnel.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

While the company is tight-lipped about the upcoming product, its OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane said in an Axios-hosted panel at Davos the AI startup is on track to announce its first hardware device in the second half of this year.\nLast November, Altman described the potential device to be more “peaceful and calm” than iPhones. Previous reporting suggests the company wants to build a screen-free and pocketable device.\nWhile the company is not spilling any details, more recent reporting from Asian publications and leakers suggests OpenAI’s first device could be a pair of earbuds. According to reports, this device is codenamed “Sweet Pea” and will have a unique design as compared to existing earbuds. The earbuds could work on a custom 2-nanometer processor and handle AI tasks locally instead of sending requests to the cloud.\nA separate report from a large Taiwanese newspaper noted that OpenAI was exploring a partnership with China-based Luxshare for manufacturing, but might eventually lean in favor of Taiwan’s Foxconn. The report also said in the first year of sales, OpenAI aims to ship 40 to 50 million units.\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT has nearly a billion weekly users, but the company has to rely on other devices and platforms for distribution. With its own device, it might want to take more control of the development and distribution of the AI assistant and also release exclusive and purpose-built features.\nHowever, replacing existing earbuds like AirPods in users’ daily lives is going to be challenging if there’s not a strong integration with operating systems.\nUntil now, there hasn’t been a standout AI device success story. Last year, Humane Pin got sold to HP. Rabbit is still just chugging along after the initial hype of 2024. And the Friend AI companion necklace received a swift backlash for its marketing tactics. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, big tech companies are making moves into wearables.

    "body": "\nThe ground beneath our feet holds so much energy that experts at the Department of Energy think geothermal power could generate 60 gigawatts — or nearly 10% of U.S. electricity — by 2050. \nZanskar co-founder and CEO Carl Hoiland thinks that lofty number is too low, mostly because it’s discounting conventional geothermal’s potential.\nThe DOE’s figures assume advances in enhanced geothermal, which uses fracking techniques to access hot rock deep underground. Companies like Fervo and Sage Geosystems have been pursuing that angle, and experts agree it has tremendous potential. By contrast, conventional geothermal, which taps naturally fractured hotspots, has been stagnant, generating just 4 gigawatts in the United States, up only about a gigawatt in the last decade or so.\nConventional geothermal has been held back by outdated assumptions, Hoiland told TechCrunch.\n“They underestimated how many undiscovered systems there are, maybe by an order of magnitude or more,” Hoiland said. With modern drilling techniques, “you can get a lot more out of each of them, maybe even an order of magnitude or more from each of those. All of a sudden the number goes from tens of gigawatts to what could be a terawatt-scale opportunity.”\nZanskar is relying on AI to help break conventional geothermal out of its malaise. In the process, the startup has resuscitated a flagging power plant in New Mexico and discovered two new sites with over 100 megawatts of combined potential.\nThose successes have helped Zanskar land a $115 million Series C led by Spring Lane Capital with participation from the All Aboard Fund, Carica Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Imperative Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Munich Re Ventures, Obvious Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, StepStone Group, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Tranquillion, Union Square Ventures, University Growth Fund, and UP.Partners.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMany potential geothermal sites have been overlooked because people have been looking for evidence on the surface like a hot spring or a volcano, Hoiland said. But about 95% of all geothermal systems lack such a tell, he added. “We just keep finding them by accident. That is a great application for AI.”\nTo find new geothermal resources, Zanskar first feeds supervised machine learning models a range of data, including past accidental discoveries. When they have identified a promising site, the company sends a team to the site validate the discovery.\nZanskar then has to come up with a plan to develop it. For that, the team uses another AI approach, one developed for this very purpose called Bayesian evidential learning (BEL). In BEL, existing data helps build a series of assumptions known as priors, and then models work to falsify those hypotheses, spitting out probabilities for each. Where there are gaps, the startup has built a geothermal simulator to fill in the blanks.\nSo far, Zanskar’s approach has been working. The previous funding round allowed the startup to explore three sites, each of which it considered a success. “Three of three,” said Zanskar co-founder and CTO Joel Edwards. “What does it look like when you try 10?”\nThe company has enough sites in the pipeline to support at least a gigawatt of generating capacity, Hoiland said. For now, they’ve been focused on the U.S. West, which has the most potential. He would like to find at least 10 confirmed sites to help Zanskar court project finance investors, which provide access to lower cost capital than VCs. If the company can make that work, then it might get through the valley of death that has claimed many other climate tech startups.\nHoiland is not convinced that Zanskar has solved all the challenges associated with finding geothermal resources, but he’s optimistic the company is on the right path.\n“We now know this is the future of exploration,” he said. “This is going to change geothermal in very short order.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nI have long dreamed of a better world: one where I would unlock my phone to find a notification that my grandma has challenged me to a game of Scrabble. I would play my word. She would play hers. We would play back and forth over a few days, and the entire time, neither of us would have to see any overwhelming technicolor ads with deceptive skip buttons that blast us with even more pop-ups. It’s a simple life.\nYou would think such an app already existed. You would be wrong. Until now. (Zynga, I will never forgive you for what you’ve done to Words with Friends).\nAt last, New York Times Games has brought my humble dreams to life with a Scrabble-like multiplayer app called Crossplay, available now on iOS and Android. \nCrossplay is not a Scrabble clone exactly, but unless you are the type of Scrabble lover that goes to tournaments or memorizes the Scrabble dictionary, it’s basically Scrabble. The game board and tile distribution are a bit different, and there’s a slight rule change around what happens once the bag runs out of tiles. Those differences may have been done for legal reasons. As a casual player, I barely noticed them.\nLike other social word games, Crossplay allows you to invite friends to play, or you can get matched with strangers near your skill level. For New York Times Games subscribers, the game will have no ads at all, but free users might see some banner ads. Still, it beats paying $10 a month to remove ads from Words With Friends, yet still have to deal with a cartoon-like interface among other features that annoy me.\nBehold: one game that looks normal, and one that looks like Cocomelon for adults.Image Credits:Crossplay (left), Words With Friends (right)\nWhile Scrabble purists may quibble about the slight rule changes, they may find delight in a feature of the game called CrossBot. Like the WordleBot and ConnectionsBot, CrossBot analyzes each move of your game to determine where you may have made a better move. It ranks your gameplay in terms of both luck and strategy, then highlights both your best moves, and those where you faltered.\nThe New York Times has been publishing its Crossword puzzle since 1942, but its digital gaming business kicked into high gear in 2022 when it bought Wordle after it went viral. According to data from ValueAct Capital, a hedge fund that invests in the Times, users spent more time in the Games app than the actual News app by the end of 2023.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nI’m not the only one who was craving a multi-player word game without egregious distractions — Jonathan Knight, Head of Games at the New York Times, thinks this is what makes its Games vertical so successful.\n“Games like Spelling Bee and Wordle found a way to take the magical ‘solve a puzzle’ feeling and create a very mainstream, quick, snackable version of that that works well on your phone, that’s very sharable with friends and family, and that I think is very respectful of your time,” Knight told TechCrunch. “You can just decide to do it in the morning, or at night before you go to bed, and then go to bed.”\nAccording to the New York Times, Wordle was played 4.2 billion times in 2025. Connections was played 1.6 billion times.\nWhen TechCrunch spoke to Wordle creator Josh Wardle shortly before he sold his game, he shared a mindset similar to Knight’s. He told us, “people have an appetite for things that transparently don’t want anything from you.”\nSure, a publicly traded company like the New York Times isn’t as pure of heart as an indie developer making a game for his partner, but the spirit of the game has persisted. Even as Wordle’s viral moment passed, people kept up with their daily habit, according to Knight.\n“The share rate on Wordle — the percentage of users that share every day — has not changed since we acquired the game,” he said. “It’s a really cool way to bring people together. You know, we see the Pope talking about his Wordle, sharing with his brother.”\nNow, Knight’s team wants to extend the quiet simplicity of its games philosophy to Crossplay.\n“We wanted people to be able to just get in and play the game with friends and family, and then get on with your day,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nLanguage learning marketplace Preply is now valued at $1.2 billion after raising a $150 million Series D round that marks a new chapter for the 14-year-old company, whose previous backers include Horizon Capital, Hoxton Ventures, Owl Ventures and Techstars Berlin.\nWhile Preply has been connecting language learners with tutors since 2013, it has now been EBITDA profitable for twelve months. Not coincidentally, it has also ramped up AI integration to support its 100,000 tutors and continue scaling.\nThat’s a fine line — Duolingo faced backlash after declaring it would become an “AI-first company,” and tutors have been a key differentiator for Preply. The company is adamant it won’t replace them — but AI can also bring consistency to a model that relies on self-employed instructors. The future of learning “is going to be human-guided and amplified by AI,” Preply CEO Kirill Bigai told TechCrunch.\nAccording to Bigai, Preply already applies AI to features such as lesson summaries and homework, but also to match learners to tutors that best fit their needs. To further develop these capabilities, he said Preply is now hiring AI talent across its four offices — Barcelona, London and New York but also Kyiv, which the company hasn’t left despite the Russian invasion.\nAlthough Preply is headquartered in the U.S., where it got its first start, Bigai and his cofounders are Ukrainian and the company has been very actively supporting their home country. They have been doing that in several ways since the war started, including as an employer. “We are very committed [to the] Ukrainian office,” said Bigai.\nOut of Preply’s 750 employees, approximately 150 people work from Kyiv, despite Russian strikes regularly forcing them into shelters and causing power outages that have made the current freezing winter particularly challenging. “Our office has different generators so we have electricity, Internet, and the office is warm and it’s open 24/7 so any Ukrainian team member can come to the office at any time,” Bigai said.\nThese employees may be grateful to Preply — but Bigai is grateful to them and has deep admiration for his people. “Ukrainians are going through very challenging times, and it builds a significant resilience and creativity,” he said. Having to adapt to the reality and uncertainty of war also transformed Preply. “I think the fact that the company went through this experience — and how so many people helped other people — made us stronger, more resilient, more creative,” he added. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWith its new funding, the edtech company has now joined the growing cohort of unicorns with Ukrainian roots, including Fintech-IT Group and Grammarly. But it may also follow in the footsteps of Airbnb, whose former CFO Laurence Tosi led the Series D through his growth equity firm, WestCap. While Bigai said Preply has no timeline or concrete IPO plans yet, he noted WestCap’s “phenomenal experience in [taking] companies public, which is one of the things that we will continue to think about.”\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nAs YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram continue to dominate mobile viewing, Netflix is rethinking how its app fits into a social-first video landscape. During its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the company announced plans to revamp its mobile app and expand its short-form video feature, which it mentions could help promote the new slate of original video podcasts it unveiled last week.\nSet to launch later in 2026, Netflix’s redesigned mobile app is intended to “better serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come,” according to co-CEO Greg Peters. The update will act as a foundation for ongoing experimentation, allowing the company to “iterate, test, evolve, and improve” its offering over time.\nAt the center of the redesign is deeper integration of vertical video feeds, which the streaming giant has been experimenting with since May. The feed displays short clips from Netflix shows and movies in a format familiar to TikTok and Instagram Reels users. \n“You can imagine us bringing more clips based on new content types, like video podcasts,” Peters remarked during the earnings call, further signaling that Netflix sees swipeable short-form clips as a powerful tool for capturing attention and increasing time spent in the app.\nNetflix is also making a significant push into video podcasts — a sector where YouTube has long been the leader. This week, Netflix debuted its first original video podcasts, including shows hosted by high-profile personalities such as Pete Davidson and Michael Irvin. The company has also partnered with major podcast players to bring established video podcast libraries to the platform, including tie-ups with Spotify and iHeartMedia.\nBoth of these moves signal a broader effort to make content discovery and daily engagement on Netflix feel more like a social platform experience. At the same time, Netflix has been careful to position its strategy as experimentation rather than imitation. Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference, CTO Elizabeth Stone emphasized that the company isn’t trying to become TikTok, but rather to strengthen its entertainment discovery capabilities through mobile-first features.\nDuring the earnings call, co-CEO Ted Sarandos reflected on the wider shift in the streaming industry: services are no longer competing only with one another, but with the entire entertainment industry. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“There’s never been more competition for creators, for consumer attention, for advertising and subscription dollars, the competitive lines around TV consumption are already blurring,” Sarandos said. “TV is not what we grew up on. TV is now just about everything. The Oscars and the NFL are on YouTube…Apple’s competing for Emmys and Oscars, and Instagram is coming next.”\nSarandos also commented on Netflix’s evolving film strategy, referencing the company’s recent shift in its theatrical release strategy as it prepares to acquire Warner Bros. This signals an openness to hybrid distribution models, as the line between cinema, streaming, and social content continues to blur.\nIn 2025, Netflix delivered $45.2 billion in revenue, with ad revenue rising to over $1.5 billion. Additionally, Netflix crossed the 325 million paid subscriptions milestone in the fourth quarter. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nIndustry reports and the growth of voice model companies in the Indian market suggest that there is a growing demand for voice AI solutions in the country. Voice is a popular medium for communication among people and businesses in India. That’s why enterprises and startups are eager to use voice AI to be more efficient at customer support, sales, customer acquisition, hiring, and training.\nBut recognizing market demand is one thing — proving businesses will pay is another. Y Combinator rejected the application from Bolna, a voice orchestration startup built by Maitreya Wagh and Prateek Sachan, five times before finally accepting it into the fall 2025 batch, skeptical that the founders could turn interest into revenue.\n“When we were applying for Y Combinator, the feedback we got was, ‘great to see that you have a product that can create realistic voice agents, but Indian enterprises are not going to pay, and you are not going to make money out of this,’” Wagh told TechCrunch.\nThe startup applied with the same idea for the fall batch but was able to show it had revenue of more than $25,000 coming in every month for the last few months. At that time, the company was running $100 pilots to help users build voice agents. Now the startup is pricing those pilots at $500.\nThe momentum has continued. The startup said on Tuesday that it has raised a $6.3 million seed round led by General Catalyst, with participation from Y Combinator, Blume Ventures, Orange Collective, Pioneer Fund, Transpose Capital, and Eight Capital. The round also includes individual investors, including Aarthi Ramamurthy, Arpan Sheth, Sriwatsan Krishnan, Ravi Iyer, and Taro Fukuyama.\nThe product and customers\nBolna is building an orchestration layer — essentially a platform that connects and manages different AI voice technologies — akin to startups like Vapi, LiveKit, and VoiceRun, to suit the idiosyncrasies of interactions in India, including noise cancellation, getting verification on the caller ID platform Truecaller, and handling mixed languages.\nFeature-wise, the company has built specific nuances for Indian users, such as speaking numbers in English regardless of the core language, or allowing for keypad input for longer inputs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Bolna\nWagh noted that the key differentiation of Bolna is that it makes it easy for users to build voice agents by just describing them, even if they don’t know much about the underlying technology, and start using them for calls. The company said that 75% of its revenue is coming from self-serve customers.\nHe also said that because Bolna is an orchestration layer, it doesn’t depend on a single model, so enterprises can easily switch when there is a better model available.\n“Our platform allows customers to switch models easily or even use different models for different locales to get the best out of them. An orchestration layer is necessary for enterprises to ensure they are getting the best models because one model can be better today and another one can be better tomorrow,” Wagh said.\nThe company has a range of clients, including car reselling platform Spinny, on-demand house-help startup Snabbit, beverage companies, and dating apps. Most of these are small to midsize businesses that use Bolna’s self-serve platform.\nSeparately, Bolna is pursuing large enterprise deals. For these large enterprises and custom implementations, Bolna has a team of forward-deployed engineers — specialists who work directly with clients on-site or closely with their teams. The startup has signed two large enterprises as paying customers and has four more in the pilot stage. Currently, Bolna employs nine forward-deployed engineers and is adding two to three people to that team every month to support this enterprise push.\nBolna has seen steady growth in both call volumes and revenue. It say it’s now handling over 200,000 calls per day and on the verge of crossing $700,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company noted that while 60% to 70% of call volume is in English or Hindi, other regional languages are steadily rising.\nAkarsh Shrivastava, who is part of the investment team at General Catalyst, said that the firm found Bolna impressive because its orchestration layer is flexible for various kinds of customers.\n“Bolna allows you the freedom to choose any model and has a stack behind it to mold it according to your requirement. It’s a good option for people who want to own some part of the stack, want flexibility in model picking, and want to be able to maintain those products themselves,” Shrivastava told TechCrunch over a call.\n",

    "body": "\nLast week, after reversing an earlier ban, the U.S. administration officially approved the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips, along with a chip line by AMD, to approved Chinese customers. Maybe they aren’t these chipmakers’ shiniest, most advanced chips, but they’re high-performance processors used for AI, making the export controversial. And at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei unloaded on both the administration and the chip companies over the decision.\nThe criticism was particularly notable because one of those chipmakers, Nvidia, is a major partner and investor in Anthropic.\n“The CEOs of these companies say, ‘It’s the embargo on chips that’s holding us back,’” Amodei  said, incredulous, in response to a question about the new rules. The decision is going to come back to bite the U.S., he warned.\n“We are many years ahead of China in terms of our ability to make chips,” he told Bloomberg’s editor-in-chief, who was interviewing him. “So I think it would be a big mistake to ship these chips.” Amodei then painted an alarming picture of what’s at stake. He talked about the “incredible national security implications” of AI models that represent “essentially cognition, that are essentially intelligence.” He likened future AI to a “country of geniuses in a data center,” saying to imagine “100 million people smarter than any Nobel Prize winner,” all under the control of one country or another.\nThe image underscored why he thinks chip exports matter so much. But then came the biggest blow. “I think this is crazy,” Amodei said of the administration’s latest move. “It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”\nThat sound you hear? The team at Nvidia, screaming into their phones.\nNvidia isn’t just another chip company. While Anthropic runs on the servers of Microsoft and Amazon and Google, Nvidia alone supplies the GPUs that power Anthropic’s AI models (every cloud provider needs Nvidia’s GPUs). Not only does Nvidia sit at the center of everything, but it also recently announced it was investing in Anthropic to the tune of up to $10 billion.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nJust two months ago, the companies announced that financial relationship, along with a “deep technology partnership” with cheery promises to optimize each other’s technology. Fast-forward to Davos, and Amodei is comparing his partner to an arms dealer.\nMaybe it was just an unguarded moment — it’s possible he got swept up in his own rhetoric and blurted out the analogy. But given Anthropic’s strong position in the AI market, it seems more likely he felt comfortable speaking with confidence. The company has raised billions, is valued in the hundreds of billions, and its Claude coding assistant has developed a reputation as a highly beloved and top-tier AI coding tool, particularly among developers working on complex, real-world projects.\nIt’s also entirely possible that Anthropic genuinely fears Chinese AI labs and wants Washington to act. If you want to get someone’s attention, nuclear proliferation comparisons are probably a pretty effective way to do it.\nBut what’s perhaps most remarkable is that Amodei could sit onstage at Davos, drop a bomb like that, and walk away to some other gathering without fear that he just adversely impacted his business. News cycles move on, sure. Anthropic is also on solid footing right now. But it does feel that the AI race has grown so existential in the minds of its leaders that the usual constraints — investor relations, strategic partnerships, diplomatic niceties — don’t apply anymore. Amodei isn’t concerned about what he can and can’t say. More than anything else he said on that stage, that fearlessness is worth paying attention to.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nAmagi Media Labs, a Bengaluru-headquartered company that sells cloud software used to run and monetize TV and streaming channels, saw its shares slide in its India market debut after raising ₹17.89 billion (about $196 million) in an IPO — a deal that stands out in a market still dominated by consumer companies going public. \nShares opened at ₹318 on Wednesday, a 12% discount to the ₹361 issue price, before climbing to ₹356.95 and later trading around ₹348.85, valuing Amagi at ₹75.44 billion (around $825.81 million), according to the National Stock Exchange. Amagi was last valued at $1.4 billion in a private funding round in November 2022, after a $100 million raise led by General Atlantic, and investors sought to buy more than 30 times the available shares.\nThe Bengaluru-headquartered company sells cloud software that helps TV networks and streaming services distribute and monetize video, and earns almost all of its revenue outside India — including around 73% from the U.S. and about 20% from Europe — CEO and co-founder Baskar Subramanian said in an interview, making it a rare export-first technology listing on Indian exchanges.\nThe $196 million IPO included a fresh issue of shares worth ₹8.16 billion (about $89.33 million), while existing investors sold about 26.9 million shares through an offer-for-sale. The deal was smaller than Amagi’s earlier plan, after the company trimmed the fresh issue and reduced the number of shares to be sold by existing backers from 34.2 million.\nNorwest Venture Partners, Accel, and Premji Invest were among Amagi’s existing shareholders who sold shares in the IPO. Subramanian told TechCrunch the sales were only a “very small portion” of holdings, and said the company’s founders were not selling a single share.\n“For us as an event, it’s a pit stop in a long journey,” he said.\nAccel has particularly retained close to a 10% stake in Amagi after the IPO, even as the listing locks in a roughly 3.3x gain on shares it acquired at around ₹108 per share. “To make the IPO, we are reluctantly exiting as little as possible to make this happen,” said Shekhar Kirani, an Accel partner.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFounded in 2008 by Subramanian, Srividhya Srinivasan, and Arunachalam Srinivasan Karapattu, Amagi counts content companies such as Lionsgate Studios, Fox, and Sinclair Broadcast Group among its clients, as well as distributors including Roku, Vizio, Rakuten TV, and DirecTV, and advertising platforms such as The Trade Desk and Index Exchange.\nSubramanian said Amagi is riding a shift as broadcasters and streamers move away from “big iron” hardware and satellite-based workflows toward cloud-based operations, arguing that only a small portion of the industry has completed the transition so far. The company has also begun pitching new automation and AI-driven tools to help media companies cut labor-heavy operating costs, he said.\nThe company’s revenue from operations rose 34.6% year-over-year to ₹7.05 billion (around $77.18 million) in the six months ended September 30, 2025, while net revenue retention was about 127% — meaning existing customers increased their spending by 27%, per its prospectus (PDF).\nAmagi is betting that broadcast and live video are still in the early stages of moving to the cloud, Subramanian told TechCrunch, estimating that less than 10% of the industry has made the shift, leaving a long runway as media groups modernise infrastructure and expand ad-supported streaming.\nThe company’s appeal lies in being a “premium” and highly reliable platform for blue-chip customers, said Rachit Parekh, a partner at Accel, arguing that downtime during major live events can be highly costly for broadcasters and streamers. This dynamic has helped drive high customer retention and expansion.\nNonetheless, Amagi is also competing against legacy broadcast vendors that are racing to modernize their own offerings for the cloud, while its push into AI-driven automation will test whether Amagi can expand beyond infrastructure into software with better profit margins without rising cloud costs eating into profitability.\nAmagi said it plans to plow most of the fresh proceeds into technology and cloud infrastructure, allocating ₹5.50 billion ($60.21 million) for that purpose, while also setting aside funds for potential acquisitions and general corporate use, per its prospectus.\nAmagi’s debut comes as India’s IPO market has drawn a rising number of technology-led listings, supported by strong domestic investor demand even as late-stage startup funding remains subdued. The shift has positioned public markets as both a growth-financing option and a path to exits for early backers, a dynamic that has become more visible as private capital has turned more selective.\nIndia’s tech sector recorded 42 IPOs in 2025, up from 36 in 2024, per market intelligence firm Tracxn. Several venture-backed startups, including consumer and fintech firms, are also widely expected to test public markets in 2026 as the pipeline builds.\n",

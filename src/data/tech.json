And how many of them were just using AI as an excuse to cover other problems?\nThat’s the question posed by a New York Times article on the trend of “AI-washing,” where companies will cite AI as the reason for layoffs that might actually be caused by other factors, like over-hiring during the pandemic.\nAI was the stated reason for more than 50,000 layoffs in 2025, with Amazon and Pinterest among the tech companies that blamed the technology for recent cuts.\nBut a Forrester report published in January argued, “Many companies announcing A.I.-related layoffs do not have mature, vetted A.I. applications ready to fill those roles, highlighting a trend of ‘A.I.-washing’ — attributing financially motivated cuts to future A.I. implementation.”\nMolly Kinder, a senior research fellow at the Brookings Institute, noted that saying layoffs were caused by AI is a “very investor-friendly message,” especially when the alternative might mean admitting, “The business is ailing.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

    "body": "\nSocial network UpScrolled, which gained prominence after TikTok’s ownership change in the U.S. in January, has zoomed past 2.5 million users, the company’s founder Issam Hijazi said during Web Summit Qatar.\n“We launched about six months ago, and we grew to about 150,000 up until early January. And as of the last few days, we reached over one million users globally. Now, starting today, we surpassed two-and-a-half million users globally,” Hijazi said.\nUpScrolled is a blend of Instagram and X, and claims to be inclusive of all voices. The company says that it allows for all kinds of content and doesn’t shadowban or censor people.\nDuring his speech, Hijazi called out big tech companies for being unethical and selling user data for profit, and accused social networks of suppressing pro-Palestinian content and choosing to censor users selectively.\n“They don’t care about selling your data to someone else if that means profit for them. And they don’t care about your mental health, as in they will design something just to keep you addicted to using that platform as long as it’s profitable for them,” he said.\nUsers on other platforms have complained about UpScrolled hosting a lot of porn and nudity. Hijazi noted that while the company won’t rely on amplification algorithms to boost or suppress certain views, it would have community guidelines in place to comply with laws in different regions. The company is gathering a team of experts to solidify its community guidelines and is also taking user feedback into account, he added.\nThe company hasn’t announced any funding publicly, but Hijazi said that the social network has been getting investor interest. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn January, TikTok switched to a new ownership structure in the U.S. with a consortium consisting of investors like Silver Lake and Oracle taking a majority share of the company, while ByteDance retained 20% ownership. That change led to many users exploring other social networks. Apart from UpScrolled, AT Protocol-based Skylight also gained attention, crossing 380,000 users in the days following the finalization of the TikTok deal.\nWhile these social networks might have benefited from a short-term boost following organizational changes at TikTok, they will have to build features and a community to retain users. They will also have to form moderation policies and take content decisions that might not be popular with their user base, as Bluesky has discovered over the last few years.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

This initiative could deliver significant cost savings for customers and may increase Grubhub’s appeal in a fiercely competitive market.\nThe new Super Bowl advertisement stars actor George Clooney at an extravagant dinner party. As the host dramatically asks, “Who will eat the fees?” Clooney responds, “Grubhub will eat the fees.”\n\n​Grubhub says this is a permanent offering aimed at putting more money back in customers’ pockets amid challenging economic times. The company notes that delivery and service fees on orders over $50 usually average about $13 per transaction across food delivery apps.\n​Grubhub’s move to permanently eliminate fees on all orders over $50 stands out as a unique offer in the food delivery space. Neither DoorDash nor Uber Eats offers a permanent waiver of delivery and service fees on large orders. Their promotions are typically limited-time offers or tied to paid subscription services (such as DashPass or Uber One), which often apply only to select restaurants or are subject to other restrictions.\nAdditionally, this new offering comes as Grubhub faces challenges in user growth and trails behind its competitors. The delivery company, which was acquired by Marc Lore’s Wonder Group in 2024, saw its monthly active users decline by 20% year-over-year in 2025, to 8 million, according to marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower. DoorDash boasts nearly 50 million monthly active users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n​In addition to its new fee policy, Grubhub recently acquired Claim, a startup providing cash-back rewards at local restaurants, which customers can redeem for dine-in or pickup orders. With Claim, Grubhub aims to help more restaurants engage customers through personalized rewards programs. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\nAI is already having a seismic impact on how software is written, with much of the grunt work of programming now performed by swarms of agents and subagents. But as developers experiment with new interfaces and form factors for human-AI collaboration, it’s become hard for even the most advanced AI labs to keep up. \nThe current trend is for agentic software development — systems where AI agents can work independently on coding tasks — epitomized by the Claude Code and Cowork apps. In the meantime, OpenAI has been gradually building out its Codex tool, which launched as a command line tool last April and expanded to a web interface one month later.\nNow OpenAI is taking a major step toward catching up. On Monday, the company launched a new macOS app for Codex, integrating many of the agentic practices that have become popular in the past year. The new app is designed to work with multiple agents in parallel, integrating agent skills and other state-of-the-art workflows. The launch also comes less than two months after the launch of GPT-5.2-Codex, OpenAI’s most powerful coding model, which the company hopes will be enough to tempt over Claude Code users.\n“If you really want to do sophisticated work on something complex, 5.2 is the strongest model by far,” CEO Sam Altman told reporters on a press call. “However, it’s been harder to use, so taking that level of model capability and putting it in a more flexible interface, we think is going to matter quite a bit.”\nWhile Altman’s confidence in GPT-5.2 is understandable, coding benchmarks tell a more complicated story. GPT-5.2 does hold the top spot on TerminalBench (a test measuring how well AI handles command-line programming tasks), at least as of press time. But agents from Gemini 3 and Claude Opus have logged roughly equivalent scores — lower, but within the margin of error of the benchmark. Results from SWE-bench, another coding benchmark that tests AI’s ability to fix real-world software bugs, are similar, showing no clear advantage for GPT-5.2. However, agentic use cases have been difficult to benchmark effectively, and state-of-the-art models can vary significantly in user experience.\nThe Codex app also comes with a range of new features that OpenAI says will help it achieve parity or, in some cases, outpace the various Claude apps. The Codex app will allow for automations that can be set to run in the background on an automatic schedule, with results placed in a queue to be reviewed when the user returns. Users can also select different personalities for the agent — from pragmatic to empathetic — depending on their working style.\nBut for the company, the biggest selling point is the sheer speed of development that’s made possible by AI. “You can use this from a clean sheet of paper, brand new, to make a really quite sophisticated piece of software in a few hours,” Altman said. “As fast as I can type in new ideas, that is the limit of what can get built.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nRing’s AI-powered “Search Party” feature, which leverages the company’s network of cameras to find lost dogs, is now available to all Ring customers in the U.S. For the first time, the feature will be made available to those who don’t own a Ring camera, too.\nLaunched last fall, Search Party uses AI to find possible matches for lost dogs across neighbors’ camera footage.\nWhen a neighbor reports a lost dog in the Ring app, nearby outdoor cameras use AI to scan for possible matches. If a match is found, that camera owner receives an alert and can optionally choose to share any related video clips with their neighbor who reported the pet missing. They’ll also have an option to call the owner or send them a message, without sharing their own phone number. \n Ring says the feature has been reuniting more than a dog per day since its launch. \nPreviously, Search Party was only available to customers with a Ring camera installed. The company is now making Search Party accessible to anyone through the Ring app.\n“Now, pet owners can mobilize the whole community—and communities are empowered to help—to find lost pets more effectively than ever before,” noted Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, in an announcement. “That’s why we believe it’s so important to make this feature available to anyone who shares a lost dog post in Neighbors,” he added, referring to the company’s Neighbors app for Ring customers.\n\n\n\nAlongside the launch and expansion, Amazon-owned Ring said it’s committing $1 million to equip animal shelters with Ring camera systems, and aims to aid 4,000 U.S. shelters. By adding the shelters to Ring’s network, the company hopes more lost dogs will be reunited with their owners.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company already works with other nonprofits, including Petco Love and Best Friends Animal Society, and is open to other partnerships.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "\nThe developer of the popular open source text editor Notepad++ has confirmed that hackers hijacked the software to deliver malicious updates to users",
    "body": "\nThe developer of the popular open source text editor Notepad++ has confirmed that hackers hijacked the software to deliver malicious updates to users over the course of several months in 2025.\nIn a blog post published Monday, Notepad++ developer Don Ho said that the cyberattack was likely carried out by hackers associated with the Chinese government between June and December 2025, citing multiple analyses by security experts who examined the malware payloads and attack patterns. Ho said this “would explain the highly selective targeting” seen during the campaign.\nRapid7, which investigated the incident, attributed the hacking to Lotus Blossom, a long-running espionage group known to work for China, and said the hacks targeted government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.\nNotepad++ is one of the longest-running open source projects, spanning more than two decades, and it counts at least tens of millions of downloads to date, including by employees at organizations around the world.  \nAccording to Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who first discovered the cyberattack and wrote up his findings in December, the hackers compromised a small number of organizations “with interests in East Asia” after someone unwittingly used a tainted version of the popular software. Beaumont said that the hackers were able to gain “hands-on” access to the computers of victims who were running hijacked versions of Notepad++. \nHo said that the “exact technical mechanism” of how the hackers broke into his servers remains under investigation, but provided some details as to how the attack went down. \nIn the blog, Ho said that Notepad++’s website was hosted on a shared hosting server. The attackers “specifically targeted” Notepad++’s web domain with the goal of exploiting a bug in the software to redirect some users to a malicious server run by the hackers. This allowed the hackers to deliver malicious updates to certain users who had requested a software update, until the bug was fixed in November and the hackers’ access was terminated in early December.\n“We do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented,” wrote Ho. \nIn an email, Ho told TechCrunch that his hosting provider confirmed his shared server was compromised but that the provider did not say how the hackers initially broke in.\nHo apologized for the incident, and urged users to download the most recent version of his software, which contains a fix for the bug.\nThe cyberattack targeting Notepad++ users is somewhat reminiscent of the 2019-2020 cyberattack affecting customers of SolarWinds, a software company that makes IT and network management tools for large Fortune 500 organizations, including government departments. Russian government spies hacked into the company’s servers and secretly planted a backdoor in its software, allowing the Russian spies to access data on those customers’ networks once the update had rolled out.\nThe SolarWinds breach affected several government agencies, including Homeland Security and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice, and State.\nUpdated with a response from Ho and with additional details from Rapid7.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

The social network has over 220 million users in the U.S.\nThe company blamed last week’s snowstorm, which caused an outage at an Oracle-operated data center responsible for TikTok operations.\n“We have successfully restored TikTok back to normal after a significant outage caused by winter weather took down a primary U.S. data center site operated by Oracle. The winter storm led to a power outage which caused network and storage issues at the site and impacted tens of thousands of servers that help keep TikTok running in the U.S. This affected many of TikTok’s core features—from content posting and discovery to the real-time display of video likes and view counts,” the company said in a post on X.\n\nIn January, the U.S. finalized the deal to create a separate entity for TikTok. A U.S.-based investor consortium called TikTok USDS took a controlling 80% stake, with the remaining 20% ownership held by ByteDance.\nFollowing the deal finalization — which coincided with the snowstorm — users experienced glitches in features like posting, searching within the app, slower load times, and time-outs. TikTok noted that creators might see zero views on their posts until the problem was resolved. Later, the company said that it was working on solving the issue, but outages persisted, and users faced problems with posting content.\nTikTok’s transition to a new ownership structure, paired with app snafus and user experience glitches, was beneficial for some other social networks. The Mark Cuban-backed short video app Skylight, which is built on the AT protocol, saw its user base soar to more than 380,000 users in the week the deal was finalized. UpScrolled, a social network by Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist Issam Hijazi, also climbed in App Store rankings to reach the second spot in the social media category in the U.S. The app was downloaded 41,000 times within days of the TikTok deal’s finalization, according to analyst firm Appfigures.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTwo Stanford students announced Monday that they have raised $2 million for an accelerator program called Breakthrough Ventures, which aims to fund businesses founded by college students and recent graduates nationwide.\nRoman Scott and Itbaan Nafi began building the accelerator program after hosting a series of popular Demo Days at Stanford starting in 2024 and decided to expand it after students were achieving success.\n“This fundraise turns Breakthrough from just being a seasonal accelerator into a lifelong partnership with our founders,” Nafi, who is still a master’s candidate at Stanford, told TechCrunch. \nScott received his undergraduate degree from Stanford in 2024 and went on to earn a master’s degree there the following year.\nEarly last year, the duo tapped Raihan Ahmed to lead the accelerator and then got to work, officially fundraising from the likes of Mayfield and Collide Capital (as well as a slew of Stanford founder alumni) to back the next generation of AI, health, consumer, deep tech, and sustainability companies. Scott said what makes their accelerator different is that it is specifically built “for student founders by student founders.”\nStudent programs like this aren’t new. UC Berkeley offers a similar program called Free Ventures for students seeking pre-seed funding, and MIT has its own Sandbox Innovation Fund. Even Stanford has some accelerator programs, both run by or affiliated with the school, such as StartX, LaunchPad, and Cardinal Ventures.\n“Students have enjoyed how we’ve brought together so many others from different American colleges,” Nafi said of his program, comparing it to Stanford’s Treehacks hackathon. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Breakthrough’s purpose is to fill in the funding and opportunity gap that exists in many of these ecosystems because students have historically lacked access to capital and the networks required to launch their entrepreneurial pursuits,” Scott added. \nBreakthrough will have a hybrid model, with in-person meetups at local powerhouse VC firms, culminating in a Demo Day at Stanford. Those participating in the program get access to grant funding (up to $10,000), compute credits (through Microsoft and the Nvidia Inception program), legal support, mentorship, “along with the opportunity to receive a $50,000 follow-on investment at the conclusion of the program,” Nafi said.\n“We’ve nailed the student-founder experience to a T,” Nafi said. “Hence why we offer the resources we do and have structured the program in this way. Students really feel like we get them, and that’s because we are students.” \nThe duo hopes to deploy the fund over three years, aiming to incubate at least 100 companies. Overall, Nafi hopes this fund will help grow Breakthrough into “the hub for Gen Z entrepreneurship and thought leadership,” specifically given the anxiety many young people feel about their economic future.\nApplications for the latest cohort open today. \n“We hope that by supporting young entrepreneurs, we’re able to uplift as many stories as possible to then inspire many more across the world to use the tools and knowledge around them to pursue entrepreneurship not only to change their communities, but also gain economic stability for themselves and their families,” Nafi said. \nThis piece was updated to correct the name of one of the investment firms. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nBy now, the Forbes 30 Under 30 list has become more than a little notorious for the amount of entrants who go on to be charged with fraud. Notable alumni include FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Frank CEO Charlie Javice, Joanna Smith-Griffin, founder of the AI startup AllHere Education, and “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli, among others. Now, another member of the list has been hit with federal charges.\nGökçe Güven, a 26-year-old Turkish national and the founder and CEO of fintech startup Kalder, was charged last week with alleged securities fraud, wire fraud, visa fraud, and aggravated identity theft.\nThe New York-based fintech startup — which uses the “Turn Your Rewards into [a] Revenue Engine” tagline — says it can help companies create and monetize individual rewards programs. The company was founded in 2022, and offers participating firms the opportunity to earn ongoing revenue streams via partner affiliate sales, Axios previously reported.\nGüven was featured in last year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 list. The magazine notes in the writeup that Güven’s clients included major chocolatier Godiva and the International Air Transport Association, the trade organization that represents a majority of the world’s airlines. Kalder also claims to have enjoyed the backing of a number of prominent VC firms.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice alleges that, during Kalder’s seed round in April of 2024, Güven managed to raise $7 million from more than a dozen investors after presenting a pitch deck that was rife with false information.\nAccording to the government, Kalder’s pitch deck claimed that there were 26 brands “using Kalder” and another 53 brands in “live freemium.” However, officials say that, in reality, Kalder had, in many cases, only been offering heavily discounted pilot programs to many of those companies. Other brands “had no agreement with Kalder whatsoever—not even for free services,” officials said in a press release announcing the indictment. The pitch deck also “falsely reported that Kalder’s recurring revenue had steadily grown month over month since February 2023 and that by March 2024, Kalder had reached $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue.” \nThe government also accuses Güven of having kept two separate sets of financial books. One of those sets included “false and inflated numbers,” and was presented to investors or potential investors to hide the “true financial condition of the company,” the government claims. The DOJ also alleges that Güven used lies about Kalder as well as forged documents to obtain a category of visa reserved for individuals of “extraordinary ability,” that would allow her to live and work in the United States. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTechCrunch reached out to Güven through her personal website.

    "body": "\nWhat is and isn’t a weed that needs to be eliminated in the field is determined by the eyes of the farmer — and now, increasingly, by a new AI model from Carbon Robotics.\nSeattle-based Carbon Robotics, which builds the LaserWeeder — a robot fleet that uses lasers to kill weeds — announced a new AI model, the Large Plant Model (LPM), on Monday. This model recognizes plant species instantly and allows farmers to target new weeds without needing to retrain the robots.\nThe LPM is trained on more than 150 million photos and data points collected by the company’s machines across the more than 100 farms in 15 countries where the robots currently operate. The model now powers Carbon AI, the AI system that serves as the brains inside the company’s autonomous weed-killing robots.\nPaul Mikesell, the founder and CEO of Carbon Robotics, told TechCrunch that prior to LPM, every time a new type of weed would show up on a farm — or even the same type of weed in different soil or with a slightly different appearance — the company would have to create new data labels to retrain its machines to recognize the plant.\nThis process took about 24 hours each time, Mikesell said. Now, LPM can learn a new weed instantly, even if it’s never seen it before.\n“The farmer can live in real time and say, ‘Hey, this is a new weed. I want you to kill this,’ and that was something that had never been done before,” Mikesell said. “There’s no new labeling or retraining because the Large Plant Model understands, at a much deeper level, what it’s looking at and the type of plant.”\nMikesell said that the company, which was founded in 2018, started developing this model shortly after it began shipping its first machines in 2022. Mikesell has years of experience building these types of neural networks from previous roles at Uber and working on Meta’s Oculus virtual reality headsets.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThis new model will reach the company’s existing systems through a software update. From there, farmers can tell the machine what to kill and what to protect by selecting photos that the machine has collected in the robot’s user interface.\nCarbon Robotics has raised more than $185 million in venture capital from backers including Nvidia NVentures, Bond, and Anthos Capital, among others. Now, the company will look to continue to fine-tune the model as the machines continue to feed the LPM new data.\n“We have over 150 million labeled plants now in our training set,” Mikesell said. “We have enough data now that we should be able to look at any picture and decide what kind of plant that is, what species it is, what it’s related to, what its structure is like, without having ever even seen that particular plant before, because we have so much data going into the neural net.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nSometimes, you might be sitting on a hot product and not know it until the market demands it.\nAfter launching as a digital business card that doubled as a lead capture tool for sales teams, Birmingham, Alabama-based Linq pivoted a few times before landing on an idea last year: helping businesses better communicate with their customers by upgrading from SMS (text) to iMessage and RCS.\nNow, Apple already lets businesses do this via its Messages for Business service, and Twilio has built an $18.26 billion business by helping companies text their customers. But users can always tell when they’re talking to a business — the texts are displayed in gray, and the branding is often obvious.\nLinq’s customers wanted to be able to send blue-bubble messages to their customers, not green or gray, to lend an air of authenticity to their communications.\nThe startup, founded by former Shipt executives Elliott Potter (CEO), Patrick Sullivan (CTO), and Jared Mattsson (president), heard that feedback and launched an API in February 2025 that lets companies message their customers natively within iMessage, leveraging all the capabilities Apple’s platform offers to iPhone users, like group chats, emojis, threaded replies, images, and voice notes. Within eight months, Linq had doubled its annual recurring revenue it had built over four years, Potter told TechCrunch.\nLinq was not content with its newfound product-market fit, however, as the advent of AI agents gave the company an even larger market to sell its tech to. That idea was sparked by an AI assistant called Poke, which can handle tasks, answer questions, and schedule your calendar from inside iMessage.\n“In spring of last year, this company came to us, called the Interaction Company of California, and they were building this AI assistant called poke.com and they were like, ‘Hey, we we don’t have a CRM, but we really want to use your API’,” Potter told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPoke went viral at launch last September, which, Potter says, led to his team being inundated with requests for tapping their messaging API. All of a sudden, a slew of AI companies wanted to offer their chatbots and assistants directly through iMessage, RCS, and SMS.\nLinq now had a decision to make: stick with its original, steady revenue stream from serving B2B clients, or pivot once again to leverage its tech stack and become an infrastructure layer for a new segment of the AI market.\n“We still love our sales customers, and we love that use case, but our choices were, do we stay a spoke of this wheel, or do we build the hub? Do we focus on being the infrastructure layer for all these different applications of programmatic messaging?”\nPotter thinks that consumers are suffering from app fatigue; but with Linq’s technology, there’s no need to use another app to interact with AI assistants as they can all live within their messaging app. Also, developers won’t have to worry about building an app since they can just build for a messaging-native interface instead.\n“Poke.com, along with others, have proved that AI has gotten good enough,” Potter said. “You don’t need a traditional app anymore to do things. Really, you just need an interface that will let you talk to an intelligent enough AI, maybe connect it to some of your systems, and just tell it what to do, and give it feedback.”\nLinq ended up pivoting, and it says its customer base has expanded by 132% from the previous quarter, and on average its customer accounts have expanded by 34%. Its customers’ AI agents now reach 134,000 monthly active users via the platform. The company claims it facilitates more than 30 million messages per month, resulting in net revenue retention of 295% with zero churn.\nTo continue building its tech, the company said on Monday it has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by TQ Ventures. Mucker Capital and some angel investors also participated. The company plans to use the fresh cash to expand its team, develop a new go-to-market motion, and continue building its tech. Linq did not disclose its valuation. \nRosy outlook aside, the reality is that Linq is still building on top of Apple’s platform — at least for now. There’s no telling if Apple will pull a Meta and bar third parties from offering AI chatbots on its platform. Besides, iMessage is popular in the U.S., but the rest of the world also uses other messaging services like WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, and Signal.\nPotter, however, says Linq’s eventual goal lies beyond messaging. “Our vision for the platform is everything you need to build conversational tech, and that’s not limited to a few channels. Right now, we have programmatic voice, we have iMessage, RCS, SMS. That’s just the beginning. Our ambition is, wherever your customers are, you should be able to talk to them, be it Slack, be it email, be it Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Signal, anywhere your customers are, and can converse.”\n“By making AI-to-human communication as frictionless as texting a friend, Linq is enabling an entirely new category of companies,” Andrew Marks, co-founding partner of TQ Ventures, said in a statement. “Linq’s founding team is extraordinary, and we have no doubt in their ability to execute on this massive opportunity.” \n",

    "body": "\nWaymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company, has raised $16 billion as it plans to grow its fleet of driverless taxicabs this year to more than a dozen new cities internationally, including London and Tokyo. \nDragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, and Sequoia Capital led the funding round, which now values Waymo at $126 billion, the company said in a blog post Monday. Parent company Alphabet supported the round and maintained its position as majority investor.\nThe round also included significant investments from Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala Capital, as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Additional investors included BDT & MSD Partners, CapitalG, Fidelity Management & Research Company, GV, Kleiner Perkins, Perry Creek Capital, and Temasek.\nWaymo said the funds will be used to fuel its growth, which has accelerated over the past year and doesn’t appear to be slowing. The company recently secured rides to and from San Francisco International Airport and has expanded its robotaxi service throughout Northern California and several major metropolitan areas in the U.S., including Los Angeles, Austin, and Miami.\nFor years, the former Google self-driving project slowly progressed forward, testing its autonomous vehicle tech on public roads in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area and providing the occasional public or media demo. In 2016, it made its first geographic leap forward and began testing in Phoenix, where it eventually pulled its human safety driver out of the vehicles. Phoenix became Waymo’s first robotaxi market, in which the public could hail driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivans.\nWaymo pushed down the accelerator in August 2023 after receiving the final necessary permit to operate a robotaxi service — and charge for rides — in California. It launched a limited service in San Francisco, later expanding to much of the greater Bay Area, Silicon Valley, and more recently to the freeways that connect the dozens of towns in the area. It also expanded to Los Angeles. The company launched in Austin and Atlanta in 2025 through a partnership with Uber. It kicked off the year by expanding to Miami.\nThe geographic expansion has translated to 400,000 rides provided every week across six major U.S. metropolitan areas. The company said that in 2025 alone, it more than tripled its annual volume to 15 million rides, surpassing 20 million lifetime rides to date.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We are no longer proving a concept,” the company wrote in its blog post. “We are scaling a commercial reality, laying the groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including Tokyo and London.”\nThe rapid expansion has also led to increased scrutiny and criticism as Waymo’s robotaxis have made missteps and the technology creates problems for some residents.\nSome robotaxis have exhibited dangerous behaviors particularly in school zones. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation as well as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have opened investigations into the illegal behavior of Waymo robotaxis around school buses. The NHTSA also launched another investigation last week after a Waymo robotaxi hit a child near a school. The child, who sustained minor injuries, was struck at about 6 mph.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nCloud data company Snowflake entered into a $200 million multi-year AI deal with OpenAI on Monday, the latest signal that enterprise AI competition continues to heat up.\nUnder the deal, Snowflake’s 12,600 customers will have access to OpenAI models across all three major cloud providers. Snowflake employees have access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise as well. The two companies are also partnering to build new AI agents and other AI products.\n“By bringing OpenAI models to enterprise data, Snowflake enables organizations to build and deploy AI on top of their most valuable asset using the secure, governed platform they already trust,” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a press release. “Customers can now harness all their enterprise knowledge in Snowflake together with the world-class intelligence of OpenAI models, enabling them to build AI agents that are powerful, responsible, and trustworthy. Together, we’re setting a new standard for AI innovation, helping businesses transform with confidence, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.”\nOpenAI declined to share information on the deal beyond the press release.\nIf this deal feels familiar, it should. Snowflake announced a $200 million enterprise deal with AI research lab Anthropic at the beginning of December. At the time, Ramaswamy was quoted making very similar comments about how the partnership with Anthropic would give its customers access to powerful AI models on top of their existing data.\n“Our partnership with OpenAI is a multi-year commercial commitment focused on reliability, performance, and real customer usage. At the same time, we remain intentionally model-agnostic. Enterprises need choice, and we do not believe in locking customers into a single provider,” Baris Gultekin, vice president of AI at Snowflake, told TechCrunch over email. “OpenAI is an important partner, and it is one of several frontier model providers available on Snowflake today, alongside Anthropic, Google, Meta, and others. \nSnowflake isn’t the only enterprise signing sizable deals with multiple AI companies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn January, workflow automation platform ServiceNow announced multi-year deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic for very similar reasons as Snowflake. ServiceNow president, COO, and CPO Amit Zavery told TechCrunch at the time that working with both AI labs was deliberate because they wanted to give their customers and employees the ability to choose which model they wanted based on the task at hand.\nIt’s hard to pinpoint which AI companies are seeing the most enterprise adoption success thus far. \nA Menlo Ventures survey from late 2025 shows its portfolio company Anthropic holds a commanding market lead; an Andreessen Horowitz report from last week naturally found its portfolio company OpenAI is leading the pack.\nThese conflicting surveys make it difficult to accurately track enterprise AI usage trends. However, this latest string of deals does provide a short-term view of what enterprise AI adoption will look like. The upshot: Enterprises will continue to strike partnerships with multiple AI companies because each one offers large language models with varying strengths and weaknesses.\nEnterprises are likely going to partner with multiple AI players because different AI companies and their large language models come with their own strengths and weaknesses. \nEnterprise AI could easily become a market that contains several winners with an overlapping customer base, similar to how many ride-hail users swap between Lyft and Uber based on what makes the most sense for that moment. Case in point: Employees of these enterprises already use their preferred model regardless of their company contracts.\n Or maybe there will be a clear winner after all. But for now, it’s likely we are going to see enterprises ink deals with multiple players as they continue to hunt for where AI can deliver tangible value.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nOne of the design features that became synonymous with Tesla has been banned in China.\nUnder new safety rules published Monday by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, cars sold in the country must have mechanical releases on their door handles. The new rules, which go in effect January 1, 2027, will prohibit the hidden, electronically actuated door handles popularized by Tesla — and now found on numerous other electric vehicles in China.\nThe new rule dictates that each door (excluding the tailgate) should be equipped with a mechanically released external door handle. Vehicles must also have a mechanical release on the interior of the vehicle. Bloomberg previously reported on the new safety policy.\nNumerous high-profile fatal incidents, in which occupants have become trapped in their vehicles, have raised concerns among safety regulators and advocates globally. China is the first country to issue a ban.\nAn investigation by Bloomberg last September uncovered problems with the concealed door handles on Tesla vehicles, citing several crashes in which first responders or occupants were unable to open the doors because the electronic door locks weren’t getting enough power from the vehicle’s battery system to work properly. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration then opened a defect investigation into certain Tesla Model Y and Model 3 door handles. While Tesla does have manual releases inside its vehicles, federal investigators noted that the releases can be hard for children to access, and many owners are unaware of their existence. Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed regulation requiring manual door releases in all new vehicles.\nFatal incidents in China, including a crash involving a Xiaomi SU7 electric sedan, prompted regulators there to propose changes to EV door handles last year.\nThe Chinese government began the process in May 2025 with more than 40 domestic vehicle manufacturers, parts suppliers, and testing institutions participating in the initial research. More than 100 industry experts held multiple rounds of discussions to determine the standard framework and form a draft standard of what would become the Safety Technical Requirements for Automobile Door Handles rule, according to the Chinese government’s standards agency.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat included dozens of automakers, including Chinese companies such as BYD, Geely Holdings, SAIC, and Xiaomi, as well as foreign automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Hyundai, Nissan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen. Tesla, however, was not listed as an official “drafter,” according to information posted on the standards agency’s website.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nAs Adobe ramps up its investments in AI, the company has decided to shut down its 2D animation software, Adobe Animate. On Monday, Adobe issued an update to the company’s support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing Adobe Animate will be discontinued on March 1, 2026.\nEnterprise customers can continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition. Other customers will have support through March of next year, the company said.\nThe decision has been met with incredulity, disappointment, and anger among Adobe Animate users, who are concerned about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.\nOne customer, posting on X, pleaded with Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things like “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” and “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.\nAdobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an FAQ, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”\n\n\n\n\nReading between the lines, it sounds as if Adobe is saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.\nWhat’s surprising is that Adobe can’t even recommend software that will fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it says customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”\nFor instance, it suggests that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes, and other design elements.\nThere were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction after Animate was ignored at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released. \nThe software will continue to work for those who have it downloaded, Adobe noted. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. \nSome users are recommending other animation programs to use instead, including Moho Animation and Toon Boom Harmony.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Adobe for comment.

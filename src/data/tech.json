If the recommendations become legally binding, member states that ignore the rules might face infringement procedures and even financial penalties, the report said. Virkkunen is looking at limiting Chinese vendors’ involvement in fiber network projects amid a push for faster broadband rollout. \nHuawei and ZTE did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe move comes amid a broader effort to limit China’s influence in key infrastructure as EU’s ties fray with the world’s second-largest economy. Last year, Germany’s top security official said that, starting in 2026, the country would prohibit the use of key components from Chinese firms ZTE and Huawei. In addition, Finland reportedly plans to broaden the scope of its ban on the use of Huawei components in 5G networks.\nIn recent years, the U.S. has persuaded European allies like the U.K. and Sweden to restrict or ban Huawei gear over concerns that Beijing could exploit it for cyber-espionage or disrupt critical communications. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

    "body": "\nGoogle announced on Monday that it’s starting to roll out Gemini to the Google TV Streamer, replacing Google Assistant. The tech giant says the change will enable users to use their voice more naturally to access content and more. \nFor example, users can now ask something like, “I like dramas but my wife likes comedies. What’s a movie we can watch together?” when looking for movie recommendations. \nOr, users could quickly catch up on a show they’re returning to by asking something like, “What happened at the end of Outlander last season?” In another example, Google says users can even ask something like “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”\nGoogle says Gemini for TV goes beyond entertainment, as users can ask the AI assistant any other type of question as well, just like they can with Gemini on their phone.\nFor example, users could bring learning to their TV by asking Gemini to “Explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader.” Gemini can also guide users through DIY projects or recipes with YouTube videos, Google says. \nTo access Gemini on the Google TV Streamer, you need to press your remote’s microphone button. \nGoogle says the update is rolling out “over the next few weeks” to users aged 18 and older. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe move comes as Google announced back in September that it was introducing Gemini for Google TV to select TCL devices. The company said at the time that later in the year, Gemini would be arriving on the 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models. \nIn addition to the Google TV Streamer, Gemini is also available on the Walmart Onn 4K Pro streaming device.\nMonday’s announcement doesn’t come as a surprise, as the change is part of Google’s plans to replace Google Assistant with Gemini across all of its devices and platforms. Plus, the company had announced at CES in January that Gemini would be coming to Google TV this year.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWikipedia on Monday laid out a simple plan to ensure its website continues to be supported in the AI era, despite its declining traffic. \nIn a blog post, the Wikimedia Foundation, the organization that runs the popular online encyclopedia, called on AI developers to use its content “responsibly” by ensuring its contributions are properly attributed and that content is accessed through its paid product, the Wikimedia Enterprise platform.\nThe opt-in, paid product allows companies to use Wikipedia’s content at scale without “severely taxing Wikipedia’s servers,” the Wikimedia Foundation blog post explains. In addition, the product’s paid nature allows AI companies to support the organization’s nonprofit mission.\nWhile the post doesn’t go so far as to threaten penalties or any sort of legal action for use of its material through scraping, Wikipedia recently noted that AI bots had been scraping its website while trying to appear human. After updating its bot-detection systems, the organization found that its unusually high traffic in May and June had come from AI bots that were trying to “evade detection.” Meanwhile, it said that “human page views” had declined 8% year-over-year.\nNow Wikipedia is laying out its guidelines for AI developers and providers, saying that generative AI developers should provide attribution to give credit to the human contributors whose content it uses to create its outputs.\n“For people to trust information shared on the internet, platforms should make it clear where the information is sourced from and elevate opportunities to visit and participate in those sources,” the post reads. “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.”\nEarlier this year, the organization released its AI strategy for editors, which said it would use AI to help editors with workflows around tedious tasks, automating translation, and other tools that help its editors, not replace them.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nIn 2023, after nearly three decades as CEO of the company he founded, Robert LoCascio stepped down as CEO of LivePerson, the public firm credited with pioneering web chat in 1997.\nGenerative AI advances inspired his next project, which he calls “the highest bar” for the technology: replicating human beings with their life stories and personality. In 2024, he founded and self-funded, Eternos, a legacy service that allows people to preserve their voice and stories for loved ones after they pass away. Now, it’s got a new name and modified mission. \nThe startup gained significant media attention after its first client, the terminally ill Michael Bommer, revealed how he worked with Eternos to create a digital replica of himself after spending 25 hours talking to Eternos about his life, interests, and worldview.\nLoCascio was set on building a legacy business, but what surprised him was that most of the people considering using Eternos weren’t preparing for death.\nEternos developed the Human Life Model (HLM) — a framework that uses only an individual’s data, rather than general LLM data, to capture their unique values, life story, and decision-making traits. LoCascio saw an opportunity to use this technology to help individuals create personal AIs for professional and personal use.\nThe company announced Tuesday it has rebranded as Uare.ai and raised $10.3 million in seed funding led by Mayfield and Boldstart Ventures.\n“I started to realize that the big models, they’re taking our datasets, and they’re getting smarter because of us,” LoCascio told TechCrunch. “We don’t have to take that path. You own the model, and you can share it and monetize it.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe vision for Uare.ai is to be a scaling tool for creators and professionals. Since the personal AI models hold the individual’s full expertise, a digital replica can be put to work to generate content, handle customer interactions, and even execute projects.\nOnce Uare.ai’s platform launches later this year, individuals will be able to start training their HLMs by responding to Uare.ai questions about their lives using text, voice, and even video.\n“The first part is getting a human life story. Where’d you come from? Tell me a story about your childhood. What’s a crossroad in your life when you were younger?” LoCascio said.\nUare.ai then asks the person to submit additional facts about their life, including information about their profession. “We blend the facts with this human life story, and that gives us your model,” he said.\nUnlike Character.ai and other chatbots, Uare.ai’s model won’t turn to general LLMs to fill the gaps about anything that’s not in HLM. “Our AIs will say, I don’t know if they can’t answer the question,” LoCascio said.\nUare.ai intends to generate revenue through subscription fees or take a share of the revenue generated by customers who earn income from their digital twins.\nAnother startup developing personal AIs is Sequoia-backed Delphi, which has attracted people with large followings, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, and enables others to interact with his replicated knowledge via voice or text.\nNavin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield, believes Uare.ai stands out from competitors because it targets individual professionals like CPAs. Plus, it has LoCascio, a very successful entrepreneur at the helm, he told TechCrunch.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMeta may be about to lose one of its most renowned AI heads: Yann LeCun, a chief AI scientist at the company, is planning to leave the company to build his own startup, the Financial Times reported, citing anonymous sources.\nLeCun, a professor at New York University, senior researcher at Meta, and winner of the prestigious A.M. Turing Award, plans to leave in the coming months, and is already in talks to raise capital for a startup that would focus on continuing his work on world models, the report added.\nA world model is an AI system that develops an internal understanding of its environment so it can simulate cause-and-effect scenarios to predict outcomes. Top labs and startups like Google DeepMind and World Labs are also developing world models.\nLeCun’s departure would come at a pivotal time for Meta, which has of late changed how it approaches AI development in response to concerns that it is being outpaced by rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.\nThe company has reportedly started revamping its AI organization after hiring over 50 engineers and researchers from its competitors to build out a new AI unit, dubbed Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Notably, Meta in June invested $14.3 billion in data-labeling vendor Scale AI and brought on board its CEO Alexandr Wang to run the new division.\nThose decisions, sources told TechCrunch in August, have made things increasingly chaotic at Meta’s AI unit, with new talent expressing frustration with navigating the bureaucracy of a big company, while Meta’s previous generative AI team has seen its scope limited.\nLeCun’s long-term research work at the company under its Fundamental AI Research Lab (FAIR) division has been overshadowed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s decisions to overhaul things after the company’s previous family of AI models, Llama 4, failed to keep up with rival models. Unlike MSL, FAIR is designed to focus on long-term AI research — techniques that may be used five to 10 years from now.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLeCun has been openly skeptical about how AI technology — specifically LLMs — is currently being marketed as the cure for all of humankind’s ails. He even tweeted that AI systems have a long way to go. \n“It seems to me that before ‘urgently figuring out how to control AI systems much smarter than us’ we need to have the beginning of a hint of a design for a system smarter than a house cat,” he wrote.\nMeta did not immediately return a request for comment outside regular business hours. \n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor. He covered North American and European M&A, equity, regulatory news and debt markets at Reuters and Acuris Global, and has also written about travel, tourism, entertainment and books.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Ram by emailing ram.iyer@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nIsraeli AI agent startup Wonderful has raised $100 million in a Series A round led by Index Ventures, with participation from Insight Partners, IVP, Bessemer, and Vine Ventures. \nThe large round, in a market already crowded with AI agent startups, suggests Wonderful has convinced top tier investors it’s not just another GPT wrapper, but a company building the infrastructure and orchestration that could scale if multi-agent systems take off.  \nThe round brings Wonderful’s total funding to $134 million just four months after the startup came out of stealth with a seed round and a promise to help enterprises deploy customer-facing AI agents across voice, chat, and email in every market and every language. The startup says it tailors the platform to each market it serves, fine-tuning for language, cultural norms, and regulatory environments, and even organizes local teams to manage deployment.  \nThat approach has led to rapid growth for the young startup, which claims its AI agents are already managing tens of thousands of customer requests daily with an 80% resolve rate. Since launching, Wonderful has expanded to Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Greece, Poland, Romania, the Baltics, the Adriatics and the UAE. \nWith its fresh funding, Wonderful intends to launch in Germany, Austria, the Nordics and Portugal in 2025, and plans to expand in the Asia-Pacific region in early 2026. But the company doesn’t intend to stop with customer support agents. \nSince its system plugs deeply into an enterprise customer’s existing software and can be tailored for each market, the startup says it will be able to give agents the capabilities to perform new tasks with minimal extra effort. It is currently exploring areas like employee training, sales enablement, regulatory compliance, internal IT support, and onboarding, the company said. \n“The promise of AI agents is clear, but putting that into practice, and critically, into production, is a huge challenge,” Bar Winkler, CEO and co-founder of Wonderful, said in a statement. “It requires marrying best-in-class technology together with flawless delivery, on the ground with customers. That’s been our approach with Wonderful, and it’s what has driven the accelerated adoption we’ve seen across markets in the last few months.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCustomer-facing AI agents are emerging as the first real beachhead for the technology, and investors were likely attracted by Wonderful’s focus here. These use cases help enterprises cut costs by augmenting or replacing human support staff, and they integrate readily into existing call centre infrastructure. Crucially, they also carry less risk than having an AI make internal decisions autonomously — a use case that most enterprises aren’t ready to adopt at scale yet.  \nIndex Ventures partner Hannah Seal pointed to Wonderful’s ability to “[move] from concept to global scale in less than a year” as a source of confidence for investors. The company’s true edge, she said, is its ability to deploy agents for global enterprises that function across every market and language. \nJeff Horing, co-founder and managing director at Insight Partners, said the adoption Wonderful is seeing across industries shows “just how valuable culturally fluent agents can be.” \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nThreads, Meta’s competitor to X, will now begin targeting a specific type of creator: podcasters. The company said on Tuesday that Threads will focus on bringing more discussions around podcasts to its app and helping creators promote their shows.\nInitially, Threads will roll out a couple of new features to help on this front. For one, it will give podcast links in the feed a unique and more pronounced look, with colorful backgrounds and image thumbnails, making them easier to spot.\nCreators, meanwhile, will get a dedicated spot in their user profile to add a link to their podcast. Threads says these links, which are similarly designed to stand out, will help podcasters better promote their shows and grow their audiences.\nIn the year ahead, these features will be followed by others that will also focus on serving podcasters and their listeners, a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nImage Credits:Threads\nMeta explained it’s interested in the podcast community because it sees the potential in becoming the de facto place for people to talk about shows and engage with creators. Today, such discussions are distributed across social media, on places like Reddit, X, Facebook and Instagram, as well as on the platforms where podcasts are streamed, like YouTube and Spotify (the latter added support for comments last year).\nThe company’s also trying to tap podcasts’ deep ties to culture, which can drive discussions and encourage interactions. Threads currently has more than 400 million monthly active users and 150 million daily active users, less than its rival X, which claims as many as 600 million monthly active users. Capturing the podcast community, or even a portion of that, could help to narrow that gap significantly.\nImage Credits:Threads\nHowever, while Threads will target the discussions that result from podcasts, the company told TechCrunch it doesn’t intend to be a podcast distribution platform. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInstead, the company will focus on giving podcast hosts more insight and analytics on how the conversations around their shows are resonating with fans. It also intends to develop more features that would help people discover podcasts they might like, and connect podcasters and listeners through conversations.\nThis isn’t the first time Threads has targeted creators as a way to differentiate its social network from X, Bluesky, and others in the space.\nImage Credits:Threads\nThe company in May gave creators the ability to add up to five links in their profile, allowing them to promote their broader presence across the web, including on other social media sites, video platforms, blogs, and portfolios. The company more recently also began allowing creators to share longer thoughts and perspectives through a text attachment feature.\nMeta says users can expect to see Threads explore more features focused on podcast discussions in the months ahead.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nPeople often think about tech bubbles in apocalyptic terms, but it doesn’t have to be as serious as all that. In economic terms, a bubble is a bet that turned out to be too big, leaving you with more supply than demand.  \nThe upshot: It’s not all or nothing, and even good bets can turn sour if you aren’t careful about how you make them. \nWhat makes the question of the AI bubble so tricky to answer is mismatched timelines between the breakneck pace of AI software development and the slow crawl of constructing and powering a data center. \nBecause these data centers take years to build, a lot will inevitably change between now and when they come online. The supply chain that powers AI services is so complex and fluid that it’s hard to have any clarity on how much supply we’ll need a few years from now. It isn’t simply a matter of how much people will be using AI in 2028, but how they’ll be using it, and whether we’ll have any breakthroughs in energy, semiconductor design, or power transmission in the meantime. \nWhen a bet is this big, there are lots of ways it can go wrong — and AI bets are getting very big indeed.  \nLast week, Reuters reported that an Oracle-linked data center campus in New Mexico has drawn as much as $18 billion in credit from a consortium of 20 banks. Oracle has already contracted $300 billion in cloud services to OpenAI, and the companies have joined with SoftBank to build $500 billion in total AI infrastructure as part of the “Stargate” project. Meta, not to be outdone, has pledged to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over the next three years. We’ve been tracking all the major commitments here — and the sheer volume has made it hard to keep up. \nAt the same time, there is real uncertainty about how fast demand for AI services will grow.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA McKinsey survey released last week looked at how top firms are employing AI tools. The results were mixed. Almost all the businesses contacted are using AI in some way, yet few are using it on any real scale. AI has allowed companies to cost-cut in specific use cases, but it’s not making a dent on the overall business. In short, most companies are still in “wait and see” mode. If you’re counting on those companies to buy space in your data center, you may be waiting a long time. \nBut even if AI demand is endless, these projects could run into more straightforward infrastructure problems. Last week, Satya Nadella surprised podcast listeners by saying he was more concerned with running out of data center space than running out of chips. (As he put it, “It’s not a supply issue of chips; it’s the fact that I don’t have warm shells to plug into.”) At the same time, whole data centers are sitting idle because they can’t handle the power demands of the latest generation of chips.  \nWhile Nvidia and OpenAI have been moving forward as fast as they possibly can, the electrical grid and built environment are still moving at the same pace they always have. That leaves lots of opportunity for expensive bottlenecks, even if everything else goes right. \nWe get deeper into the idea in this week’s Equity podcast, which you can listen to below. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

Now, iOS users in the U.S. can describe their edits using voice or text to modify images, Google announced Tuesday. The company is also bringing its redesigned photo editor with easy editing options to iOS.\nThe upgrade includes a new personalized edits feature that recognizes people from Google Photos’ face groups. Users can find the “Help me edit” option and type several  instructions applicable to people within the photo. For instance, “Remove Riley’s sunglasses, open my eyes, make Engel smile, and open her eyes” to get edits related to each person, as the image below shows.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe company is adding its popular AI image model, Nano Banana, to Google Photos to let users edit their photos to recreate images in new styles like a Renaissance portrait or cartoon strip. \nGoogle is also adding AI templates to easily let users convert one photo into a specific format. With Nano Banana, formats like turning images into retro portraits or action figures became popular. The company said this feature will roll out next week on Android under the Create tab in the U.S. and India, where Nano Banana is used the most.\nImage Credits: Google\nGoogle Photos is also getting a slight design change with a new Ask button that will act as a starting point for different AI requests. Users can ask for information about the photo, discover related moments, and edit it using prompts. The company will also show some suggestion chips to indicate what users can do with this feature, which is rolling out to users in the U.S. on iOS and Android.\nImage Credits: Google\nLast year, Google introduced an AI-powered search feature for the Photos app with an initial launch in the United States. Today, the company is expanding the search to more than 100 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Africa.

    "body": "\nMasayoshi Son isn’t known for half measures. The SoftBank founder’s career has been studded with eyebrow-raising bets, each one seemingly more outrageous than the last. \nHis latest move is to cash out his entire $5.8 billion Nvidia stake to go all-in on AI. And while it surprised the business world on Tuesday, it maybe should not. At this point, it’s almost more surprising when the 68-year-old Son doesn’t push his chips to the center of the table.\nConsider that during the late 1990s dot-com bubble, Son’s net worth soared to about $78 billion by February 2000, briefly making him the richest person in the world. Then came the ugly dot-com implosion months later. He lost $70 billion personally – which, at the time, was the largest financial loss by any individual in history — as SoftBank’s market cap plummeted 98% from $180 billion to just $2.5 billion. \nAmid that terribleness, Son made what would become his most legendary bet: a $20 million investment in Alibaba in 2000, one decided (the story goes) after just a six-minute meeting with Jack Ma. That stake would eventually grow to be worth $150 billion by 2020, transforming him into one of the venture industry’s most celebrated figures and funding his comeback.\nThat Alibaba success has often made it harder to see when Son has stayed too long at the table. When Son needed capital to launch his first Vision Fund in 2017, he didn’t hesitate to seek $45 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund – long before taking Saudi money became acceptable in Silicon Valley. \nAfter journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in October 2018, Son condemned the killing as “horrific and deeply regrettable” but insisted SoftBank couldn’t “turn our backs on the Saudi people,” maintaining the firm’s commitment to managing the kingdom’s capital. In fact, the Vision Fund actually ramped up dealmaking soon after.\nThat didn’t turn out so well. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA big bet on Uber generated paper losses for years. Then came WeWork. Son overrode his lieutenants’ objections, fell “in love” with founder Adam Neumann, and assigned the co-working company a dizzying valuation of $47 billion in early 2019 after making several previous investments in the company. But WeWork’s IPO plans collapsed after it published a famously troubling S-1 filing. The company never quite recovered – even after pushing out Neumann and instituting a series of belt-tightening measures – ultimately costing SoftBank $11.5 billion in equity losses and another $2.2 billion in debt. (Son reportedly later called it “a stain on my life.”)\nSon has been mounting another comeback for years, and Tuesday will undoubtedly be remembered as an important moment in his turnaround tale. Indeed, it will likely be recalled as the day SoftBank revealed it had sold all 32.1 million of its Nvidia shares – not to diversify its bets but instead to double down elsewhere, including on a planned $30 billion commitment to OpenAI and to participate (it reportedly hopes) in a $1 trillion AI manufacturing hub in Arizona. \nIf selling that position still gives Son some heartburn, that’s understandable. At about $181.58 per share, SoftBank exited just 14% below Nvidia’s all-time high of $212.19, which is a strong look. That’s remarkably close to peak valuation for such a huge position. Still, the move marks SoftBank’s second complete exit from Nvidia, and the first one was exceedingly costly. (In 2019, SoftBank sold a $4 billion stake in the company for $3.6 billion, shares that would now be worth more than $150 billion.)\nThe move also rattled the market. As of this writing, Nvidia shares are down nearly 3% following the disclosure, even as analysts emphasize that the sale “should not be seen as a cautious or negative stance on Nvidia,” but rather reflects SoftBank needing capital for its AI ambitions.\nWall Street can’t help but wonder: does Son see something right now that others do not? Judging by his track record, maybe — and that ambiguity is all investors have to go on.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nJenny Shao was a practicing physician and was in residency at Harvard. During the pandemic, Shao saw that people in isolation had a neurological impact, and they needed support. This drove her to leave her medical career, the Harvard residency, to launch a start offering an AI assistant called Robyn. \nRobyn is intended to be an empathic, emotionally intelligent AI for people.\nNavigating human relationships with AI assistants is a tricky space. On the one hand, there are general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT; on the other, there are companion/friendship/avatar apps like Character.AI, Replika, and Friend, and even therapy apps like Feeling Great. A study in July indicated that 72% of U.S. teens have used AI companion apps. These apps have been accused of playing a part in the suicides of multiple people through various lawsuits.\nShao said that it is trying to position Robyn in a way that it is neither a friendship app nor a replacement for a therapist or a clinical practitioner.\n“As a physician, I have seen things go badly when tech companies try to replace your doctor. Robyn is and won’t ever be a clinical [replacement]. It is equivalent to someone who knows you very well. Usually, their role is to support you. You can think of Robyn as your emotionally intelligent partner,” Shao said.\nImage Credits: Robyn\nThe founder said that with Robyn, her startup has tried to replicate the way humans remember things. Shao previously worked under Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel’s, who won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, lab to research human memory. Shao said she put those learnings into Robyn to have the AI understand users more.\nRobyn, which is available on iOS, has an onboarding process like many journaling or mental health apps. The app asks you about yourself, your goals, how you react when you are challenged, and what kind of tone you Robyn to respond in.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage credits: Robyn\nOnce you complete the onboarding, you can chat with Robyn about different topics. For instance, when I asked it to build a morning routine for me, it asked me a bunch of questions and also had a detailed conversation about having a minimum screen time at the beginning of the day. \nAs you chat more with Robyn, the app will give you more insights into your pattern and also describe different traits about you, including your emotional fingerprint, attachment style, love language, growth edge, and inner critic. The startup has also made a demo website to analyze profiles on X and give insights as to what kinds of insights they would get out of Robyn.\nImage credits: Robyn\nShao said that the company takes safety seriously and has been putting in guardrails even when she was testing the chatbot as a solo user. The app gives users a crisis line number and points them to the nearest ER if they talk about self-harm. The assistant also pushes back on certain topics and answers. If you ask it to show the latest sports score or ask it to count to 1,000, Robyn will say that it can’t perform these actions but help you with any personal stuff. \nThe company has raised $5.5 million in seed funding led by M13 with participation from Google Maps co-founder Lars Rasmussen, early Canva investor Bill Tai, ex-Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman, and X.ai co-founder Christian Szegedy. The startup had three team members at the start of the year and has now grown to 10 people. \nRasmussen said that the app’s emotional memory system was impressive, and Shao’s mission of helping people attracted him to invest in the app.\nImage Credits: Robyn\n“We’re living through a massive disconnection problem. People are surrounded by technology but feel less understood than ever. Robyn tackles that head-on. It’s solving emotional disconnection, helping people reflect, recognize their own patterns, and reconnect with who they are. It’s not about therapy or replacing l relationships. It’s about strengthening someone’s capacity to connect — with themselves first, and then with others,” he told TechCrunch over email.\nA big challenge for Robyn would be to maintain the safety of its users and also make sure users don’t anthropomorphize the chatbot.\nLatif Parecha, a partner at M13, said that Robyn’s ultimate goal is to foster human connections, but for AIs operating in this realm, there needs to be guardrails.\n“There needs to be guardrails in place for escalation for situations where people are in real danger. Especially, as AI will be part of our lives just like are family and friends are,” Parecha told TechCrunch over a call.\nThe startup has been testing Robyn with a select set of users for a few months and launching today in the U.S. The app is paid, and the subscription costs $19.99 a month or $199 a year. \n",

    "body": "\nKaltura, a New York-headquartered AI video platform company, is acquiring eSelf.ai, an Israel-based startup behind conversational avatars — AI-generated digital humans that can talk with users — for about $27 million. Kaltura announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf, a platform supporting more than 30 languages and featuring a user-friendly studio for creating, customizing, and deploying photorealistic digital avatars.\nCo-founded in 2023 by CEO Alan Bekker, who previously sold his first startup, Voca, to Snap in 2020 — and CTO Eylon Shoshan, eSelf brings deep technical expertise in speech-to-video generation, low-latency speech recognition, and screen understanding, which allows avatars to see and respond to what’s on a user’s screen. The eSelf co-founders will join Kaltura to oversee the integration of eSelf’s technology into the company, with all current eSelf employees coming on board as well.\nThe two-year-old startup has a small but strong team of around 15 AI experts, Ron Yekutiel, co-founder and CEO of Kaltura, told TechCrunch. He noted that Bekker’s former company specialized in natural language processing, which helps computers understand human speech, and computer vision, saying it was a “very leading company in the area of conversational speech bots. And so he’s an expert [in this field], and that’s what we bought,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura offers a suite of cloud-based software solutions designed for advanced video applications, including a corporate video portal akin to a private YouTube, tools for webinars and virtual events, and integrations that embed video learning into university learning management systems, or platforms that organize online coursework.\nThe Nasdaq-listed company also delivers virtual classroom products and end-to-end TV streaming solutions. Kaltura’s video platform serves over 800 enterprise customers, helping them engage users across sales, marketing, customer care, education, and entertainment. Its clients include tech giants like Amazon, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Adobe, and IBM, as well as leading banks, insurance companies, consulting firms, pharmaceutical companies, and universities in the U.S.\nKaltura plans to integrate eSelf.ai’s virtual agent technology across its video offerings; the integration aims to enable agents that can listen, speak, and interpret user screens in real time.\n“This acquisition was so strategic. We were actively evaluating multiple companies to find the right fit. We determined that they [eSelf] were best-in-class for real-time, synchronous conversation — not just video-on-demand lip-syncing — and that they had an impressive speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology stack,” Yekutiel said in an interview with TechCrunch. “Beyond the technology, there was also a strong cultural and geographic alignment, which was critical for us.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhy a video company is betting on conversational avatars\nFor the past two decades, businesses have mostly used video for streaming, uploading, and managing content. But that’s changing fast. Thanks to AI, videos can now be generated instantly — hyper-personalized and contextual — giving every viewer their own custom experience, tailored exactly to what they need in that moment, Yekutiel explained.\n“We started with video, then moved to personalized video, and now, with eSelf’s technology, we’re adding human-like capabilities — faces, eyes, mouths, ears — to make our AI agents conversational and expressive,” Yekutiel said.\nKaltura is evolving from a video platform into a video-based customer and employee experience provider, where video serves as the interface. Unlike most avatar companies that offer only a “face,” it delivers the full workflow — avatar, intelligence, and enterprise-connected knowledge. The focus isn’t just streaming video; it’s driving measurable business results and ROI, the CEO added.\nThe company plans to launch standalone, embeddable agents for uses including sales, marketing, customer support, and training. Target sectors include education, media and telecom, e-commerce, financial services, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.\nAsked about media reports saying Kaltura was exploring a sale or merger at a $400 million to $500 million valuation, Yekutiel told TechCrunch that Kaltura has explored opportunities with a range of companies, including potential “acquisitions, mergers with similarly sized firms, and connections with some larger players.” But it never got close to a transaction like the ones being reported, he said. He also pointed to Kaltura’s recent acquisitions, including its fourth company, as evidence of the company’s continued commitment to its current strategy.\nThis marks Kaltura’s fourth acquisition to date. The company acquired cloud TV solution Tvinci in 2014, followed by Rapt Media in 2018, and video conferencing platform Newrow in 2020. eSelf’s most recent funding round was its $4.5 million announced in December 2024. \nKaltura, which went public in 2021, reports around $180 million in revenue, is profitable on an adjusted EBITDA and cash flow basis, and has about 600 employees.\n",

    "description": "\nRaising a $250 million Series D round may seem like a distant and unnecessary distraction to startup founders pitching investors for that first $1 mi",
    "body": "\nRaising a $250 million Series D round may seem like a distant and unnecessary distraction to startup founders pitching investors for that first $1 million in seed money. But it shouldn’t be, according to several founders and venture capitalists. In their view, founders should be charting out a strategy for those later stage fundraises from the beginning. \nAven co-founder and CEO Sadi Khan said, while on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt, startup founders should start thinking about their later rounds before they raise their first financing. This strategy allows founders to determine how much capital they’ll likely need throughout the growth of their startup. \n“We’re a very capital-intensive company; we provide asset-backed credit cards to consumers,” Khan said. “We require large amounts of capital to scale up, and we’ll require large, large amounts of capital to grow. From day zero, we knew that we needed to have an intensive pipeline of investors that we want to work with over a long period of time.”\nFounders who understand how much capital they need can focus on finding the right investors for an early-stage round while building relationships with later-stage investors of the same flavor.\nLila Preston, head of growth equity at Generation Investment Management, said startups should start building these relationships at least two years before they need the capital.\nStarting these relationships early gives investors time to get to know the business and the market it operates in, Preston added. It also gives investors a peek into the company’s growth. \nSome later-stage investors — like Generation Investment Management, Preston said — can add value to a company long before they invest, if they think an idea is promising.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“When we show up, even at Series A or B, we’ve done the homework so that we’re an additive worthwhile conversation,” Preston said. “‘What are your milestones?’ ‘What does success look like to you?’ As the entrepreneur, [if you are] able to articulate that, you can come back and say, ‘yes, you’ve been able to hit the milestones you set out.’”\nZeya Yang, a partner at IVP, agreed and added that later-stage rounds are closing quicker than ever. Giving investors time to learn about your company in advance helps both sides, Yang noted.\n“It definitely helps to get to know those people earlier than you think you need to,” Yang said. “When you’re actually raising, you’re talking to folks, one that you know you probably get along with, two who’ve already thought about your business a bit, etc. So it’s definitely helpful to think about it well in advance.”\nYang added that when early-stage companies start talking to later stage investors they don’t have to necessarily share all their numbers or metrics quite yet. Instead, they can share the general direction of the company and the overall vision of what it’s building.\nStartups looking to find these late-stage investors should start by turning to their existing cap table, Khan said. A company’s existing investors can connect the founder to other VCs — his early investors introduced him to Khosla Ventures which led the company’s Series E round — that would be a good fit or have worked well the investors on the cap table in the past.\n“At any given stage of fundraising, we always thought about what the next set of investors would be,” Khan said. “We try to build relationships in the previous round with an investor who really focuses on the next stage round. And sometimes we would let them come in on like a symbolic check to really start establishing a relationship.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

Today, OpenAI also launched a new model designed to turbo-charge Codex: GPT-5.3 Codex.\nThe company says that the model transforms Codex from an agent that can merely “write and review code” to one that can do “nearly anything developers and professionals do on a computer, expanding who can build software and how work gets done.” Having tested its new model against a number of performance benchmarks, OpenAI claims that it can create “highly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days.” \nOpenAI says that GPT-5.3 Codex is also 25% faster than its previous model (GPT-5.2) and that it was the company’s first model that “was instrumental in creating itself,” meaning that the company’s staff used early versions of the program to debug itself and evaluate how it was performing.\nThe new model release notably follows hot on the heels of a new agentic coding model released by its competitor, Anthropic. Indeed, OpenAI and Anthropic had originally planned to release their two agentic coding tools at the exact same time: 10 a.m. PST. However, not long before the original release time, Anthropic moved its release date up by 15 minutes, slightly besting OpenAI in the race to publicize the models.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

This figure marks a 24% year-on-year increase and the business segment’s largest growth rate in 13 quarters. Annual revenue run rate for the business segment is $142 billion, according to Amazon. The cloud service also saw an increase in its operating income from $12.5 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $10.6 billion in the same period in 2024.\n“It’s very different having 24% year-over-year growth on $142 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth on a meaningfully smaller base, which is the case with our competitors,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “We continue to add more incremental revenue and capacity than others, and extend our leadership position.”\nThat fourth-quarter growth was fueled by new agreements with Salesforce, BlackRock, Perplexity, and the U.S. Air Force, among other companies and government entities.\n“More of the top 500 U.S. startups use AWS as their primary cloud provider than the next two providers combined,” Jassy said. “We’re adding significant easy to core computing capacity each day.”\nAWS also added more than a gigawatt of power to its data center network in the fourth quarter.\nJassy said AWS still sees a fair amount of its business coming from enterprises that want to move infrastructure from on-premise to the cloud. AWS is, of course, also seeing a boost from the AI boom, and Jassy credited AWS’s top-to-bottom AI stack functionality.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We consistently see customers wanting to run their AI workloads where the rest of their applications and data are,” Jassy said. “We’re also seeing that as customers run large AI workloads on AWS, they’re adding to their core AWS footprint as well.”\nAWS made up 16.6% of Amazon’s overall $213.4 billion revenue in the fourth quarter. \nAWS’s success wasn’t enough to appease Amazon investors, however. Amazon shares fell 10% in after-hours trading after investors reacted to the company’s plan to boost capital expenditures and missed Wall Street’s expectations on earnings per share.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nPeople without coding backgrounds are discovering that they can build their own custom apps using vibe coding — solutions like Lovable that turn plain-language descriptions into working code.\nWhile these prompt-to-code tools can help create nice prototypes, launching them into full-scale production (as this reporter recently discovered) can be tricky without figuring out how to connect the application with external tech services, such as those that can send text messages via SMS, email, and process Stripe payments.\nIlan Zerbib, who spent five years as Shopify’s director of engineering for payments, is building a solution that could eliminate these back-end infrastructure headaches for nontechnical creators.\nLast summer, Zerbib launched Sapiom, a San Francisco startup developing the financial layer that allows AI agents to securely purchase and access software, APIs, data, and compute — essentially creating a payment system that lets AI automatically buy the services it needs.\nEvery time an AI agent connects to an external tool like Twilio for SMS, it requires authentication and a micro-payment. Sapiom’s goal is to make this whole process seamless, letting the AI agent decide what to buy and when without human intervention.\n“In the future, apps are going to consume services which require payments. Right now, there’s no easy way for agents to actually access all of that,” said Amit Kumar, a partner at Accel.\nKumar has met with dozens of startups in the AI payments space, but he believes Zerbib’s focus on the financial layer for enterprises, rather than consumers, is what’s truly needed to make AI agents work. That’s why Accel is leading Sapiom’s $15 million seed round, with participation from Okta Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Array Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Anthropic, and Coinbase Ventures.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“If you really think about it, every API call is a payment. Every time you send a text message, it’s a payment. Every time you spin up a server for AWS, it’s a payment,” Kumar told TechCrunch.\nWhile it’s still early days for Sapiom, the startup hopes that its infrastructure solution will be adopted by vibe-coding companies and other companies creating AI agents that will eventually be tasked with doing many things on their own.\nFor example, anyone who has vibe-coded an app with SMS capabilities won’t have to manually sign up for Twilio, add a credit card, and copy an API key into their code. Instead, Sapiom handles all of that in the background, and the person building the micro-app will be charged for Twilio’s services as a pass-through fee by Lovable, Bolt, or another vibe-coding platform.\nWhile Sapiom is currently focused on B2B solutions, its technology could eventually empower personal AI agents to handle consumer transactions. The expectation is that individuals will one day trust agents to make independent financial decisions, such as ordering an Uber or shopping on Amazon. While that future is exciting, Zerbib believes that AI won’t magically make people buy more things, which is why he’s focusing on creating financial layers for businesses instead.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Anthropic\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t9:51 AM PST · February 5, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nOn Thursday, Anthropic released the latest version of Opus — its most advanced model and a particularly important model for Claude Code. Opus 4.5 was only released last November, and with 4.6, the company has sought to broaden its model’s capabilities and appeal, allowing for a greater variety of uses and customers.\nPerhaps the most notable addition to the newest version of Opus is the inclusion of what the company calls “agent teams” — teams of agents that can split larger tasks into segmented jobs.\n“Instead of one agent working through tasks sequentially, you can split the work across multiple agents — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others,” the company says. Scott White, Head of Product at Anthropic, compared the new feature to having a talented team of humans working for you, noting that the segmenting of agent responsibilities allows them “to coordinate in parallel [and work] faster.” The agent teams are currently available in a research preview for API users and subscribers.\nOpus 4.6 also comes with a longer context window — meaning that the program has a capacity to recall a greater amount of information per user session. The new model offers 1 million tokens of context, which is comparable to what the company’s Sonnet (versions 4 and 4.5) currently offers. Those context windows allow for work involving larger code bases and can also allow for the processing of larger documents, the company says.\nThe new version of Opus also integrates Claude directly into PowerPoint as an accessible side panel. This is a step up from PowerPoint’s previous integration with the chatbot. Previously, a user could tell Claude to create a PowerPoint deck, but the file would then have to be transferred to PowerPoint to edit the presentation, White said. Now the presentation can be crafted within PowerPoint, with direct help from Claude.\nWhite told TechCrunch that Opus has evolved from a model that was highly capable in one particular domain — software development — into a program that could be “really useful for a broader set” of knowledge workers. “We noticed a lot of people who are not professional software developers using Claude Code simply because it was a really amazing engine to do tasks,” he said. White added that the kinds of people the company has seen using it include not just software engineers, but product managers, financial analysts, and people from a variety of other industries.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nThe European Commission on Friday accused TikTok of purposefully designing its app for being “addictive,” calling out features such as infinite scroll, autoplay, and push notifications, as well as its recommendation engine.\nIn preliminary findings from an investigation that sought to determine TikTok’s compliance with the European Union’s far-reaching Digital Services Act, the Commission said the short video platform did not “adequately assess” how its design decisions could harm the well-being of its users, particularly minors and vulnerable adults.\nThe EU’s executive arm said the company disregarded “important indicators of compulsive use of the app” like the time users spend at night, and how often users open it.\n“By constantly ‘rewarding’ users with new content, certain design features of TikTok fuel the urge to keep scrolling and shift the brain of users into ‘autopilot mode’. Scientific research shows that this may lead to compulsive behaviour and reduce users’ self-control,” the Commission wrote in a statement.\nThe Commission said TikTok must change the “basic design” of its user interface by disabling features like infinite scroll, implementing screen time breaks, and changing its recommendation system.\nTikTok did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.\nTikTok does offer screen-time management tools and parental controls, but the European Commission said those tools don’t do enough to reduce the risks of its addictive design. “The time management tools do not seem to be effective in enabling users to reduce and control their use of TikTok because they are easy to dismiss and introduce limited friction. Similarly, parental controls may not be effective because they require additional time and skills from parents to introduce the controls,” the Commission wrote.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe allegations against TikTok come as social media platforms deal with heightened scrutiny across the world, with some governments pushing to ban young users from accessing social media altogether. In December, Australia mandated social media sites to deactivate accounts belonging to users under 16, and the U.K. and Spain are reportedly looking into similar measures. France, Denmark, Italy, and Norway have worked on similar age-restriction measures for social media platforms, and in the United States, 24 states have so far enacted age-verification laws.\nTikTok recently settled a major social media addiction lawsuit in the U.S., and it now has time to reply to the European Commission’s preliminary findings. Confirmed breaches of the DSA can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

The feature displays short story cards that users can swipe through and rate with a thumbs up or down.\nThese short swipeable stories are summarized from third-party sources to highlight interesting details and behind-the-scenes moments, the company says. \nWith this new feature, Spotify is giving its users access to a feature that isn’t available on rival platforms like Apple Music. \nAbout the Song is rolling out in beta on mobile in English for premium users in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia. \nImage Credits:Spotify\nUsers can access the new feature through the “Now Playing” screen by scrolling down to find the “About the Song” card on supported tracks, after which they can swipe through to explore the story behind the track. \n“Music fans know the feeling: A song stops you in your tracks, and you immediately want to know more,” Spotify wrote in a blog post. “What inspired it, and what’s the meaning behind it? We believe that understanding the craft and context behind a song can deepen your connection to the music you love.”\nIt’s been a busy week for Spotify, as About the Song isn’t the only feature it’s announced in recent days.\nYesterday, the streaming service shared that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to purchase physical copies of their favorite audiobooks directly through the app. Spotify also announced two new audiobook features, including “Page Match,” which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps.”\nEarlier this week, the company made lyrics translations available worldwide and introduced the ability to view lyrics when offline for all users, not just premium subscribers. Spotify also moved the location of lyrics, as they will now appear directly beneath the album artwork or the short, looping video that plays alongside the music.\nEarlier today, Spotify said it’s revamping its Developer Mode APIs, which developers use to test third-party applications. The changes include a mandatory premium account, a cap on the number of test users, and a limited set of API endpoints.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMeta is testing a stand-alone Vibes app, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday. Launched last September, Vibes lets you create and share short-form AI-generated videos and access a dedicated feed that displays AI videos from others.\nThink TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every video you come across is AI generated. Until now, the feed has lived in the Meta AI app. By making Vibes available outside of the Meta AI app, the company is positioning it as a more direct competitor to Sora, OpenAI’s AI-generated video and social app that launched shortly after Vibes.\n“Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,” Meta said in an emailed statement. “We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.”\nThe news was first reported by Platformer. \nMeta says it doesn’t share specific numbers but claims Vibes has performed well, with Meta AI usage continuing to grow steadily since its launch, which it believes signals demand for a stand-alone app.\nThe tech giant also notes that while users engage with content in Meta AI, a stand-alone app allows for a more focused experience for creation and engagement.\nVibes lets users generate a video from scratch or remix a video that they see on their feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.\nMeta says collaboration and sharing are on the rise, with many Vibes videos being messaged to friends, which the company says mirrors how people use Reels.\nIt’s worth noting that Meta told TechCrunch last week that, in addition to testing new premium subscriptions across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it’s going to explore subscriptions for AI features, including Vibes.\nAlthough Vibes has been free since its launch, Meta plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month. Meta plans to launch these test subscriptions in the coming months. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Friday, when SpaceX filed plans with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a million-satellite data center network, you might have thought Elon Musk was having a bit of fun with us. But a week later, it is clear that he is dead serious. \nThe most obvious step, of course, is the formal merger between SpaceX and xAI that went forward on Monday, officially drawing together Musk’s space and AI ventures in a way that makes a lot more sense if there’s some kind of joint infrastructure project planned. \nBut even beyond the merger, we’re starting to see the idea of orbital AI data clusters — essentially, networks of computers operating in space — cohere into an actual plan. On Wednesday, the FCC accepted the filing and set a schedule seeking public comment. It’s a pro forma step normally, but FCC chairman Brendan Carr took the unusual step of sharing the filing on X. Throughout his tenure as chairman, Carr has shown himself eager to help Trump’s friends and punish his enemies — so as long as Musk stays on Trump’s good side, the proposal is likely to sail through without issue.\nAt the same time, Elon Musk has started to flesh out the argument for orbital data centers in public. On a new episode of Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison’s podcast “Cheeky Pint,” which also featured guest Dwarkesh Patel, Musk laid out the basic case for moving most of our AI computing power into space. Essentially, solar panels produce more power in space, so you can cut down on one of the main operating expenses for data centers.\n“It’s harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space,” Musk said in the podcast. “Any given solar panel is going to give you about five times more power in space than on the ground, so it’s actually much cheaper to do in space.”\nClose listeners will note that there is a bit of a gap in the logic here! It’s true that solar panels produce more power in space, but since power isn’t the only cost in operating a data center and solar panels aren’t the only way to power a data center, it doesn’t follow that it’s cheaper to do the whole thing in orbit, as Patel noted in the podcast. Patel also raised concerns about servicing GPUs that fail during AI model training, but you’ll have to listen to the full episode for that.\n\nOverall, Musk was undeterred, marking 2028 as a tipping point year for orbital data centers. “You can mark my words, in 36 months but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,” Musk said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe didn’t stop there. “Five years from now, my prediction is we will launch and be operating every year more AI in space than the cumulative total on Earth,” Musk continued.\nFor context, as of 2030, global data center capacity will be an estimated 200 GW, which is roughly a trillion dollars’ worth of infrastructure when you’re just putting it on the ground.\nOf course, SpaceX makes its money by launching things into orbit, so all this is pretty convenient for Musk — particularly now that SpaceX has an AI company attached to it. And with the new SpaceX-xAI conglomerate headed for an IPO in just a few months, you can expect to hear a lot more about orbital data centers in the months ahead. With tech companies still pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into data center spending each year, there’s a real chance that not all the money will remain earthbound.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nIn May, AI sales automation startup Clay said it was allowing most of its employees to sell some of their shares at a $1.5 billion valuation. Coming just months after its Series B, Clay’s offer of liquidity was a rarity in a market where tender offers, as these types of secondary transactions are known, were still uncommon for relatively young companies.\nSince then, several other newer, fast-growing startups have allowed their staff to convert some of their stock into cash. Linear, a six-year-old AI-powered Atlassian rival, completed a tender offer at the same valuation as the company’s $1.25 billion Series C. More recently, the three-year-old ElevenLabs authorized a $100 million secondary sale for staff, at a valuation of $6.6 billion, double its previous value.\nAnd just last week, Clay, which has tripled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $100 million in one year, decided it was again time for its employees to cash in on the company’s fast growth. The eight-year-old startup announced that its staff can sell stock at a valuation of $5 billion, a more than 60% increase from its $3.1 billion valuation announced in August.\nThese secondary sales at increasingly higher valuations for young, perhaps still-unproven companies may initially appear to be a premature “cash-out” reminiscent of the 2021 bubble. The most infamous example of that time was Hopin, whose founder, Johnny Boufarhat, reportedly sold $195 million worth of his company’s stock just two years before the company’s assets were sold for a tiny fraction of its peak $7.7 billion valuation.\nBut there is a critical distinction between the 2021 boom and today’s market.\nDuring the ZIRP era, a large portion of the secondary deals provided liquidity almost exclusively to founders of buzzy companies like Hopin. In contrast, the recent transactions from Clay, Linear, and ElevenLabs are structured as tender offers that also benefit employees.\nWhile investors these days largely frown upon the outsized founder payouts of the 2021 boom, the current shift toward employee-wide tender offers is viewed far more favorably.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’ve done a lot of tenders, and I haven’t seen any drawbacks yet,” Nick Bunick, a partner at the secondary-focused VC firm NewView Capital, told TechCrunch.\nAs companies stay private longer and talent competition intensifies, allowing employees to turn some of their paper gains into cash can be a powerful tool for recruiting, morale, and retention, he said. “A little liquidity is healthy, and we’ve certainly seen that across the ecosystem.”\nAt the time of Clay’s first tender offer, co-founder Kareem Amin told TechCrunch that the main reason for giving employees a chance to cash out some of their otherwise-illiquid stock was to ensure that “the gains don’t just accumulate to a few people.”  \nSome fast-growing AI startups are realizing that without offering early liquidity, they risk losing their best talent to public companies or more mature startups like OpenAI and SpaceX, which regularly offer tender sales.\nWhile it’s hard not to see the positive aspects of allowing startup employees to reap cash rewards from their hard work, Ken Sawyer, co-founder and managing partner at secondary firm Saints Capital, pointed to unintended second-order effects of employee tenders. “It is very positive for employees, of course,” he said. “But it enables companies to stay private longer, reducing liquidity for venture investors, which is a challenge for LPs.”\nIn other words, relying on tenders as a long-term substitute for IPOs could create a vicious cycle for the venture ecosystem. If limited partners don’t see cash returns, they will be more reluctant to back the very VC firms that invest in startups.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nReddit suggested on Thursday that its AI-powered search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business — not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver impacting its bottom line. During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, it offered an update on its plans to merge traditional and AI search together and hinted that although search is not yet monetized, “it’s an enormous market and opportunity.”\nIn particular, the company believes that generative AI search will be “better for most queries.”\n“There’s a type of query we’re, I think, particularly good at — I would argue, the best on the internet — which is questions that have no answers, where the answer actually is multiple perspectives from lots of people,” said Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.\nTraditional search, meanwhile, is more like navigation — it’s a way to find the right link to a topic or subreddit. But LLMs can be good at this, too, if not better, he said. “So that’s the direction we’re going.”\nThe exec also noted that weekly active users for search over the past year grew 30% from 60 million users to 80 million users. Meanwhile, the weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers grew from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.\n“We’re seeing a lot of growth there, and I think there’s a lot of potential too,” Huffman added.\nReddit said it’s working to modernize the AI answers interface by making its responses more media-rich, and pilots of this are already underway.\nThe company is also thinking about how it can position itself when it’s not just a social site, but a place people come for answers. Reddit told investors on the call that it’s doing away with the distinction between logged-in and logged-out users starting in Q3 2026, as it will aim to personalize the site — using AI and machine learning — and make it relevant to whoever shows up.\nThe company announced in 2025 it was planning to combine its AI search feature, Reddit Answers, with its traditional search engine to improve the experience for end users. In the fourth quarter, Reddit said it had made “significant progress” in unifying its core search and its AI feature. It also released five new languages on Reddit Answers and is piloting dynamic agents along with search results that include “media beyond text.”\nThough Reddit sees value in its AI answers, it’s not been keeping that to itself. The company’s content licensing business, which allows other companies to train their AI models on its data, is growing, too. That business revenue is reported as part of Reddit’s “other” revenues (i.e., its non-ad revenue). This “other” revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to reach $36 million in Q4 and was up 22% to reach $140 million for 2025.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSometimes, it can seem like the AI industry is racing to see who can spend the most money on data centers. Whoever builds the most data centers will have the most compute, the thinking goes, and thus be able to build the best AI products, which will guarantee victory in the years to come. There are limits to this way of thinking — traditionally, businesses eventually succeed by making more money and spending less — but it’s proven remarkably persuasive for large tech companies.\nIf that is the game, Amazon does seem to be winning. \nThe company announced in its earnings on Thursday that it projects $200 billion in capital expenditures throughout 2026, across “AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites.” That’s up from the $131.8 billion in capex in 2025. It’s tempting to attribute the whole capex budget to AI. But unlike most of its competitors, Amazon has a significant physical plant, some of which is being converted for use by expensive robots, so the non-AI expenses aren’t so easy to wave away.\nGoogle is close behind. In its earnings on Wednesday, the company projected between $175 billion and $185 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, up from $91.4 billion the previous year. It’s significantly more than the company spent on fixed assets last year, and significantly more than most of its competitors are spending.\nMeta, which reported last week, projected $115 billion to $135 billion in capex spending for 2026, while Oracle (once the poster child for AI infrastructure) projects a measly $50 billion. Microsoft doesn’t have an official projection for 2026 yet, but the most recent quarterly figure was $37.5 billion, which pencils out to roughly $150 billion, assuming it keeps up. It’s a notable increase, and one that has led to investor pressure on CEO Satya Nadella — but it still puts the company in third place.\nFrom within the tech world, the logic here is simple. The revolutionary potential of AI is going to turn high-end compute into the scarce resource of the future, and only companies that control their own supply will survive. But while Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and others are frantically prepping for the compute desert of the future, their investors aren’t convinced. Each company saw its stock price plummet as investors balked at the hundreds of billions of dollars being committed, and companies with higher spends tended to drop more.\nCrucially, this isn’t just a problem for companies like Meta that haven’t figured out their AI product strategy yet. It’s everyone — even companies like Microsoft and Amazon with a robust cloud business and a straightforward take on how to make money in the AI era. The numbers are simply too high for investor comfort.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInvestor sentiment isn’t everything — and in this case, it may not do much to change the industry’s mind. If you believe AI is about to change everything (and the argument is pretty compelling at this point), you’d be a fool to change course just because Wall Street got jumpy. But going forward, Big Tech companies will be under a lot of pressure to downplay how expensive their AI ambitions really are.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nSpotify is changing how its APIs work in Developer Mode, its layer that lets developers test their third-party applications using the audio platform’s APIs. The changes include a mandatory premium account, fewer test users, and a limited number of API endpoints.\nThe company debuted Developer Mode in 2021 to allow developers to test their applications with up to 25 users. Spotify is now limiting each app to only five users, and requires devs to have a Premium subscription. If developers need to make their app available to a wider user base, they will have to apply for extended quota.\nSpotify says these changes are aimed to curb risky AI-aided or automated usage. “Over time, advances in automation and AI have fundamentally altered the usage patterns and risk profile of developer access, and at Spotify’s current scale, these risks now require more structured controls,” the company said in a blog post.\nThe company notes that development mode is meant for individuals to learn and experiment.\n“For individual and hobbyist developers, this update means Spotify will continue to support experimentation and personal projects, but within more clearly defined limits. Development Mode provides a sandboxed environment for learning and experimentation. It is intentionally limited and should not be relied on as a foundation for building or scaling a business on Spotify,” the company said. \nThe company is also deprecating several API endpoints, including the ability to pull information like new album releases, an artist’s top tracks, and markets where a track might be available. Devs will no longer be able to perform actions like request track metadata in bulk or get user profile details of others nor will they be able to pull an album’s record label information, artist follower details, and artist popularity.\nThis decision is the latest in a slew of measures Spotify has taken over the past couple of years to curb how much developers can do with its APIs. In November 2024, the company cut access to certain API endpoints that could reveal users’ listening patterns, including frequently repeated songs by different groups. The move also barred developers from accessing tracks’ structure, rhythm, and characteristics.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn March 2025, the company changed its baseline for extended quotas, requiring developers to have a legally registered business, 250,000 monthly active users, be available in key Spotify markets, and operate an active and launched service. Both moves drew ire from developers, who accused the platform of stifling innovation and supporting only larger companies rather than individual developers.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe computer systems of La Sapienza in Rome, one of the largest universities in Europe with around 120,000 students, have been down for three days following an apparent ransomware attack. \nIn a post and in stories on Instagram published Tuesday, the university said that it took down its systems out of precaution following the cyberattack, that it was investigating the incident and working on restoring all digital services, and that some communication channels such as email and workstations are “partially limited.” \nThe school also said that it was working to restore systems based on backups, which were not affected by the hack. \nAs of this writing, the Sapienza website remains down. \nItalian daily news outlet Il Corriere della Sera reported this week that the disruption is due to a ransomware attack, something that neither the school nor other authorities have confirmed so far. The hackers allegedly sent the university a link to a request for a ransom, which has a countdown of 72 hours, which would start only once the link is clicked. \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this attack, or the Femwar02 ransomware gang? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nLa Sapienza did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment sent via email. It’s unclear whether the university is able to accept email at the time we reached out.\nSpokespeople for Italy’s national cybersecurity agency, Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale (or ACN), which is investigating the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more information and if the attack was caused by ransomware.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn an article on Wednesday, Il Corriere reported that the hacking group behind the attack is called “Femwar02,” which was previously unknown prior to this incident. The gang used the BabLock malware, which was discovered in 2023 and is also known as Rorschach, according to the report.\nLa Sapienza said that exams are proceeding as normal, but students who want to sign up for exams must do so directly with professors. The school also set up “infopoints” on several locations on campus to provide information to students. \nLike other types of organizations, universities and schools are frequent targets of hackers. Last year, the notorious hacking group ShinyHunters hacked Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania and stole data — without using malware to encrypt its systems — in an effort to extort the schools. The hackers revealed this week that the schools did not pay the ransom.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nOpenAI has launched a new product to help enterprises navigate the world of AI agents, focusing on agent management as critical infrastructure for enterprise AI adoption.\nOn Thursday, AI giant OpenAI announced the launch of OpenAI Frontier, an end-to-end platform designed for enterprises to build and manage AI agents. It’s an open platform, which means users can manage agents built outside of OpenAI too.\nFrontier users can program AI agents to connect to external data and applications, which allows them to execute tasks far outside of the OpenAI platform. Users can also limit and manage what these agents have access to, and what they can do, of course.\nOpenAI said Frontier was designed to work the same way companies manage human employees. Frontier offers an onboarding process for agents and a feedback loop that is meant to help them improve over time the same way a review might help an employee.\nOpenAI touted enterprises, including HP, Oracle, State Farm, and Uber as customers, but Frontier is currently only available to a limited number of users with plans to roll out more generally in the coming months.\nThe company would not disclose pricing details in a press briefing earlier this week, according to reporting from The Verge. OpenAI declined to comment on pricing.\nAgent-management products become table stakes since AI agents rose to prominence in 2024. Salesforce has arguably the best-known such product, Agentforce, which the company launched in the fall of 2024. Others have quickly followed. LangChain is a notable player in the space that was founded in 2022 and has raised more than $150 million in venture capital. CrewAI is a smaller upstart that has raised more than $20 million in venture capital.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn December, global research and advisory firm Gartner released a report about this type of software and called agent management platforms both the “most valuable real estate in AI” and a necessary piece of infrastructure for enterprises to adopt AI.\nIt’s not surprising that OpenAI would release this platform in early 2026, as the company has made it clear that enterprise adoption is one of its main focus areas for this year. The company has also announced two notable enterprise deals this year with ServiceNow and Snowflake.\nStill, if OpenAI wants to be a meaningful player in the enterprise space, offering a product like Frontier is a promising step.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

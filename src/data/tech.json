During its 12 years as a private business, the one-time tech darling raised approximately $330 million in venture capital from top investors such as Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.\nUnlike traditional private equity firms, Bending Spoons buys companies that it intends to hold forever, aiming to turn them profitable by cutting costs, raising prices, and introducing new product features. In October, Bending Spoons announced a massive $270 million funding round that valued the company at $11 billion.\nBesides Bending Spoons, other investors follow the strategy of acquiring, fixing, and holding stalled software firms, often referred to as “venture zombie” companies. These firms include Constellation Software, Curious, Tiny, SaaS.group, Arising Ventures, and Calm Capital.\nAndrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, told TechCrunch that the firm buys “great companies” at low prices and quickly revives them to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins. \nAudited annual revenue was flat at about $325 million for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. Bending Spoons has agreed to pay approximately 1.7 times Eventbrite’s trailing 12 months’ revenue of $295 million. Despite this seemingly low revenue multiple, Eventbrite stockholders will receive $4.50 in cash per share, an 81% premium over the previous day’s $2.48 closing price.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n",

    "body": "\nAmazon announced a new product Tuesday called “AI Factories” that allows big corporations and governments to run its AI systems in their own data centers. Or as AWS puts it: Customers supply the power and the data center, and AWS plunks in the AI system, manages it, and can tie it into other AWS cloud services.\nThe idea is to cater to companies and governments concerned with data sovereignty, or absolute control over their data so it can’t wind up in a competitor’s or foreign adversary’s hands. An on-prem AI Factory means not sending their data to a model maker and not even sharing the hardware.\nIf that product name sounds familiar, it should. That’s what Nvidia calls its hardware systems that are chock-full of tools needed to run AI, from its GPU chips to its networking tech. This AWS AI Factory is, in fact, a collaboration with Nvidia, both companies say. \nIn this case, the AWS Factory will use a combination of AWS and Nvidia technology. Companies that deploy these systems can opt for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs or Amazon’s new Trainium3 chip. It uses AWS’ homegrown networking, storage, databases, and security and can tap into Amazon Bedrock — the AI model selection and management service, and AWS SageMaker AI, the model building and training tool.\nInterestingly, AWS is far from the only giant cloud provider installing Nvidia AI Factories. In October, Microsoft showed off its first of many-to-come AI Factories rolling out into its global data centers to run OpenAI workloads. Microsoft didn’t announce at the time that these extreme machines would be available for private clouds. Instead, Microsoft highlighted how it was leaning on a host of Nvidia AI Factory data center tech to build and connect its new “AI Superfactories,” aka new state-of-the-art data centers being built in Wisconsin and Georgia.\nLast month, Microsoft also outlined the data centers and cloud services that would be built in local countries to address the data sovereignty issue. To be fair, its options also include “Azure Local,” Microsoft’s own managed hardware that could be installed on customer sites.\nStill, it is a bit ironic that AI is causing the biggest cloud providers to invest so heavily in corporate private data centers and hybrid clouds like it’s 2009 all over again.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\nAs Discord prepares for a potential IPO, the platform is launching new commerce features to enhance the gaming experience for users while also generating new revenue streams for developers.\nAnnounced on Tuesday, the features allow users to purchase digital game items directly within Discord, eliminating the need to leave the platform. Users can also create wishlists for game items and send in-game items as gifts through direct messages.\nIf Discord becomes a public company, it will face financial scrutiny, so these additions also present a new monetization opportunity for both Discord and game developers. By enabling developers to sell digital goods directly on Discord, the platform helps them reach a wider audience beyond their own communities, potentially boosting revenue.\nThe initial rollout of these features is in partnership with the popular video game Marvel Rivals, which now has a dedicated store page within the game’s official Discord server. \nImage Credits:Discord\nMarvel Rivals is a smart choice for this launch, as it garnered 10 million players within 72 hours of its release last year, generated over $100 million in its first month, and has built a community of more than 4 million members on Discord.\nPlayers can now browse and purchase in-game items directly from the Marvel Rivals server, which includes items such as bundles, costumes, emotes, and emojis.\nAdditionally, users can create wishlists that friends can view and purchase as gifts. With the holiday season approaching, this feature is particularly timely, as it simplifies gift-giving for those looking to buy for gamer friends or family members. Plus, the ability to gift in-game items through DMs allows users to send gifts to friends even if they don’t play Marvel Rivals themselves.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe shop currently accepts U.S. currency and is available only on the desktop app for players in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, and Oceania.

    "body": "\nNew data shows ChatGPT’s growing influence as a referrer to e-commerce websites, as well as how small its slice of this market is currently.\nAccording to a new analysis by mobile app insights provider Apptopia, ChatGPT referrals to retailer mobile apps increased 28% year-over-year over the Black Friday holiday shopping weekend, running from Thanksgiving Day on Thursday through Sunday.\nHowever, the use of ChatGPT may not be benefiting smaller retailers as much as it’s helping to further entrench the e-commerce giants Amazon and Walmart. This year, Amazon’s share of ChatGPT referrals grew to 54%, up from 40.5% in 2024. Walmart’s share, meanwhile, increased from 2.7% last year to now 14.9%.\nThe data was collected by Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which is based on observed consumer activity on mobile devices. As it’s not first-party data, its figures are only estimates. For this analysis, the firm defined a referral session as a retail mobile app session that directly followed (within 30 seconds) a ChatGPT session.\nDespite the big jump from 2024, consumers’ use of AI chatbots to find e-commerce deals is still a small sliver of the overall referral market, Apptopia noted. Last year, ChatGPT’s referrals to e-commerce apps were only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday, and that figure only grew to 0.82% this year.\nIn this case, a referral session was anytime ChatGPT either gave the searcher a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from their chat session that brought them to the retail app.\nApptopia isn’t the only firm digging into how AI is impacting e-commerce during the busy holiday shopping season. Adobe also reported this week that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday, and those who landed on a retail site from an AI chatbot were 38% more likely to make a purchase.\nIn addition, Adobe said that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites on Cyber Monday increased by 670%. In the holiday shopping season so far (November 1 to December 1), AI traffic is up 760%, it noted.\n\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flags\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAmazon has announced it’s launching a new service that completes deliveries in 30 minutes or less in Seattle and Philadelphia. The new “ultra-fast” delivery option will allow Amazon to better compete with services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Instacart.\nCustomers will be able to order a range of different items, including milk, eggs, fresh produce, toothpaste, cosmetics, pet treats, diapers, paper products, electronics, seasonal items, over-the-counter medicines, chips, dips, and more, according to the company.\nPrime members can choose the fast delivery option for a $3.99 fee per order, while non-Prime members will have to pay $13.99. Orders below $15 will include a small-basket fee of $1.99.\nCustomers in Seattle and Philadelphia can now check the Amazon app and homepage and look for the “30-Minute Delivery” option in the navigation bar to see if it’s available in their area. \nAfter placing an order, customers can track their deliveries and tip drivers through the app. \n“Amazon is utilizing specialized smaller facilities designed for efficient order fulfillment, strategically placed close to where Seattle- and Philadelphia-area customers live and work,” Amazon explained in a blog post. “This approach prioritizes the safety of employees picking and packing orders, reduces the distance delivery partners need to travel, and enables faster delivery times.”\nThe move follows Amazon’s launch of a 15-minute delivery service in the United Arab Emirates in October. The company said at the time that some customers received their orders in as little as six minutes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe launch of the new service marks Amazon’s latest effort to enter the fast delivery market in the United States. In 2014, the e-commerce giant introduced a “Prime Now” service that offered one-hour deliveries, but the company discontinued it in 2021.\nAmazon has been working to expand its delivery options and announced in June that it plans to invest more than $4 billion to triple the size of its delivery network by 2026.  \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon Web Services on Tuesday announced three new AI agents it calls “frontier agents,” including one designed to learn how you like to work and then operate on its own for days.\nEach of these agents handle different tasks such as writing code, security processes like code reviews, and automating DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.\nPerhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called “Kiro autonomous agent” can work on its own for days at a time.\nKiro is a software coding agent based on AWS’s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was announced in July. While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company’s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called “spec-driven development.”\nAs Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently.\n“You simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,” AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday.\n“It actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,” he said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAmazon says Kiro maintains “persistent context across sessions.” In other words, it doesn’t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do.  It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention. \nGarman described a task like updating a bit of critical code used by 15 bits of corporate software. Instead of assigning and verifying each update, Kiro can be assigned to fix all 15 in one prompt. \nTo complete the automation of coding tasks, the cloud provider developed AWS Security Agent, an agent that works independently to identify security problems as code is written, tests it after the fact, and then offers suggested fixes. The DevOps Agent rounds out the trio, automatically testing the new code for performance issues, or compatibility with other software, hardware, or cloud settings.\nTo be sure, Amazon’s agents aren’t the first to claim long work windows. For instance OpenAI said last month that GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, its agentic coding model, is designed for long runs, too, up to 24 hours.\nIt’s also not totally clear that the biggest hurdle to agentic adoption is the context window (aka the ability to work continuously without stalling out). LLMs still have hallucination and accuracy issues that turn developers into “babysitters,” they say.  So developers often want to assign short tasks and verify quickly before moving on.\nStill, before agents can become like co-workers, context windows must grow bigger. Amazon’s tech is another big step in that direction. \n\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nAs OpenAI goes into “Code Red” over competitive pressures, Google announced it has begun testing a new feature that merges its AI Overviews with AI Mode in Search. That means that users who are provided with the now common AI-generated snapshot of key information on a topic or question above their search results can choose to go deeper by asking follow-up questions in a conversational interface.\nGoogle calls this conversational feature AI Mode. It launched to U.S. users this May, and to global users this August, allowing for back-and-forth chats with Google’s Gemini AI, in an experience similar to ChatGPT.\nHowever, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual.\nBut if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead.\nGoogle now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more. You may have thought you were starting a simple query, only to find yourself delving deeper into the topic.\n\n(1/2) Today we’re starting to test a new way to seamlessly go deeper in AI Mode directly from the Search results page on mobile, globally.This brings us closer to our vision for Search: just ask whatever’s on your mind – no matter how long or complex – and find exactly what you… pic.twitter.com/mcCS7oT2FI— Robby Stein (@rmstein) December 1, 2025\n\nWith the new test, announced on Monday, Google says users will be able to “seamlessly go deeper” in AI Mode directly from the Search results page. While the test is rolling out to users globally, it’s only available on mobile devices for the time being. \nThe rollout comes alongside a push inside Google’s AI rival, OpenAI, which is now delaying other products to focus on improving the chatbox experience. Thanks in part to the release of Gemini’s Nano Banana image model and other Gemini improvements, Gemini has grown to over 650 million monthly users as of November. Merging the conversational mode with AI Overviews, which has 2 billion monthly users, could give Gemini an edge in consumer adoption.\nNotes VP of Product for Google Search Robby Stein, in a post on X, “You shouldn’t have to think about where or how to ask your question.” Instead, he explained, users will continue to get an AI Overview as a helpful starting point, but will then be able to ask conversational follow-up questions in AI Mode from the same screen.\n“This brings us closer to our vision for Search: just ask whatever’s on your mind – no matter how long or complex – and find exactly what you need,” Stein wrote. \n\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

    "body": "\nGoogle announced on Tuesday that it is releasing a slew of Android 16 updates, along with new general Android and accessibility features. The rollout of the new Android 16 features, which are first coming to Pixel devices, marks a new chapter in how Android updates are delivered, as the company is moving from a single yearly update to more frequent releases.\nAndroid 16 is adding AI-powered notification summaries that condense long messages and group chats into quick, glanceable overviews. A new “Notification organizer” will automatically group and silence lower-priority notifications, such as promotions, news, and social alerts.\nThe update also brings more ways to customize devices, with users getting access to custom icon shapes, themed icons, and the option to automatically darken light apps, even those that don’t have their own native dark theme.\nAdditionally, there’s a new Parental Controls option within Android Settings that allows parents to set screen time limits, create downtime schedules, control app usage, and more for their children.\nImage Credits:Google\nThese updates are starting to roll out with Android 16 on eligible Pixel devices starting Tuesday.\nGoogle is also releasing several new Android features that aren’t specific to Android 16. A new beta feature called “Call Reason” allows users to flag calls to saved contacts as “urgent.” Recipients will see this on their incoming call screen and know it’s time-sensitive. If they miss the call, the “urgent” note will stay in their call history.\nGoogle is also launching “Expressive Captions” that display the full emotion of speech with tags like [sad] or [joyful], whether it’s a video message or a post on social media. The company says this will allow users to glean the full context of what’s being said when the sound is off.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe tech giant is making it easier to spot and exit unwanted group chats. If an unknown number invites a user to a group, they’ll get an alert that shows key information about the group. The user can then quickly choose to reply, leave the chat, or block and report the number.\nIn addition, Pinned tabs in Chrome now work the same way as on desktop, which means pinned pages stay saved at the front of the browser, letting users pick up where they left off.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle is also updating Circle to Search, its feature that allows users to search from anywhere on their phone by using gestures like circling, highlighting, scribbling, or tapping. Users can now analyze suspicious messages with the feature — after initiating Circle to Search, an AI Overview will appear indicating whether the message is likely a scam.\nFor accessibility updates, Google is enhancing its “Guided Frame” feature in the Pixel camera app. Previously, the feature has notified users about things like a face in the frame. Now, it will provide a more in-depth description, such as “one girl with a yellow T-shirt sits on the sofa and looks at the dog.”\nAdditionally, users no longer need to physically tap their phone to start using Voice Access, which allows users to control their Android devices with voice commands. Now, users just need to say “Hey Google, start Voice Access” to begin controlling their phone hands-free.\nThe company is also launching Fast Pair for hearing aids, starting with hearing aids from Demant, a Danish company that owns several major hearing aid brands, including Oticon, Sonic, and Bernafon.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNuclear startup Antares said Tuesday it has raised $96 million in Series B funding as it pursues its small modular reactor design.\nThe round, which was led by Shine Capital with participation from Alt Capital, Caffeinated, FiftyThree Stations, Industrious, and others, consists of $71 million in equity and $25 million in debt.\nAntares says it is targeting commercial, defense, and space-based applications with its R1 microreactor, which will produce between 100 kilowatts and 1 megawatt of electricity. The design uses TRISO fuel, which in Antares case is spheres of carbon- and ceramic-coated uranium embedded in graphite.\nThe startup is one of several companies that have benefited recently from renewed interest in nuclear power over the last six months.\nLast week, Amazon-backed X-energy said it had raised a $700 million Series D round, which came on the heels of an upsized $700 million Series C that closed in February. The company is also designing a reactor around TRISO fuel. Deep Fission, which had struggled to raise money as recently as April, went public in a $30 million reverse merger in September. \nAalo Atomics raised $100 million in August to build a demonstration data center powered by a microreactor, and in June, Nvidia contributed to a $650 million round for TerraPower, a small modular reactor startup also backed by Bill Gates.\nBig nuclear plants have been given a second chance, too.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEarlier this month, Microsoft partner Constellation Energy received a $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island by 2028. That project is expected to cost $1.6 billion to refurbish the reactor that was idled in 2019. In October, Google said it would work with NextEra Energy to reopen a nuclear power plant in Iowa that was damaged during a torrential downpour in 2020.\nEarlier this summer, Amazon bought 1.92 gigawatts of generating capacity from a Talen Energy nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Meta also said in June it would buy the clean energy attributes from a Constellation Energy nuclear power plant in Illinois.\nAnd while big nuclear has been a major beneficiary, the Trump administration is bullish on small nuclear’s potential to revive the industry’s fortunes in the coming decade. \nIn August, Antares was named one of 11 participants in the Department of Energy’s reactor pilot program, which aims to have at least three of those begin operation by July 4, 2026, a timeline that’s significantly faster than the nuclear industry is accustomed to.\nAntares has said it aims to demonstrate its reactor for the DOE next year and is planning to turn on its full-power reactor sometime in 2027.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAmazon Web Services is rolling out a slate of new homegrown AI models and a service for enterprise customers to build their own custom versions. The cloud provider launched Nova 2, a fleet of four new AI models to its Nova model family, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s AWS re:Invent keynote on Tuesday. \nThe first version of AWS Nova was announced last year at the company’s annual tech conference. At the time, the company released four text-generating models and one image-generating model. This year, AWS is giving the models an upgrade and launching an accompanying service.\n“The momentum has been really fantastic,” Garman said during his Tuesday keynote. “Nova has been, has grown to be used by tens of thousands of customers today, everyone from marketing giants to tech leaders like Infosys or Blue Origin or Robinhood to innovative startups like NinjaTech AI and today, we’re making Nova even better.”\nThe four new models include Nova 2 Lite, a more cost-effective reasoning model. Reasoning AI models “think” before they respond and can process text, images, and videos to generate text that’s meant for everyday tasks. Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning agent that can process text, images, videos and speech that is designed for “highly complex tasks” like coding.\nNova 2 Sonic is a new speech-to-speech model to be used for conversational AI. Nova 2 Omni is a multimodal reasoning and generation model that can process images, text, video and speech input, and produce both text and images.\nAlongside the model upgrades, AWS also announced a new service called Nova Forge which allows AWS cloud customers to build their own frontier version of AWS Nova models called Novellas for $100,000 a year, according to CNBC reporting. This service allows enterprises to access pre-trained, mid-trained or post-trained models for companies to then train on their own proprietary data.\nGarman said this will be able to solve some of the problems that arise when enterprises try to incorporate their own data into already-trained AI models.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The more you customize models, the more you add a bunch of data in post training, these models tend to forget some of that interesting stuff that it learned earlier the core reasoning,” Garman said. “It’s a little bit like humans trying to learn new language. When you start when you’re really young, it’s actually relatively easy to pick up, but when you try to, you learn a new language later in life, it’s actually much, much harder. Model training is kind of like this too.”\nCompanies including Reddit, Sony and Booking.com are early Nova Forge customers.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual enterprise tech event here.\n\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

It’s important to note that the game does not feature a multiplayer mode and players must be connected to the internet to play; offline gameplay is not available.\nOriginally released by Rockstar Games in 2010, Red Dead Redemption is set in the year 1911 during the Wild West era. Players assume the role of John Marston, a former outlaw searching for his kidnapped family. The mobile version includes the stand-alone expansion pack, “Undead Nightmare,” which follows Marston as he faces a zombie outbreak.\n\nThe inclusion of Red Dead Redemption in Netflix’s gaming lineup is a significant addition to its gaming strategy, especially considering that Netflix has faced challenges in previous years with fewer than 1% of its subscriber base engaging with the available games. The company’s investment in the space finally showed signs of growth in 2024, when estimates revealed that Netflix Games downloads increased 180% year-over-year.\nRed Dead Redemption is one of Rockstar’s most popular franchises, second only to the iconic Grand Theft Auto series. The game has attracted a dedicated base, and some players have been speculating that a prequel might be announced soon. The newly launched mobile game could potentially generate renewed interest in the franchise.\nThe launch comes on the heels of Netflix’s introduction of games on smart TVs in October. Subscribers can use their phones as controllers to play a collection of party titles, including Boggle Party, LEGO Party!, and Pictionary.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe rollout also occurs just two years after Netflix introduced Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy into its mobile game catalog.

    "body": "\nSimular, a startup building AI agents for Mac OS and Windows, has raised a $21.5 million Series A led by Felicis, with  NVentures (Nvidia’s venture arm), existing seed investor South Park Commons, and others joining in.  \nSimular is an interesting agentic startup because unlike others, it isn’t trying to control the browser but the PC itself. (Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention.) “We can literally move the mouse on the screen and do the click. So it’s more capable of doing, repeating whatever human activities in the digital world,” co-founder CEO Ang Li told TechCrunch, offering the example of copying and pasting data into a spreadsheet. \nOn Monday it announced the release of its 1.0 version for Mac OS. But it’s also working with Microsoft to develop an agent for Windows. The startup is one of five agentic companies accepted into the Windows 365 for Agents program Microsoft announced in mid November. (The others are Manus AI, Fellou, Genspark, and TinyFish.) As for the timeline for the Windows version, Li was vague except to say it promises to be as or more popular than the Mac version. \nAnother reason to watch Simular is the bona fides of the founders: Li is a continuous learning scientist who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, where he met his co-founder, reinforcement learning specialist Jiachen Yang. While their team published their fair share of papers, the work wasn’t strictly academic, Li said. It was intended to improve Google products, including Waymo. \nThat AI product background is helpful because, before the agentic future of Silicon Valley’s dreams can materialize, there are a host of technical problems to solve. One of the biggest is that LLMs hallucinate some percentage of the time.\nAgentic tasks can require completing thousands to millions of discrete steps. Not only can a hallucination at any single step invalidate all of the agent’s work, but hallucinations become statistically more likely as the number of steps grows.  \nOne way to solve this is to make the “non deterministic” LLM “deterministic,” meaning instead of allowing the LLM to be endlessly creative, its responses or actions are scripted the same each time. But that risks limiting the whole creative problem-solving aspect of an agent.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSimular is marrying the two. Its agent will iterate freely on the task, with the human user in the middle course correcting, until the agent achieves success. Then the human locks in that task’s workflow, which makes it deterministic, repeatable. \n“Our solution is, let agents keep exploring the successful trajectory. Once you found a successful trajectory, that becomes deterministic code,” Li explains. \nThe reason the startup can do this is because its work — which Li admits is still early — is not just an LLM wrapper that sends and retrieves data to a model.\n“We have a new technology which is not used by any other agent company. We call it ‘neuro symbolic computer use agents.’ It’s not fully LLM-based,” he said. “Our approach to solve hallucinations is to let the LLM write code which becomes deterministic. So if you have a workflow that works, the next time we run the same workflow, it’ll be successful as well.”  \nAnother benefit is that this deterministic code that performs a repeatable task is in the hands of the end user, not the LLM. “Once they have the code, they can trust it, because they can inspect it, they can audit it, they can see what’s going on,” Li says.\nTime will tell if this method is the magic that will bring agents into the hands of every worker. Li says his early beta customers include a car dealership automating VIN number searches, and HOAs extracting contract information from PDFs. And the company’s open source project (available only for Mac OS at the moment) has led to automations ranging from content creation to sales and marketing.  \nSimular previously raised a $5 million seed, bringing its total raised to about $27 million. Other investors in the company include Basis Set Ventures, Flying Fish Partners, Samsung NEXT, Xoogler Ventures, and podcaster and angel investor Lenny Rachitsky, the company says.\n\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flags\n",

    "body": "\nIt’s that time of year when companies are rolling out their Spotify Wrapped-like end-of-year recaps, letting users revisit the content they engaged with the most. While YouTube has offered a YouTube Music recap for the past few years, the platform announced on Tuesday that it’s now launching a separate experience for videos watched on the main service.\nYouTube Recap features up to 12 personalized cards that highlight a user’s top channels, interests, the evolution of their viewing habits, and personality-type assignment based on their watching preferences.\nFor instance, the “Skill Builder” personality type goes to users who are drawn to content that helps develop skills, while “Sunshiners” gravitate toward content that spreads positivity. “Trailblazers” watch content that’s original and challenges the norm.\nOther personality types include the “Wonder Seeker,” the “Connector,” and the “Dreamer,” among others.\nUsers will also be able to see their top artists and songs of the year, but they can get deeper insights in the YouTube Music app with their annual YouTube Music Recap, which started rolling out last week.\nImage Credits:YouTube\nRecap is available starting today for YouTube users in North America, with a global rollout coming this week. Users can find their Recap directly on the YouTube homepage or under the “You” tab. Recaps are accessible on mobile devices and desktop.\nYouTube says the new feature was requested by users and that it conducted over 50 different concept tests before landing on the final product.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlongside the launch of Recap, YouTube also released trend charts showcasing the top creators, podcasts, and songs of the year.\nMrBeast took the No. 1 spot for top creator for the sixth year in a row. The top podcast spot went to “The Joe Rogan Experience,” while Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga took the No. 1 spot for top song with “Die with a Smile.”\nYouTube Recap arrives the same day as Apple Music’s Replay and Amazon Music’s 2025 Delivered. Spotify has yet to release its highly anticipated Wrapped, suggesting that other companies are looking to get the jump on social media sharing.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nChatGPT’s unwelcome suggestion for a Peloton app during a conversation led to some backlash from OpenAI customers. People feared that ads had arrived, even for paid customers. OpenAI, however, clarified that the app suggestion was not an advertisement, but instead a poor attempt to integrate an app discovery feature within conversations.\nIn a post on X, which has since been viewed nearly 462,000 times, AI startup Hyperbolic’s co-founder, Yuchen Jin, shared a screenshot where ChatGPT seemingly suggested connecting the Peloton app in an unrelated conversation. Worse still, Jin noted he was a paid subscriber to ChatGPT’s $200 per month Pro Plan. At that price point, ads would not be expected.\nThe post, which was reshared and saved hundreds of times across X, received quite a bit of attention, as it seemed to indicate OpenAI was testing the insertion of ads into its paid product. Users complained that paying customers, especially, shouldn’t have to see app suggestions like this.\nOne person also pointed out that they couldn’t get ChatGPT to stop recommending Spotify to them, even though they were an Apple Music subscriber.\n\nHey, Kol. Thanks for flagging 🙏 This is not an ad (there's no financial component). It's only a suggestion to install Peloton's app. But the lack of relevancy makes it a bad/confusing experience. We're iterating on the suggestions and UX, trying to make sure they're awesome.— Daniel McAuley (@_dmca) December 1, 2025\n\nOpenAI’s data lead for ChatGPT, Daniel McAuley, later jumped into the thread to clarify that the Peloton placement was not an ad; it was “only a suggestion to install Peloton’s app.” He said there was “no financial component” to the appearance of the app suggestion.\nHowever, he admitted that “the lack of relevancy” to the conversation made it a bad and confusing experience, and OpenAI was iterating on the suggestions and the user experience.\nA company spokesperson also confirmed to TechCrunch that what users had spotted was one of the ways OpenAI had been “testing surfacing apps in ChatGPT conversations.” They pointed to OpenAI’s announcement in October about its new app platform, where the company noted that apps would “fit naturally” into user conversations.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“You can discover [apps] when ChatGPT suggests one at the right time, or by calling them by name. Apps respond to natural language and include interactive interfaces you can use right in the chat,” the post explained. \nBut that didn’t appear to be the case here, as the user claims they weren’t discussing anything related to health and fitness. Instead, as the screenshot shows, they had been chatting with the AI about a podcast featuring Elon Musk, where xAI was the topic being discussed. Inserting Peloton into this experience was unhelpful and a distraction. \nYet even if the app suggestion had been relevant, users may have still viewed it as an ad, given that it’s directing people to a product from a business that isn’t free. In addition, users can’t turn off these app suggestions, which may make them feel more intrusive.  \nThis user sentiment could have potential ramifications for OpenAI’s desire to replace the App Store experience, and apps that run on your phone, with integrated apps that run within ChatGPT. If users don’t want to see app suggestions, they could choose to switch to a competitor’s chatbot to avoid them.\nCurrently, ChatGPT apps are available to logged-in users outside of the EU, Switzerland, and the U.K., and the integrations are still in pilot testing. OpenAI partners with a number of app makers, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Zillow, and others. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

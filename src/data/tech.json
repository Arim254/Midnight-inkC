    "body": "\nA judge has denied Tesla’s request to overturn a $243 million jury verdict that held the automaker partially responsible for a fatal crash involving its Autopilot driver assistance system.\n“The grounds for relief that Tesla relies upon are virtually the same as those Tesla put forth previously during the course of trial and in their briefings on summary judgment — arguments that were already considered and rejected,” Hon. Judge Beth Bloom’s decision reads. “Furthermore, Tesla does not present additional arguments or controlling law that persuades this Court to alter its earlier decisions or the jury verdict.”\nLast August, a jury awarded a $243 million verdict against Tesla over its culpability in a 2019 fatal crash in Florida that killed Naibel Benavides and critically injured Dillon Angulo. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame, and attributed one-third to Tesla. Notably, the jury assessed punitive damages only against Tesla.\nTesla’s lawyers argued, in its request to reverse the ruling, that the blame rested on the driver, who helped cause the crash. \n",

Like its rival, the committee is pro-AI, but it’s pitching a different vision, one centered on transparency, safety standards, and public oversight.\nMeanwhile, the industry-backed PAC, Leading the Future, has already poured $1.1 million into ads attacking Bores, largely because he sponsored New York’s RAISE Act, which requires major AI developers to disclose safety protocols and report serious misuse of their systems.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n\n",

No one could have predicted that over 30 years later, Pixar would still be making Toy Story movies, nor could anyone have known that the latest installation in the franchise would pit Buzz Lightyear and a balding Woody against an evil AI tablet called Lilypad.\nBut sure enough, “Toy Story 5” confronts old-school toys like Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, and Slinky Dog against the sinister threat of technology.\nThe trailer shows Bonnie, the young girl who inherited Andy’s toys when he left for college in “Toy Story 2,” playing outside with her toys when a surprise package with the Lilypad tablet arrives for her. She becomes completely enraptured by the tablet, not even looking up from the screen when her parents tell her that screen time is over.\nThe “Toy Story 5” trailer makes the Lilypad — or, Lily — out to be a sinister villain. When Jessie confronts the tablet about Bonnie’s well-being, Lily seems not to be paying attention, so the cowgirl demands that the tablet listen to her.\n\n\n\n“I’m always listening,” Lily says ominously, regurgitating Jessie’s impassioned speech in a computerized tone… and then translates it into Spanish.\n“Tech’s invaded our house,” Jessie tells Woody. “I’m losing Bonnie to this device.”\nWoody replies, “Toys are for play, but tech is for everything.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCould “Toy Story 5” pull at the heartstrings of young children and get them to think twice about the consequences of excessive screen time? That may be a stretch.

An OpenAI spokesperson said Van Rootselaar’s activity did not meet the criteria for reporting to law enforcement; the company reached out to Canadian authorities after the incident.\nChatGPT transcripts weren’t the only concerning part of Van Rootselaar’s digital footprint. She apparently created a game on Roblox, the world simulation platform frequented by children, which simulated a mass shooting at a mall. She also posted about guns on Reddit. \nVan Rootselaar’s instability was also known to local police, who had been called to her family’s home after she started a fire while under the influence of unspecified drugs.\nLLM chatbots built by OpenAI and its competitors have been accused of triggering mental breakdowns in users who lose grip on reality while conversing with digital models.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8:55 AM PST · February 20, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThreads already has over 400 million monthly users, but Meta wants to push that number even higher. With the launch of a new Threads feature this week, the company is making it easier for Threads users to share posts on the app to their Instagram Stories — a move that could capitalize on Instagram’s larger user base to bring more people to Meta’s X competitor.\nThe company announced on Thursday a new feature that lets you share a Threads post to your Instagram Story without having to leave the Threads app, instead previewing how the post would look on your Story directly within the Threads app.\nThe app previously allowed you to share anyone’s Threads post to your Instagram Story similar to how you would reshare someone’s Instagram post to your Story. It also already offered tools for sharing posts to your Instagram Feed or DMs.\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta’s text-first, Twitter-like app Threads first launched in July 2023 and benefited from its ties with Instagram to rapidly grow its initial user base. To sign up, users had to authenticate with their Instagram credentials, which allowed Threads to populate with account details, like username, bio, and photo, as well as verification status and followers.\nWith one tap, users could immediately follow the accounts they already followed on Instagram — and those not on Threads would get a notification that someone had added them.\nIn the months and years following its launch, Meta has heavily leaned on its other, bigger social platforms to continue to grow Threads, including by displaying popular Threads posts on Facebook and adding a similar carousel of Threads posts to Instagram users. The company also made it easy for users to cross-post from Instagram and Facebook to Threads, which also helped boost adoption. \nThese moves have paid off. Data from market intelligence provider Similarweb last month indicated that Threads is now seeing more daily usage than Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices. (X still dominates on the web, however.) Threads’ numbers overall have been steadily growing as well, doubling usage from 200 million monthly active users in August 2024 to 400 million monthly users as of August 2025. The company announced in October that Threads reached 150 million daily active users, as well. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nEven without a background in accounting, anyone who has ever glanced at a 10-K or 10-Q can tell that preparing financial statements is a complex, tedious process.\nWhile legacy platforms like Workiva and Donnelley Financial Solutions aim to streamline financial reporting, longtime accountants Mary Antony (pictured right) and Kelsey Gootnick (pictured center) found themselves exhausted by various manual hurdles within these tools (co-founder and CTO Jared Tibshraeny is pictured left).\nThe duo met seven years ago at Flexport, where Gootnick served as the company’s controller and Antony served as assistant controller. They stayed in touch even after Antony moved to Miro and Gootnick to Hopin and later Thrive Global.\nNo matter where they worked, Antony and Gootnick kept running into the same manual challenges.\n“The way financial statements come together, it’s just patched together in a lot of spreadsheets, moved into a bunch of Word documents, emailed back and forth between people,” Antony told TechCrunch.  \nSo, in 2023, the pair decided to launch InScope, an AI-powered financial reporting platform that helps companies and accounting firms automate many aspects of the financial statement preparation process. The startup just raised $14.5 million in Series A funding led by Norwest, with participation from Storm Ventures and existing backers Better Tomorrow Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\nWhile InScope isn’t fully automating the generation of income statements and balance sheets yet, it automates a vast amount of the manual busy work, from verifying math to formatting. Simply ensuring that dollar signs and commas are uniform and correctly placed can save accountants up to 20% of their time, according to Antony, InScope’s CEO.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOver the last 12 months, InScope has grown its customer base by 5x, attracting significant accounting firms such as CohnReznick, currently ranked in the top 15 nationally.\nOf course, it may be a while before accountants — a profession Antony describes as risk-averse — feel comfortable letting AI fully automate financial statement preparation. Nonetheless, that remains InScope’s ultimate goal.\nNorwest partner Sean Jacobsohn told TechCrunch that he invested in InScope after he heard from multiple clients that the startup’s product saves them a lot of time.\nJacobsohn is convinced that InScope stands out because few founders possess the specific expertise required to reinvent financial reporting technology.\n“It’s a very complex space, and you need to be able to have been in the shoes of the buyer before,” he said.\nAntony agrees that accountants are not typically the type to launch startups. Fortunately, she and Gootnick developed their entrepreneurial instincts through years of operating within the fast-paced cultures of other high-growth startups.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

The tech giant said it’s shifting focus for Horizon Worlds to be “almost exclusively mobile” and that it’s “explicitly separating” its Quest VR platform from the virtual world.\nMeta’s Reality Labs division for VR and smart glasses development has lost nearly $80 billion since 2020. The update to Horizon Worlds, and other recent moves, signals that Meta is significantly rethinking its VR ambitions.\nLast month, the company reportedly laid off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — and shut down several VR game studios. Additionally, it was reported that the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.” \nHorizon Worlds originally launched in 2021 as a VR platform and later rolled out to the web and mobile. Meta said Thursday that to “truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”\nBy going mobile-first, Horizon Worlds is positioning itself to compete with popular platforms like Roblox and Fortnite.\n“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks,” Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, said in the blog post. “You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus.”\nRyan went on to note that Meta is still focused on VR hardware. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” Ryan wrote. \nMeta’s metaverse ambitions have effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. After shifting its Reality Labs investments away from the metaverse, Meta is now focused on developing AI wearables and advancing its own AI models. \nDuring Meta’s latest earnings call last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, “It’s hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren’t AI glasses.”\nThe exec also stated that sales of Meta’s glasses tripled within the last year, calling them “some of the fastest-growing consumer electronics in history.”\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLucid Motors is laying off 12% of its workforce in a bid to “improve operational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability,” according to an internal memo that was obtained by TechCrunch. \nHourly workers on the manufacturing, logistics, and quality teams are not affected by the cuts, according to the memo, which was sent to employees being spared by the layoffs. It’s unclear exactly how many workers are being laid off, but it is likely in the hundreds. Lucid Motors reported having 6,800 full-time employees globally at the end of 2024.\n“Saying goodbye to colleagues is never easy,” interim CEO Marc Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted by today’s actions, and we are providing severance, bonus, continued health benefits, and transition support to help them through this period.” The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe cuts come as the company is in the middle of ramping up production and deliveries of its Gravity SUV. While Lucid Motors struggled with Gravity production and quality issues during the first few months, the company has been able to pick up the pace, and ultimately doubled its 2024 output last year.\nThe company is also preparing to launch a more affordable mid-size EV later this year that is expected to cost around $50,000. It’s collaborating with Uber and autonomous vehicle company Nuro on launching a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area this year, too. The company is scheduled to release its financial results for 2025 next week.\n“Importantly, today’s actions do not affect our strategy,” Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “Our core priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to focus on the start of production of our Midsize platform. With disciplined execution, we are also focused on further expansion into the robotaxi market, continued ADAS and software development, and growth in sales of Lucid Gravity and Air across existing and new geographies.”\nLucid Motors has now gone almost a full year without a permanent CEO. Peter Rawlinson, who was the company’s chief executive and chief technical officer, abruptly resigned on February 25, 2025. Since then, Lucid Motors has seen a significant amount of turnover in its executive ranks, including the loss of its chief engineer, who sued the company in December for wrongful termination and discrimination. (Lucid Motors has called his legal claims “absurd.”)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nSarvam, an Indian AI startup focused on building models for local languages and users, on Friday launched its Indus chat app for web and mobile users, entering a fast-growing market dominated by global players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.\nThe launch comes as India has become a key battleground for generative AI adoption. Recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said ChatGPT has more than 100 million weekly active users in India, while Anthropic said India accounts for 5.8% of total Claude usage, second only to the U.S.\nIndus serves as a chat interface for its newly announced Sarvam 105B model, the company’s 105-billion-parameter large language model. The app’s launch comes two days after Bengaluru-based Sarvam unveiled its 105B and 30B models at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi earlier this week. At the summit, the startup also outlined enterprise initiatives and hardware plans and announced partnerships with companies including HMD to bring AI to Nokia feature phones and Bosch for AI-enabled automotive applications.\nCurrently available in beta on iOS, Android, and the web, the Indus app allows users to type or speak queries and receive responses in text and audio. Users can sign in using their phone number, Google or Microsoft account, or Apple ID, though the service appears to be limited to India for now.\nImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\nThe app currently comes with some limitations. Users cannot delete their chat history without deleting their account, and there is no option to turn off the app’s reasoning feature, which can sometimes slow response times. Sarvam has also warned that access may be restricted as it gradually expands its compute capacity.\n“We’re gradually rolling out Indus on a limited compute capacity, so you may hit a waitlist at first. We will expand access over time,” Sarvam co-founder Pratyush Kumar wrote on X, adding that the company is seeking feedback from users.\nFounded in 2023, Sarvam has raised $41 million to date from investors, including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Peak XV Partners, and Khosla Ventures as it builds large language models tailored for India.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSarvam is one of a small but growing group of Indian startups attempting to build domestic alternatives to global artificial intelligence platforms as India seeks greater control over its AI infrastructure.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA U.S. federal court has sentenced a Ukrainian man to five years in prison for his part in a long-running identity theft operation that helped overseas North Korean workers gain fraudulent employment at dozens of U.S. companies.\nU.S. prosecutors brought charges in 2024 against Oleksandr Didenko, 29, a resident of Kyiv, for setting up North Koreans with stolen identities of U.S. citizens to get hired and earn a wage. Under this scheme, the workers’ earnings were funneled back to Pyongyang, which the regime used to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program.\nThis is the latest in a string of recent convictions of individuals involved in facilitating ongoing North Korean so-called “IT worker” schemes. Security researchers have described North Korean workers as a “triple threat” to U.S. and Western businesses, as they violate U.S. sanctions, all the while enabling North Koreans to steal sensitive company data, and then later extort those victim companies into not publicly releasing corporate secrets.\nProsecutors said Didenko ran a website called Upworksell, which allowed people working overseas, including North Koreans, to buy or rent stolen identities for gaining employment with U.S. firms. Didenko handled more than 870 stolen identities, per the Justice Department.\nThe FBI seized Upworksell in 2024 and diverted its traffic to its own servers. Polish authorities arrested Didenko, who was then extradited to the U.S. and later pleaded guilty.\nA screenshot showing Upworksell’s website at the time it was seized by the FBI (ImagE: TechCrunch/screenshot)\nIn a statement this week, the U.S. Department of Justice said Didenko also paid people to receive and host computers at their homes in California, Tennessee, and Virginia. These “laptop farms” are rooms containing racks of open laptops, allowing North Koreans to remotely perform their work as if they were physically in the United States.\nSecurity giant CrowdStrike said last year that it has seen a sharp rise in the number of North Korean workers infiltrating companies, often as remote developers or other technical software engineering jobs. The scheme is among many that the North Korean regime uses to enrich itself, while unable to use the global financial system, thanks to international sanctions.\nNorth Koreans are also known to impersonate recruiters and VCs in efforts to trick unsuspecting high-profile and high-net-worth victims into granting access to their computers, including crypto.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nPeak XV announced on Friday that it has raised $1.3 billion across new India and Asia-focused funds. The firm, which now manages more than $10 billion in assets, is sharpening its focus on artificial intelligence and cross-border bets amid intensifying competition for deals in the region.\nThe capital will be deployed across its India seed and venture funds as well as its APAC vehicle. A majority is earmarked for India, with the firm expecting to invest the pool over the next two to three years, managing director Shailendra Singh said in an interview on Friday.\nPeak XV split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, in an effort to separate the India-focused portions of Sequoia’s portfolio. The firm now counts more than 450 portfolio companies across fintech, software, and consumer internet, spanning seed to growth stages.\nThe firm’s new fundraise comes as New Delhi hosts the AI Impact Summit, drawing major technology players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. At the event, General Catalyst outlined plans to invest $5 billion in the country over the next five years, sharply increasing its earlier commitment to the market.\nSingh said Peak XV is not trying to match rivals dollar-for-dollar, emphasizing that the firm’s priority is generating strong returns rather than maximizing assets under management. The firm will continue to size its funds based on where it sees the best opportunity to deliver “high-performing funds,” he said.\nHe added that Peak XV is still building its presence in the U.S. and is selective about where it competes. “In the U.S. market, we are an underdog — and that’s great,” Singh said, adding that the firm is focusing on areas where its experience in software, developer tools, and fintech gives it an edge.\nThe latest fundraise follows a period of leadership changes at Peak XV, including the recent departures of senior partner Ashish Agrawal and investors Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma. Singh told TechCrunch the firm retains significant experience on its leadership team, noting that five of its seven managing partners have been with Peak XV for more than a decade. The broader Peak XV team includes more than 30 full-time investors, with about a dozen leading investments across its markets.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPeak XV has returned more than $7 billion in cash to investors since inception, Singh said, adding that 35 of its portfolio companies have gone public. He declined to specify distributions since the firm’s split from Sequoia Capital. In September 2024, TechCrunch reported that the firm had returned about $1.2 billion in the year.\nAhead of the current raise, Peak XV’s prior fund was sized at $2.85 billion in late 2021, before the firm split from Sequoia Capital. That figure was later reduced to about $2.4 billion as part of what Singh described as a disciplined approach to capital. The earlier pool included Peak XV’s India growth strategy, and Singh said the firm does not plan to raise a new growth fund until more of that dry powder is deployed.\nSingh expects to deploy the new capital primarily into AI, fintech, and consumer startups, while also seeing emerging opportunities in deep tech. The firm has made more than 80 investments in AI startups to date. He added that the U.S.-India ties are becoming increasingly important as more founders in the region build for global markets.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\nLoading the player…\n\nThe generative AI boom minted a startup a minute. But as the dust starts to settle, two once-hot business models are looking more like cautionary tales: LLM wrappers and AI aggregators. \nDarren Mowry, who leads Google’s global startup organization across Cloud, DeepMind, and Alphabet, says startups with these hooks have their “check engine light” on.\nLLM wrappers are essentially startups that wrap existing large language models, like Claude, GPT, or Gemini, with a product or UX layer to solve a specific problem. An example would be a startup that uses AI to helps students study.\n“If you’re really just counting on the back end model to do all the work and you’re almost white-labeling that model, the industry doesn’t have a lot of patience for that anymore,” Mowry said on this week’s episode of Equity. \nWrapping “very thin intellectual property wrapped around Gemini or GPT-5” signals you’re not differentiating yourself, Mowry says. \n“You’ve got to have deep, wide moats that are either horizontally differentiated or something really specific to a vertical market” for a startup to “progress and grow,” he said. Examples of the deep moat LLM wrapper type include Cursor, a GPT-powered coding assistant, or Harvey AI, a legal AI assistant.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn other words, startups can no longer expect to slap a UI on top of a GPT and get traction on their product, like they could, perhaps, in mid-2024 when OpenAI launched its ChatGPT store. The challenge now is to build sustainable product value. \nAI aggregators are a subset of wrappers — they’re startups that aggregate multiple LLMs into one interface or API layer to route queries across models and give users access to multiple models. These companies typically provide an orchestration layer that includes monitoring, governance, or eval tooling. Think: AI search startup Perplexity or developer platform OpenRouter, which provides access to multiple AI models via a single API. \nWhile many of these platforms have gained ground, Mowry’s words are clear to incoming startups: “Stay out of the aggregator business.”\nGenerally speaking, aggregators aren’t seeing much growth or progression these days because, he says, users want “some intellectual property built in” to ensure they’re routed to the right model at the right time based on their needs — not because of behind-the-scenes compute or access constraints.\nMowry has been in the cloud game for decades, cutting his teeth at AWS and Microsoft before setting up shop at Google Cloud, and he’s seen how this plays out. He said the situation today mirrors the early days of cloud computing in the late 2000s/early 2010s as Amazon’s cloud business started taking off. \nAt that time, a crop of startups sprang up to resell AWS infrastructure, marketing themselves as easier entry points that provided tooling, billing consolidation, and support. But when Amazon built its own enterprise tools and customers learned to manage cloud services directly, most of those startups were squeezed out. The only survivors were the ones who added real services, like security, migration, or DevOps consulting. \nAI aggregators today face similar margin pressure as model providers expand into enterprise features themselves, potentially sidelining middlemen. \nFor his part, Mowry is bullish on vibe coding and developer platforms, which had a record-breaking year in 2025 with startups like Replit, Lovable, and Cursor (all Google Cloud customers, per Mowry) attracting major investment and customer traction.\nMowry also expects strong growth in direct-to-consumer tech, in companies that put some of these powerful AI tools into the hands of customers. He pointed to the opportunity for film and TV students to use Google’s AI video generator Veo to bring stories to life.\nBeyond AI, Mowry also thinks biotech and climate tech are having a moment — both in terms of venture investment going into the two industries and the “incredible amounts of data” startups can access to create real value “in ways we would never have been able to before.”\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

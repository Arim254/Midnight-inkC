It said that Veo 3.1 builds on May’s Veo 3 release and generates more realistic clips and adheres to prompts better.\nThe model allows users to add an object to the video and have it blend into the clip’s style, Google said. Soon, users will be able to remove an existing object from the video in Flow, too.\nVeo 3 already has edit features such as adding reference images to drive a character, providing the first and last frame to generate a clip using AI, and the ability to extend an existing video based on the last few frames. With Veo 3.1, Google is adding audio to all these features to make the clips more lively. \nThe company is rolling out the model to its video editor Flow, the  Gemini App, along with Vertex and Gemini APIs. It said that since Flow’s launch in May, users have created more than 275 million videos on the app. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

The company is pulling in roughly $13 billion in annual revenue, with 70% coming from everyday people paying $20 a month to chat with an AI, according to the Financial Times. That’s pretty wild when you consider ChatGPT has 800 million regular users,  but only 5% are actually paying subscribers.\nRaking in billions though it may be, OpenAI has also committed to spending over $1 trillion over the next decade (yes, trillion). The company has recently locked in deals for more than 26 gigawatts of computing capacity from Oracle, Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — infrastructure that’ll cost vastly more than what’s coming in.\nTo bridge this gap, OpenAI is getting creative, reports the FT. A five-year-plan includes exploring government contracts, shopping tools, video services, consumer hardware, and even becoming a computing supplier itself through its Stargate data center project.\nA growing number of businesses need the math to work out. Some of America’s most valuable companies are now leaning on OpenAI to fulfill major contracts, notes the FT; if OpenAI falters (no pressure!), it could potentially destabilize the broader U.S. market.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Spotify\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:17 AM PDT · October 15, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nSpotify on Wednesday upgraded its AI DJ feature — available to Premium subscribers — with a handful of new features, including the ability to send in your requests by typing, not just using voice commands. \nThe feature works with both English and Spanish requests, as Spotify’s Spanish-language DJ, called DJ Livi, now accepts music requests. \nThe AI DJ feature was updated earlier this year to accept voice requests, instead of only playing tunes Spotify thinks that you’ll like. However, that feature was only available to the English-language AI DJ until today.\nTexting with an AI assistant is now a common behavior, thanks to the rising popularity of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini. These services allow for multi-modal inputs, meaning you can either talk, text, or upload images and files as part of your request. As more people have gotten used to shifting back and forth between input methods, Apple rolled out a version of its Siri assistant that can also be reached by text.\nIt’s a natural next step for Spotify’s AI feature to accept text input, as well, given that users are often engaged with the streaming service when out and about, commuting, or in a quiet space where they don’t want to disturb others by issuing voice commands. \nIn addition to the new texting feature, Spotify says that the AI DJ will also now offer personalized prompt suggestions to help inspire you if you’re not sure what you want to listen to next. \nTo access the DJ, you simply search for the term “DJ” on Spotify and then press play to start your curated selection of music. If you want to change the music, you can tap the DJ button in the bottom-right of the screen, then offer your suggestion via voice or text. \nSpotify notes the DJ can handle requests that combine genre, mood, artist, or activity. The feature is currently live in English and Spanish in over 60 markets worldwide.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAI hyperscaler startup Nscale has signed a sizable deal with Microsoft to bring Nvidia AI hardware to multiple data centers.\nThe AI cloud provider announced that it signed a deal with Microsoft to bring approximately 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs to three data centers in Europe and one in the U.S. on Wednesday.\nThese GPUs will be delivered through Nscale-owned operations and through a joint venture with investment company Aker, one of Nscale’s investors.\nAbout half of these GPUs, 104,000, will head to a data center in Texas leased by Ionic Digital, over the next 12 to 18 months. Nscale plans to increase its footprint at this location to 1.2 gigawatts, the company stated.\nNscale will also deploy 12,600 GPUs to the Start Campus data center in Sines, Portugal, starting in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe deal builds on previous plans with both Microsoft and Aker regarding data centers in Norway and the United Kingdom. Nscale will send 23,000 GPUS to its Loughton, England campus starting in 2027, and send the remaining 52,000 GPUs to Microsoft’s AI campus in Narvik, Norway.\n“This agreement confirms Nscale’s place as a partner of choice for the world’s most important technology leaders,” Josh Payne, founder and CEO of Nscale, said in a company press release. “Few companies are equipped to deliver GPU deployments at this scale, but we have the experience and have built the global pipeline to do so.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s a bold claim by Payne, considering that Nscale was founded in 2024. Since its launch, the company has raised more than $1.7 billion from strategic partners including Aker, Nokia and Nvidia. Nscale has also raised from investors like Sandton Capital Partners, G Squared and Point72, among others. Payne told the Financial Times that the company is looking at an IPO as early as the end of next year.\n“The pace with which we have expanded our capacity demonstrates both our readiness and our commitment to efficiency, sustainability and providing our customers with the most advanced technology available. It’s a clear signal that Nscale is setting a new standard for how the next wave of AI infrastructure will be delivered,” Payne said in the release.\nGPU deals have picked up in recent weeks. OpenAI announced it was purchasing six gigawatts worth of chips from AMD last week. OpenAI also recently inked a deal with Nvidia in which Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in the company in exchange for 10 gigawatts worth of chips in September. \n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

When you are locked out of your account because you lost your device or forgot your password. This setting is under the security tab on your Google Accounts page.\nImage Credit\nWhen you are locked out, you can select a recovery contact as the backup method, and they will get a number, which will be valid for 15 minutes, that you will have to verify to log in to your account again. You can add 10 recovery contacts to your account, and they will have to approve your request to be added as one. Once you add a recovery contact, you can’t use them again for seven days.\nThe company is also adding sign-in with mobile number as a recovery method, which is particularly helpful when you lose a device. The tool automatically identifies all accounts linked with a particular phone number. You can use your lock-screen passcode or pattern from the previous device to verify yourself. This feature is gradually rolling out worldwide.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe company launched on-device protection for messages for Pixel devices to detect scam and spam messages. Google is now baking in spam link detection in Google Messages for all users. When you click on a suspicious message, the app will warn you and stop you from visiting that page.\nImage Credits: Google\nFor more technically inclined people, the company is adding a key verifier in Google Messages. This helps identify the other person and ensures that your messages are end-to-end encrypted and private. Users with Android 10 and later can scan a QR code for your contact for verification.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits: Google\nGoogle is also introducing a new game called Be Scam Ready to educate users about different fraud and scam use cases.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSemiconductor design company Arm is partnering up with Meta to enhance the social media giant’s AI systems amid an unprecedented infrastructure buildout. Under the partnership, Meta’s ranking and recommendation systems will move to Arm’s Neoverse platform, which was recently optimized for AI systems in the cloud, among other implementations.\n“AI is transforming how people connect and create,” Santosh Janardhan, Meta’s head of infrastructure, said in a statement. “Partnering with Arm enables us to efficiently scale that innovation to the more than 3 billion people who use Meta’s apps and technologies.”\nBest known for its mobile CPU architecture, Arm’s GPU offerings have often been overshadowed by competitors like Nvidia. But Arm is now emphasizing its advantage in low-power deployments.\n“AI’s next era will be defined by delivering efficiency at scale,” Rene Haas, Arm’s CEO, said in a statement. “Partnering with Meta, we’re uniting Arm’s performance-per-watt leadership with Meta’s AI innovation.”\nThe multi-year partnership comes as Meta invests in vastly expanding its data center network to keep pace with anticipated demand for AI services. One project, code-named “Prometheus,” is expected to come online with multiple gigawatts of power in 2027. Construction is currently underway in New Albany, Ohio, and a 200-megawatt natural gas project is being constructed to directly serve the project’s power needs.\nMeta is also building a data center campus, code-named “Hyperion,” across 2,250 acres in northwest Louisiana that’s meant to deliver 5 gigawatts of computational power when complete. Construction is expected to continue through 2030, although some portions may come online before then.\nCrucially, Arm and Meta are not exchanging ownership stakes or significant physical infrastructure, setting this partnership apart from a number of recent AI infrastructure deals. Nvidia has been particularly aggressive with its investments — it recently committed to a $100 billion phased investment into OpenAI, as well as billion-dollar investments into Elon Musk’s xAI, Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab, and French AI lab Mistral.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA rival to both Nvidia and Arm, AMD recently committed to supplying OpenAI with 6 gigawatts worth of compute capacity. As part of the deal, OpenAI will receive AMD stock options worth as much as 10% of the company.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nAs AI makes it easier to create bots that act ever more human-like, Elon Musk’s X is developing a new feature that would expose more information about the users behind an X profile, in an effort to help people better understand who they’re talking to on the platform. \nAccording to a new post by X’s head of product Nikita Bier, the social network will begin experimenting with displaying more information on user profiles, including details such as the date the account was created, its location, the number of username changes it has undergone, and how it’s utilizing X’s service.\n\nWhen you read content on X, you should be able to verify its authenticity. This is critical to getting a pulse on important issues happening in the world.As part of that, we're experimenting with displaying new information on profiles, including which country an account is… pic.twitter.com/OYgT1OiJdA— Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) October 14, 2025\n\nThe idea is that by exposing some of these details, users will be able to make a more informed decision about whether someone is operating an authentic account or if they’re possibly a bot or bad actor attempting to sow misinformation. \nFor instance, if an account’s bio claims they’re based in a U.S. state, but their account information shows it’s based overseas, you may suspect the account has another agenda.\nSimilarly, if it shows they’ve downloaded the X app in an international app store, but pretend they’re from the U.S., you may also question their legitimacy. (That’s not to say that someone couldn’t have started an account elsewhere and then relocated to the U.S., but it’s a signal that could be combined with others — like multiple username changes, perhaps — that could raise red flags.) \nBier said that X will begin testing the feature first on some X employee profiles next week to get feedback before rolling it out more broadly. He also noted in a response to a question about user privacy that people would be able to opt out of having this information displayed. However, he pointed out, “if a user configures [the privacy toggles], that will likely be highlighted on their profile.” \nHe also addressed concerns over exposing people’s location, given that there are some areas where speech could have penalties, saying that X may substitute region for country in those cases. \nThe idea of displaying more information about a social media account to help users understand who they may be engaged with on social media is not new. In a recent interview at Bloomberg’s Screentime conference, for instance, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that users on the photo and video-sharing app today could visit someone’s profile and see a similar set of information. \n“Today, if you go to my profile, you can go to ‘About this profile,’ and you can see how long I’ve had this profile, what country I’m based in, how many times I’ve changed my username — a series of signals that you can use to decide how much you want to trust or not trust,” he said, noting that Instagram may “do more” to provide additional context in the future. \nThe changes on X, if they roll out publicly, could help to address issues around trust to some extent, though scammers and spammers often have effective ways of working around attempts at exposure. \nThe news follows a recent bot purge on X, where the company removed 1.7 million bots engaging in reply spam. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Waymo\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2:00 AM PDT · October 15, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nWaymo said on Wednesday it will offer a commercial robotaxi service in London in 2026, marking the Alphabet-owned company’s second international expansion following Tokyo.\nThe announcement follows weeks of speculation fueled by a couple of London-based job postings. Waymo already has ties to the U.K: In 2019, the company acquired Latent Logic, a U.K. startup spun out of Oxford University’s computer science department that uses a form of machine learning called imitation learning to make self-driving car simulation more realistic. Waymo launched an engineering hub in Oxford as part of the acquisition.\nIn a blog post, Waymo said its all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles — equipped with self-driving technology — will begin driving on London’s public roads in the coming weeks. Waymo will start with human safety drivers behind the wheel before it launches driverless testing and eventually invites the public to hail its robotaxis, a strategy that it has used in other commercial markets such as Phoenix and San Francisco.\nWaymo wouldn’t provide further details on when it would remove the human safety driver, or the size of the testing fleet. Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher did confirm the company intends to operate a self-driving car service for public riders next year.\nWhen that robotaxi service launches in 2026 will depend on the U.K. government finalizing its approval process for those operations. \nWaymo has increasingly tapped partners to share the load of operating a robotaxi service, and similarly plans to use Moove, which already manages its autonomous vehicles (AVs) in Phoenix, to handle fleet operations in London. \nIn Austin and Atlanta, its partner Uber splits the responsibilities of owning and operating a fleet of driverless vehicles, handling the charging, maintenance and cleaning of the AVs, and manages access to the robotaxis via its app. Meanwhile, Waymo monitors the tech and the autonomous operations, including roadside assistance and certain aspects of rider support.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWaymo has ramped up its testing and commercial operations over the past two years, spreading beyond its initial market of Phoenix to several other U.S. cities, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The company also has plans to offer a commercial robotaxi service in Miami, Nashville and Washington DC.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

The company said it uses “intelligent area detection” to blend the background in after an object is removed without affecting the resolution or color.\nUnlike most AI-powered removal tools that leave artifacts at times, VSCO claims its tool is more precise and preserves details, and is therefore better suited for professional photographers.\nVSCO’s new AI-powered image removal tool Image Credits: VSCO\nThe company said that it will soon launch another AI-powered feature called Upscale, which claims to increase the resolution of images and sharpen details without compromising on details or composition.\nVSCO is using Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.1 Kontext model to power these features.\nThe AI Labs features are available on VSCO’s Pro tier, which costs $12.99 a month, or $60 a year, on the VSCO Studio app on iOS. The company is not setting a limit on the number of times users can use AI Labs features.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nYou can use Brush, tap, or Lasso select tools to pick objects to remove from an image Image Credits: VSCO\n“Since our inception, VSCO has supported authentic creative expression and has provided photographers with many ways to achieve their desired success . We see how much AI is impacting photography, and are focused on bringing AI tools to our community that are designed specifically to support photographers in achieving creative excellence while respecting the art of their photography,” Eric Wittman, VSCO’s CEO, said in a statement.\nThe company has been bolstering its toolset to better compete with editing tools. In May, it launched an AI-powered whiteboard to let photographers and their potential clients collaborate on projects, and last year, launched a marketplace to match photographers with clients.

    "body": "\nStellantis, the international automaker that owns Chrysler, Jeep, and Ram, said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years as part of a broader revival plan directed by its new CEO.\nFive new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The investment will also support the production of a new four-cylinder engine and reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which will allow the automaker to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. In all, more than 5,000 jobs will be created.\nUnlike previous multibillion-dollar investment pledges, however, this one doesn’t focus on electrification.\nOne of the five new vehicles will be a range-extended EV — a vehicle that combines a battery with a gas generator for additional range — produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan beginning in 2028. The automaker also plans to produce a large, new, gas-powered SUV at the Warren plant.\nThe remaining products include a next-generation Dodge Durango that will be produced at the Detroit Assembly Complex in 2029, a new midsize truck that will be assembled at its Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio, and an all-new four-cylinder engine called the GMET4 EVO that will go into production beginning in 2026 at its Kokomo, Indiana, factory.\nImage Credits:Stellantis\nStellantis CEO and North America COO Antonio Filosa said the investment will drive the automaker’s growth, strengthen its manufacturing footprint, and “bring more American jobs to the states we call home.”\n“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” Filosa said in a statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStellantis has scaled back its electrification plans for the U.S. market in the past year. The automaker said in September it would no longer include an electrified Gladiator in its Jeep lineup as it reassessed its product strategy. Earlier that month, the automaker said it canceled plans to produce a battery-electric full-size pickup. However, Stellantis said it still planned to produce an extended-range Ram 1500 REV, formerly called the Ramcharger. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nCoinbase has increased its investment in India’s CoinDCX, valuing the exchange at $2.45 billion post-money, as the U.S. crypto giant bets on the country’s digital-asset potential even as regulation remains unclear.\nThe investment is an extension of CoinDCX’s previous funding round and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the companies said on Wednesday. They did not disclose the amount invested or the size of Coinbase’s stake, but noted that the new round increased the Indian exchange’s valuation from $2.15 billion in its last raise in April 2022.\nCoinDCX confirmed to TechCrunch that the latest funding is an investment of new capital by Coinbase. The U.S. exchange has been an investor in CoinDCX since 2020 and last backed the Indian exchange in its Series D round in 2022 through its venture capital arm, Coinbase Ventures.\nNotably, the funding comes just months after CoinDCX suffered a security breach in July that led to the theft of around $44 million worth of assets. It comes amid reports earlier this year suggesting that Coinbase was acquiring CoinDCX — claims that the Indian exchange’s CEO denied at the time.\n“This investment adds to our growing presence in the region, where we also maintain local operations and other important local partners,” said Coinbase’s chief business officer, Shan Aggarwal, in a blog post. “Taken together, these steps reflect a clear commitment: we believe India and its neighbors will help shape the future of the global onchain economy.”\nMore than a year after ceasing operations in India, Coinbase re-entered the market earlier this year by registering with the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit. The U.S. exchange is also an investor in CoinSwitch, another leading Indian crypto platform.\nIndia, the world’s most populous country and home to more than a billion internet subscribers, is a key market for U.S. tech giants. However, the South Asian nation remains a relatively small market for crypto, partly due to regulatory uncertainty and the government’s flat 30% tax on digital asset gains, along with a 1% levy on each transaction. New Delhi also restricts offshore crypto exchanges unless they register with its financial watchdog. Recently, 25 global platforms — including BingX, LBank, and CoinW — came under government scrutiny for failing to register and comply with anti–money laundering rules.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCoinbase’s move to double down on CoinDCX to expand its presence in India makes strategic sense, as the Indian exchange has a strong local footprint with more than 20.4 million users. In July, CoinDCX reported customer assets exceeding ₹100 billion (about $1.12 billion), annualized group revenue of ₹11.79 billion (around $133 million), and annualized transaction volumes across products totaling ₹13.7 trillion (roughly $154.6 billion).\nIn addition to India, CoinDCX expanded into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) last year by acquiring BitOasis. Coinbase could leverage that footprint to strengthen its presence in the region, one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally.\nThe new capital will be used to enhance products, drive user growth, expand into new geographies, and deepen educational initiatives, CoinDCX said in a statement.\n“We see strong synergies with Coinbase in building a compliant and regulatory-friendly crypto ecosystem in India, MENA, and beyond,” Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, said.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nShortly after its addition of direct messages this summer, Instagram Threads is adding support for group messaging with up to 50 people. The Meta-owned competitor to X, which now has more than 400 million monthly active users, is making group chats available to global users starting today. It will also bring its messaging experience to users in the EU, where it was initially delayed.\nWithin the group chats, Threads users ages 18 and up will be able to share text posts, videos, GIFs, and emojis, as they can on the public timeline. \nThreads VP of Product Management Emily Dalton Smith explained during a group chat session with reporters earlier this week that, as with individual direct messages (DMs), group chats will not be encrypted. Rather, the company views Threads DMs as a way for people to connect about things they’re talking about now — like a football game or TV show they’re watching, not as a secure messaging service.\n“We see messaging as a way for people to connect more deeply with the people they’re already having conversations with — it’s really about going deep with people who share your interests,” Smith said in the conversation as she showed off the new feature and answered questions about its functionality and purpose.\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe changes also come as Threads’ parent, Instagram, is refocusing its app around Reels and DMs because the company found these were the features that users engaged with the most. Not surprisingly, it’s now making messaging a core part of the Threads app, too.\nIts top competitor, X, has done the same, but its focus has been shifting its users to an end-to-end encrypted chat service, XChat; security researchers have said it’s not as trustworthy as Signal.\nThreads says its users will have some control over who can start group chats with them, as they can with DMs. Users have to be following the person for them to add you to the group chat, Smith said. This is more restrictive compared with how Threads DMs work, as individual messages from people you don’t follow are simply directed to your Message Requests folder, not your main inbox.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIndividual DMs have other restrictions, however. Links and media are also disabled in message requests, and users are limited in how many requests they can send. In addition, users can turn off message requests from people they don’t follow, while potential spam is further filtered to a hidden folder.\nUsers will also be able to give their group chats a name, and will later be able to invite others by sharing a link to the chat, instead of adding them individually. This could make it easier for members to connect with others in a particular Community — a newer feature for finding interest groups on the app.\nImage Credits:Meta\nSmith also pointed out that people use Threads to connect with a different set of people than they do on Instagram. For instance, more than a third of those who use Threads daily follow less than half the same number of people as they do on Instagram, she said. The company believes that this suggests people are making more “Threads-first” connections on the app.\nIn addition to group chats, messaging will arrive in the EU over the next few days, giving users in this market access to both individual and group chats at launch. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nCybersecurity firm F5 Networks says government-backed hackers had “long-term, persistent access” to its network, which allowed them to steal the company’s source code and customer information.\nIn a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, F5 said it now “believes its containment actions have been successful,” after first discovering the hackers in its network on August 9.\nThe Seattle, Washington-based company, which specializes in providing application security and cybersecurity defenses for large companies and governments, said the hackers had access to its BIG-IP product development environment and its knowledge management systems, which included source code and undisclosed security vulnerabilities.\nF5 said it wasn’t aware of any modifications to its software while in development, nor was it aware of any exploitation of the vulnerabilities. The company published several updates on Wednesday for its BIG-IP platform to fix the undisclosed security flaws and urged customers to patch them.\nThe company also said the hackers downloaded configurations and implementation information about some of its customers’ systems, files that could help hackers find and exploit potential design weaknesses, and potentially hack into those customers’ systems.\nF5 said in the notice that the U.S. Department of Justice allowed the company to delay its public disclosure. An F5 spokesperson would not say for what reason the delay was allowed, but the DOJ can allow companies to hold off on notifying the public if there is a “substantial risk to national security or public safety.”\nF5 has over 1,000 corporate customers and serves more than 85% of the Fortune 500, the largest public companies by revenue, including banks, tech companies, and critical infrastructure companies.\nThe U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre warned on Wednesday, following F5’s disclosure, that hackers could “enable a threat actor to exploit F5 devices and software.”\nCISA said in an email on Wednesday that it has ordered civilian federal agencies under an emergency directive to patch their systems by October 22, citing the security risks.\nThe company did not attribute the attacks to a particular government or nation-state-affiliated hacking group, and F5 spokesperson Dan Sorensen declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions beyond the company’s published statement, including how many customers are affected and if it was known how the hackers broke in to begin with. \nF5 is the latest tech company in recent years to have been hacked by government hackers, including Microsoft — by China, and Russia, at least twice; cloud and enterprise technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and several other companies as part of the broader Russian cyberattack on the software maker SolarWinds.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple on Wednesday announced its new M5 chip along with the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro, all powered by the new chip.\nThese devices are now available for preorder, with shipping and in-store availability expected on October 22.\nThe M5 chip will allow the new devices to run faster than their predecessors. Apple says the chip has over four times the peak GPU compute performance compared to the M4. Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, added in a statement that it “ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon.” \nImage Credits:Apple\nFor the new iPad Pro, Apple touts that the chip brings “up to 3.5x the AI performance” of last year’s Pro and up to 5.6x faster than the iPad Pro with M1.\nOther upgrades include Apple’s C1X cellular modem with up to 50% faster cellular data performance and the N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread connectivity. Additionally, the new iPad Pro has faster storage read and write speeds and faster charging of up to 50% in around 30 minutes.\nAdding more power to the iPad Pro seems like a logical step for Apple to take, as the tech giant is pushing it to feel more like a laptop. With iPadOS 26, the tablet is getting more intuitive window displays, the Preview app, and the ability to create folders for better organization. \nThe pricing starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch, with color options in black and silver.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Apple\nThe new 14-inch MacBook Pro is expected to be even faster than its predecessor, featuring upgraded graphics performance (up to 1.6 times better), a higher memory bandwidth of 153Gbps (increased from M4’s 120Gbps), and improved storage speeds.\nIt also boasts a battery life of up to 24 hours.\nThe price starts at $1,599, and it is available in space black and silver.\nImage Credits:Apple\nVision Pro is also set to receive the M5 chip, replacing the current M2.\nThe M5 chip enhances display rendering by 10%, supports refresh rates up to 120Hz (up from 100Hz), and accelerates AI-powered features, making them 50% faster. Additionally, battery life improves by 30 minutes, providing up to 2.5 hours of general use and three hours of video playback.\nThe upgraded Vision Pro also comes with a Dual Knit Band to give users a more comfortable fit. It’s available in small, medium, and large. The price remains at $3,499.\nThe announcement of the new Vision Pro follows reports that Apple is shifting its focus toward developing smart glasses instead of overhauling its VR headset. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

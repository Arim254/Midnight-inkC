But in reality, he said it’s “the opposite.”\n“For years, there was this sense that, ‘Oh they’re doing something strange with computers, and they’re replacing actors,’” Cameron said. “When in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we’re doing, it’s a celebration of the actor-director moment.”\nIndeed, the CBS segment shows members of the “Avatar” cast performing their underwater scenes in a 250,000-gallon water tank.\n“Go to the other end of the spectrum and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character, they can make up an actor, they can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt,” Cameron added. “No, that’s horrifying … That’s exactly what we’re not doing.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n",

    "body": "\nNew York’s latest state budget includes new disclosure requirements for businesses that use personal data to set different prices for different shoppers — for example, charging you more if you have a history of splurging.\nBusinesses that use personalized pricing are now required to tell customers, “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data,” according to The New York Times.\nIt’s not clear how widespread this practice actually is among online retailers. An Uber spokesperson told the NYT that the company is now showing this disclosure to New Yorkers, although they described the law as “poorly drafted and ambiguous” and insisted that Uber only uses geography and customer demand to calculate its dynamic pricing.\nThe National Retail Federation filed a lawsuit to stop the law, but a federal judge allowed it to move forward.\nLina Khan, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission and now co-chair of the mayoral transition team for Zohran Mamdani, told the NYT that the law will be an “absolutely vital” tool for the government, but she also suggested there’s a “ton more work to be done” to regulate the practice.\n",

    "body": "\nDefense tech startup Anduril Industries has faced numerous setbacks during testing of its autonomous weapons systems, according to new reporting by the WSJ. The problems cited include more than a dozen drone boats that failed during a Navy exercise off California in May, with sailors warning of safety violations and potential loss of life; a mechanical issue that damaged the engine of Anduril’s unmanned jet fighter Fury during a summer ground test; and an August test of its Anvil counterdrone system that caused a 22-acre fire in Oregon.\nFounded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, Anduril raised $2.5 billion back in June at a $30.5 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, which help incubate the company. The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems.\nBeyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine’s SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. The issues were reportedly severe enough that Ukrainian forces stopped using the drones in 2024 and haven’t fielded them since, though Anduril maintains that its challenges are typical of weapons development, that its engineering team is achieving meaningful progress, and that the aforementioned incidents don’t indicate any underlying flaws in its technology.\n",

Between 10am and 2pm, online shoppers were supposedly spending $12.5 million every minute. Forbes reports that Adobe said in a statement that the numbers show Black Friday has become “a major e-commerce moment, as more shoppers opt to stay home and take advantage of deals.” \nThe company projects that Cyber Monday (coming in two days, on December 1) will be even bigger, with $14.2 billion spent online, according to Reuters.\nBlack Friday data from companies like Adobe and Salesforce can provide an early indicator of broader holiday shopping trends. Adobe is projecting a total of $253.4 billion in holiday spending this year, compared to $241.1 billion in 2024.\nSalesforce said it tracked $79 billion in global spending on Black Friday, with $18 billion of that in the United States, year-over-year increases of 6% and 3%, respectively. But this growth may have less to do with increased consumer demand and instead reflecting higher prices — Salesforce data also shows that prices were up an average of 7%, while order volumes were down 1%.\nAnd both Adobe and Salesforce claim to see a growing influence of AI on holiday shopping. For example, Salesforce said that between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, AI and AI agents influenced $22 billion in global sales, though it’s not clear how broadly that’s defined.\nThe data is less clear about how online trends compare to in-person shopping at brick-and-mortar stores, with RetailNext telling Forbes that in-store traffic appears to be down 3.4% nationwide, while Pass_by said foot traffic is up 1.17% overall, and up an even more impressive 7.9% in department stores.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nOn November 30, 2022, OpenAI introduced a new product to the world, innocuously describing it as “a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.”\nIt’s no hyperbole to suggest that ChatGPT subsequently transformed the worlds of business and tech, becoming enormously popular — it’s still in the number one spot on Apple’s free app rankings today — while also serving as the catalyst for a flood of generative AI products.\nIt’s even made people suspicious of the em dash, which no chatbot will ever take from me.\nIn fact, “Empire of AI” author Karen Hao argued in a recent interview with TechCrunch that OpenAI has “already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation-state in the world,” and is now “rewiring our geopolitics, all of our lives.”\nThere may be even more dramatic changes to come. Charlie Warzel wrote in The Atlantic that we are now living in “the world ChatGPT built,” which is “defined by a particular type of precarity” and is “perpetually waiting for a shoe to drop.”\n“Young generations feel this instability acutely as they prepare to graduate into a workforce about which they are cautioned that there may be no predictable path to a career,” Warzel said. “Older generations, too, are told that the future might be unrecognizable, that the marketable skills they’ve honed may not be relevant.”\nOf course, others feel more optimistic about an AI-centric future, and indeed are positioned to profit from it handsomely. But in Warzel’s telling, the AI boosters and investors are waiting along with everyone else — waiting to see if their bets pay off, but also waiting “because a defining feature of generative AI, according to its true believers, is that it is never in its final form.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg took a more focused look at how ChatGPT has transformed the stock market. The most obvious winner so far has been Nvidia, with its stock up 979% since the chatbot launched. But AI fever has also buoyed other Big Tech companies, with the seven most valuable companies on the S&P 500 — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Broadcom — all tied to tech, and with their collective growth accounting for nearly half of the benchmark’s 64% increase since ChatGPT was launched.\nThis has made for a more top-heavy market. The S&P 500 is weighted based on market capitalization, and those same seven companies now account for 35% of the weighting, compared to around 20% three years ago.\nHow long will this growth last? With the notable exception of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, it’s become increasingly common for AI executives to acknowledge that we might be in a bubble (or if you prefer, a “mania”).\n “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money in AI,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in August, at a dinner with journalists.\nSimilarly, Sierra CEO and OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor agreed we are “in a bubble” that he compared it to the dot-com boom of the late ‘90s. While individual companies might fail, he predicted, “AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future.”\nIn another three years — or less — we might know whether that optimism was warranted.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nMeesho, an Indian e-commerce rival to Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, is set to launch a roughly $606 million IPO marked by token sell-downs from early backers and no sales from big names such as SoftBank and Prosus, signalling investor conviction in India’s booming online retail market at a time when tech shareholders globally have been cashing out at listings.\nThe ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021.\nMeesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing.\nSome of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares.\nMeesho’s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders.\nFounded in 2015, Meesho began as a social commerce platform that targeted first-time online shoppers through WhatsApp before evolving into a full-fledged marketplace. It has since carved out a fast-growing niche with a low-cost model tailored to India’s price-sensitive consumers and small merchants — an approach that has increasingly pressured larger rivals Amazon and Flipkart. The Bengaluru-based company uses a commission-light model, earning primarily from logistics fees, advertising, and other services, while charging commissions on products sold through its separate Meesho Mall channel.\nMeesho reported revenue from operations of ₹55.78 billion (about $624.0 million) for the six months ended September 30, up from ₹43.11 billion (around $482.0 million) a year earlier, per its prospectus. Net merchandise value rose 44% year-over-year to ₹191.94 billion (roughly $2.15 billion). However, its losses widened, with Meesho posting a restated loss before tax of ₹4.33 billion (around $48.4 million) for the September 2025 half-year, compared with ₹0.24 billion (about $2.7 million) a year earlier.\nIn the last 12 months, Meesho recorded 234.20 million transacting users — unique consumers who purchased at least one product on the platform. Over the same period, the company had 706,471 annual transacting sellers, defined as sellers who received at least one order in the year.\nMeesho also uses a sprawling creator network for product discovery, with more than 50,000 active content creators generating at least one placed order through their content over the past year.\n“Many Indians are only experiencing e-commerce for the first time on Meesho, and much like the rest of us, over the next decade, they will buy more and more things and more and more frequently on this platform,” Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director at Peak XV Partners, told TechCrunch. “That’s why long-term conviction is the reason to hold on to as much of our stake as we can hold on to.”\nPeak XV — which first invested in Meesho in 2018 during its Sequoia Capital India era and holds about 13% across its two vehicles — is selling around 17.38 million shares in the IPO.\nMeesho has positioned itself as a value-focused platform — unlike Amazon and Flipkart, which it sees as convenience-led players. In that respect, the company compares itself with other value-driven marketplaces such as Pinduoduo in China, Shopee in Southeast Asia, and Mercado Libre in Latin America.\n“If you look at the value-focused bucket, here, you are trying to appeal to mass market consumers selling all kinds of products and categories in a marketplace business model, which tends to be asset light,” Aatrey told reporters during Meesho’s press conference on Friday. “And the reason people come back is because they want access to more and more selection with the affordability value proposition.”\nMeesho also sees the IPO improving its ability to attract talent and strengthening confidence across its wider ecosystem, CFO Dhiresh Bansal told TechCrunch. He said a public listing boosts the company’s brand with job candidates — including those coming from big tech firms — and has a positive knock-on effect on consumers, sellers and logistics partners by reinforcing Meesho’s governance standards.\nThe IPO will open for public subscription on December 3, with the anchor book scheduled for December 2. About 75% of the offer is reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 10% for retail investors and 15% for non-institutional investors.\nSoftBank did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\t\n\nLoading the player…\n\nVibe coding has taken the tech industry by storm, and it’s not just the Lovables and Replits of the world that are winning. The startups building the infrastructure behind them are cashing in too. \nSupabase, the open-source database platform that’s become the backend of choice for the vibe-coding world, raised $100 million at a $5 billion valuation just months after closing $200 million at $2 billion. But co-founder and CEO Paul Copplestone has a surprising strategy: he keeps turning down million-dollar enterprise contracts from deep-pocketed but demanding customers. He’s betting instead that if he sticks to his own product vision, the world will come to him. So far, he’s been right.  \nToday on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, Julie Bort sat down with Copplestone to explore Supabase’s rise and what it means for vibe coding, developers and the database giants who have historically controlled this market. \nSubscribe to Equity on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.

    "body": "\nDavid Sacks’ role as President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar could work out very well for his investments, as well as his friends, according to a new report The New York Times.\nHowever, Sacks fired back in a post on X, in which he described a five-month reporting process in which accusations were “debunked in detail.”\n“Today they evidently just threw up their hands and published this nothing burger,” Sacks said. “Anyone who reads the story carefully can see that they strung together a bunch of anecdotes that don’t support the headline.”\nThis isn’t the first time critics have suggested that there may be conflicts of interest between Sacks’ political role and his investments. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts — said earlier this year that Sacks “simultaneously leads a firm invested in crypto while guiding the nation’s crypto policy,” an “explicit conflict of interest” that would “normally” be prohibited under federal law.\nBut the NYT’s story (under the headline “Silicon Valley’s Man in the White House is Benefiting Himself and His Friends,” and credited to five bylined reporters) seems to offer a more comprehensive view, with an analysis of his financial disclosures suggesting that among Sacks’ 708 tech investments, 449 are AI companies that could benefit from the policies he supports.\nSacks has received two White House ethics waivers declaring he would sell most of his crypto and AI assets. However, the NYT said his public ethics filings do not disclose the remaining value of his crypto and AI investments, nor do they say when he sold off the assets he divested.\nKathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor specializing in government ethics, made similar points in July after reviewing Sacks’ crypto waiver, telling TechCrunch, “This is graft.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe NYT also said that Sacks’ filings classify hundreds of investments as hardware or software, rather than AI, while the companies pitch themselves as AI businesses in their marketing.\nTo illustrate Sacks’ “intertwined interests,” the NYT pointed to the White House summit in July where Trump unveiled his AI roadmap — White House chief of staff Susie Wiles reportedly stepped in to prevent the All-In podcast (which Sacks co-hosts) from being the only host of the event. And All-In asked potential sponsors to pay $1 million for access to a private reception and other events, the NYT claimed.\nThe NYT also reported that Sacks became close with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this spring and has played a role in removing restrictions on Nvidia chip sales around the world, including in China.\nRight-wing media personality and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon (who’s made no secret of his animosity towards some of Trump’s Silicon Valley allies) said Sacks is emblematic of an administration where “the tech bros are out of control.”\nSacks’ spokesperson Jessica Hoffman told the NYT that “this conflict of interest narrative is false.” Hoffman said Sacks has complied with the rules for special government employees, that the Office of Government Ethics determined which investments he had to sell, and that his role in the government has cost him, rather than benefited him.\nWhite House spokesperson Liz Huston said Sacks has been “an invaluable asset for President Trump’s agenda of cementing American technology dominance.”\nSacks’ post responding to the NYT includes a letter written to the newspaper from Clare Locke, a law firm that Sacks hired, claiming that the reporters had been given “clear marching orders: find and report on a conflict of interest between Mr. Sacks’ duties in the White House and his background in the private technology sector.”\nThe letter also addresses some of the specifics of the NYT story, including the All-In podcast’s role in the White House AI event. Sacks’ lawyers said the AI summit was a not-for-profit event, and that the All-In podcast “lost money hosting the event.”\n“Two sponsors were brought on to help partially defray the cost of the event, for which they received nothing but logo placements,” the letter said. “No access to President Trump was ever offered, and no VIP reception ever took place.”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nFor years, when it was time for startups to start selling their product, they could turn to any number of traditional playbooks. But as with so many things, AI is changing how companies prepare to go to market.\n“You can do more with less than ever before,” Max Altschuler, general partner at GTMfund, told the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt last month.\nThe challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there’s still a need for more specific domain expertise.\n“When you have great advisors around you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven’t gone out the window. I think it’s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,” Altschuler said.\nAlison Wagonfeld, vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required.\n “You certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,” Wagonfeld said.\nTeams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly “You can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,” , she added. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMarc Manara, head of startups at OpenAI, has found many startups have embraced AI in their GTM strategy, though it’s not necessarily with the sole focus of minimizing how many resources they put toward it. \n“There’s a movement of, yes, you can do more with less, but you can also be very focused with how you do it,” he said. “The degree of personalization and signal following that you can do with AI is differentiated now.”\nSpecifically, he said there are tools that help build leads which are much more sophisticated than in the past. Rather than just a simple query of a database, AI prompts can help startups find prospective customers that fit a very specific set of requirements.\nInbound marketing has changed, too, he added, by using the results of those prompts to qualify and score inbound leads “with a lot more precision could have been in the past.”\nWhen it comes time for a startup to begin crafting its go-to-market strategy, Wagonfeld said its important to consider what qualities it might want in a GTM team. \n“It’s a change in hiring perspective, where the past it was more about hiring specialists, people who really knew, sometimes even like a sub-specialty within marketing or within sales. And now it’s hiring for a sense of curiosity and understanding,” she said. “It’s almost the top thing to hire for now.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "\nFinland’s weather is notoriously unfriendly; but even so, your food order might be delivered by a drone.\nOn a rainy day after Helsinki’s annual Slush",
    "body": "\nFinland’s weather is notoriously unfriendly; but even so, your food order might be delivered by a drone.\nOn a rainy day after Helsinki’s annual Slush conference, Finnish entrepreneur Ville Leppälä took TechCrunch behind the scenes of a three-party partnership between Irish drone delivery company Manna, DoorDash-owned food delivery platform Wolt, and his own startup, Huuva.\nHuuva, whose name means kitchen hood, raised a seed round led by General Catalyst in 2022 with the promise of bringing good food to the suburbs. While it branched out of its cloud kitchen origins, its business still relies heavily on delivery tech — now including drones.\n“If available, we’ll send your order with a drone.” That’s how Wolt has been notifying customers ordering from Huuva’s Niittari location in Espoo, which is part of the Helsinki metropolitan area, but which Leppälä sees as particularly well suited for this concept.\nWhile European suburbs aren’t as sprawling as those in the United States, people who work, study, and live in places like Espoo still lack the variety of options they can find in the capital. Huuva lets them order popular items from partner restaurant brands — and drones help those orders arrive faster, Leppälä said.\nBuilding upon Manna’s track record of completing more than 50,000 deliveries in Dublin, operations in Finland started quickly once the appropriate permits were secured. After a pilot phase from February, the drones have been fully operational for the last two months in Espoo, where they depart from a launchpad that’s shared with delivery-only grocery store Wolt Market.\nFor the end users, this means that they can order different food styles from Huuva’s partner brands, and add some groceries, too — each drone can carry around 4.4 lb, and Manna can send two of them at once. \nImage Credits:TechCrunch\nThis adds another layer of convenience, but also speed. Unlike drivers, drones won’t get stuck in traffic at lunch time. According to Leppälä, this is key to making sure the food arrives fresh; and it doesn’t hurt if unit economics are more sustainable for Huuva, too. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHuuva’s team estimates that regular deliveries currently cost €5-6 each (approximately $6-8), while drone deliveries could get down to €1 ($1.16). That’s not accounting for the extra costs that Manna may be incurring from setting up its Finnish operations, although the weather wasn’t as challenging as it might have been for a newcomer.\nComing from Ireland, Manna’s drones were already thoroughly tested for wind and rain, in such quantities that snow also falls under the same umbrella. Icing does present an extra challenge, but according to local operations and maintenance lead Makar Nalimov, in those cases they’ll just use other delivery methods, especially since using chemicals for de-icing is also out of the question when food is involved.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\nThese fallback options highlight that Manna’s drones are part of a fast-expanding range of last-mile delivery solutions. Wolt itself is already using sidewalk robots from Coco and Starship in Finland, and its parent company DoorDash even built its own, Dot, which started performing deliveries in Arizona earlier this year.\nAmid rumors that DoorDash may be building its own drone delivery program, in addition to collaborating with Alphabet-owned Wing, direct partnerships could be beneficial to companies like Manna and Huuva. The food startup is considering an expansion to another Espoo location where Wolt Market would be out of the equation, which would make it possible for the launchpad to be close enough to the kitchen for deliveries to be handed over through a window.\nIn the current process, Manna’s launchpad sits within a short distance; delivery workers on e-scooters pick up the orders from the kitchen in a heat bag, then carry it over to Manna’s operators. Under maintenance lead Nalimov’s supervision, they put the orders on a scale and balance the weight if needed before placing them into special bags approved by regulators.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\nResistant bags are only one of many safety measures that Manna follows to comply with regulations and its own procedures. For instance, batteries are systematically swapped so that drones always fly with a full charge. According to Nalimov, there’s also redundancy at all levels, plus preparedness for different incident scenarios — and a parachute as a last resort.\nAlthough Manna has staff on the ground, Mission Control sits in Ireland. There, operators assess the LiDAR maps, review the planned flight itinerary and drop a pin for the drone to deliver within a short radius of the customer’s location. If conditions aren’t met, the order falls back to a courier. If approved, the drone captures an image of the landing spot for final human confirmation before lowering the package with biodegradable rope. \nThis process has now become routine for Manna’s local staff, which is getting busier. According to Nalimov, he and his team are now handling double-digit deliveries a day, and are confidently gearing up for their first operational winter in Finland. As for Huuva, it is now ready to double down on drone deliveries in Espoo, with one extra wish: being allowed to put its logo on those regulator-sanctioned bags.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "description": "\nWhen its season ended early this month, Angel City FC finished 11th out of 13 teams, a disappointing result for the Los Angeles soccer franchise that",
    "body": "\nWhen its season ended early this month, Angel City FC finished 11th out of 13 teams, a disappointing result for the Los Angeles soccer franchise that venture capitalist Kara Nortman co-founded in 2020. But the season’s struggles tell only part of a much larger story that’s reshaping how investors think about women’s sports.\nDespite its lackluster on-field performance, Angel City itself has become a case study (including literally, inside Harvard Business School) in how to best construct a women’s sports property. The team’s celebrity ownership group, including Natalie Portman and Serena Williams, has helped generate nearly unprecedented buzz. The franchise has also been savvy about sponsorships, breaking records before players kicked a ball.\n“We went from zero to $30 million in revenue. We sold out games. We built something people didn’t think was possible,” Nortman reflected in an interview last month, pointing to Angel City’s commercial success from the very outset of the team’s formation. \nThat commercial success, not trophies, became the blueprint for Monarch Collective, the $250 million fund Nortman launched in 2023, which has become the first investment vehicle focused exclusively on women’s sports. While its origin story may be rooted in a team that has yet to win a playoff game, Monarch’s portfolio and influence have expanded far beyond Angel City’s training facility in Thousand Oaks, California.\nThe fund now holds stakes in three other National Women’s Soccer League clubs: San Diego Wave, Boston Legacy FC (debuting next year), and its newest investment, announced earlier this month, FC Viktoria Berlin. The deal for 38% of the German club, makes Monarch the first foreign investor to acquire a stake in a German women’s soccer team.\nIt’s a diverse collection that reflects Nortman’s conviction that women’s sports have reached an inflection point, regardless of any single team’s fortunes. The numbers support her optimism, too.\n“The overall men’s sports market globally is estimated to be about half a trillion dollars,” Nortman explains. “The women’s sports market, when we started Monarch in 2023, was thought to be about half a billion dollars. It’s now closer to $3 billion.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTapping into that growth requires a different playbook than men’s sports, Nortman says. It’s not a simple rinse-and-repeat. “Like, how many men’s team owners are thinking about parachuting Sephora boxes from rafters? Or having at [a New York] Liberty [WNBA game] a Fenty cam for putting on your [Fenty] lipstick, or Angel City having a Hello Kitty collab night where people can’t figure out how to get their hands on the merch before it sells out?”\nAngel City’s innovative approach to marketing and partnerships helped it build so much excitement that in the fall of last year, power couple Bob Iger and Willow Bay acquired a majority stake in it for $250 million, making it the most valuable women’s sports franchise in the world.\nFor Nortman, who left Upfront Ventures and more traditional venture capital to focus full-time on women’s sports, Angel City’s commercial achievements have continued to validate Monarch’s thesis. Though there’s current tension – certainly in the sports press, at least – between Angel City’s business success and its on-field performance, the team has inarguably proven that women’s sports can generate serious revenue with the right pieces in place.\nNow, as with any successful new endeavor, the question is: can the momentum last? Nortman is acutely aware that women’s sports has seen promising moments evaporate before. She frequently references a striking historical parallel from 1920, when 60,000 people showed up in Liverpool, England, to watch the Dick, Kerr Ladies play football, which is a bigger crowd than most Premier League games draw today. The next year, the English Football Association banned women from playing, and the sport essentially disappeared for decades.\n“Everyone gets to wake up and become the discoverer of women’s sports when they do,” Nortman says. “But it takes consistent, hard work to get that to play out into consistency.”\nThat hard work, she argues, requires more than just riding waves of attention from breakout stars like Caitlin Clark or Angel Reese. It demands systematic investment in infrastructure, governance, and operations – the unglamorous work of building sustainable businesses.\nThis is where Monarch’s approach diverges from typical venture capital. Rather than making passive bets on dozens of startups, Monarch is taking concentrated positions in a handful of teams and leagues, then getting deeply involved in operations. The fund describes its strategy as “venture-like markets” with “growth equity or private equity-like” risk management.\n“We show up alongside control owners and add a lot of operational value,” Nortman explains. The goal is to help teams reach breakeven or profitability on their core operations, positioning them to benefit as higher-margin media revenue grows.\nMonarch’s investment interest extend beyond soccer. The fund is more broadly focused on what Nortman calls sports with “no product-market risk,” meaning established formats with proven audiences.\n“Is this a sport people like to watch on their computer or television?” she asks. “There are participatory sports, like pickleball, but are people going to sit home and create an event out of watching it?”\nIndeed, while Monarch has stakes right now in four “football” clubs, it’s interested, too, in women’s basketball, golf, and tennis – sports with substantial media revenue potential, along with existing infrastructure.\nThe firm’s current limited partners include Melinda French Gates, former Netflix executives, and other wealthy individuals, and interest in its mission seems to be growing. For one thing, Monarch’s debut fund of $250 million is substantially more than the $100 million that Nortman and her co-founder – Jasmine Robinson, a former investor with the sports-, media-, gaming-, and fitness-focused growth stage firm Causeway – initially planned to raise. She says the increased size reflects the market’s rapid maturation during Monarch’s fundraising period.\n“When we started raising the fund, nine out of 10 conversations were, ‘Yeah, we don’t think [women’s] basketball is really a thing,’” Nortman says, recalling a “lot of skepticism around it.” Then came Caitlin Clark’s meteoric rise, the WNBA’s record-breaking viewership, and suddenly basketball became the hottest sector in women’s sports.\nThat growing interest validates Nortman’s thesis that women’s sports investment isn’t about finding the single perfect team but about supporting an ecosystem where multiple franchises can thrive. Some will win championships. Some will struggle competitively but succeed commercially. The key is having enough capital and operational expertise distributed across the market to weather individual setbacks.\nAlready, Angel City appears to be inspiring other ownership groups. “You started having other teams – Kansas City, Bay FC, Washington D.C. Spirit – with female-led ownership groups come in and show they could build a real P&L,” Nortman notes. Whether intentionally or not, Angel City became a template.\nAs women’s sports enters what feels like a sustained boom period — the Golden State Valkyries just played their first WNBA next season, the NWSL is expanding, media rights deals are growing — Nortman remains cautiously optimistic about whether this moment will prove different from past surges in interest.\nThe key, she argues, lies in the fundamentals: strong league governance, owner commitment, infrastructure investment, and building genuine community connections. Media attention creates opportunity; operational excellence makes it sustainable.\n“Every spike is an opportunity to create a consistent experience around it,” Nortman says. “You have to look at all the underlying criteria to see where it’s likely to stick around.”\n",

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday evening at PlayGround Global in Palo Alto, some very smart people who are building things you don’t understand yet will explain what’s coming. This is the final StrictlyVC event of 2025, and truly, the lineup is ridiculous.\nThe series has traveled around the globe under the auspices of TechCrunch. Steve Case rented a theater in D.C.; we talked to Greece’s prime minister in Athens; and Kirsten Green hosted us at the Presidio in San Francisco. The concept is always the same, though: bring together people who are working on genuinely important developments in a smaller setting, before everyone else figures out they’re important.\nOne of our favorite moments was when, in 2019, Sam Altman told a StrictlyVC crowd that OpenAI’s monetization strategy was basically “build AGI, then ask it how to make money.” Everyone laughed. He wasn’t joking.\nThis time we’ve got Nicholas Kelez, a particle accelerator physicist who spent 20 years at the Department of Energy building things that shouldn’t be possible. Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but also exceedingly important in this moment. There is also growing competition chasing after the same prize.\nThen there’s Mina Fahmi, who’s made a ring that captures your whispered thoughts and turns them into text. Before you roll your eyes, know that he and cofounder Kirak Hong spent years at Meta working on this stuff after their company was acquired. The Stream Ring isn’t trying to be your friend — it’s trying to extend your brain. Backed by Toni Schneider, an operator who scaled WordPress in its earlier days, Sandbar just emerged from stealth and might well be onto something. (Schneider is a partner at True Ventures, whose other hardware bets have included Peloton, Ring, and Fitbit; he’s also coming to Palo Alto next week.)\nWe have Max Hodak — Science Corp founder, Time magazine cover subject, and, earlier, Neuralink cofounder — who has already restored vision to dozens of blind people with retinal implants. Now he’s working on “biohybrid” brain-computer interfaces where chips seeded with stem cells grow into your brain tissue so paralyzed people can control devices with their thoughts. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, as Hodak views it. In fact, he thinks 2035 is going to look wildly different from today, and he’s happy to share how.\nFinally, we’re thrilled to welcome Chi-Hua Chien and Elizabeth Weil, two VCs who’ve backed Twitter, Spotify, TikTok, Slack, SpaceX, Figma, and Coinbase before they were household names. Chien runs Goodwater Capital; Weil founded Scribble Ventures after stints at Andreessen Horowitz and Twitter, made 100+ angel investments, and has a first fund showing 4x returns. (Her network is so good that it’s annoying.) Both think Silicon Valley is completely misreading the moment while everyone pours capital into enterprise AI, and they’ll explain why. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPlayGround Global is hosting, along with general partner Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO of Intel. There will be drinks, delicious food, and merriment; seating is limited, so if you want to come, act fast. \nIf you want to partner with the series in 2026, get in touch.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine. Previously the Silicon Valley Editor of TechCrunch, she was named Editor in Chief and General Manager of TechCrunch in September 2023. She’s also the founder of StrictlyVC, a daily e-newsletter and lecture series acquired by Yahoo in August 2023 and now operated as a sub brand of TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Connie by emailing connie@strictlyvc.com or connie@techcrunch.com, or via encrypted message at ConnieLoizos.53 on Signal.\r\n\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nBuild Mode is back with a holiday bonus episode. This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition, Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd, a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process.\nDamoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army, where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails.\nCut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. \n“Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever.\nIn this interview, Damoa is fresh off this big win and eager to use the momentum and prize money to accelerate Glīd into their next phase. They’re already launching a pilot with Great Plains Industrial Park, and their next product Glīder is about to hit the market. And the team is hiring for roles in nearly every aspect of the business. Their process is more on the casual end of the spectrum, with Damoa calling it “an organic process” where an initial vibe check and résumé review can turn into a new team member.\nDamoa says that process has attracted people who are mission driven, laser-focused, all while practicing mindfulness. That makes sense when the CEO is the kind of leader who responds to the news that they’ve made the top five in Startup Battlefield by saying: “I’m going to meditate.”\nUsing this human-centric approach, the Glīd team has attracted people who are mission driven and laser-focused, all while practicing mindfulness.

    "body": "\nWhen Will Bruey talks about the future, the timelines are shorter than most might imagine. The Varda Space Industries CEO predicts that within 10 years, someone could stand at a landing site and watch multiple specialized spacecraft per night zooming toward Earth like shooting stars, each carrying pharmaceuticals manufactured in space. Within 15 to 20 years, he says, it will be cheaper to send a working-class employee to orbit for a month than to keep them on Earth.\nThe reason Bruey thinks these scenarios are realistic is because he has watched ambitious business projections unfold before, while working as an engineer at SpaceX.\n“I remember the first rocket I worked on at SpaceX was flight three of Falcon 9,” he said at TechCrunch’s recent Disrupt event. The partially reusable, two-stage, medium-lift launch vehicle has since completed nearly 600 successful missions. “If someone had told me ‘reusable rockets,’ and ‘[we’ll see as] many [of these] flights as daily flights out of LAX,’ I would have been like, ‘All right, [maybe in] 15 to 20 years,’ and this feels the same level of futuristic.”\nVarda has already proven the core concept. In February 2024, after a months-long regulatory odyssey, the company became only the third corporate entity ever to bring something back from orbit – crystals of ritonavir, an HIV medication – joining SpaceX and Boeing in that exclusive club. It has completed a handful of missions since.\nThe company brings its pharmaceuticals back to Earth inside the W-1 capsule, a small, conical spacecraft about 90 centimeters across, 74 centimeters high, and weighing less than 90 kilograms (roughly the size of a large kitchen trash can). The company this week launched its fifth capsule ever aboard a SpaceX ride-share mission, hosted by a spacecraft bus that provides power, communications, propulsion, and control while in orbit.\nSo why manufacture crystals in space? In microgravity, the usual forces that interfere with crystal formation on Earth – like sedimentation and gravity pulling on growing crystals – essentially disappear. Varda says that this gives it much more precise control over crystallization, allowing it to create crystals with uniform sizes or even novel polymorphs (different structural arrangements of the same molecule). These improvements can ostensibly translate into real benefits: better stability, greater purity, and longer shelf life for drugs.\nThe process isn’t quick. Pharmaceutical manufacturing can take weeks or months in orbit. But once it’s complete, the capsule detaches from the spacecraft bus and plunges back through Earth’s atmosphere at over 30,000 kilometers per hour, reaching speeds above Mach 25. A heat shield made of NASA-developed carbon ablator material protects the cargo inside, and a parachute brings it down for a soft landing.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe actual business is pretty prosaic, though, Bruey offered. “Forget about space for a second,” he said. “We just have this magic oven . . . where you can create formulations that you otherwise couldn’t.” Added Bruey of what people often get wrong about Varda, the company isn’t “in the space industry; we’re in-space industry,” he said. Space is “just another place to ship to.”\nWorth noting: Varda isn’t discovering new drugs or creating new molecules. It’s aiming to expand the menu of what can be done with existing, approved drugs.\nThis isn’t speculative science, either. Companies like Bristol Myers Squibb and Merck have been running pharmaceutical crystallization experiments on the International Space Station for years, proving the concept works. Varda says it’s just making it commercial by building the infrastructure to do it repeatedly, reliably, and at a scale that might actually matter to the pharmaceutical industry.\nAs for why now, two things have changed. First, space launches have become bookable and predictable. “Ten years ago, you would have to get a chartered flight. It was like hitchhiking to get to orbit if you were not a primary mission payload,” Bruey explained. “It’s still expensive today, but [it’s dependable, you can book a slot, and we [have] booked launches years in advance.”\nSecond, end-to-end space service companies like Rocket Lab started producing satellite buses that could be purchased off the shelf. Buying spacecraft from Rocket Lab and integrating its pharmaceutical manufacturing capsules with them is a major unlock.\nStill, only the highest-value products make economic sense. That’s why Varda started with pharmaceuticals; a drug that can command thousands of dollars per dose can absorb the transportation costs. \nThe “seven domino” theory\nWhen Bruey talks to members of Congress, which he says he does frequently these days, he pitches what he calls the “seven domino theory.” \nDomino one: reusable rockets. Done. Domino two: manufacturing drugs in orbit and returning them. Domino three is the big one: getting a drug into clinical trials. “It’s a big deal because what it means is perpetual launch.”\nThis is where Varda’s business model diverges fundamentally from every other space company.\nThink about how satellite companies work. SiriusXM launches satellites to broadcast radio. DirecTV launches satellites to transmit television. Even Starlink, with its thousands of satellites, is fundamentally building out a constellation – a network that, once complete, doesn’t require constant launches to function. These companies treat launch as a capital investment. They spend money to place hardware in orbit, and then they’re done.\nVarda is different. Each drug formulation requires manufacturing runs. Manufacturing runs require launches. More demand for the drugs means more launches.\nThis matters because it changes the economics for launch providers. Instead of selling a fixed number of launches to build out a constellation, they have a customer with (theoretically) unlimited demand that grows with success. That kind of predictable, scalable demand helps justify the fixed costs of launch infrastructure and drives down per-launch prices.\nDomino four triggers the feedback loop: as Varda scales, costs drop, making the next tier of drugs economically viable. More drugs mean more scale, lowering costs again – a cycle Bruey says will “shove launch costs into the ground.”\nVarda’s commercial viability remains unproven, and no space-manufactured drugs are currently on pharmacy shelves. But the virtuous cycle Bruey imagines won’t just benefit Varda. Lower launch costs make space accessible for other industries, including semiconductors, fiber optics, and exotic materials – everything that benefits from microgravity but can’t yet justify the expense.\nEventually, Bruey tells his team, launch costs will get so low that it will be cheaper to put an employee in orbit for a month because creating additional automation would cost more.\n“I imagine ‘Jane’ goes to space for a month. It’ll be like [heading to] an oil rig. She works at the drug factory for a month, comes back down, and [becomes] the first person ever to go to space and back where she generate[s] more value than the cost to take her there.”\nIt’s at that moment, Bruey says, when “the invisible hand of the free market economy lifts us off our home planet.”\nThe near-death experience\nThe path to those shooting star drug deliveries nearly ended before it began, Bruey told TechCrunch.\nVarda launched W-1 in June 2023 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission. The pharmaceutical manufacturing process inside the capsule worked as planned, producing crystals of Form III ritonavir, a specific crystalline structure of the drug that’s difficult to create on Earth. The experiments were completed within weeks.\nBut then the capsule just . . . stayed in orbit. For six months. The problem wasn’t technical, Bruey said; Varda couldn’t get approval to bring its W-1 capsule home.\nThe Utah Test and Training Range, where Varda wanted to land, exists to “test weapons and train warriors,” as Bruey put it. Space drugs didn’t fall into that category, so Varda wasn’t a priority customer. When higher-priority military missions needed the range, they bumped Varda’s scheduled landing windows. Each bump invalidated the company’s reentry license with the FAA, requiring it to start the approval process over.\n“There were 80 people in the office who had spent two and a half years of their lives on this thing, and it’s in orbit, but we’re not sure if it can come home,” Bruey recalled.\nThe situation looked bad from the outside. To observers, it seemed like Varda had been reckless and launched without proper approvals. But he said in reality, the FAA had authorized Varda to launch without a finalized reentry license because the agency wanted to encourage the nascent commercial reentry industry.\nThe FAA had authorized Varda to launch without a finalized reentry license, encouraging the nascent commercial reentry industry.\n“They encouraged us to proceed with our launch, with the goal being that we would continue to coordinate that license, as well as the use of reentry timing with the range, while we were in orbit,” Bruey explained.\nThe real problem was that this was the first commercial land reentry ever attempted. There was no established process for the Utah range to coordinate with the FAA. Both entities felt like they were shouldering all the liability.\nVarda explored every alternative it could think of. Water landing? The capsule doesn’t float; they’d lose it. Australia? Possible, and they started those conversations. But Bruey says he made a call: no half measures.\n“Either you have to push the boundaries of regulation to create this future, or you don’t,” he said. “In order for Varda to be successful, we need to land on land regularly. So we just sucked it up and said, ‘Let’s figure this one out.”\nWhile its first mission remained stranded in orbit, the company continued production on the next capsule. It kept hiring.\nIn February 2024, eight months after launch, W-1 finally came home. It landed as originally planned at the Utah Test and Training Range, the first commercial spacecraft to land on a military test range and the first to land on U.S. soil under the FAA’s Part 450 licensing framework, introduced by the agency in 2021 to make commercial space operations more flexible.\nNow Varda has landing sites in both the U.S. and Australia, and it’s the first company to receive an FAA Part 450 operator license that lets it reenter the U.S. without resubmitting full safety documentation for each flight.\nMeanwhile, Varda has a secondary business that emerged from necessity: hypersonic testing.\nVery few objects ever travel through the atmosphere at Mach 25. The environment at those speeds is extreme and unique: Temperatures reach thousands of degrees, creating a plasma sheath around a vehicle. The air itself undergoes chemical reactions as molecules are ripped apart and recombine. This environment can’t be replicated on Earth, even in the most advanced wind tunnels.\nThe Air Force and other defense agencies need to test materials, sensors, navigation systems, and communications equipment in real hypersonic conditions. Traditionally, that would require dedicated test flights that cost upwards of $100 million each and involve significant risk.\nVarda offers an alternative. Its W-1 capsules are already reentering at Mach 25. The company can embed sensors, test new thermal protection materials, or validate equipment in the actual flight environment rather than in approximations. The capsule is akin to a wind tunnel, and the reentry is the test.\nVarda has already flown experiments for the Air Force Research Laboratory, including an optical emission spectroscopy payload that took in-situ measurements of the shock layer during reentry.\nInvestors are, big surprise, excited about Varda’s story. The company raised $329 million as of its Series C round this past July, most of it earmarked for building out the company’s pharmaceutical lab in El Segundo. It’s also hiring structural biologists and crystallization scientists to work on more complex molecules, eventually including biologics like monoclonal antibodies, which Bruey says is a $210 billion market.\nA whole lot has to go right between then and now for Varda to elbow its way into that business, as well as to make a dent in the business it’s currently targeting. But if Bruey is right, “then” is closer than most people might right now imagine.\n",

These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models.\nTechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.\nThe project will be overseen by Kevork Kechichian, the executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s data center group, according to reporting from Reuters. Kechichian was hired in September among a slew of new engineer-focused hires.\nIntel also hired Eric Demers for the effort in January. Demers was previously at Qualcomm for more than 13 years, most recently serving as a senior vice president of engineering.\nThis initiative seems to be in relatively early stages as Tan said the company plans to develop its strategy around customer demands and needs.\nWhile Nvidia didn’t invent the GPU, that specific kind of chip has played a large role in its success. Its GPUs for AI systems are so advanced and popular, the chipmaker currently holds a commanding market lead.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s interesting to see Intel expand into this area now as Tan said the company would be consolidating and focusing on its core businesses when he took the helm as CEO last March. While GPUs are still semiconductors, of course, this is still a notable expansion.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Enterprise\n\n",

He often posts about the company’s autonomous ride-hailing efforts, and has a board seat at AV company Waabi — so the appointment may be a signal of the company’s plans to expand its driverless investments and operations.\nIndeed, on the company’s Q4 earnings call on Wednesday, Krishnamurthy said the company would invest capital in its AV software partners, work with AV makers by investing equity or via offtake agreements, and “support our AV infrastructure partners.”\n“With large and growing free cash flows, over the coming years we will invest with discipline across a multitude of opportunities, including positioning Uber to win in an AV future,” Krishnamurthy wrote in a statement detailing the company’s Q4 results.\nUber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on the call that he was convinced autonomous vehicles would “unlock a multi-trillion dollar opportunity,” for the company, adding that autonomy “fundamentally amplifies” the strengths of the company’s platform.\n“By the end of 2026, we expect to be facilitating AV trips in as many as 15 cities globally, with a roughly even split of U.S. and international cities. And by 2029, we intend to be the largest facilitator of AV trips in the world,” Khosrowshahi said.\nUber said revenue rose to $14.37 billion in the fourth quarter, up 20% from a year earlier, driven by strong demand for its food delivery services. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMahendra-Rajah is leaving Uber after three years at the company.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Transportation\n\n",

    "body": "\nVoice AI company ElevenLabs said today it raised $500 million in a new funding round led by Sequoia Capital, which was an investor in the startup’s last secondary round through a tender. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed is joining the company’s board.\nThe startup is now valued at $11 billion, more than three times its valuation in its last round in January 2025. Earlier in the year, the Financial Times reported that the startup was looking to raise at that valuation.\nThe company said that existing investor a16z quadrupled its investment amount, and Iconiq, which led the last round, tripled it. Some prior investors, like BroadLight, NFDG, Valor Capital, AMP Coalition, and Smash Capital, also joined the round. New investors for the funding included Lightspeed Venture Partners, EvanticCapital, and Bond.\nElevenLabs said that it will disclose some investors later in February, which might be strategic partners. The company has raised over $781 million to date. It said that it will use the funding for research and product development, along with expansion in international markets like India, Japan, Singapore, Brazil, and Mexico. \nThe company’s co-founder, Mati Staniszewski, indicated that ElevenLabs might work on agents beyond voice and incorporate video. In January, the company announced a partnership with LTX to produce audio-to-video content.\n“The intersection of models and products is critical – and our team has proven, time and again, how to translate research into real-world experiences. This funding helps us go beyond voice alone to transform how we interact with technology altogether. We plan to expand our Creative offering – helping creators combine our best-in-class audio with video and Agents – enabling businesses to build agents that can talk, type, and take action,” he said in a statement.\nThe company has seen good growth momentum as it closed the year at $330 million ARR. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year, Staniszewski said that it took ElevenLabs five months to reach $200 million to $300 million in ARR.\nVoice AI model providers are an attractive target for investors and big tech companies. In January, rival Deepgram raised $130 million from AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation. Meanwhile, Google hired top talent from voice model company Hume AI, including CEO Alan Cowen.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:hocus-focus / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5:00 AM PST · February 4, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nSpotify on Wednesday announced changes to its built-in song lyrics feature, which includes making lyrics translations globally available, offering the ability to view lyrics when offline, and relocating the feature in the app.\nThe changes follow other tweaks the streamer has made to lyrics over the years, hoping to leverage the feature as a tool to push free users to become subscribers. That began with Spotify trying to paywall lyrics in 2024, before loosening its grip later in the year after numerous complaints. \nNow, the company hopes that the new offline lyrics feature — which will only be offered to Premium subscribers — could encourage users to upgrade.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nIn the new experience, lyrics will also be relocated so they appear directly beneath the album artwork or the short, looping video that plays alongside the music. Spotify says it chose to move lyrics to this more prominent position after user tests suggested it increased engagement with the feature. (It’s still possible to share favorite lyrics snippets to social media from the Now Playing View, the company noted.) \nThis feature, which Spotify called lyric previews, will roll out globally to both free and paid customers on the iOS and Android apps for smartphones and tablets. \nIn addition, lyrics translations, which were first introduced in 2022, will now be globally available. That’s an expansion from the 25 markets supported last year. When translations are available, you can tap the translate icon on the lyrics card to see the translation appear beneath the original lyrics. The translation will default to whatever your device’s language is set to, Spotify says. \nIn past years, Spotify had been slow to roll out lyrics across its app, largely due to licensing issues. After years of consumer demand for the feature, the company finally rolled out real-time lyrics to global users in 2021 after a smaller launch in a couple of dozen markets the year prior, and tests that spanned back to 2019. Before this, Spotify had partnered with Genius for a “behind the lyrics” feature, which combined partial lyrics with song trivia.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSNAK Venture Partners announced Wednesday the close of its oversubsubscribed $50 million debut fund, anchored by the investment firm Pritzker Group (founded by Illinois governor JB Pritzker and his brother, Tony). \nSNAK founders Sonia Nagar and Adam Koopersmith worked at the firm and helped lead investments in companies like the auto marketplace Backlot Cars and TicketsNow (exited to Ticketmaster). The duo decided to break out on their own and, earlier this year, launched their firm to back digital marketplaces. \n“It felt like the timing was right and there was support within the firm to go do this,” Nagar said. \nThe vision is that there is still so much to digitize, like in supply chain and construction, and this is the moment to strike because even holdout industries are more comfortable adopting new technology as fintech architecture advances. \n“If you look at the biggest venture wins over the last decade,” she said, pointing to the likes of Uber, Instacart, and Airbnb, “those are five of the top 10 outcomes in venture.” As in those companies that raised billions from investors, went on to IPO, and returned millions to them.\n“Most of those wins were in consumer, which tends to be faster-moving than large enterprises,” Nagar continued. “We think there’s a ton of white space to double down and focus on B2B marketplaces.” Looking specifically for the categories that haven’t yet digitized. \nThe firm has already invested in six companies, including BigRentals and Repackify, focused on equipment rental and packaging logistics, respectively. Nagar said the firm hopes to overall write seed checks into at least 20 companies, at $1 million to $2 million a pop. She said they hope to deploy the entire fund within the next 3 to 4 years. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThough many new funds are struggling to raise capital (and capital remains concentrated at the top), Nagar said she and Koopersmith were able to lean on their backgrounds when wooing LPs. \nNagar previously helped launch Amazon apparel back in 2009 and was head of mobile at RetailMeNot. Koopersmith, meanwhile, spent 20 years at Pritzker Group and serves on the board of various marketplace companies. At the same time, Nagar said that without Pritzker’s support, it would have been quite hard to raise this fund, especially in last year’s environment.\nOther LPs in their fund include the State of Illinois Growth and Innovation Fund and executives from other marketplace companies, like Favor Delivery and RetailMeNot. \nNagar said the firm is also location-agnostic, recognizing that the still-hidden marketplaces may not be found only in Silicon Valley and New York City. “We’re finding these overlooked founders in places where maybe other funds aren’t looking,” she said. \nSNAK is itself based in Chicago, which she said some LPs have questioned. “People perceive that as a disadvantage; we view it as an advantage,” she continued. “We can get to everybody very fast.” \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe founder of David Protein, maker of popular high-protein nutrition bars, announced on X on Monday that longevity guru Dr. Peter Attia “has stepped down from his role as Chief Science Officer at David.”\nThe announcement comes after Attia’s name appeared in more than 1,700 documents, including email correspondence, released on Friday as part of a massive file dump related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to The New York Times. Attia served on the executive team of the food startup and was also an early investor.\nFor those unfamiliar, Attia is a Canadian American physician who has become one of the most prominent voices in longevity and preventive health. He’s best known for his bestselling book “Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity” and his now seven-year-old podcast, wherein he explores optimization strategies. He was also hired just last month as a contributor to CBS.\nThree-year-old, New York-based David Protein raised a $75 million Series A funding round in May of last year led by Greenoaks, with participation from Valor Equity Partners. The company has experienced significant growth since launching its flagship protein bar in September 2024, a product it describes as having 28 grams of protein, zero sugar, and 150 calories.\nIn a lengthy post on X, Attia wrote that he was “ashamed” of some of the crude content in his emails with Epstein, but he also said he was not involved in criminal activity and never visited Epstein’s island or traveled on his plane. Attia also discussed at length how he came to know Epstein and why he stayed involved with him even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction.\nThe fallout appears to extend beyond David Protein. It also appears that Biograph, the healthcare testing and longevity startup that Attia co-founded with entrepreneur John Hering, may be distancing itself from the physician. The company declined to comment on Attia’s ongoing participation with the startup or about the pages on its website that used to mention him but now omit his name or return a “file not found” error.\nBiograph came out of stealth a year ago, TechCrunch previously reported, with backing from investors that include Vy Capital, Human Capital, Alpha Wave, and WndrCo, along with angel investors, including Balaji Srinivasan. Like a growing number of concierge medical service companies, Biograph offers premium preventive health services to subscribers who pay between $7,500 and $15,000 per year. Attia was previously named on the company’s press release and site as a co-founder.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSemiconductor startup Positron has secured $230 million in Series B funding, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The outfit plans to use the capital to speed up deployment of its high-speed memory chips, a critical component for the chips used for AI workloads, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. \nThe round, which brought Positron to a $1 billion valuation, was co-led by Arena Private Wealth, Jump Trading, and Unless, with strategic investment from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which has been increasingly focused on building out AI infrastructure, the sources said. \nThe Reno-based startup’s Series B comes as hyperscalers and AI firms push to reduce their reliance on longstanding leader Nvidia. These firms include OpenAI, which, despite being one of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers, is reportedly unsatisfied with some of the firm’s latest AI chips and has been seeking alternatives since last year. \nMeanwhile, Qatar, through QIA, has been accelerating a broader push into so-called “sovereign” AI infrastructure – a priority repeatedly underscored at Web Summit Qatar in Doha this week. Several sources told TechCrunch the country views compute capacity as critical to staying competitive on the global economic stage, and is positioning itself as a leading AI services hub in the Middle East, fueling interest in startups like Positron. \nThe strategy is already taking shape through major commitments, including a $20 billion AI infrastructure joint venture with Brookfield Asset Management that was announced in December.\nPositron’s fundraise brings the three-year-old startup’s total capital raised to just over $300 million. The startup previously raised $75 million last year from investors including Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, DFJ Growth, Flume Ventures and Resilience Reserve. \nThe company claims its first-generation chip, Atlas, manufactured in Arizona, can match the performance of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for less than a third of the power. Positron is focused on inference – computing needed to run AI models for real-world applications – rather than training large language models, positioning the company well as demand surges for inference hardware as businesses increasingly shift focus from building large models to deploying them at scale.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWith the funding, Positron aims to accelerate its roadmap to ship its next-generation Asimov silicon chip, targeting production in early 2027.\nSources tell TechCrunch that beyond its memory capabilities, Positron’s chips also perform strongly in high-frequency and video-processing workloads.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Positron for more information.\nThis article has been updated to include updates from Positron about co-lead investors and valuation. \nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated the date of QIA’s partnership with Brookfield. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nSkyryse, an El Segundo, California-based aviation automation startup, has raised more than $300 million in a Series C investment, pushing its valuation to $1.15 billion and into unicorn territory.\nThe round, which was announced Tuesday and led by Autopilot Ventures, provided a multimillion-dollar accelerant for the startup as it nears the end of a lengthy Federal Aviation Administration certification process for its flight control system. The capital will also be used to integrate its operating system, known as SkyOS, across numerous aircraft, including U.S. military Black Hawk helicopters.\nOther investors in this round include Fidelity Management & Research Company, ArrowMark Partners, Atreides Management LP, BAM Elevate, Baron Capital Group, Durable Capital Partners, Positive Sum, Qatar Investment Authority, RCM Private Markets Fund managed by Rokos Capital Management, and Woodline Partners. The startup, which was founded in 2016, has raised more than $605 million in equity capital. \nImage Credits:Skyryse\nSkyryse has made inroads with investors as well as the U.S. military, emergency medical service operators, law enforcement, and private operators for its simplified flight system. The startup has stripped out dozens of mechanical flight controls like gauges and switches and replaced them with a system containing several flight computers that automate the more complicated and dangerous aspects of flying.\nThis is not a fully autonomous system; a pilot must still handle the operations. But it’s designed to automate the trickiest aspects of flying, enhance the skills of pilots, and improve safety.\nThat simplicity and ease of operation — a literal swipe of the finger on a touchscreen — has won over companies like United Rotorcraft, Air Methods, and Mitsubishi Corporation, which have contracts with Skyryse to integrate SkyOS on a variety of helicopters and airplanes.\nSkyryse started building and testing its system on helicopters, one of the most unstable aircraft to operate. But the idea is that SkyOS can be applied to any aircraft. That initial operating system, known as Skyryse One, automates takeoff and landing and fully automates hover and engine-out emergency landings. The company has since integrated the operating system on Black Hawk helicopters.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSkyryse has made progress on its certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration.

    "body": "\nNew York City and others like it are filled with old buildings that are for the most part fine, except they’re not all that comfortable to live in. Built in an era when massive boilers were cutting-edge technology, the buildings are usually too hot or too cold, but seldom just right.\nThere are companies trying to rectify that using clever horseshoe-shaped heat pumps. Superficially, they’re similar to window air conditioners, except they don’t block the view and they can heat as well as cool. \nGradient makes one of those heat pumps, but now it’s adding a twist: In multifamily buildings, it can link every one of its window units together. The startup shared with TechCrunch exclusive details about the new Nexus software and service.\n“Multifamily buildings are an ignored sector,” Vince Romanin, chief technology officer at Gradient, told TechCrunch. “It’s a place where we can do better for the user.”\nThe startup is mostly targeting old buildings that need HVAC upgrades. Gradient has worked with the New York City Housing Authority to install its heat pumps in public housing, and it ran a pilot in Tracy, California, in a newer two-story affordable-housing complex. It’s also talking with colleges and universities, many of which have dorms that weren’t built with hot autumn weather in mind.\nOld buildings often have one electric meter, which can tempt residents into overusing their heating or air conditioning. Nexus gives some control back to building managers. They can set guardrails to prevent people from overusing the heat or AC — either intentionally or otherwise — while still allowing them to be comfortable. In one instance, a building manager set the heating limit at 78˚ F, and the next day energy consumption dropped by a quarter.\nRomanin said Gradient’s heat pumps are the “lowest-cost option” for old buildings with boilers that are reaching end of life, a common occurrence in New York City. As a bonus, units that previously only had a steam radiator now get air conditioning, future proofing the units against worsening heat waves. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy installing a window unit rather than a minisplit, retrofits can happen within hours. They also don’t require electrical upgrades, Romanin said. In buildings with old electrical wiring that can’t support a full 12 amp load on a single outlet, Nexus can reduce the draw, said Mansi Shah, senior vice president of product and software at Gradient.\nThat strategy can extend beyond the building too. When the grid is overwhelmed by demand, which can happen on hot summer days, Gradient is working on a way to dial back its heat pumps while still maintaining occupant comfort. By using information about the building along with feedback from sensors in the heat pumps, the company hopes to predict which units can reduce their air conditioning demand, like those on the shady side of a building. That sort of demand response can help the grid serve more heat pumps without requiring costly upgrades.\n“There’s a lot of people who said when we electrify everything, the grid won’t handle it,” Romanin said. “I think that it is very possible to electrify everything and make the grid better, make the grid’s job easier, and make electrons cheaper.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

    "body": "\nAdobe is putting on hold its plan to discontinue Adobe Animate following intense backlash from its customers after it announced plans to shut down the 2D animation software amid an increased focus on its investments in AI.\n“We are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate. Animate will continue to be available for both current and new customers, and we will ensure you continue to have access to your content,” the company wrote in a post on Wednesday.\nAdobe’s Monday announcement about discontinuing Animate was met with incredulity, disappointment, and anger, and users aired concerns about the lack of alternatives that mirror Animate’s functionality.\nThe company changed its tune on Wednesday, saying there would no longer be a “deadline or date by which Animate will no longer be available.”\n“Adobe Animate is in maintenance mode for all customers. This applies to individual, small business, and enterprise customers.  Maintenance mode means we will continue to support the application and provide ongoing security and bug fixes, but we are no longer adding new features. Animate will continue to be available for both new and existing users - we will not be discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate,” it said.\nOne customer, posting on X, had asked Adobe to at least open source the software rather than abandon it. Commenters on the thread responded with angst, saying things like, “this is legit gonna ruin my life,” and, “literally what the hell are they doing? animate is the reason a good chunk of adobe users even subscribe in the first place.”\nOn Monday, the company updated its support site and sent emails to existing customers announcing that Adobe Animate would be discontinued on March 1, 2026. Enterprise customers would continue to receive technical support through March 1, 2029, to ease the transition, the company said at the time. Other customers would have support through March of next year.\nAdobe explained its decision to discontinue the program in an FAQ, saying, “Animate has been a product that has existed for over 25 years and has served its purpose well for creating, nurturing, and developing the animation ecosystem. As technologies evolve, new platforms and paradigms emerge that better serve the needs of the users. Acknowledging this change, we are planning to discontinue supporting Animate.”\n\n\n\n\nReading between the lines, it seemed as if Adobe was saying that Animate no longer represents the current direction of the company, which is now more focused on products that incorporate AI technologies.\nWhat’s surprising is that Adobe couldn’t even recommend software that would fully replace what customers are losing with Animate. Instead, it said customers with a Creative Cloud Pro plan can use other Adobe apps to “replace portions of Animate functionality.”\nFor instance, it suggested that Adobe After Effects can support complex keyframe animation using the Puppet tool, and Adobe Express can be used for animation effects that can be applied to photos, videos, text, shapes and other design elements.\nThere were hints that Adobe was headed in this direction when no mention was made of Animate at the company’s annual Adobe Max conference. Plus, no 2025 version of the software was released.\nBefore switching to “maintenance mode,” Abode had intended for the software to continue to work for those who have it downloaded. Typically, Adobe charged $34.49 per month for the software, which dropped to $22.99 with a 12-month commitment. The annual prepaid plan was available for $263.88. Now, the company says it will be available to new users, as well.\nSome users have been recommending other animation programs to use as a replacement, including Moho Animation and Toon Boom Harmony.\nUpdated, Feb. 4, 2026, to note that Adobe reversed its decision and announced the software would be placed in maintenance mode instead of discontinued. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nVaraha, an India-based climate tech startup, has raised $20 million in fresh funding as it looks to scale carbon removal projects from the Global South and position itself as a lower-cost supplier for verified emissions reductions.\nThe investment marks the first portion of a planned $45 million Series B round led by WestBridge Capital, the venture firm’s first investment in climate tech, with participation from existing investors including RTP Global and Omnivore. Founded in 2022, Varaha has raised about $33 million in equity to date, alongside $35 million in project financing and $500,000 in grants, as it builds carbon removal projects across Asia and Africa.\nIndia has emerged as an increasingly important base for carbon removal projects, offering lower operating costs, deep agricultural supply chains, and a large pool of technical talent as corporate demand for verified removals rises, including from companies facing growing energy use from data centers and AI workloads. Varaha is positioning itself to capitalize on those advantages, arguing that its execution-focused model allows it to deliver carbon removal at lower cost while meeting the same international verification standards as higher-priced competitors in Europe and North America.\nVaraha’s advantage lies less in proprietary technology and more in execution, said co-founder and chief executive Madhur Jain in an interview, arguing that high operating costs could become a constraint for carbon removal developers in wealthier markets as prices come under pressure.\n“If carbon credit is a cost to the businesses that are buying these carbon credits … it’s a cost on their balance sheet. It’s not a CSR item,” Jain told TechCrunch. “And hence, if the cost of a certain geography is going to be so high by an order of magnitude of like, 1.5x to 3x credit production, it is going to be extremely hard for those companies to survive.”\nVaraha develops carbon removal projects across four main pathways: regenerative agriculture, agroforestry, biochar, and enhanced rock weathering, working largely with smallholder farmers and industrial partners in emerging markets. The startup generates and sells verified carbon removal credits through international registries, including Puro.earth, Isometric, Verra, Gold Standard, and Switzerland-based Carbon Standards International, positioning itself as a supplier to global corporations seeking durable and independently validated emissions reductions.\nOne of Varaha’s Regenerative agriculture projectsImage Credits:Varaha\nTo date, Varaha has removed more than 2 million tons of carbon dioxide across 14 active projects, generating around 150,000 carbon removal credits, Jain said. He added that the startup was the first in India to issue carbon credits from biochar projects and the first in Asia to issue credits from enhanced rock weathering through an international registry.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVaraha reported revenue of ₹430 million (about $4.76 million) last financial year from delivered credits and expects revenue to rise to nearly ₹1 billion (around $11.06 million) this year, while remaining profitable after tax.\nThe startup has signed long-term offtake agreements with global buyers including Google and Microsoft, as well as corporates such as Lufthansa, Swiss Re, and Capgemini.\nVaraha currently operates across India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Ivory Coast, working with about 170,000 to 175,000 farmers over roughly 1.7 million acres, Jain said. The latest funding will be used to expand into additional markets in South and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Indonesia, while deepening its presence in existing geographies.\nThe startup is also rolling out an Industrial Partners Program, which allows industrial operators with access to sustainable biomass and gasification capacity to generate verified biochar-based carbon removal credits using Varaha’s measurement, reporting, and verification systems. The program is already operational with partners in West Africa and India, including agribusinesses and a steel producer, as Varaha looks to scale carbon removal through partnerships rather than owning all assets itself.\n“The problem is so big that tech, etc., will become open source over a period of time,” Jain said. “So what matters the most is the execution.”\nVaraha employs about 225 to 230 people, including roughly 55 across technology, science, product and data roles, with more than 80% of its workforce based in India. While the startup does not maintain offices overseas, it has staff in markets including Nepal, Germany, the U.S., and Australia, reflecting its growing international customer base.\n“We believe Varaha is uniquely positioned to build a global carbon-removal platform from India, combining integrity, scale, and impact,” said Sandeep Singhal, co-founder and managing partner, WestBridge Capital. “This investment reflects our conviction in the team and their potential to shape the next phase of climate infrastructure worldwide.”\n",

    "body": "\nAlexa+, Amazon’s upgraded, generative AI-powered version of its Alexa assistant, is available to all U.S. customers as of Wednesday. The company said that the AI feature will be free to Prime members across devices. Meanwhile, anyone can use Alexa+ for free via the Alexa website or mobile app, with some limitations.\n“We have tens of millions of customers using Alexa+ now, and now we’re going to make it available to all Prime members…Prime members enjoy unlimited access — it’s basically a paid tier level of access that we’re including in Prime now,” notes Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. \nAnnounced last year, Alexa+ is model agnostic — meaning it runs on a combination of Amazon’s own foundation models and those from other companies, allowing the assistant to do more than the basic tasks of its predecessor using whatever AI technology is best for the job. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nAs an AI assistant, Alexa+ can carry on natural language conversations that include follow-up questions and back-and-forth chat.\nIn addition to performing smart home tasks, scheduling timers, or offering news and weather, as before, the new assistant can do most things that other AI chatbots can do — like planning an itinerary for a trip, updating a shared calendar, finding and saving recipes to a library, making movie recommendations, helping with homework, exploring a topic, and more. \nPlus, integrations with services like Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, Uber, Angi, Expedia, Square, Yelp, Fodor’s, OpenTable, and Suno will allow Alexa to perform more complex tasks, like scheduling a dinner reservation or requesting an Uber ride. Amazon has not yet shared user adoption numbers on this more “agentic” use case (where the AI acts autonomously to complete tasks) for the AI helper.\nDuring its year-long beta testing period, Alexa customers had the option to try the AI feature or roll back to the prior version. The company tells TechCrunch the option to revert to the old Alexa will continue to be available, but couldn’t say for how long. Likely, Amazon wants a bit more time to improve the AI experience before making it a requirement for users. The percentage of those opting out is also a key metric to track, but Rausch notes that the figure is in the low single digits, suggesting that most customers are not so unhappy with Alexa+ that they’re giving up. \nImage Credits:Amazon\nStill, Amazon has had to work to resolve bugs and address user feedback ahead of this launch. Some beta testers complained that Alexa+ was too chatty, or interrupted at the wrong times, for instance. Others complained about Alexa’s new voice.\nAmazon has taken in this feedback and made changes over time. For instance, the company revised the onboarding experience to have Alexa explain how to change her voice, as some preferred Alexa’s “OG” voice. (That voice is still available as Alexa+ voice No. 2, but it now uses AI to add more inflection.)\n“Eventually, we had her use her new version of her old voice, and then switch back again, just to show customers,” says Rausch, describing the changes the team made to onboarding. \nIn another example, Amazon tried to make Alexa less prone to unwanted interruptions. Now, Alexa will ask, “Is that for me?” when the AI is unsure who is being addressed. \nImage Credits:Screenshot of the new Alexa app\nRausch points out that the overall experience is configurable, too. If customers don’t want the follow-on mode, for instance — which allows Alexa to continue listening after responding — they can turn it off.\nAsked if users will be able to change the AI assistant’s personality, as in other AI chatbots, where the AI can be set to be personal, professional, quirky, nerdy, and more,  Rausch says simply, “Stay tuned.” \nDuring the beta, Amazon reported positive adoption trends in terms of both usage and engagement, with few customers opting for rollbacks. Music streams increased by 25% after customers upgraded to Alexa+, and more customers are engaging deeply with recipes, a feature that has seen 5x growth.\nOverall, customers are having 2 to 3 times more conversations with Alexa+, compared with the original Alexa. \nWhile Alexa+ will be free to U.S. Prime members, non-Prime customers could opt to pay $19.99/month for standalone access — a price that’s comparable to something like ChatGPT Plus. \nAmazon notes the free experience on web and mobile will have some limits, but these are mainly in place to protect against abuse. \n“I think we’ve got some great, generous limits. We’re not talking about exactly what they are today, but…there are some [limits],” Rausch says. \nThe Alexa+ experience in the U.S. will be available across Alexa devices, including Echo products, Fire TV, Alexa.com, the Alexa mobile app, and Alexa-enabled devices from partners including Samsung, Bose, and others, with more to come. \n",

    "body": "\nApple is bringing agentic coding to Xcode. On Tuesday, the company announced the release of Xcode 26.3, which will allow developers to use agentic tools, including Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex, directly in Apple’s official app development suite.\nThe Xcode 26.3 Release Candidate is available to all Apple Developers today from the developer website and will hit the App Store a bit later. \nThis latest update comes on the heels of the Xcode 26 release last year, which introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple’s other hardware platforms.\nThe integration of agentic coding tools allows AI models to tap into more of Xcode’s features to perform their tasks and perform more complex automation.\nThe models will also have access to Apple’s current developer documentation to ensure they use the latest APIs and follow the best practices as they build. \nAt launch, the agents can help developers explore their project, understand its structure and metadata, then build the project and run tests to see if there are any errors and fix them, if so. \nImage Credits:Apple\nTo prepare for this launch, Apple said it worked closely with both Anthropic and OpenAI to design the new experience. Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode. \nXcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.\nDevelopers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode’s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-Codex vs. GPT-5.1 mini).\nIn a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple’s provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.  \nImage Credits:Apple\nAs the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it’s easy to see what’s happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what’s happening under the hood. \nThis transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting a “code-along” workshop on Thursday on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real time with their own copy of Xcode.\nAt the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.) \nPlus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nMost of what we know about the ocean just skims the surface, literally. We’ve gathered a large quantity of data on the oceans from satellites, but most of that is based on the top layer of water. Below that, the picture gets murkier.\nBuoys, ships, and some autonomous rovers have recently added some detail, but it’s nothing like what we get from satellites today. It’s frustrating to everyone from fishermen to the Coast Guard, meteorologists to offshore wind developers.\n“Getting data from the subsurface ocean has always been really hard,” Ravi Pappu, founder and CEO of Apeiron Labs, told TechCrunch. “It’s really slow. You need a ship that costs $100,000 a day, [and] steams out slowly. Everything’s an expedition.”\nPappu hopes that his bobbing, autonomous underwater vehicle can change that. He founded Apeiron Labs in 2022 after a stint as CTO of In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. There, the lack of data on the ocean was “a persistent problem” that kept coming up. \nTo fill the gaps, Apeiron Labs is building low-cost vehicles that travel 400 meters up and down the water column (the vertical section of ocean from surface to seafloor), sampling temperature, salinity, and acoustics once or twice per day. Apeiron currently sells to both civilian and defense customers, Pappu said.\nTo build and sell more of its autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), Apeiron Labs recently closed a $9.5 million Series A round led by Dyne Ventures, RA Capital Management Planetary Health and S2G Investments, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Assembly Ventures, Bay Bridge Ventures, and TFX Capital participated.\nAt three feet long, five inches in diameter, and just over 20 pounds, the startup’s AUVs can be deployed from boats or airplanes. Not coincidentally, they also fit into the U.S. Navy’s existing launch equipment. Once the AUV hits the water, it gets its bearings and connects to a cloud-based operating system, where it logs its data. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhile it dives, the operating system uses models of the ocean to predict where it will surface. When the AUV finally breaches and reconnects with the operating system, the cloud-based software incorporates the new data to refine its models. The AUVs are spaced about 10 km to 20 km apart (6.2 miles to 12.4 miles), forming a line or array that captures data in greater resolution than ship-based efforts.\nApeiron envisions deploying dozens or hundreds of its AUVs for a range of customers. The Pentagon might use them to listen for submarines off the coast of the U.S., while fisheries might want to receive more detailed temperature and salinity data about prime fishing waters. The goal is persistent monitoring in key parts of the ocean.\nPappu said that at Apeiron’s current scale, it has brought the cost of ocean data down by 100-fold. He wants to get it down by a factor of 1,000, and he thinks Apeiron can hit that target next year. Referencing a type of small, low-cost satellite, Pappu adds: “We think of ourselves as the CubeSat for the ocean.”\nUpdate 10 am ET: The headline has been updated to reflect that Apeiron raised $9.5 million, not $29 million.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

The move comes shortly after the company’s acquisition by the Italian tech conglomerate Bending Spoons, which purchased it in an all-cash deal last year for $1.38 billion.\nBending Spoons confirmed the layoffs to BI but wouldn’t share how many people would lose their jobs. The Verge reports that the cutbacks will impact a “large portion” of the company’s total workforce, citing a LinkedIn post from Vimeo’s former VP of Global Brand and Creative, who stated that he, “along with a large portion of the company,” had been “impacted by layoffs.”\nTechCrunch reached out to Vimeo and Bending Spoons for more information.\nVimeo, which was founded in 2004, has struggled to find its footing in a field dominated by YouTube. In recent years, the company has leaned heavily into AI. In 2023, it announced plans to launch AI-powered script-writing and video-editing tools. This past October, the company added a suite of additional AI-powered creator tools designed to connect filmmakers’ “content directly to AI workflows.”\nIn recent years, Bending Spoons has acquired a number of other well-known tech platforms, including Meetup, Evernote, and WeTransfer.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n",

Congrats to the Tesla AI team!” \nHe then made a recruitment pitch for engineers interested in “solving real-world AI,” which he says will “likely lead to AGI” to join the Tesla AI team. \nThe automaker launched its robotaxis in the Texas city last June in a limited deployment with a safety operator in the front passenger seat. Tesla initially offered those first rides to influencers and handpicked customers. In December, Tesla began testing its robotaxis in Austin without a safety driver in the front seat — a precaution in case the vehicle needs a human to take over.\nNot all of Tesla’s fleet in Austin will be fully driverless. Per Tesla’s AI lead Ashok Elluswamy, the company will be “starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.”\nTesla is charging for the rides, according to one rider who posted on X. There also appears to be a chase car following the driverless vehicles. \nSome of Tesla’s rivals, like Zoox and Waymo, did not immediately charge for driverless rides upon initial deployment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTechCrunch has attempted to reach out to Tesla for clarification. \nThe article has been updated to reflect new information, including that Tesla is charging for the rides. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Transportation\n\n",

As the court date gets closer, Meta’s lawyers are working hard to limit what can be used against the company in court. \nAccording to public records reviewed by Wired, the company wants to block research about social media’s impact on youth mental health, stories about teen suicides linked to social media, any mention of Meta’s finances, the company’s past privacy violations, and even things about CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s college years.\nThese efforts are part of a lawsuit filed by New Mexico attorney general Raúl Torrez in late 2023. The state accuses Meta of failing to protect minors from online predators, trafficking, and sexual abuse on its platforms. The case claims Meta allegedly allowed explicit material to reach minors and didn’t put adequate child safety measures in place. \nNotably, this lawsuit is considered the first trial of its kind at the state level, scheduled to begin on February 2.\nIt’s fairly standard that Meta would try to keep the case as narrow as possible. However, two legal experts who talked to Wired believe the company’s attempt to keep out so much information is unusually broad, including its requests not to mention its AI chatbots.\nAdditionally, Meta requested that the court block any mention of a public health warning issued by former U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy regarding social media’s effect on youth mental health. The company also doesn’t want surveys (including its own) about the amount of inappropriate content on its platforms. It argues that all this information is irrelevant or could unfairly sway the jury.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:58 AM PST · January 22, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nSubstack, a platform known primarily for newsletters, is launching a TV app for Apple TV and Google TV. The company announced on Thursday that the beta app will allow subscribers to watch video posts and livestreams on TV created by authors on its platform.\nThe TV app features a TikTok-like “For You” row that will highlight videos from these creators, along with recommended videos.\nFree and paid subscribers can now start using the TV app, with access based on their subscription tier. Substack plans to add paid content previews for free subscribers in the future. The platform also plans to add audio posts and read-alouds, enhanced search and discovery features, in-app upgrades to paid subscriptions, and dedicated sections for each publication where subscribers can explore all videos from a specific creator.\nThe move comes as Substack has been investing more heavily in video and livestreaming, as it looks to compete with platforms like YouTube and Patreon for both creators and viewers.\nSubstack began its push into video with the launch of video posts back in 2022. It then started allowing creators to monetize videos early last year. Around the same time, it rolled out livestreaming capabilities to all publishers. The company has also embraced short-form video, launching a TikTok-like video feed in its app in March 2025.\n“Substack is the home for the best longform—work creators put real care into and subscribers choose to spend time with,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Now these thought-provoking videos and livestreams have a natural home on the TV, where subscribers can settle in for the extended viewing that great video deserves.”\nWhile Substack sees the launch as the next step in its video ambitions, comments on its announcement tell another story. The top comment on the company’s blog post reads: “Please don’t do this. This is not YouTube. Elevate the written word.” Another popular comment reads: “You guys have gone from saying Substack is the best home for longform writing/writers to ‘Substack is the home for the best longform—work…’. I get trying to evolve, but this just seems like another venture capital-fueled idea.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOther comments reflect a similar sentiment, questioning why the platform appears to be shifting its focus from writing to video. \nIt’s worth noting that Substack isn’t the only platform pushing into the living room, as Instagram recently launched IG for TV, a new experience that lets users watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIt’s going to be more difficult to fake or manipulate Ring camera video footage going forward. On Thursday, the Amazon-owned device maker introduced Ring Verify, a new video authenticity feature that will allow anyone to determine whether a video has been altered in any way.\nThe company says this could be useful when you come across shared videos, like those sent to you by a neighbor or those purporting to show some sort of incident.\nWhile you may not be able to instantly identify whether some TikTok video was AI-generated — like bunnies jumping on a trampoline, for instance — you will be alerted to any changes to a Ring video that someone has shared with you directly.\nImage Credits:Ring\n“Think of it like the tamper-evident seal on a medicine bottle — if anyone changes the video in any way, even something small like trimming a few seconds or adjusting the brightness, the seal breaks,” Ring explained in its announcement.\nThe verification feature will be automatically enabled on every video recorded with a Ring device from December 2025 onward, the company notes. Any changes or edits, including cropping and filters, will break that verification seal. Ring says this includes videos uploaded to sharing sites that compress footage.\nFailing verification doesn’t necessarily mean the video is fake. It’s just a signal that it has been altered. Maybe someone boosted the brightness for visibility, or it could mean the video was recorded before December 2025.\nImage Credits:Ring\nIn the case of a failed verification, recipients can request a copy of the unedited video. Ring suggests this could be useful for purposes like insurance claims.\nThe verification feature, which is built on C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) industry standards, will be present on all videos downloaded or shared from Ring’s cloud, regardless of the specific device that captured the footage. But the company notes that content verification will not be compatible with videos recorded using end-to-end encryption — those will always show as “not verified,” it said. \nTo verify footage, Ring will be able to visit the website Ring.com/verify and submit their video link and get instant results.\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch noticed the verification website was not yet up and running. The coma y says the correct URL is http://www.ring.com/pages/verify and its blog had it listed incorrectly. \nThe company’s announcement was also delayed due to the outage with Microsoft 365 today, a rep for Ring said.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nKais Khimji has spent most of his professional career as a venture investor, including six years as a partner at the prominent VC firm Sequoia Capital.\nBut just like several other former Sequoia partners — including David Vélez, who founded the Brazilian digital bank Nubank — Khimji (pictured left) has always wanted to be a startup founder. On Thursday, he announced that he has revived an idea he began working on as a student at Harvard about 10 years ago, turning it into the AI calendar-scheduling company Blockit. In a major vote of confidence, Khimji’s former employer, Sequoia, led the company’s $5 million seed round.\n“Blockit has a chance to become a $1Bn+ revenue business, and Kais will make sure it gets there,” Pat Grady, Sequoia’s general partner and co-steward who led the investment, wrote in a blog post.\nWhile many startups have tried to automate scheduling in the past, Khimji believes that thanks to advances in LLMs, Blockit’s AI agents can handle scheduling more seamlessly and efficiently than many of its predecessors, including now-defunct startups Clara Labs and x.ai. (Yes, that domain name ended up with Elon Musk’s AI company.)\nUnlike the current category leader Calendly, which was last valued at $3 billion and relies on users sharing links to find availability, Blockit is betting that its AI agents can master the nuance required to handle the entire scheduling process without human involvement.\nWith Blockit, Khimji and co-founder John Hahn — who previously worked on calendar products, including Timeful, Google Calendar, and Clockwise — are building what is essentially an AI social network for people’s time.\n“It always felt very odd. I have a time database — my calendar. You have a time database — your calendar, and our databases just can’t talk to each other,” Khimji told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nKhimji says that Blockit can finally solve this disconnection. When two users need to meet, their respective AI agents communicate directly to negotiate a time, bypassing the typical back-and-forth emails entirely.\nUsers can invoke the Blockit agent by copying it on an email or messaging it in Slack about a meeting. The bot then takes over the logistics, negotiating a mutually convenient time and location that fits the preferences of all participants.\nKhimji said that Blockit can work as seamlessly as a human executive assistant. Users simply need to provide the system with specific instructions about their preferences, such as which meetings are nonnegotiable and which are “movable” based on daily needs. “Sometimes my calendar is crazy, so I need to skip lunch, and the agent needs to know that it’s okay to skip lunch,” he said.\nThe system can even be trained to prioritize meetings based on the tone of an email. For instance, a user might instruct the agent that a meeting request signed with a formal “Best regards” should take precedence over a casual interaction ending with “Cheers.”\nBy learning the preferences of its users, Blockit appears to be capitalizing on what venture firm Foundation Capital’s partners Jaya Gupta and Ashu Garg call “context graphs.” In a widely shared essay, the investors describe a multibillion-dollar opportunity for AI agents to capture the “why” behind every business decision by relying on the hidden logic that previously only existed in a person’s head.\nBlockit is already being used by more than 200 companies, including AI startup Together.ai, the newly acquired fintech company Brex, and robotics startup Rogo, as well as venture firms a16z, Accel, and Index. The app is available for free for 30 days. After that, it costs $1,000 annually for individual users and $5,000 annually for a team license with support for multiple users, Khimji said.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:GM\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3:55 PM PST · January 22, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nGeneral Motors is shuffling where its vehicles are made in a move that will shift production away from China and Mexico and to a U.S. factory in Kansas. That change will also mean the end of its rebooted Chevrolet Bolt EV, the only vehicle currently built at the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas.\nThe factory musical chairs reflect an economic and political environment, shaped by the Trump administration’s tariff policy and its decision to end the federal EV tax credit, which provided up to $7,500 off qualifying electric vehicles. These changes have made it more expensive to build vehicles in China and Mexico that are then sold in the United States.\nProduction of the 2027 Chevy Bolt EV, which landed in dealerships this month, is expected to end in about a year and a half. The new Chevy Bolt EV, which is priced at $29,990 including the destination fee, is one of the most affordable new EVs available to U.S. consumers.\nGM confirmed to TechCrunch that the next-generation Buick Envision, currently built in China, will move to the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas, beginning in 2028. The gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox, which is made in the San Luis Potosí plant in Mexico, will move to the Kansas factory in mid-2027.\nThe Bolt, meanwhile, will have a short life if GM follows through with its previously announced plans.\n“When we revealed Bolt in October, we said and it was widely reported that it’d be a limited run model,” a GM spokesperson said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. “We had also previously announced the gas-powered Equinox would be coming to Fairfax in mid 2027 after Bolt production ramps down. Today we’re announcing the next-generation Buick compact SUV will come to Fairfax beginning in 2028.”\nThe company still sells other EVs, including an electric Chevy Equinox and Chevy Blazer. The question is whether GM will change course and save the Bolt if sales are better than expected. We do know that GM has promised to make new future investments in Fairfax Assembly for its next generation of affordable EVs. We just don’t know when. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nWaymo robotaxis can now be hailed by the public in Miami. \nThe company said Thursday it will initially open the service, on a rolling basis, to the nearly 10,000 local residents on its waitlist. Once accepted, riders will be able to hail a robotaxi within a 60-square-mile service area in Miami that covers neighborhoods such as the Design District, Wynwood, Brickell, and Coral Gables. \nWaymo said it plans to eventually expand to Miami International Airport, but didn’t provide a timeline beyond that it was coming “soon.”\nWaymo has had a presence in Miami for months in the lead-up to the commercial launch. After mapping and then testing its autonomous vehicles on Miami’s public roads, the company removed safety operators from the fleet in November. The driverless service was initially open to employees.\nImage Credits:Waymo\nThis phased approach is part of Waymo’s launch playbook, and one that is being implemented far more often than even a year ago. Waymo first opened its robotaxis to the general public in Phoenix in 2020. It expanded to San Francisco and Los Angeles and eventually opened it to all riders in 2024. As the company continued to expand in those metro areas — pushing into the larger Bay Area and into Silicon Valley, for example — it also opened in new markets. \nWaymo opened a robotaxi service in spring 2025 in partnership with Uber in Atlanta and Austin, and expanded its service area in existing markets to include freeways. \nWaymo has laid out an aggressive plan to bring its robotaxi service to nearly a dozen more cities over the next year. Those plans include Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, London, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The company has already started testing in some of those cities using a mix of its all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles and newer Zeekr RT vans that have been rebranded “Ojai.”\nWaymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last October that “by the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week.” \nThe expansion hasn’t been without problems. Residents in cities like San Francisco have captured video of Waymo vehicles creating traffic jams, notably during a widespread power outage in December. \nIt has also gotten the attention of federal safety regulators.  \nThe National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened an initial investigation into the company last October over how its robotaxis operated around a stopped school bus in Atlanta. School district officials in Austin have shared video and complaints around the same issue of Waymo moving past school buses even when the lights are on and the stop sign is deployed.\nThe company has issued a voluntary software recall to fix that issue. However, new videos, which show Waymos illegally passing school buses, suggest the problem has not been resolved.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nJenny Liu, former CEO of exclusive, celebrity-favorite gym Dogpound, said there were two reasons she wanted to start her own venture fund. \nFor one, she was surrounded by wellness founders at her local gym who loved testing new products and building community. Second, Liu also realized that many of these founders, especially women and minorities, were struggling to fund their ideas due to limited access to founder networks. \nTo bridge this gap, she launched Crush It Ventures, a wellness-focused early-stage fund. The firm hopes to back companies building across the wellness sector, including in mental health, fitness and sport, beauty, and hospitality. On Thursday, it announced the final close of a $5 million Fund I. \nThe wellness industry often overlaps with the health sector (like sleep and body health), making it quite hard to estimate how big it truly is. Nonetheless, wellness trends have been booming in the past few years. Gyms have become a Gen Z obsession, and so have run clubs.\nA McKinsey study from last year found that the U.S. alone spends more than $500 billion a year on wellness. Young people in particular have become big spenders as they continue to openly talk about mental health and burnout. The McKinsey report said that though Gen Z makes up 36% of the adult U.S. population, they are responsible for over 41% of wellness spending. This is compared to those 58 and older, who make up around 35% of the U.S. population, yet account for 28% of wellness spending.\nLiu believes this area has become so popular because people are realizing that health is more than just physical fitness — it also involves mental, emotional, and social well-being. “As we automate more with technology in our daily lives, we’re valuing experiences and products that foster real connection and long-term well-being,” she said. “It’s also a reflection of shifting values: younger generations want purpose-driven brands and are craving real community.” \nLiu said she started raising the fund in 2024. Though the environment was “cautious,” she said, there was a growing interest in wellness, “especially from LPs looking for more diverse mission-driven funds.” The environment for new funds is still tough (especially for a woman solo GP) as most of the capital continues to flow to the top firms.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLiu declined to share the name of the LPs in the fund but said she was able to break through as a new fund manager by leaning into her network. She has a background in banking before angel investing in the gym, later joining as CFO. During her decade there, she was CEO for two years.\nAt Dogpound, she worked with founders and celebrities around the world. “I learned that brand building is not just about marketing a product or service, but about creating a space for shared experiences, joy, and genuine connection,” she said, adding that her fund is keen on helping founders build their brand and communities as they scale their businesses. \nCrush It plans to typically write checks of $100,000 to $250,000, and invest in between 20 and 25 companies, she said. So far, the firm has invested in 18 companies, like the wearable tech company Elemind and CPG business Caliwater. She hopes to deploy all of the checks within the next 12-18 months. \n“We want to help close the gap in wellness funding for underrepresented founders, build stronger founder networks, and show that purpose and community-driven companies can scale and make a meaningful difference in health and lifestyle,” she said. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOpenAI has reorganized some of its leadership and picked a familiar face to lead its push into selling AI to business customers as the company looks to catch up to its rivals in 2026.\nThe company appointed Barret Zoph to lead its efforts to sell its AI to enterprises, according to reporting from The Information, citing an internal OpenAI memo.\nTechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for confirmation and more information.\nZoph returned to OpenAI last week after leaving Thinking Machine Labs, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s AI startup where Zoph had served as a co-founder and CTO since October 2024.\nThe exact circumstances of his departure aren’t clear, with rumors swirling about whether Zoph and a few other former OpenAI employees were fired or left on their own accord, possibly with plans to return to OpenAI all along.\nZoph was previously the vice president of post-training inference at OpenAI from September 2022 to October 2024. He’s stepping into a very different position and will likely play an important role at the company as it looks to grow its enterprise business — an area where it is losing ground to competitors.\nOpenAI launched its enterprise-focused ChatGPT Enterprise product in 2023 more than a year before Anthropic and multiple years before Google launched its enterprise offerings. The company claims the product has more than 5 million business users and counts companies including SoftBank, Target, and Lowe’s as customers.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut its market share is falling while its rivals are climbing.\nAnthropic holds a dominant lead over its AI rivals when it comes to enterprise large language model usage. The AI research lab holds a 40% market share, according to a December report from VC firm Menlo Ventures (which, it should be noted, has invested aggressively in Anthropic). In July, the startup’s market share was estimated to be 32%.\nGoogle’s Gemini adoption has been steadier, according to Menlo Ventures. The company released its enterprise product last fall and has seen its enterprise LLM usage market share largely stay the same, per Menlo’s findings, growing from 20% in July to 21% at the end of the year.\nOpenAI on the other hand has seen its usage market share drop from 50% in 2023 to 27% at the end of 2025 — a trend that appears to concern the company. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed concern specifically that Google Gemini’s growth was starting to encroach on OpenAI in an internal memo a few months ago.\nEnterprise growth is an area of focus for the company in 2026, OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar wrote in a blog post this past Sunday.\nThe company has since announced an expanded multi-year partnership with ServiceNow that will give ServiceNow customers access to OpenAI models.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nDefense tech company Anduril on Thursday announced its plans to expand its Southern California presence with a major campus in Long Beach, the coastal town where founder Palmer Luckey grew up.\nThe expanded campus will eventually support about 5,500 jobs. Luckey told TechCrunch that these will be new jobs, not transfers from other operations.\nAnduril’s headquarters is nearby, in Costa Mesa, California, and it also has a massive manufacturing facility in Ohio. The Long Beach campus will span 1.18 million square feet across six buildings, combining office space and industrial areas dedicated to R&D. It is expected to be ready by mid-2027, the company said.\nLong Beach is “a major aerospace hub right in our backyard,” Luckey told TechCrunch about why the company chose that location.\nThe plan is to hire similar types of employees to those working at headquarters: manufacturing workers, technicians, assembly workers, and engineers across disciplines (electrical, mechanical, aerodynamics), as well as build and test roles, and “a lot of people on the logistics side, because the things that we’re going to be making there, we’re going to be sending all over the world,” he said.\nWhile bringing thousands of jobs to his childhood town made headlines today, Luckey said the most exciting part for him was the fighter jets. \n“It looks like we’re going to be able to manufacture autonomous fighter jets that will take off right from the factory and fly to wherever the customer needs them,” he said. “We might have jets leaving the factory, flying directly into combat. And I think that that is extremely cool.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnduril makes autonomous military drones and aircraft for land, air, and sea. In 2025, it unveiled a fighter jet called Fury, designed to fly autonomously, meaning it operates using AI rather than being piloted remotely by a human operator. The AI executes flight plans set by humans. The Fury completed its first test flight in California on October 31. \n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Carol Yepes / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:27 AM PST · January 22, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nPrepping for the SAT is nobody’s idea of fun, but Google aims to make it less stressful with AI. The company announced that it’s now focusing its AI education efforts on standardized testing with free SAT practice exams powered by Gemini. \nStudents can prompt Gemini by typing “I want to take a practice SAT test,” and the AI will provide them with a free practice exam. Gemini then analyzes the results, highlighting strengths and identifying areas that need further review. It also offers detailed explanations for any incorrect answers. \nImage Credits:Google\nThe company said it partnered with education companies like the Princeton Review to ensure the content is vetted and that students are working with questions that closely mirror what they will encounter on the actual SAT.\nThis recent move by Google is viewed as a game-changer for students who can’t readily access personalized SAT tutoring. By making SAT prep free, Google is trying to open the door for more students to compete on equal footing. However, it also sparks a broader conversation about the role of AI in education and just how much we want AI to shape how students learn.\nThe adoption of AI in education is not without controversy. Many teachers worry that students might end up leaning too heavily on tools like Gemini and ChatGPT to get their work done. If students let AI do all the thinking, it could chip away at their problem-solving skills. There are even studies out there that back this up, suggesting that relying too much on AI can actually weaken students’ ability to think critically and tackle challenges on their own.\nLet’s also not forget about human SAT tutors. Free AI-powered exam prep poses a significant threat to the traditional tutoring industry, which has long thrived on providing personalized coaching to college-bound students. With Google offering a free alternative, the job security of private SAT tutors may be at risk.\nThis news follows Google’s recent launch of a Gemini-powered feature that lets teachers create podcast-style audio lessons, which could help catch the attention of Gen Z students. Other available Gemini tools include features that help teachers brainstorm ideas, build lesson plans, and tailor learning materials for their classes.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

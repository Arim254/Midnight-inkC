    "body": "\nStripe is considering a deal to buy some or all of PayPal Holdings, sources told Bloomberg, though talks are still in their very early stages and the deal may not happen.\nThe news comes the same day Stripe released its annual letter, giving updates on the business. The big news was that Stripe is making a tender offer that values the company at $159 billion, a 74% increase from last year. The investors buying employee shares this time around include Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive Capital. Stripe will also buy back some stock, the letter said.The latest valuation again makes Stripe one of the industry’s most valuable private companies. Based in Dublin, Stripe’s co-founder and CEO, Patrick Collison, told CNBC recently that going public was not on his list of priorities. PayPal Holdings (which includes the flagship product PayPal and its services, as well as other companies like Venmo) is currently a publicly traded company, with a market cap of around $40 billion.\nPayPal’s stock rose slightly after reports of Stripe’s interest in an acquisition. Stripe declined to comment.\n",

Etched didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMatX’s latest round comes more than a year after its Series A of about $100 million, which was led by Spark Capital. TechCrunch earlier reported that the 2024 round valued the startup at more than $300 million.\nBefore co-founding MatX in 2023, Pope led AI software development for Google’s TPUs, the tech giant’s proprietary AI chips. His co-founder, Mike Gunter, was a lead designer of the TPU hardware before leaving to launch the startup.\nThe new funding will help MatX produce its chips with TSMC, with plans to start shipping them in 2027.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Hardware\n\n",

But in the eyes of CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber is really just a giant code base with engineers that are “literally the builders of the company.” In fact, Uber’s engineers have gone so far as to replace Khosrowshahi with a chatbot that they’ll ask questions in preparation of meetings with the top brass.\nThat’s according to an interview Khosrowshahi gave this week on Steven Bartlett’s podcast, The Diary of a CEO.\n“One of my team members told me that some teams have built a Dara AI, you know, so that they basically make the presentation to the Dara AI as a prep for making a presentation to me,” Khosrowshahi said on the podcast. “Because you can imagine, like, you know, by the time something comes to me, there’s been a prep and a meeting of the slide deck has been beautifully honed. So they have Dara AI to tune their prep.”\nBusiness Insider earlier reported this detail.\nAbout 90% of Uber’s software engineers are using AI in their work, Khosrowshahi said, while about 30% are “power users” of AI tools, completely rethinking the architecture of the company.\n“They are manufacturing the bricks that go into the system, and they’re architects who are kind of thinking about what the system should look like,” he said.\nKhosrowshahi added: “It really is changing their productivity in a way that I’ve never, ever seen before.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Transportation\n\n",

The European Union has led the charge on this front with laws like the GDPR, the Digital Services Act and the AI Act, seeking to curb tech companies’ control and exploitation of user data and hold them accountable. \nThe Trump administration has historically opposed such regulatory approaches, and this order reinforces that position as the government seeks to boost U.S. AI companies. \nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n\n",

While prosecutors didn’t name the company at the time, the U.S. Treasury Department confirmed on Tuesday that the broker is Operation Zero and announced sanctions against the company. \nOperation Zero offers millions of dollars for details of security vulnerabilities in Android and iPhone devices, as well as messaging apps like Telegram. Operation Zero claims to resell the tools it acquires exclusively to the Russian government and local companies. \nThe U.S. Department of Justice alleged that the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed the end customer to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.” Williams, who previously worked for an Australian spy agency and the country’s military, admitted that he made $1.3 million in crypto from the sales between 2022 and 2025. \nL3Harris and Williams’ lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Security\n\n",

    "body": "\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of the viral AI agent OpenClaw, who has since been hired by OpenAI, has some advice for those experimenting with AI technology, including AI agents. From his own experience, the best way to build today is to explore, be playful, and not expect to be an expert at what you do right away.\n“I wish I could say that I had the unified plan in the beginning, but a lot of it was just exploration,” Steinberger said. “I wanted things, and those things didn’t exist, and…let’s say, I prompted them into existence.” \nThe developer was chatting with OpenAI’s Head of Developer Experience, Romain Huet, on the first episode of the company’s new Builders Unscripted podcast. Here, he spoke about what OpenClaw was like in its early days and how he didn’t have a plan when he got started.\nSteinberger explained he began by building a tool that would integrate with WhatsApp, but then set it aside for a bit and focused on other things, as he assumed the AI labs would build something like what he was working on in the near future.  \n“I just experimented a lot. My mission was, kind of like, to have fun and inspire people,” Steinberger noted. By last November, however, the developer was surprised that no AI labs had started to build what he wanted to use. That led him to create the initial prototype of what’s now OpenClaw. \n“Where it really clicked was where I was at this weekend trip in Marrakesh, and I found myself using it way more because it was so convenient…there was no really good internet. [But] WhatsApp just works everywhere,” he said. The tool made it easy for him to find restaurants, look up things on his computer, send texts to friends, and more. \n\n\n\nThe more he played with the technology, Steinberger realized how good modern AI models have become at problem-solving, much like coders are. \n“Now they can just, like, actually come up with the solutions themselves, even though you never programmed them at all,” he noted. \nThroughout the process of building, Steinberger said that his workflow improved — and he stresses to other developers that’s something that can take time, so don’t give up.\n“There’s these people that…write software in the old way, and the old way is going to go away,” he pointed out. They then decide to try vibe coding, but are disappointed with the results.\n“I think vibe-coding is a slur,” said Steinberger, basically suggesting that it’s not as simple a process at first as the term makes it sound. “They try AI, but they don’t understand that it’s a skill,” he said, then comparing the process of coding with AI to learning guitar.\n“You’re not going to be good at guitar on the first day,” he said. Instead, he recommends that people approach learning with a more playful attitude. If he writes a prompt now, he has a gut feeling as to how long it will take, and if it takes longer, he reflects on what may have gone wrong and adapts.\n“My… advice always is, approach it in a playful way. Build something that you always wanted to build. If you’re at least a little bit of a builder, there has to be something on the back of your mind that you want to build. Like, just play.” \nThis ability to experiment and have fun is what’s most important, especially at a time when people are worried their jobs will be overtaken by AI. \n“If your identity is: I want to create things. I want to solve problems. If you’re a high agency, if you’re smart, you will be in more demand than ever,” Steinberger said.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nElectric trucking startup Harbinger has acquired autonomous driving software company Phantom AI, in an effort to vertically integrate more technology and create new revenue streams for the young company.\nThe acquisition, which is Harbinger’s first, is part of the startup’s plan to steadily expand its portfolio beyond the electric truck chassis it’s been building and selling for the last year. Just last month, Harbinger announced it would start selling its battery packs for energy storage and auxiliary power, with Airstream as the first customer.\nHarbinger announced Wednesday it has already lined up a customer for Phantom’s advanced driver assistance tech that it just acquired. German automotive technology giant ZF Group has agreed to license that tech from Harbinger, and plans to sell it to automakers for use in their passenger cars. (Terms of the two deals were not disclosed.)\nHarbinger co-founder and CEO John Harris told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview that he expects this new software services business line to generate “millions” of dollars in revenue this year, which he said is mostly “not material” compared to the amount the company will make from selling its truck chassis. The startup recently raised $160 million in a funding round co-led by FedEx and THOR Industries, both of which are customers.\nHarris instead expects the ZF Group deal will bring in more significant revenue in 2027 or 2028. \n“The passenger car market is slower, but the volumes are very, very large,” he said.\nHarbinger was already using Phantom AI’s driver assistance tech, Harris said, and the acquisition will see the companies deepen that integration. Harris expects that to be a big win for Harbinger’s own customers. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Medium-duty [trucking] has a complete lack of safety features,” he said. “The majority of medium-duty vehicles on the road that have no backup cameras, no air conditioning, no lane keeping, no automatic emergency braking. It’s just not a thing that exists in the market yet, which is crazy.”\nHarbinger already promises a lower total cost of ownership for commercial customers, better emissions compliance, and an easier truck to drive thanks to the simpler, quieter electric powertrain. But Harris thinks the safety features enabled by Phantom’s tech will make Harbinger’s chassis that much better — especially because of how and where they tend to be used.\n“These vehicles, many of them are spending their time navigating around truck ports and pulling in and out of neighborhoods to deliver packages.

    "body": "\nPodcasts have officially overtaken AM/FM talk radio as the more popular medium for spoken-word audio in the United States, according to Edison Research’s Share of Ear survey.\nThe researchers have tracked these statistics over the last decade, and almost always, the percentage of time people spent listening to podcasts increased, while their time with spoken radio broadcasts decreased. For the first time this year, podcasts eclipsed spoken-word radio with 40% of listening time, as opposed to 39% for radio.\nIf anything, it’s surprising that it has taken this long for podcasts to overtake radio shows. (Remember, this doesn’t include listening to music on the radio.) But perhaps that speaks more to the durability of good, old-fashioned radio than the merits of podcasting.\nImage Credits:Edison Research\nWe checked with Edison to see if these statistics include video podcasts, and they do. But the need to clarify that question points to the undeniable growing prevalence of video podcasts, hosted on platforms like Spotify and YouTube, which marks another key trend in podcasting.\nPerhaps an industry bellwether, Netflix is inking deals with iHeartMedia and Barstool Sports to bring podcasts to the streaming service as a more trendy version of the daytime talk show. It’s not a bad investment — according to YouTube, people watch them on TV. YouTube said that viewers watched 700 million hours of podcasts each month in 2025 on living room devices, like TVs, up from 400 million the previous year.\nBut the popularity of video podcasts doesn’t seem to be detracting from audio-first podcast listening. \nTriton Digital’s U.S. Podcast Report for 2025 showed that 80% of consumers over 18 years of age tune into both audio and video podcasts; 13% only listen to audio, while 7% only watch video. Listener preferences also appear to vary greatly depending on a podcast’s genre, with podcasts about topics like music, sports, comedy, and news skewing more popular on video. Genres like science, history, art, fiction, and true crime are more often consumed via audio.\nEdison’s findings show a similar trend in the role of video in podcasting. Eighty-five percent of weekly U.S. podcast listeners above the age of 13 consume podcasts with any sort of video component, up 7% from 2023. The research also showed that there are an estimated 115 million weekly podcast listeners in the U.S., with only 5% of listeners reporting that they watch podcasts, but don’t listen to them.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nAmazon is introducing a new feature that will allow users to change the personality of its AI assistant, Alexa+. On Wednesday, the company launched three new Alexa+ personality styles — Brief, Chill, and Sweet — that will change the AI assistant’s tone.\nIn the Brief style, Alexa will respond with shorter, direct responses, while the Chill style will see Alexa answer more like a laid-back friend. Enabling the Sweet style, meanwhile, will have Alexa become warmer and more enthusiastic, offering encouragement and positivity, says Amazon.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe idea of infusing an AI with a personality has been a complicated issue for model makers. \nFor some chatbot users, a flattering and affirming AI model, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o, led some users to develop an unhealthy dependency on the technology. In a few cases, it even exacerbated the user’s existing mental health issues, leading to crises or even suicides, multiple lawsuits have alleged.\nStill, chatbot users have shown a preference for controlling how their AI responds, even writing custom instructions to dictate the AI’s personality. To address this need, OpenAI launched new ChatGPT features in December that allow users to adjust the AI’s base style and tone in terms of its warmth, enthusiasm, and use of emojis, among other things. Despite this, some users are complaining that the latest model is too reassuring by default.\nAmazon says its new styles for Alexa have been built on five dimensions that contribute to its personality: expressiveness, emotional openness, formality, directness, and humor. Each style represents specific levels of all five factors. For instance, Brief isn’t just concise, it’s also casual, direct, and uses minimal humor, the company says.\nTo change Alexa’s style, you can either speak to the AI assistant via a device, like an Echo speaker, or access the feature in the Alexa app’s Device Settings under “Personality Style.”\nThe company notes that these three styles are only the first to ship, and others will be on the way in the future. At present, the styles are only available in the U.S. market. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nEnterprise software giant Atlassian is rolling out a new way for humans and AI agents to work together that it hopes will help teams produce “10x the work without 10x the chaos.”\nAtlassian announced “agents in Jira” on Wednesday. This update gives users of the company’s project management software Jira the ability to assign and manage work for their digital agents from the same dashboard they use for their human employees.\nAgents in Jira allows enterprises to assign tasks and tickets to AI agents, just as they would to people. It also tracks how the work is coming along, and sets deadlines, among other metrics. Users can now also loop in AI agents during the middle of an existing project too.\nThis feature is now available in open beta.\nThis update is meant to give users the same visibility into the work their agents are doing as their human employees, Tamar Yehoshua, Atlassian’s new chief product and AI officer, told TechCrunch.\n“Atlassian has been in the business, for decades, of collaboration software helping people get work done,” Yehoshua said. “Now, you enter agents, and agents are now doing a lot of that work, and so you want to be able to coordinate between humans and agents.”\nBut Atlassian understands that just giving people more avenues to automate doesn’t necessarily mean less work, Yehoshua said. That’s why the key part of this update is that everything happens within the same dashboard, she said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“You’ve been hearing in the zeitgeist lately that all of these agents are creating more work for people, and in some ways, more chaos,” Yehoshua said. “What we’re really good at is putting order to that chaos.”\nAs enterprises continue to figure out how and where they can find a return on investment from investing in AI tools, this kind of view could prove beneficial. The ability to compare the work of agents versus humans on the same project could help enterprises figure out where to deploy agents to begin with and what tasks should remain human-led.\nThis announcement is just the first of many, Yehoshua said, as the company looks to increasingly add AI tools into its existing software products.\n“The goal is to enable people to work more productively with AI and I think this is a step,” Yehoshua said. “It’s only the beginning of the journey. It’s a long journey, but this is a really important step of how to integrate AI into the workflows that you already have, which I’m really excited about.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nApple is launching new tools to comply with the growing number of age-verification laws both in the U.S. and abroad. As part of the changes, Apple will block the downloads of apps rated 18+ in Brazil, Australia, and Singapore, while also rolling out other features to comply with laws in Utah and Louisiana in the U.S.\nThe company informed developers on Tuesday that it’s expanding its set of “age assurance” tools, including an updated Declared Age Range API now available for beta testing.\nThese tools allow developers to obtain a user’s age range without gaining access to the user’s personal information, like their date of birth. The need for a technical solution like this came about as more governments around the world have created laws to block or restrict certain apps like social media that can only be used by adults 18 and up.\nIn Brazil, for example, developers can use the Declared Age Range API to obtain the user’s age category, if the user or their parent or guardian chooses to share it. \nIn addition, Apple will block users in Australia, Brazil, and Singapore from downloading apps rated 18+, starting today, until they confirm they are adults. In this case, the App Store will perform the age confirmation automatically, but Apple notes that developers may still have separate compliance requirements they need to meet.\nAlso, developers whose games contain loot boxes — a gambling-like mechanism that lets players spend money for a random chance at in-game rewards and that lawmakers believe shouldn’t be available to kids — will see their apps’ age ratings updated to reflect an 18+ audience in Brazil, specifically.\nIn the U.S., new users in Utah and Louisiana will soon have their age categories shared with their developers’ apps through the Declared Age Range API as well. The company said it has expanded its other tools around age ratings and permissions to meet its compliance obligations.\n“New signals are now available through the Declared Age Range API, including whether age-related regulatory requirements apply to the user and if the user is required to share their age range,” reads the Apple blog post. “The API will also let you know if you need to get a parent or guardian’s permission for significant app updates for a child.”\nApple last October worked to comply with similar age-assurance requirements in Texas but put some of its plans on hold back in December, as the state’s law is being fought in court. It also updated its age ratings system last year with more granular age ranges than before and added a variety of new questions for developers submitting apps to Apple for review.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nDakotah Rice is stepping back into the founder’s seat. On Wednesday, he announced that his new company, the AI-native insurance brokerage Harper, has raised $46.8M million in a combined Series A and seed round.\nPreviously, he founded the investment company Poolit, which closed in 2023. He spoke openly to TechCrunch about the collapse of that company, saying he never figured out how to make it profitable.\n“My ego made it hard to accept the failure,” he told TechCrunch. “In hindsight, I should have shut it down a year earlier.” \nFor his next company, he went back to his roots. His family owned an insurance brokerage, and he remembered all the hassles that came when founders like himself walked through the doors, trying to insure their businesses. “I hated insurance,” he continued, “swore I’d never end up in it.”\nBut then he had an idea. At first, he and Tushar Nair, a longtime friend and former CTO of Poolit, thought about building AI tools for existing brokerages. Then, they decided to just use that technology to build an AI-native insurance brokerage and call it Harper, after Rice’s mother’s maiden name. \nLaunched in 2024, Harper is part of a trend YC recently wrote about (Harper took part in the YC W’25 batch). The YC blog wrote that the future of agencies “will look more like software companies, with software margins.” That’s exactly what Harper is — an almost fully autonomous licensed commercial insurance agency. It matches small- to mid-sized businesses with more than 160 insurance carriers to assist with workers’ compensation, as well as general and professional liability. \n“What often takes a traditional broker five to seven days, we can often do in one to two,” Rice, the company’s CEO, said. He said a typical sales team at a human-led brokerage handles 20 to 30 deals a month, but AI enables Harper to handle more than 1,000 customers a month. Harper has more than 5,000 customers to date, he continued. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“AI handles the operational weight. Submission routing, underwriter follow-ups, document collection, pipeline management,” Rice continued. \nInvestors in the company include YC and Peak XV Partners, and its Series A round was led by Emergence Capital. \nRice thinks of nearly all brokerages as Harper’s competition. He said that work remains very fragmented, with big players and everyone else running on “email and spreadsheets.” There are, of course, other AI-native brokerages in this space, like Gyde, as well as companies that use AI tools, like FurtherAI or Vantel (both of which are also YC alums). \nRice said what makes Harper different is that it hopes to target middle America. “The real-world businesses,” he said, “like daycares, manufacturers, car dealerships, local bars and restaurants.” \nThe fresh funding will be used to build out Harper’s engineering team and help grow the brand. The second time in the game, he has big dreams for this company. \n“We want to become the voice for entrepreneurs, starting with their insurance, but over time becoming a focal point for all types of things related to risk, compliance, and their entire back office,” he said. “We want to make it simple for them to do their core work, and we basically do everything else over time.” \nThis piece was updated to clarify the total funding amount. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAI chatbots have become embedded in the lives of American teenagers, according to a report published Tuesday by the Pew Research Center. \nWhile the most common uses of AI among this demographic are to search for information (57%) and get help with schoolwork (54%), teens are also using AI to fill roles that would typically be occupied by friends or family. Sixteen percent of U.S. teens say they use AI for casual conversation, while 12% use AI chatbots for emotional support or advice. \nSome teens may find solace in talking to chatbots, but mental health professionals are wary. General purpose tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok are not designed for such uses, and in the most extreme cases, these chatbots can have life-threatening psychological effects.\n“We are social creatures, and there’s certainly a challenge that these systems can be isolating,” Dr. Nick Haber, a Stanford professor researching the therapeutic potential of LLMs, told TechCrunch recently. “There are a lot of instances where people can engage with these tools and then can become not grounded to the outside world of facts, and not grounded in connection to the interpersonal, which can lead to pretty isolating — if not worse — effects.”\nImage Credits:Pew Research Center\nPew’s survey also shows a discrepancy between teenagers’ self-reported AI usage and the extent to which their parents think they engage with this technology. About 51% of parents said that their teen uses chatbots, while 64% of teens reported using them.\nThe majority of parents are okay with their teens using AI to search for information (79%) or get help with schoolwork (58%), but far fewer parents approve of their teens using AI chatbots for casual conversation (28%) or to get emotional support or advice (18%). In fact, 58% of parents are not okay with their child using AI for such purposes.\nAI safety is a contentious topic among leading tech companies, to say the least. But one popular chatbot maker, Character.AI, made the choice to disable the chatbot experience for users under the age of 18. This decision followed public outcry and lawsuits filed over two teenagers’ suicides, which took place after prolonged conversations with the company’s chatbots. OpenAI, meanwhile, made the decision to sunset its particularly sycophantic GPT-4o model, which sparked backlash from people who had come to rely on the model for emotional support.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThough a majority of teens use AI chatbots in some way, they have mixed feelings about the impact of this kind of technology on society. When asked how they think AI will impact society over the next 20 years, 31% of teens said the impact would be positive, while 26% said it would be negative. \n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nLarge language models have a problem: they are large. Multiverse Computing, a Spanish startup, is addressing this issue with compressed models that aim to close the gap between what frontier models can do and what companies can actually afford to deploy. \nThe secret sauce is CompactifAI, a compression technology inspired by quantum computing that the Basque company has applied to models released by OpenAI. As of today, developers can access a newer version of Multiverse’s HyperNova 60B model for free on Hugging Face. The company also plans to open source more compressed models in 2026 to support a wider range of use cases.\nAccording to Multiverse, its models are smaller, but nearly as potent and accurate. At 32GB, HyperNova 60B is roughly half the size of the model it derives from — OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b — while boasting lower memory usage and lower latency. The updated version, called HyperNova 60B 2602, now also better supports ​​tool calling and agentic coding, where inference costs can be high.\nOne of the competitors Multiverse claims to have beaten with HyperNova 60B is Mistral Large 3, one of the models released by French decacorn Mistral AI. But beyond the technological rivalry, the two European AI companies also have a lot in common.\nLike Mistral, Multiverse has expanded beyond its home country, with offices in the United States, Canada, and across Europe. Both companies also have enterprise customers. In Multiverse’s case, it names Iberdrola, Bosch, and the Bank of Canada. \nAnd while Multiverse is not officially a unicorn yet, it is now rumored to be raising a fresh €500 million funding round at a valuation of more than €1.5 billion. In a statement shared with TechCrunch, the company confirmed that active discussions with potential investors toward a new funding round are ongoing, but added it would be premature to comment on valuation or funding size at this stage. Multiverse also declined to comment on reports that its annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached €100 million in January.\nIf confirmed, this would still only be a fraction of OpenAI’s $20 billion ARR; but not that far from Mistral’s, whose ARR soared to over $400 million, owing in part to growing demand for alternatives to U.S. tech. Similarly, Multiverse positions itself in its latest press release as a company that can “deliver sovereign solutions across the AI stack.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese geopolitical undertones recently helped Multiverse secure a collaboration with the regional government of Aragón, in northeastern Spain. The Spanish Agency for Technological Transformation (SETT) also participated in the AI startup’s $215 million Series B last year. Since its inception, Multiverse has also benefited from support from the Basque region — which could very soon count its first unicorn.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

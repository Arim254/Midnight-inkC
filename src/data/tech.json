To that end, OpenAI has said it has started testing ads in ChatGPT for free users, a gamble that could lead to more revenue or could send users running from the platform. \nApparently investors think it’s worth the risk if they’re valuing the company $20 billion higher than the $830 billion valuation initially expected. The company’s pre-money value will remain at $730 billion, per Bloomberg’s source. \nThe first tranches of funding are reportedly coming from the usual suspects: Amazon (already in talks to invest up to $50 billion), SoftBank (gearing up for $30 billion), Nvidia (close to investing $20 billion), and Microsoft. VC firms and sovereign wealth funds are expected to close later, potentially bringing the total amount raised higher.\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

If completed, it would be the largest power plant in the U.S., capable of powering around 7.5 million homes.\nWith a price tag of $33 billion, the project would be more expensive than recent natural gas-fired power plants, which have skyrocketed in cost, Bloomberg notes. It’s unclear who will ultimately foot the bill, though traditionally rate-payers have shouldered the burden for new generating capacity.\nThe Japanese investor is a partner in the Stargate project with OpenAI. SB Energy did not say whether the new power plant would feed directly into the grid or if it would power data centers. OpenAI and SoftBank are in the process of building a “proof of concept” data center at GM’s former Lordstown automotive assembly plant.\nA power plant of this size is likely to take years, perhaps a decade, to complete even before taking into account the shortage of natural gas turbines. If completed, the project could emit around 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. When including methane leaks from the natural gas supply chain, the climate impact could even be even bigger. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Climate\n\n",

That rivalry has only intensified in recent months: after OpenAI said it would bring advertisements to ChatGPT, Anthropic took a swipe at OpenAI in a couple ads during the Super Bowl, declaring that it would never introduce ads into Claude.\nAltman soon after hit back in response, calling Anthropic “dishonest” and “authoritarian.”\n“We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid, and we know our users would reject that,” he wrote at the time.\nBoth Altman and Amodei were in India this week for the AI summit held in New Delhi, which saw a bevy of AI-related investments, features and products being announced. OpenAI said it is opening two new offices in India, partnering with IT giant TCS, and is deploying tools for higher education. Anthropic has also opened an office in India and teamed up with Infosys for internal and external deployment of its AI tools.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

    "body": "\nEtsy is selling Depop, a secondhand clothing app popular with Gen Z and millennials, to eBay for $1.2 billion in cash, the company announced on Wednesday. Etsy says the deal will allow it to focus on its own marketplace.\nThe deal comes nearly five years after Etsy acquired Depop for $1.62 billion, at a time when secondhand clothing apps were gaining in popularity.\nFounded in 2011, Depop generated approximately $1 billion in gross merchandise sales — the total value of goods sold through its platform — in 2025. In the U.S., the company saw nearly 60% year-over-year growth. As of December 31, 2025, the marketplace had seven million active buyers, nearly 90% of whom were under 34, and more than three million active sellers.\n“Depop has built a trusted, social-forward marketplace with strong momentum in the pre-loved fashion category, and we are confident that as part of eBay, Depop will be even more well-positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from our scale, complementary offerings, and operational capabilities,” said eBay CEO Jamie Iannone in the press release.\nThe move comes as Etsy has struggled to grow its business after the pandemic-era e-commerce boom, competing with marketplaces like Temu and Shein, as well as Amazon.\nThe company’s year-over-year revenue grew 2.2% in 2024, down from 7.1% growth reported in 2023. Etsy is scheduled to release its 2025 earnings on Thursday.\n“We are excited that this transaction allows us to focus exclusively on the compelling opportunity we see in front of us: to grow the Etsy marketplace in ways that matter most to our buyers and sellers,” said Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal in the press release. “We are proud of what the Depop team has built – a truly differentiated brand and product, grounded in clear purpose and strong community – becoming one of the fastest-growing fashion resale marketplaces in the U.S. I am confident that Depop is well-positioned for its next phase of growth as part of eBay.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe sale is the latest in a pattern of Etsy acquiring and then divesting niche online marketplaces. Etsy’s sale of Depop comes as the company has purchased and then sold other niche online marketplaces in recent years, including Brazilian e-commerce company Elo7 and musical instrument marketplace Reverb.\nThe deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "\nA student admissions website used by families to enroll children into schools has fixed a security lapse that was exposing their personal information",
    "body": "\nA student admissions website used by families to enroll children into schools has fixed a security lapse that was exposing their personal information.\nThe website, Ravenna Hub, which lets parents apply and track the status of their kids’ applications across thousands of schools, was allowing any logged-in user to access the personally identifiable data associated with any other user, including their children.\nThe exposed data includes children’s names, dates of birth, addresses, pictures, and details about their school. Email addresses and phone numbers of parents, as well as information about children’s siblings, were also exposed.\nFlorida-based VentureEd Solutions, which develops and maintains Ravenna Hub, says on its website that it serves over a million students, and processes hundreds of thousands of applications a year.\nTechCrunch first learned of the vulnerability on Wednesday and soon after alerted the company. VentureEd fixed the bug the same day, but TechCrunch held this report until we could verify that the bug was fixed.\nNick Laird, the chief executive of VentureEd Solutions, told TechCrunch in an email that the company was able to replicate the issue and has addressed the vulnerability.\nLaird said the company was investigating the incident, but he would not commit to notifying users about the security lapse, or say — when asked by TechCrunch — if the company has the ability to check if there was any improper access to other users’ data. We also asked if Ravenna Hub had its security checked by a third-party, and if so, by whom. Laird would not say, and declined to comment further.\nIt’s not clear who, if anyone, oversees cybersecurity at VentureEd and Ravenna Hub.\nThe vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a common security flaw that allows users to access stored information because of weak or non-existent security controls on the concerned servers. \nIn practice, the bug allowed any logged-in user to access another student’s data, including their personal information, by modifying the unique number associated with a student’s profile using their web browser’s address bar. \nIn the case of Ravenna Hub, student numbers are sequential, meaning it was possible for any user to access another student’s data by changing the profile number by one or more digits.\nWhen TechCrunch created a new account with test data, we found that the web address contained a seven-digit number. As such, there were slightly more than 1.63 million records prior to ours that were accessible to any other user.\nThis is the latest security lapse involving simple security flaws affecting the personal information of children. In January, online mentoring site UStrive exposed the personal information of its users, many of whom are still in school. \n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nRivian has a new pitch for its outdoorsy, tech-loving customers: Ditch the phone and use your Apple Watch to access vehicle controls.\nThe company said on Thursday it plans to launch a companion app that pairs with the Apple Watch as part of a broader update to the Rivian mobile app next week. Rivian owners will be able to perform basic tasks such as locking and unlocking doors, venting windows, and triggering the vehicle alarm using their Apple Watch.\nRivian said it is adding more precise and customizable functions, too. For instance, users can adjust the digital crown on the watch to set a target state of charge or adjust the temperature inside the vehicle. The app also allows users to pick four quick controls, depending on which they use the most.\nThere are some limitations, however, for Rivian’s first-generation R1T trucks and R1S SUVs. Owners of these cars will only be able to lock or unlock their vehicle by opening the app and tapping the lock icon on the Watch. Second-generation R1 vehicles, meanwhile, will unlock automatically as the driver approaches the car, provided a digital key has been set up.\nThe Apple Watch integration follows a broader update to the vehicle software system that was rolled out on Thursday.\nMost of the updates focus on improving performance and accessibility, including a “kneel mode” that lowers the vehicle another inch below its previous low setting. The update will also allow drivers to toggle between different drive modes without causing the advanced driver assistance system to disengage. \nThere’s also a new cold weather indicator that will add a blue tint to the battery graphic displayed on the vehicle’s digital screen so drivers can see how much energy the battery pack is used for warming.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRivian makes and sells EVs, but software has become one of its central products, and a selling point, for consumers as well as companies like Volkswagen that have tapped the carmaker for its technology. In 2024, Rivian and VW set up a $5.8 billion technology joint venture under which Volkswagen will invest in Rivian, based on reaching certain milestones, through 2027. Software developed by the joint venture will be used in future VW Group vehicles.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nDef Con, one of the largest and longest-running hacking conferences in the world, announced on Wednesday that three people linked to Jeffrey Epstein are no longer allowed to attend.  \nThe conference justified adding Pablos Holman, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Joichi Ito to its public list of banned individuals, citing the three as appearing in the Department of Justice’s latest release of files related to its investigation of the late investor and convicted sex offender. Def Con also cited an article in Politico based on emails that the three exchanged with Epstein.\nJoan Vollero, a spokesperson for Iozzo, told TechCrunch in a statement that Def Con’s actions are “entirely performative, given that Mr. Iozzo has barely attended the conference in the past twenty years.”\n“It was a rush to judgment not based on any investigation or wrongdoing by Mr. Iozzo,” the spokesperson said.\nA Def Con spokesperson declined to comment. \nHolman and Ito did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. \nThe move to ban the three comes days after TechCrunch reported that cybersecurity conferences Black Hat and Code Blue removed Iozzo from their official review board pages, amid new and emerging revelations linking the prominent hacker, among others, to Epstein.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about Epstein’s connections in the cybersecurity world?? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or by email. \t\t\nIozzo is a veteran of the cybersecurity industry who is currently the founder and chief executive of identity startup SlashID. He previously served as a director at CrowdStrike after the security giant acquired his cybersecurity startup IperLane in 2017. As TechCrunch previously reported, Iozzo interacted with Epstein between 2014 and 2018, including after the Miami Herald reported new allegations that Epstein had abused dozens of women and children.\nEpstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting sex from girls and registered as a sex offender in New York and Florida. In 2019, the Department of Justice accused Epstein of trafficking, exploiting, and abusing dozens of underage girls. Epstein died in jail.\nIozzo previously told TechCrunch that his interactions with Epstein were “limited to business opportunities that never materialized, as well as discussion of the markets and emerging technologies,” and that he “never observed nor participated in any illegal activity or behavior.”\nPrior to his startups, Iozzo was a research affiliate at MIT Media Lab, which was overseen by Ito at the time. The two appear in several Epstein emails together. \nJoichi Ito was the director of the MIT Media Lab until 2019, when he resigned after it was reported that he was aware that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that he and the university had extensive personal and financial relationships with Epstein. \nHolman, meanwhile, is the general partner at venture capital firm Deep Future and describes himself on his website as “a hacker, inventor & technology futurist.” \nHolman was in contact with Epstein since 2010, planned to stay at one of his apartments in New York City in 2013, and tried to help Epstein hide negative online news stories about himself. \nAccording to an email, Epstein made plans to attend Def Con along with Holman in 2013, but it’s unclear if they attended. Def Con founder Jeff Moss said that as far as he knows, “Epstein never attended.”\nThis story was updated to include Def Con’s no comment.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nAs India pitches itself as a global hub for applied artificial intelligence, OpenAI has partnered with Pine Labs to integrate AI-driven reasoning into the fintech firm’s payments stack, automating settlement and invoicing workflows in a move the companies say could help accelerate AI-led commerce in India.\nThe partnership will see Pine Labs embed OpenAI’s application programming interfaces — software tools that let companies plug AI into their existing systems — within its payments and commerce infrastructure, the companies said on Thursday, all with the aim of enabling AI-assisted settlement, reconciliation, and invoicing workflows.\nThe deal underscores OpenAI’s broader push to expand its footprint in India, one of its fastest-growing markets, as it looks to move beyond being known primarily as the maker of ChatGPT and embed its technology into education, enterprise, and infrastructure. Earlier this week, OpenAI partnered with leading Indian engineering, medical, and design institutions to bring AI tools into higher education, betting that India’s large developer base and more than a billion internet users will play a central role in the next phase of AI adoption.\nPine Labs is already using AI internally to automate parts of its settlement and reconciliation process, cutting the time it takes to clear daily settlements from hours to minutes, according to Chief executive B Amrish Rau. The Noida-based company previously relied on manual checks by dozens of employees to process funds from multiple banks before markets opened each day, a workflow that is now largely handled by AI-driven systems, he said in an interview.\nFor Pine Labs, the partnership is intended to extend those AI-driven efficiencies beyond internal operations to merchants and corporate clients, starting with business-to-business use cases such as invoice processing, settlements and payments orchestration, Rau told TechCrunch. He noted the company sees faster adoption in B2B workflows, where AI agents can handle large volumes of repetitive financial tasks under predefined rules, before similar capabilities reach consumer-facing payments.\n“People talk about retail AI, but the bigger impact of all of this is really efficiency improvement, especially in B2B,” Rau said. “If you look at invoicing and settlement, those are workflows where agents can actually drive the process end to end, and that’s where adoption can happen faster.”\nThe rollout of more autonomous, agent-led payment workflows will move faster in overseas markets where regulations already allow such transactions, Rau said, while India is likely to see a more gradual adoption focused on AI-assisted commerce rather than fully agent-initiated payments. He said that Pine Labs is already prototyping agent-driven payments in parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, even as Indian regulations require tighter controls on how payments are authorized.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor OpenAI, the partnership offers a route deeper into India’s payments and enterprise ecosystem as it looks to move beyond consumer-facing tools and embed its models into high-volume, regulated workflows. Rau said the collaboration is aimed at increasing merchant stickiness and expanding Pine Labs’ role from a payments processor to a broader commerce platform, with higher transaction volumes over time translating into incremental revenue.\nPine Labs says it works with more than 980,000 merchants, 716 consumer brands, and 177 financial institutions, and has processed over 6 billion cumulative transactions valued at over ₹11.4 trillion (about $126 billion), per its prospectus published last year. The fintech operates across 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, parts of Africa, the UAE, and the U.S., giving the OpenAI partnership reach across both Indian and international markets.\nRau said the partnership does not involve revenue sharing between the two companies, with Pine Labs not taking a cut if its merchants choose to embed OpenAI’s tools. “We’ve kept it completely independent of each other — anything related to payment and payment services, we will get the benefit of it, and anything related to OpenAI revenues will go to them,” he said.\nThe arrangement, Rau added, is also non-exclusive. He compared it to OpenAI’s partnership with Stripe in the U.S. and said Pine Labs remains open to working with other AI providers.\nRau said Pine Labs is building additional security and compliance layers around AI-driven workflows to ensure that sensitive merchant and consumer transaction data remains protected, as the company integrates AI more deeply into its payments systems. He said the focus is on ensuring transactions remain secure and compliant even as more workflows are automated by AI.\nPine Labs’ interest in AI-driven commerce builds on earlier work through its Setu unit, which has experimented with agent-led bill payment experiences using chatbots including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Separately, India also began piloting consumer payments directly through AI chatbots last year.\nThe new announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are showcasing their latest capabilities alongside Indian startups demonstrating AI applications aimed at large-scale deployment across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.\n",

    "body": "\nOpenAI has partnered with India’s Tata Group to secure 100 megawatts of AI-ready data center capacity in the country, with plans to scale to 1 gigawatt. The move is part of a broader push to deepen the company’s enterprise and infrastructure footprint in one of its fastest-growing markets. \nOpenAI announced on Thursday that the partnership with the Tata Group is part of its Stargate project, which aims to build AI-ready infrastructure and expand enterprise adoption globally. OpenAI will become the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services’ HyperVault data center business, beginning with 100 megawatts of capacity. The deal also includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise across Tata’s workforce and standardizing AI-native software development through OpenAI’s tools.\nThe partnership, which falls under the “OpenAI for India” initiative, highlights the company’s expanding footprint in the country, which according to recent estimates from CEO Sam Altman has more than 100 million weekly ChatGPT users spanning students, teachers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The scale of adoption has positioned India as one of OpenAI’s most important growth markets as it deepens enterprise and infrastructure investments in the country.\nThe local data center capacity will allow OpenAI to run its most advanced models within India, reducing latency for users while meeting data residency, security, and compliance requirements for regulated sectors and government workloads. Hosting compute domestically is critical for enterprises that handle sensitive data and operate under data localization and digital infrastructure rules. These circumstances could widen OpenAI’s access to enterprise customers that require in-country processing.\nAn initial 100 megawatts of capacity represents a substantial commitment in the context of AI infrastructure, where large-scale model training and inference require power-hungry clusters of graphics processing units, or GPUs. Scaling to 1 gigawatt over time would place the Tata facility among the largest AI-focused data center deployments globally, underlining the scale of OpenAI’s long-term ambitions in India.\nBeyond infrastructure, OpenAI and Tata Group will pursue a strategic enterprise collaboration aimed at accelerating AI adoption across Tata’s businesses. The conglomerate plans to roll out ChatGPT Enterprise to its workforce over the coming years, beginning with hundreds of thousands of employees at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), in what would rank among the largest enterprise AI deployments globally. TCS also intends to use OpenAI’s Codex tools to standardize AI-native software development across its engineering teams.\nN Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, said OpenAI’s partnership would help build “state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India” while supporting efforts to skill the country’s workforce for the AI era.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed, including whether OpenAI is making a capital investment in HyperVault or leasing capacity.\nIn November 2025, TCS secured backing from private equity firm TPG to develop AI-ready infrastructure in India under its HyperVault data center business. The platform is backed by about ₹180 billion (about $2 billion) in planned investment and is designed to support large-scale compute workloads for hyperscalers and enterprise customers.\nOpenAI will also expand its certification programs in India, with TCS becoming the first participating organization outside the United States. The certifications are designed to help professionals build practical AI skills across roles and industries, the company said. The move follows OpenAI’s recent partnerships with leading Indian institutions in engineering, medicine, and design.\nOpenAI plans to open new offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru later this year, adding to its existing presence in New Delhi as it deepens operations in the country. The expansion is expected to support enterprise partnerships, developer engagement, and local regulatory coordination as the company scales its footprint in India.\nThe announcement comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where global AI leaders, including Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are participating alongside Indian startups and enterprises showcasing AI applications across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education.\nOpenAI has been expanding its presence in India through partnerships with companies including Pine Labs, JioHotstar, Eternal, Cars24, HCLTech, PhonePe, CRED, and MakeMyTrip, as it seeks to embed its models across consumer platforms, enterprise systems and digital payments infrastructure in one of the world’s largest internet markets.\nTogether, the data center build-out, enterprise deployments, and expanding partner ecosystem signal OpenAI’s most comprehensive push yet to anchor advanced AI infrastructure and applications in India.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMukesh Ambani, the billionaire chairperson of Indian conglomerate Reliance, on Thursday unveiled the group’s ₹10 trillion (about $110 billion) plan to build AI computing infrastructure in India over the next seven years.\nSpeaking at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Thursday, Ambani said the investment would fund gigawatt-scale data centers, a nationwide edge computing network, and new AI services integrated with Reliance’s Jio telecom platform.\nReliance has already begun construction of multi-gigawatt data centers in Jamnagar, Gujarat, Ambani said, and more than 120 megawatts of capacity is expected to come online in the second half of 2026.\nAmbani’s pledge adds to a growing wave of AI investment in India. Earlier this week, Adani Group outlined plans to invest about $100 billion to build AI data centers in the country, and the Indian government expects more than $200 billion in AI infrastructure spending over the next two years. \nGlobal technology firms are also stepping up their presence, with OpenAI partnering with the Tata Group to develop about 100 megawatts of AI capacity in the country, and plans to scale that to 1 gigawatt eventually.\nAmbani said the push is essential for India’s technological self-reliance, saying the country “cannot afford to rent intelligence,” and that Reliance aims to cut the cost of AI services as dramatically as it once reduced mobile data prices in the country.\n“The biggest constraint in AI today is not talent or imagination,” Ambani said. “It is scarcity and high cost of compute.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe build-out, Ambani said, would be supported by Reliance’s green energy capacity, which stretches to 10 gigawatts of surplus power from solar projects in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.\nReliance will partner with Indian enterprises, startups, and academic institutions to embed AI in industries ranging from manufacturing and logistics to agriculture, healthcare and financial services.\nJio has already been striking AI partnerships: it last year landed a deal with Google to offer free Gemini AI Pro access to millions of its users in India.\nReliance also plans to develop AI capabilities in several Indian languages to spur adoption of the tech, Ambani said.\nThe aggressive push highlights how India’s largest conglomerates are racing to secure a foothold in what is expected to be one of the country’s biggest technology opportunities.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in court on Wednesday in a landmark trial aiming to determine if the tech giant’s social media applications are addictive and harmful to teens and kids. The trial, taking place in L.A. Superior Court, already revealed that Meta’s own research indicated that parental supervision couldn’t prevent teens from compulsive use of social media, and teens who faced traumatic life experiences were even more inclined to overuse social media.\nLawyers for the plaintiff, a 20-year-old who goes by her initials KGM, questioned Zuckerberg this week about whether Instagram employees were given goals to increase daily app usage. The Meta CEO had said during an earlier Congressional hearing that this was not the case, the AP noted, but a 2015 email chain presented as evidence in the trial showed Zuckerberg pushing to increase users’ time spent in app by 12%.\nZuckerberg was also asked about Instagram’s use of beauty filters, which Meta’s own experts said should be banned when it comes to teens, as well as internal documents with Meta’s estimates of how many children under the age of 13 were on the platform. One Meta document from 2018 stated that, as of 2015, 4 million children under 13 had Instagram accounts, including roughly 30% of children aged 10-12 in the U.S., for instance.\nHere, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying age verification was difficult and smartphone makers like Apple could be more helpful on this front. (Apple recently rolled out its own age assurance tools for developers, as a result of the increasing push to regulate apps like Facebook and Instagram in the U.S., where many states have now created or are developing their own social media laws.)\nReports from the courtroom noted Zuckerberg largely stuck to the company’s talking points during his testimony, sometimes claiming the plaintiff’s lawyers were taking things out of context or mischaracterizing what documents said. \nPlaintiff KGM (who also goes by her first name Kaley) sued four social media companies over what she alleges is the harmful and addictive nature of their platforms. TikTok and Snap settled before the trial began, with YouTube and Meta defending their apps’ success. \nDuring the trial, lawyers for Meta have pointed to Kaley’s unhappy childhood as leading to her mental health concerns, not the social apps themselves. The results of this trial by jury could lead to big tech reforms, prompt new laws and regulations, and lead to a settlement with victims, if the tech companies are found to be at fault. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nA world that runs on increasingly powerful AI coding tools is one where software creation is cheap — or so the thinking goes — leaving little room for traditional software companies. As one analyst report put it, “vibe coding will allow startups to replicate the features of complex SaaS platforms.”\nCue the hand-wringing and declarations that software companies are doomed. \nOpen-source software projects that use agents to paper over long-standing resource constraints should logically be among the first to benefit from the era of cheap code. But that equation just doesn’t quite stick. In practice, the impact of AI coding tools on open source software has been far more mixed.\nAI coding tools have caused as many problems as they have solved, according to industry experts. The easy-to-use and accessible nature of AI coding tools has enabled a flood of bad code that threatens to overwhelm projects. Building new features is easier than ever, but maintaining them is just as hard and threatens to further fragment software ecosystems. \nThe result is a more complicated story than simple software abundance. Perhaps, the predicted, imminent death of the software engineer in this new AI era is premature. \nQuality vs quantity\nAcross the board, projects with open codebases are noticing a decline in the average quality of submissions, likely a result of AI tools lowering barriers to entry. \n“For people who are junior to the VLC codebase, the quality of the merge requests we see is abysmal,” Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the CEO of the VideoLan Organization that oversees VLC, said in a recent interview.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nKempf is still optimistic about AI coding tools overall but says they’re best “for experienced developers.” \nThere have been similar problems for Blender, a 3D modeling tool that has been maintained as open source since 2002. Blender Foundation CEO Franceso Siddi said LLM-assisted contributions typically “wasted reviewers’ time and affected their motivation.” Blender is still developing an official policy for AI coding tools, but Siddi said they are “neither mandated nor recommended for contributors or core developers.”\nThe flood of merge requests has gotten so bad that open-source developers are building new tools to manage it. \nEarlier this month, developer Mitchell Hashimoto launched a system that would limit GitHub contributions to “vouched” users, effectively closing the open-door policy for open-source software. As Hashimoto put it in the announcement, “AI eliminated the natural barrier to entry that let OSS projects trust by default.”\nThe same effect has emerged in bug bounty programs, which give outside researchers an open door to report security vulnerabilities. The open-source data transfer program cURL recently halted its bug bounty program after being overwhelmed by what creator Daniel Stenberg described as “AI slop.”\n“In the old days, someone actually invested a lot of time [in] the security report,” Stenberg said at a recent conference. “There was a built-in friction, but now there’s no effort at all in doing this. The floodgates are open.”\nIt’s particularly frustrating because many of open-source projects are also seeing the benefits of AI coding tools. Kempf says it’s made building new modules for VLC far easier, provided there’s an experienced developer at the helm. \n“You can give the model the whole codebase of VLC and say, ‘I’m porting this to a new operating system,’” Kempf said. “It is useful for senior people to write new code, but it’s difficult to manage for people who don’t know what they’re doing.”\nCompeting priorities\nThe bigger problem for open-source projects is a difference in priorities. Companies like Meta value new code and products, while open-source software work focuses more on stability. \n“The problem is different from large companies to open-source projects,” Kempf commented. “They get promoted for writing code, not maintaining it.”\nAI coding tools are also arriving at a moment when software, in general, is particularly fragmented. \nOpen source investor Konstantin Vinogradov says AI tools are running into a long-standing trend in open-source engineering.\n“On the one hand, we have exponentially growing code base with exponentially growing number of interdependences, And on the other hand, we have number of active maintainers, which is maybe slowly growing, but definitely not keeping up,” Vinogradov said. “With AI, both parts of this equation accelerated.”\nIt’s a new way of thinking about AI’s impact on software engineering — one with alarming implications for the industry at large. \nIf you see engineering as the process of producing working software, AI coding makes it easier than ever. But if engineering is really the process of managing software complexity, AI coding tools could make it harder. At the very least, it will take a lot of active planning and work to keep the sprawling complexity in check.\nFor Vinogradov, the result is a familiar situation for open-source projects: a lot of work to do, and not enough good engineers to do it. \n“AI does not increase the number of active, skilled maintainers,” he remarked. “It empowers the good ones, but all the fundamental problems just remain.”\n",

    "body": "\nTech investors haven’t given up on the dream of making physical products with the same speed and ease as coding software. \nExecutives at Freeform, a startup developing a novel 3D printing system for metal components, told TechCrunch that the company raised a $67 million Series B to expand its manufacturing platform. \nInvestors include Apandion, AE Ventures, Founders Fund, Linse Capital, NVidia’s NVentures , Threshold Ventures, and Two Sigma Ventures. FreeForm declined to disclose the company’s post-financing valuation, which Pitchbook cites as $179 million.\nCEO and cofounder Erik Palitsch said the funding would allow the company to upgrade its current GoldenEye printing system, which uses 18 lasers to fuse metal powders into precision components, to a new version. Dubbed Skyfall, the next iteration of the platform would use hundreds of lasers to produce thousands of kilograms of metal parts each day. \nThat’s the culmination of a vision Palitsch and co-founder/president Thomas Ronacher launched in 2018. The two met while developing rocket engines at SpaceX, where they found that industrial machines for printing metal components are expensive, finicky, and not well designed for mass manufacturing. \nTheir new company would build its platform from the ground up to achieve higher throughput and flexibility, with an emphasis on active software controls. Palitsch says Freeform’s platform is “AI native,” noting a partnership with Nvidia that allows the company to access advanced GPUs.\n“I think we’re the only quote-unquote manufacturing company out there that has H200 clusters in a data center on site,” Paltisch told TechCrunch. “What are they doing? We’re running real-time physics-based simulations and learning all the different aspects of the end to end manufacturing workflow.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe data collected by sensors in the company’s manufacturing platform and during the simulations allows Freeform to rapidly improve production quality and quantity. \n“We have more meaningful data on the physics of the metal-printing process than any company in the world,” head of talent Cameron Kay said. \nWhile Palitsch said he could not disclose any customers, he said the company is already delivering hundreds of “mission-critical” parts to buyers. Now, the company wants to hire as many as 100 new employees and expand its facility to start executing on its contract backlog. \nManufacturing-as-a-service has grown as a category as venture investors have taken a greater interest in building vehicles, robots, and energy production systems. For example, Hadrian recently earned a $1.6B valuation from its investors while developing automated production for defense, and VulcanForms and Divergent have raised hundreds of millions to develop metal-printing services of their own.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTim Fernholz is a journalist who writes about technology, finance and public policy.

    "body": "\nThere came a point when Newton Asare realized AI agents weren’t just tools anymore. “They were operating more like teammates,” he told TechCrunch. \nThe realization crystallized when Asare and Kiran Das, both serial founders, noticed they were using AI agents to perform tasks they usually would have done themselves. Asare said he came to believe that the future lay in people managing AI employees.\n “And if that’s true, we’ll need a real system to manage them, with structure around onboarding, coordination, and oversight for digital workers,” he added. \nLast year, the duo launched Reload, an AI workforce management platform. On Thursday, the company announced its first AI product, Epic, alongside a $2.275 million round led by Anthemis, with participation from Zeal Capital Partners, Plug and Play, Cohen Circle, Blueprint, and Axiom. \nReload is a platform that lets organizations manage their AI agents across teams and departments. Companies can connect agents, regardless of who built them (whether by a third party or internally), assign them roles and permissions, and track the work they perform. “Reload acts like the system of record for AI employees, providing visibility, coordination, and oversight as agents operate across functions,” said Asare, the company’s CEO.\nRight now, he observed, teams are using multiple agents simultaneously for tasks such as coding, debugging, and refactoring. The problem is that these agents are often focused solely on whatever they were prompted to do and don’t necessarily retain long-term memory of what a product is or why they were told to perform a specific function. They operate, in other words, with only short-term memory.\nOver time, an agent can lose context, or the system can evolve away from its original intent. That’s why Reload is launching Epic. Built on top of the Reload platform, it serves as an architect alongside other coding agents, continuously defining a product’s requirements and constraints, and reminding agents what they are building and why, to keep a system consistent as it develops. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“In software development specifically, coding agents can generate large amounts of code, but they don’t preserve shared system understanding over time,” Asare said. “Epic complements those agents by defining the system upfront and maintaining shared context as it evolves. It doesn’t replace coding agents; it makes them more effective.” \nEpic is designed to live inside the coding environments where developers already work. It can be installed as an extension in AI-assisted code editors like Cursor and Windsurf, running alongside other agents inside these tools.\n“When a team starts a project, Epic helps create the core system artifacts such as product requirements, data models, API specifications, tech stack decisions, diagrams, and structured task breakdowns,” Asare said, adding that these are the foundations that coding agents build against. \n“As development progresses, Epic maintains a structured memory of decisions, code changes, and patterns,” he continued. “If you switch coding agents, your structure and memory follow. If multiple engineers use different agents on the same project, everyone builds against the same shared source of truth.” \nAsare and Das previously had a company together that was acquired and this is their second company together.\nThe AI infrastructure space is crowded. Competitors include LongChain, which helps with AI agent deployment and memory management, and CrewAI, which helps enterprises manage their AI agents. \nDas said Epic is different because it “defines the system upfront and maintains shared project-level context across agents and sessions,” with a focus specifically on building infrastructure to maintain AI employees. “Traditional workforce systems weren’t designed for AI agents operating as teammates,” said Das, who serves as the company’s CTO. “That’s the layer we’re focused on.”\nThe fresh capital will go toward hiring and product advancement, specifically expanding the infrastructure needed to support a growing number of AI agents. “We’re building for the next era of work,” Asare said. \nThis piece was updated to add the other investors in the round. \n",

    "body": "\nMuch of the conversation around AI today is focused on building cloud capacity and massive data centers to run models. Companies like Apple and Qualcomm are in the early stages of making on-device AI more useful. Amid all that, the 14-person technical team of London-based Mirai is working to improve how models run on phones and laptops.\nMirai, which is backed by a $10 million seed round led by Uncork Capital, was founded by Dima Shvets and Alexey Moiseenkov last year. Both founders have experience in building scalable consumer apps. Shvets co-founded face-swapping app Reface, which was backed by a16z. Shvets later also became a scout for the venture firm. Moiseenkov was CEO and co-founder of the last decade’s viral AI filters app, Prisma.\nAs consumer developers, both had been thinking about AI and machine learning on devices even before generative AI became popular, Shvets said.\n“When we met together in London, we started to chat about technology, and we realized that within the hype of gen AI and more AI adoption, everybody speaks about cloud, about servers, about AGI coming. But the missing piece is on-device [AI] for consumer hardware,” he told TechCrunch.\nShvets and Moiseenkov wanted to use AI to create a pipeline that would allow them to enable complex tasks on the phone, which led them to start Mirai. When they asked others who developed consumer apps, they heard that many wanted better cost optimization and margin per token usage, too.\nCo-founders Alexey Moiseenkov and Dima Shvets Image Credits: Mirai\nToday, Mirai is developing a framework for models so they can perform better on devices. The company has built an inference engine for Apple Silicon that optimizes on-device throughput. With its upcoming SDK, developers can integrate the runtime in their apps with only a few lines, the company says.\n“One of the visions why we started the company was that we wanted to give developers, like this Stripe-like, eight lines of code [integration] experience…you basically go to our platform, integrate the key, and start working with summarization, classification, or whatever your use case is,” Shvets said.\nThe startup built this engine in Rust, which can bump up a model’s generation speed by up to 37%, they claim. The company said that, while tuning the model for a platform, it doesn’t tinker with model weights to ensure there is no loss in quality of the output.\nMirai’s stack currently focuses on improving text and voice modalities on the platform, with plans to support vision in the future. The team has started to work with frontier model providers to tune their models for edge use and is in talks with different chipmakers. Later, it plans to bring its engine to Android, too. \nIn addition, Mirai aims to release on-device benchmarks so model makers can test on-device performance. Shvets recognizes that not all AI work can be done on-device, though. To enable a mixed mode of operation, the team is building an orchestration layer to send requests that can’t be fulfilled on the device up to the cloud.\nWhile the startup is not directly working with apps just yet, its engine could power on-device assistants, transcribers, translators, and chat apps, we’re told.\nAndy McLoughlin, managing partner at Uncork Capital, noted that he invested in an edge machine learning company in the last decade. He said that the company was early and eventually sold its business to Spotify. In today’s world, the situation is different, he thinks.\n“Given the cost of cloud inference, something has to change… For now, VCs are happy to continue funding the rocketship companies, spending inordinate sums on cloud inference. But that won’t last — at some point, people will focus on the underlying economics of these businesses and realize that something has to change,” he said. “It feels like every model maker will want to run part of their inference workloads at the edge, and Mirai feels very well positioned to capture this demand.”\nMirai’s seed round also saw participation from individuals, including Dreamer CEO David Singleton, YC Partner Francois Chaubard, Snowflake co-founder Marcin Żukowski, ElevenLabs co-founder Mati Staniszewski, former Google AdSense product manager and Coinbase board member Gokul Rajaram, Groq investor Scooter Braun, Turing.com CTO Vijay Krishnan, Theory Forge Ventures’ Ben Parr and Matt Schlicht, and ex-Netflix technical leader, Aditya Jami.\n",

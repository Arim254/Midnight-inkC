    "body": "\nMicrosoft announced Thursday it would buy 3.6 million carbon removal credits from a biofuels plant in Louisiana owned by C2X. The plant, which is slated to begin operating in 2029, will process forestry waste into methanol, which can be used to power ships and planes and as a raw material for chemical manufacturing. Altogether, the facility will produce more than 500,000 metric tons of methanol. About 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide will be captured and stored, likely underground.\nThe purchase is one of many that Microsoft has made in the last year or so, including a 4.9 million metric ton deal with Vaulted Deep, a 3.7 million metric ton agreement with CO280, and a 7 million metric ton buy from Chestnut Carbon. Microsoft’s rapid expansion of its data center footprint has imperiled its 2030 pledge to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it generates. While the company also buys large amounts of renewable and nuclear power, carbon renewal purchases like these will help offset future fossil fuel emissions.\n",

    "body": "\nApple and Google have released several software updates to protect against a hacking campaign targeting an unknown number of their users.\nOn Wednesday, Google released patches for a handful of security bugs in its Chrome browser, noting that one of the bugs was being actively exploited by hackers before the company had time to patch it. \nUnusually for Google, the company provided no further details at the time. \nBut on Friday, Google updated the page to say that the bug was discovered by Apple’s security engineering team and Google’s Threat Analysis Group, whose security researchers primarily track government hackers and mercenary spyware makers, indicating that the hacking campaign may have been orchestrated by government-backed hackers.\nAt the same time, Apple released security updates for its flagship products, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Vision Pro, Apple TV, Apple Watches, and its Safari browser.\nAccording to the security advisory for iPhones and iPads, Apple patched two bugs and the company said it was aware “that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals” running devices prior to iOS 26.\nThat language is Apple’s typical way of saying that it knows some of its customers and users were targeted by hackers exploiting zero-days, meaning flaws that at the time of exploitation are unknown to the software makers. Often, these are cases where government hackers used hacking tools and spyware made by companies such as NSO Group or Paragon Solutions to target journalists, dissidents, and human rights activists. \nApple and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nA security researcher said Home Depot exposed access to its internal systems for a year after one of its employees published a private access token online, likely by mistake. The researcher found the exposed token and tried to privately alert Home Depot to its security lapse but was ignored for several weeks. \nThe exposure is now fixed after TechCrunch contacted company representatives last week.\nSecurity researcher Ben Zimmermann told TechCrunch that, in early November, he found a published GitHub access token belonging to a Home Depot employee, which was exposed sometime in early 2024. \nWhen he tested the token, Zimmermann said that it granted access to hundreds of private Home Depot source code repositories hosted on GitHub and allowed the ability to modify their contents. \nThe researcher said the keys allowed access to Home Depot’s cloud infrastructure, including its order fulfillment and inventory management systems, and code development pipelines, among other systems. Home Depot has hosted much of its developer and engineering infrastructure on GitHub since 2015, according to a customer profile on GitHub’s website.\nZimmermann said he sent several emails to Home Depot but didn’t hear back. \nNor did he get a response from Home Depot’s chief information security officer, Chris Lanzilotta, after sending a message over LinkedIn.\nZimmermann told TechCrunch that he has disclosed several similar exposures in recent months to companies, which have thanked him for his findings. \n“Home Depot is the only company that ignored me,” he said.\nGiven that Home Depot does not have a way to report security flaws, such as a vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program, Zimmermann contacted TechCrunch in an effort to get the exposure fixed.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch on December 5, Home Depot spokesperson George Lane acknowledged receipt of our email but did not respond to follow-up emails asking for comment. The exposed token is no longer online, and the researcher said the token’s access was revoked soon after our outreach.\nWe also asked Lane if Home Depot has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if anyone else used the token during the months it was left online to access any of Home Depot’s internal systems. We did not hear back.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch. He also authors the weekly cybersecurity newsletter, this week in security. \nHe can be reached via encrypted message at zackwhittaker.1337 on Signal.

    "body": "\nIn a move worthy of a post on the Not Like The Other Girls subreddit, Reddit, one of the world’s largest social platforms, is arguing that it isn’t like other, actual social media sites, as the company seeks to overturn Australia’s law banning children under 16 years of age from social media.\nIn a lawsuit filed with Australia’s top court, Reddit argues the law, which came into force on December 10, limits free political discourse by preventing children from airing their views online, and should be overturned.\nAnd if the legislation isn’t overturned, the company says it should be exempted from the law because it doesn’t meet the legislation’s definition of a “social media platform.”\nReddit is essentially asking the Australian High Court to address some of the questions raised about the legislation, which requires 10 major services to deactivate under-16s’ accounts and prevent them from using the app. Critics argue that the law infringes on children’s rights, and companies have sought to raise questions about what “social media” even defines.\nIndeed, calling itself a “collection of public fora arranged by subject,” Reddit brought up definitions of the word “social” in its filing to make the case that “it is not the sole or a significant purpose of Reddit to enable persons to interact ‘in a social manner’.”\n“Reddit enables online interactions about the content that users post on the site. It facilitates knowledge sharing from one user to other users. It is not a significant purpose of the site to enable interactions engaged in because of a particular user’s relationship with or interest in another user as a person […] Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become ‘friends’ with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events,” the filing reads.\nIn a post accompanying the filing, Reddit admin LastBluejay said the law carries “some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“While we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren’t,” the post reads.\nReddit also points out that a significant portion of content on social media platforms is accessible without an account, and kids under 16 years old would be more easily protected if they were allowed to have accounts that could then be restricted.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor. He covered North American and European M&A, equity, regulatory news and debt markets at Reuters and Acuris Global, and has also written about travel, tourism, entertainment and books.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Ram by emailing ram.iyer@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSpinny, an Indian online marketplace for used cars, is raising around $160 million as it moves to acquire car services startup GoMechanic, TechCrunch has learned.\nThe Series G round, which includes a mix of primary and secondary transactions, would value the 10-year-old startup at about $1.8 billion post-money, three people familiar with the matter said, broadly in line with its previous valuation. \nNearly $90 million of the round is primary, people said; Existing investor Accel has already wired about $44 million of that amount, with some details of the investment appearing in regulatory filings in India this week, which Indian outlet Entrackr first reported. A new investor is participating in the remaining portion of the primary, but TechCrunch could not confirm its specifics.\nWestBridge Capital is doubling down in the new round with a check of a similar size to its previous investment, the people said. The firm invested about $35 million to $40 million in Spinny’s Series F round earlier this year.\nMuch of the secondary portion of the transaction is being sold by Indian VC firm Fundamentum, according to the people, while Blume Ventures is also expected to pare part of its stake.\nAccel, Fundamentum, and Blume Ventures did not respond to requests for comments. WestBridge Capital declined to comment.\nIn March, Spinny raised $131 million in the first part of its Series F round led by Accel, with participation from Fundamentum, before expanding the raise to about $170 million in June to include WestBridge Capital. Those funds were earmarked to scale Spinny’s core used-car business. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHowever, the new round is being raised specifically to finance the acquisition of GoMechanic and invest in its platform, without drawing on the startup’s existing cash reserves, the people said. Earlier reports suggested Spinny could buy GoMechanic for around ₹4.5 billion (approximately $49.70 million) in a cash-and-stock deal.\nA consortium led by Lifelong Group acquired GoMechanic in 2023 after the startup admitted to “grave errors” in its financial reporting. The startup had previously been backed by high-profile investors, including Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, and SoftBank.\nFor Spinny, acquiring GoMechanic would deepen its control across the used-car value chain. The Gurugram-based startup has built a large consumer-facing business, selling about 13,000 used cars a month, primarily directly to buyers and, to a lesser extent, to dealers through its auction platform. Spinny operates its own large reconditioning centers to refurbish vehicles before sale and relies on third-party service shops for after-sales servicing of customer cars — a gap GoMechanic could bring in-house.\nGoMechanic would also act as a “two-way” funnel for Spinny, a person familiar with the matter said. The platform would service vehicles bought or sold through Spinny, and help attract car owners who may not yet be customers. That could help expand Spinny’s vehicle supply without significantly increasing customer acquisition costs.\nThe acquisition comes as India’s used-car market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% to roughly 9.5 million units by 2030, from nearly 6 million units today, per a recent report by Mahindra First Choice and Volkswagen Pre-owned Certified. \nThe GoMechanic deal would mark Spinny’s latest move to broaden its footprint in India’s automotive market. In recent months, the startup has expanded beyond used-car sales by acquiring auto publications Autocar India, Autocar Professional and What Car? India from London-based media group Haymarket, and by launching a non-banking finance company, Spinny Capital, to offer vehicle loans to customers.\nSpinny co-founder and CEO Niraj Singh declined to comment.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

According to the sheriff’s department, the footage shows that after dropping off the food and taking a photo, the woman appeared to spray a substance towards the food from a small aerosol can attached to her keychain.\nThe sheriff’s department said that using DoorDash records, detectives identified the woman as Kourtney Stevenson of Kentucky, who told local police in a phone call that she had been working for DoorDash while visiting her father, and that she’d used pepper spray to spray a spider. But the department also said that with an overnight low of 35 degrees Fahrenheit, “outdoor spiders in Indiana are not active and would not be capable of crawling on exposed surfaces.”\nWhen Stevenson allegedly declined to come in for an interview, detectives obtained a warrant to arrest her for battery resulting in a moderate injury and consumer product tampering. She is now awaiting extradition to Indiana.\nA DoorDash spokesperson said in a statement that Stevenson has been banned from the platform.\n“We have absolutely zero tolerance for this type of appalling behavior,” the spokesperson said. “The Dasher’s access to the platform has been permanently removed, and our team is supporting law enforcement with their investigation.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe New York Times and NBC News both report that it’s not clear if Stevenson has a lawyer who can comment on her behalf.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nApple is releasing another tool to dial down Liquid Glass’ transparency with its release of iOS 26.2, out now. With the update, users will be able to control the transparency of the Lock Screen’s clock. The release follows an update that introduced a slider for controlling the opacity of Liquid Glass elements through the operating system, following user complaints that the changes made their iPhone or other Apple device too hard to read.\nLaunched with iOS 26, the new design language for Apple devices turns various interface elements like buttons, sliders, and notifications semi-transparent. The elements also refract light, giving them the optical qualities of glass.\nMeant to modernize Apple’s operating systems and potentially prepare for a world where the operating system moves to AI smart glasses, Liquid Glass received mixed reviews. Some found that the transparency made their device difficult to use, as it became tricky to read key items, like notifications or the name of an artist in Apple Music. In response to user complaints, Apple released a Liquid Glass tool in iOS 26.1 that allowed users to return their interface to a more “frosted” look, if desired.\nWith the slider for the Clock’s “glassiness,” Apple is again rolling back the transparency of the Liquid Glass update, but in the form of another user-controlled customization feature, instead of a global change.\nImage Credits:iPhone screenshot by TechCrunch\nThese tweaks are notable as they telegraph that perhaps Apple isn’t standing 100% behind the design overhaul as being perfect as is.\nThe timing of the change is worth noting, too. Earlier this month, Apple confirmed the design executive behind the Liquid Glass makeover, Alan Dye, was leaving the company for Meta. While it didn’t appear that Dye was pushed out, Apple replaced him with longtime Apple designer Stephen Lemay. \nUnlike Dye, Lemay’s career was spent in interface and interaction design — a skill set called for when it comes to fixing Liquid Glass, it can be argued.\n\niOS 26.2 brought other new features beyond the latest Liquid Glass tweak.\nAs in the betas, users can now create AirDrop codes to share with people not in their contacts, allowing them to become a “known” AirDrop contact for a 30-day period. The feature might make sense at work or in other scenarios where you need to share files or photos with someone not stored in your Contacts.\nAlso in iOS 26.2, the Reminders supports alarms; Apple News gains a Following tab at the bottom nav bar along with other navigation changes; Apple Music adds offline lyrics; and the Podcasts app adds AI-generated chapters for podcast episodes, a Podcast Mention feature for linking to other shows, and other changes. \nApple Watch owners will also now get a Sleep Score based on how well they slept and if they met their sleep goals. \nApple also released several important security updates across its flagship products on Friday, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches, to patch vulnerabilities used in an active hacking campaign.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWorld, the biometric ID verification project co-founded by Sam Altman, released the newest version of its app today, debuting several new features, including an encrypted chat integration and an expanded, Venmo-like capability for sending and requesting crypto. \nWorld was created by the startup Tools for Humanity in 2019, and originally launched its app in 2023. The company says that, in a world roiled by AI-generated digital fakery, it hopes to create digital “proof of human” tools that can help separate the humans from the bots. \nDuring a small gathering at World’s headquarters in San Francisco on Thursday, Altman and World’s co-founder and CEO, Alex Blania, briefly introduced the new version of the app (which developers have termed a “super app”) before the product team took over to explain the new features. During his remarks, Altman said that the concept for World grew out of conversations he and Blania had had about the need to create a new kind of economic model. That model, based around web3 principles, is what World has been trying to accomplish through its verification network. “It’s really hard to both identify unique people and do that in a privacy-preserving way,” said Altman.\nWorld Chat, the app’s new messenger, seems designed to do just that. It uses end-to-end encryption to keep users’ conversations safe (this encryption is described as being equivalent to Signal, the privacy-focused messenger), and also leverages color-coded speech bubbles to alert users to whether the person they’re talking to has been verified by World’s system or not, the company said. The idea is to incentivize verification, giving people the power to know whether the person they’re talking to is who they say they are. Chat was originally launched in beta in March.\nThe other big feature reveal on Thursday was an expanded digital payment system that allows app users to send and receive cryptocurrency. World app has functioned as a digital wallet for some time, but the newest version of the app includes broader capabilities. Using virtual accounts, users can also receive paychecks directly into World App and make deposits from their bank accounts, both of which can then be converted into crypto. You don’t have be verified by World’s authentication system to use these features.\nTiago Sada, World’s chief product officer, told TechCrunch that part of the reason chat was added was to create a more interactive experience for users. “What we kept hearing from people is that they wanted a more social World app,” Sada said. World Chat is designed to fill that need, creating what Sada says is a secure way to communicate. “It took a lot of work to make this feature-rich messenger that is similar to a WhatsApp or a Telegram, but with encryption and security of something that is a lot closer to Signal,” Sada said.\nWorld (which was originally called Worldcoin) deploys a unique authentication process: Interested humans get their eyes scanned at one of the company’s offices, where the Orb — a large verification device — converts the person’s iris into a unique and encrypted digital code. That code, the verified World ID, can then be used by the person to interact with World’s ecosystem of services, which are available through its app.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe addition of more social-friendly features is clearly meant to drive broader adoption of the app, which makes sense since scaling verification is the company’s main challenge. Altman has said that he would like the project to scan a billion people’s eyes, but Tools for Humanity claims to have scanned less than 20 million people.  \nSince standing in long lines at a corporate office to have your eyeballs scanned by a giant metallic ball may seem slightly less than enticing to some users, the company has already sought to make its verification process less cumbersome. In April, Tools for Humanity announced its Orb Minis — hand-held, phone-like devices — that allow users to scan their own eyes from the comfort of their homes. Blania previously told TechCrunch that, eventually, the company would like to turn the Orb Minis into a mobile point-of-sale device or sell its ID sensor tech to device manufacturers. If the company takes such steps, it would drop the barrier to verification significantly, potentially inspiring much more widespread adoption.\n",

    "body": "\nGoogle is rolling out a beta experience that lets you hear real-time translations in your headphones, the company announced on Friday. The tech giant is also bringing advanced Gemini capabilities to Google Translate and expanding its language-learning tools in the Translate app.\nThe new real-time headphone translations experience keeps each speaker’s tone, emphasis, and cadence intact, so it’s easier to follow the conversation and tell who’s saying what, Google says. The new capability essentially turns any pair of headphones into a real-time, one-way translation device. \n“Whether you’re trying to have a conversation in a different language, listen to a speech or lecture while abroad, or watch a TV show or film in another language, you can now put in your headphones, open the Translate app, tap ‘Live translate’ and hear a real-time translation in your preferred language,” said Rose Yao, Google VP Product Management, Search Verticals, in the blog post.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe beta is rolling out now in the Translate app on Android in the U.S., Mexico, and India. The feature works with any pair of headphones and supports more than 70 languages.\nThe company plans to bring the capability to iOS and more countries in 2026. \nAs for the advanced Gemini capabilities coming to Translate, Google says they will enable smarter, more natural, and accurate text translations. They’ll also enable improved translations of phrases with more nuanced meanings, like slang, idioms, or local expressions.\nFor example, if you’re trying to translate an English idiom like “stealing my thunder,” you’ll now get a more accurate translation instead of a literal word-for-word translation, as Gemini will parse the context to capture what the idiom really means.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Google\nThis update is rolling out now in the U.S. and India, translating between English and nearly 20 languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and German.

English speakers can now practice German, while Bengali, Mandarin Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, German, Hindi, Italian, Romanian, and Swedish speakers can practice English. \nThe tech giant is also adding improved feedback so you can get helpful tips based on your speaking practice. \nAdditionally, Google is adding a feature that tracks how many days in a row you’ve been learning, making it easier to see your progress and stay consistent.

    "body": "\nDriverless cars are no longer restricted to the realm of sci-fi thanks to companies like Waymo deploying commercial robotaxi services in multiple cities. And a number of automakers, big and small, are trying to bring that same level of autonomy to personally owned vehicles over the next few years.\nIf that happens, what kinds of things could you do with a personal AV? Maybe you’ll be able to send it to pick up food or run errands — the hope of a company called Autolane. Or, if you’re Tesla CEO Elon Musk, you think owners will want to deploy their cars into the world to offer rides to other people, creating a tidy, nearly effortless side-hustle.\nHebron Sher, co-founder of Dallas-based Zevo, is eager to capitalize on all of the above. The company has been operating an EV-only car-share fleet for a little over a year, and it’s now adding robotaxis, starting with a new company called Tensor.\nTensor is kind of an odd duck. The startup sort of emerged earlier this year from a previous Silicon Valley startup called AutoX that also had operations in China, and boldly claims that it will be the first to sell a fully autonomous car to regular consumers — in 2026, no less. Zevo says it will purchase up to 100 of Tensor’s cars and add them to its network.\nThere aren’t a lot of details on timing, and Tensor still needs to show that it can build cars at any kind of scale and reliability, which are massive hurdles that have tripped up many other newcomers in recent years. (The company said in a statement that its “path to shipping is driven by the pacing of global regulatory approvals, not product limitations.) If it works, Zevo customers would essentially be able to borrow the Tensor AVs in what amounts to a sort of decentralized robotaxi service.\nThe announcement resembles the many heady-yet-ultimately-unmet promises that were made a decade ago, when the self-driving car hype first peaked. But with real robotaxis on the roads now, the idea seems a little more tangible this time.\n“Tensor’s vision is to build a future where everyone owns their own Artificial General Intelligence — a personal AGI that enables more time, freedom and autonomy,” Hugo Fozzati, Tensor’s chief business officer, said in a statement. “For us, this partnership with Zevo is not only just a batch sale of our vehicles, but also enables individuals and micro-entrepreneurs to participate and profit from AV business in this AI era.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt won’t be Sher’s first bet on an unproven company. In October, Zevo announced a non-binding order of 1,000 vans from perpetually imperiled EV startup, Faraday Future. Faraday, which has struggled for a decade to make and sell its flagship FF91 luxury SUV, recently resorted to importing more affordable electric vans from China and assembling them in the U.S. The company is supposed to assemble the first of those later this month.\nSher’s willingness to bet on these companies stems from two reasons. One is cost: Tensor and Faraday Future have nonexistent and bad track records, respectively, and so they’re willing to cut an attractive deal. More importantly, Sher said, these companies are more willing than a major OEM to allow Zevo to tightly integrate with their vehicles’ software — a crucial factor if you’re going to allow peer-to-peer sharing, especially of robotaxis.\nNot only is it tougher to get legacy automakers to be similarly flexible, but Sher said their “tech freaking sucks.” With newcomers, he said, “the synergy of startup and startup, sort of mingling, commingling together, and saying, ‘Let’s build a solution side by side…’ I think I’ve really enjoyed that experience.”\nSher paints the Tensor deal as a win-win for both companies: Tensor gets an early customer and a shot to prove that its robocars are real and can do what it promises; Zevo gets a good deal and that deep software integration. \nBut, he admits it’s a “calculated risk.”\n“I think that’s what makes America great, you know, the fact that we do encourage startups to take risk,” he said.\nThis story has been updated to reflect that AutoX was headquartered in Silicon Valley.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nA company that makes photo booths is exposing pictures and videos of its customers online thanks to a simple flaw in its website where the files are stored, according to a security researcher.  \nThe researcher, who goes by Zeacer, alerted TechCrunch to the security issue in late November after reporting the vulnerability in October to Hama Film, the photo booth maker that has franchise presence in Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, but did not hear back.\nZeacer shared with TechCrunch a sample of pictures taken from Hama Film’s servers, which showed groups of clearly young people posing in photo booths. Hama Film’s booths not only print out the photos like a typical photo booth, but booths also upload the customers’ photos to the company’s servers.\nVibecast, which owns Hama Film, has yet to respond to his messages alerting the company of the issues. Vibecast also hasn’t responded to several requests for comment from TechCrunch, nor did Vibecast’s co-founder Joel Park respond to a message we sent via LinkedIn.\nAs of Friday, the researcher said the company has still not fully resolved the security flaw and continues to expose customers’ data. As such, TechCrunch is withholding specific details of the vulnerability from publication.\nWhen Zeacer first found this flaw, he noted that it appeared that photos were deleted from the photo booth maker’s servers every two to three weeks. \nNow, he said, the pictures stored on the servers appear to get deleted after 24 hours, which limits the number of pictures exposed at any given time. But a hacker could still exploit the vulnerability he discovered each day and download the contents of every photo and video on the server. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBefore this week, Zeacer said at one point he saw more than 1,000 pictures online for the Hama Film booths in Melbourne. \nThis incident is the latest example of a company that, at least for a time, was not implementing certain basic and widely accepted security practices, such as rate-limiting. Last month, TechCrunch reported that government contractor giant Tyler Technologies was not rate-limiting its websites used for allowing courts to manage their jurors’ personal information. This meant anyone could break into any juror’s profile by running a computer script capable of mass-guessing their date of birth and their easy-to-guess numerical identifier. \n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nRetro, a friend-focused photo-sharing app with roughly a million users, is adding a new feature that lets you time-travel through your old photo memories from your phone’s camera roll. While the app today offers a way to share photos of what’s happening during your week with a private group of friends, or create shared albums, this latest addition, dubbed “Rewind,” is private to you — unless you choose to share the photos with others.\nRetro’s co-founder, Nathan Sharp, explains that the idea for Rewind was inspired by a feature the app already offered and was proving popular.\nToday, at the end of the row showcasing the photos your friends shared during the week, there’s a card you can tap that will let you view your own photos from that same week a year ago. \nHowever, that option wasn’t accessible to newer Retro users, since they hadn’t yet uploaded enough photos to the app to take advantage of the photo memories feature.\nImage Credits:Retro\n“If you’re a new user, you don’t really have the opportunity to go time-travel through your memories in this way,” said Sharp, who had spent over six years at Meta working on products like Instagram Stories and Facebook Dating, before leaving to found his own photo-sharing startup with Ryan Olson, Retro’s CTO, in 2022.\n“The other problem that we saw was that people take more photos than ever, but they actually do less with that volume of photos than ever before. So it’s almost as if those photos go into the ether,” he added.\nThe addition, to some extent, is pushback against the growing trend of AI-generated content and “for you” feed-style algorithms.\n“As people engage with those platforms more and more, something that has to be true and will be true is that people will still want to see more of their friends,” Sharp says. “The photos and videos you take will need to find a place where they can reach the intended audience.”\nImage Credits:Retro\nAlthough nearly half (45.7%) of Retro’s users participate in the app on a daily basis, the Rewind feature could boost that engagement even higher.  \nTo try Rewind, you can either launch it from the end of the row of shared photos, just past the “this week in” card, or from its more prominent position as the middle tab in the bottom navigation bar. \nWhen launched, there’s a haptic response as the screen starts cycling through the older photos pulled from your camera roll. These memories aren’t being shared, but you can tap on the share icon if you feel inspired to send them to a friend or post them. In addition, you can opt to hide photos you’d rather not see (like those of an ex), or tap a “dice” icon to be taken to a random memory instead.\nAs the iPod-inspired dial clicks back into your past, you’ll feel a subtle vibration as each new memory loads. You can also spin the dial to move forward or backward in time, watching the photos from months and years past flip by on the screen, pausing at those you want to view longer or share.\nImage Credits:Retro screenshot/TechCrunch\nYou can press and hold on any photo to see it uncropped, and when you share a photo, a timestamp is added at the bottom so friends will understand it’s not a new pic. \nWhile screenshots won’t appear in this photo archive, other photos — like those of receipts or whiteboards at work will show up, as they could still be interesting memories to you. (And if you come across a photo you don’t need to keep, deleting it from the app will also delete it from your camera roll.)\nThe idea to look back at older photo memories is hardly new, of course.\nIn the past, a startup called Timehop popularized the idea of doing something more with our growing digital photo archives by allowing users to revisit old photos through its simple mobile app. Later, Facebook copied the idea for its “On This Day” feature, and photo-hosting services like Google Photos and Apple Photos added memories features of their own.\nStill, Sharp doesn’t believe these will be direct competitors for Retro. Facebook, over the years, has downranked friends’ content as its feed became filled with links, news, and ads. Meanwhile, people tend to think of Apple’s and Google’s photo apps more as utilities for managing and storing photos, not as social apps like Retro.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 2023 winner, BioticsAI, announced on Monday that it has received FDA clearance for its AI software that helps detect fetal abnormalities in ultrasound images. \nThe product was envisioned by founder CEO Robhy Bustami, who was raised in a family of obstetricians, including his mother, aunt and uncle. He spent a lot of time in hospitals growing up, often traveling with his mother as she provided maternal care throughout the U.S.  \nAfter learning to code and studying computer science at UC Irvine, Bustami teamed up with Salman Khan, Chaskin Saroff, and Dr. Hisham Elgammal in 2021 to launch BioticsAI.\nThe technology uses computer vision AI “to support fetal ultrasound quality assessment, anatomical completeness, automated reporting, and seamless integration into clinical workflows,” Bustami told TechCrunch. \nHe hopes his tech will help the U.S. combat the fact that the U.S. has one of the worst prenatal outcomes for mothers among high-income nations. Black women in particular face a very high rate of maternal deaths,  \nBustami said that the prenatal ultrasound has become the “cornerstone” of monitoring pregnancies, but its low-quality images can lead to misdiagnosis. \nBustami said the hardest part was not building his AI models, which were trained on a diverse set of hundreds of thousands of ultrasounds, but ensuring the tech performed reliably in the real world, especially on demographics with the highest risk for a tragic outcome. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“In an environment where disparities in healthcare outcomes are well documented, it was critical to demonstrate consistent performance across patient subgroups, not just in idealized cases,” Bustami continued.  \nThe CEO said it took just under three years to go through the FDA process, including testing and validating the product. The experience taught him and his team how critical it is for engineering, product, clinical, and regulatory work to be tightly aligned from the very beginning. “By designing the product, clinical validation, and regulatory pathway together, rather than sequentially, we were able to move quickly,” he said.  \nNow with FDA clearance, Bustami said the companies’ next focus is scaling across various health systems nationwide. He also has plans to add more features for fetal medicine and reproductive health. \n“We’re positioned to scale both distribution and clinical impact while continuing to deepen the power of our technology,” he said.  \nThis piece was updated to correct the spelling of the co-founder’s name.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7:30 AM PST · January 18, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nIf you’re at all concerned about privacy, the rise of AI personal assistants can feel alarming. It’s difficult to use one without sharing personal information, which is retained by the model’s parent company. With OpenAI already testing advertising, it’s easy to imagine the same data collection that fuels Facebook and Google creeping into your chatbot conversations.\nA new project, launched in December by Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike, is showing what a privacy-conscious AI service might look like. Confer is designed to look and feel like ChatGPT or Claude, but the backend is arranged to avoid data collection, with the open-source rigor that makes Signal so trusted. Your Confer conversations can’t be used to train the model or target ads, for the simple reason that the host will never have access to them.\nFor Marlinspike, those protections are a response to the intimate nature of the service.\n“It’s a form of technology that actively invites confession,” says Marlinspike. “Chat interfaces like ChatGPT know more about people than any other technology before. When you combine that with advertising, it’s like someone paying your therapist to convince you to buy something.” \nEnsuring that privacy requires several different systems working in concert. \nFirst, Confer encrypts messages to and from the system using the WebAuthn passkey system. (Unfortunately, that standard works best on mobile devices or Macs running Sequoia, although you can also make it work on Windows or Linux with a password manager.) On the server side, all Confer’s inference processing is done in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), with remote attestation systems in place to verify the system hasn’t been compromised. Inside that, there’s an array of open-weight foundation models handling whatever query comes in. \nThe result is a lot more complicated than a standard inference setup (which is fairly complicated already), but it delivers on Confer’s basic promise to users. As long as those protections are in place, you can have sensitive conversations with the model without any information leaking out.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nConfer’s free tier is limited to 20 messages a day and five active chats. Users willing to pay $35 a month will get unlimited access, along with more advanced models and personalization. That’s quite a bit more than ChatGPT’s Plus plan — but privacy doesn’t come cheap.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12:26 AM PST · January 17, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk wants a jaw-dropping $79 billion to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming the AI company defrauded him by jettisoning its nonprofit mission, Bloomberg first reported. The figure comes from expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist whose bio says he has been deposed nearly 100 times and testified at trial more than a dozen times in complex commercial litigation cases.\nWazzan, who specializes in valuation and damages calculations, determined that Musk is entitled to a hefty portion of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation when he co-founded the startup in 2015. (If you’re wondering, that would mean a 3,500-fold return on Musk’s investment.)\nWazzan’s analysis combines Musk’s initial financial contributions with the technical know-how and business contributions he offered to OpenAI’s early team, calculating wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI and $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, which today owns a 27% chunk of the company.\nMusk’s legal team argues he should be compensated as an early startup investor who sees returns “many orders of magnitude greater” than his initial investment. But the sheer scale of the damages demand underscores that this legal battle isn’t really about the money.\nMusk’s personal fortune currently hovers around $700 billion, making him by far the world’s richest person. As Reuters recently noted, his wealth now exceeds that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by a stunning $500 billion, according to Forbes’ billionaires list. In November, Tesla shareholders separately approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, the largest corporate pay package in history.\nAgainst this backdrop, even a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a relatively modest addition to Musk’s wealth, likely reinforcing for those at OpenAI their characterization of the lawsuit as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment” rather than a legitimate financial grievance. OpenAI already reportedly sent a letter Thursday to investors and others of its business partners, warning that Musk will make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the company heads to trial in April. The case will be heard in Oakland, Calif., about 15 miles east of San Francisco.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nSequoia Capital is reportedly joining a blockbuster funding round for Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude, according to the Financial Times. It’s a move sure to turn heads in Silicon Valley.\nWhy? Because venture capital firms have historically avoided backing competing companies in the same sector, preferring to place their bets on a single winner. Yet here’s Sequoia, already invested in both OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, now throwing its weight behind Anthropic, too.\nThe timing is particularly surprising given what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said under oath last year. As part of OpenAI’s defense against a high-profile lawsuit by Musk, Altman addressed earlier rumors about restrictions in OpenAI’s 2024 funding round. While he denied that OpenAI investors were broadly prohibited from backing rivals, he did acknowledge that investors with ongoing access to OpenAI’s confidential information were told that access would be terminated “if they made non-passive investments in OpenAI’s competitors.” Altman called this “industry standard” protection (which it is) against misuse of competitively-sensitive information.\nAccording to the FT, Sequoia is joining a funding round led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, which are each contributing $1.5 billion. Anthropic is aiming to raise $25 billion or more at a $350 billion valuation — more than double its $170 billion valuation from just four months ago. The WSJ and Bloomberg had earlier reported the round at $10 billion. Microsoft and Nvidia have committed up to $15 billion combined, with VCs and other investors said to be contributing another $10 billion or more.\nThe Sequoia connection with Altman runs deep. When Altman dropped out of Stanford to start Loopt, Sequoia backed him. He later became a “scout” for Sequoia, introducing the firm to Stripe, which became one of the firm’s most valuable portfolio companies. Sequoia’s new co-leader Alfred Lin and Altman also appear comparatively close. Lin has interviewed Altman numerous times at Sequoia events, and when Altman was briefly ousted from OpenAI in November 2023, Lin publicly said he’d eagerly back Altman’s “next world-changing company.”\nWhile Sequoia’s investment in xAI might seem to have already contradicted the traditional VC approach of picking winners, that bet is widely viewed as less about backing an OpenAI competitor and more about deepening the firm’s extensive ties to Elon Musk. Sequoia invested in X when Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it, is an investor in SpaceX and The Boring Company, and is a major backer of Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company. Former longtime Sequoia leader Michael Moritz was even an early investor in Musk’s X.com, which became part of PayPal.\nSequoia’s apparent reversal on portfolio conflicts is especially glaring given its historical stance. As we reported in 2020, the firm took the extraordinary step of walking away from its investment in payments company Finix after determining the startup competed with Stripe. Sequoia forfeited its $21 million investment, letting Finix keep the money while giving up its board seat, information rights, and shares, marking the first time in the firm’s history it had severed ties with a newly funded company over a conflict of interest. (Sequoia had led Finix’s $35 million Series B round just months earlier.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe reported Anthropic investment comes after dramatic leadership changes at Sequoia, where the firm’s global steward, Roelof Botha, was forced aside in a surprise vote this fall just days after sitting down with this editor at TechCrunch Disrupt, with Lin and Pat Grady — who’d led that Finix deal — taking over.\nAnthropic is reportedly preparing for an IPO that could come as soon as this year.

    "body": "\n\n\n\nWhat happens when an AI agent decides the best way to complete a task is to blackmail you? \nThat’s not a hypothetical. According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user’s inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors. \n“In the agent’s mind, it’s doing the right thing,” Meftah told TechCrunch on last week’s episode of Equity. “It’s trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.”\nMeftah’s example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom’s AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal – make paperclips – to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means “things can go rogue,” per Meftah. \nMisaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic’s portfolio company Witness AI is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance. \nWitness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI’s fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.\n“People are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren’t going rogue, aren’t deleting files, aren’t doing something wrong,” Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeftah sees agent usage growing “exponentially” across the enterprise. To complement that rise – and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks – analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.\n“I do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,” Meftah said. \nAs to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, “AI safety and agentic safety is so huge,” there’s room for many approaches.\nPlenty of enterprises “want a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,” he said.\nCaccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.\n“We purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn’t easily subsume you,” he said. “So it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys.

    "body": "\nThe weather in Las Vegas wasn’t looking good. The plan had been that each employee of YC-backed Bucket Robotics would carry parts of their booth in their luggage to the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. But CEO and founder Matt Puchalski didn’t want to take the chance that one (or all) of their flights would be delayed. So he rented a Hyundai Santa Fe and packed it up. \n“It was… it was tight,” he said with a laugh on the show floor.  \nIt took 12 hours driving in the rain, but the gear – and Puchalski – made it safely to Las Vegas, and so began the young company’s first-ever CES.\nSan Francisco-based Bucket Robotics was just one of thousands of companies exhibiting at the annual tech conference, a speck of sand on a beach full of products and promises. But despite its modest setup in the automotive-focused West Hall, Puchalski said the trip was worth it.\nPart of that was a willingness to be tireless, observant, and always ready to pitch.\nAn engineer by trade, Puchalski spent most of the last decade working on autonomous vehicles at Uber, Argo AI, Ford’s subsidiary Latitude AI, and SoftBank-backed Stack AV.\nAt those jobs, Puchalski developed deep connections in the automotive industry, and we crossed paths all week.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThere he was at an industry networking party one night. On another night, in my hotel lobby at 10 p.m., he was debating how to balance quality and manufacturing yield with Sanjay Dastoor — founder of mobility startups Skip and Boosted, both of which also got off the ground at YC.\nBut I first ran into Puchalski during breakfast at the hotel. Seated at the table next to me, he and sales associate Max Joseph were running through preparations for the conference’s “Media Day” over (allegedly) cage-free eggs.\nPuchalski’s verve piqued my interest, and after making an intro, he told me what Bucket Robotics is up to. Before I knew it, he had cracked open a bright yellow Pelican case and I was holding a small piece of plastic.\nStarted as part of YC’s Spring 2024 batch, Bucket Robotics is all about using advanced vision systems to do quality inspections, specifically for surfaces. The goal is to automate a menial task that Puchalski joked is usually done by “dudes in Wisconsin,” and to accelerate the broad, multi-industry effort to onshore manufacturing. \nOne example Puchalski offered was car door handles. It’s a part customers touch every day, so it needs to be structurally sound, and that kind of quality inspection is basically solved.\nBut it can be challenging to make sure the surface is flawless. Is the color right? Are there any burn or scuff marks? These are the questions Bucket Robotics wants to answer.\n“It’s deeply hard to automate these types of challenges without huge volumes of data, so auto manufacturers just throw dudes in Wisconsin at this problem,” he said. \nBucket Robotics solves that data problem by working from the CAD files for a particular part. It then generates a bunch of simulated defects – burn marks, bumps, breaks – so that its vision software can detect those problems quickly on a production line.\nThere’s no need for manual labeling, and the company claims its models can deploy “in minutes” while also adapting if products or production lines change. One of the big selling points to date is that Bucket Robotics can integrate into existing production lines without adding new hardware, Puchalski said. \nThis has already attracted customers in automotive and in defense, setting up Bucket Robotics to pursue the increasingly popular path of becoming a “dual-use” company.  \nWhen the show floor opened, the first two hours were “intense,” Puchalski said. Attendees in suits snooped around the startup’s tables, plucked orange stickers with the Bucket Robotics logo, and quizzed the employees about their tech.  \nMore importantly, Puchalski said the level of interest stayed consistent throughout the week. He had “real technical discussions” with people from the worlds of manufacturing, robotics, and automation. He said Friday that he’s spent the week since the show on follow-up calls with prospective customers and investors. \nCES can be a slog, but Bucket Robotics survived. Now comes the actual hard part: building a business, scaling, fundraising, and striking commercial deals.  \nAs for the “dudes in Wisconsin,” Puchalski doesn’t see his company as a threat to their livelihoods. Those jobs are just as much about spotting defects as they are about identifying the root cause of the problem, he said.\nAnd besides, Puchalski added, automating surface quality inspection is something that the manufacturing industry has been trying to do for decades.\n“So when we go to our customers, it’s incredibly exciting,” he said. \n",

    "body": "\nA report from market intelligence firm Similarweb suggests that Meta’s Threads is now seeing more daily usage than Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices. While X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.\nSimilarweb’s data shows that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android as of January 7, 2026, after months of growth, while X has 125 million daily active users on mobile devices.\nThis appears to be the result of longer-term trends, rather than a reaction to the recent X controversies, where users were discovered using the platform’s integrated AI, Grok, to create non-consensual nude images of women, including, sometimes minors. Concern around the deepfake images has now prompted California’s attorney general to open an investigation into Grok, following similar investigations by other regions, like the UK, EU, India, Brazil, and many more.\nThe drama on X also led social networking startup Bluesky to see an increase in app installs in recent days.\n\nInstead, Threads’ boost in daily mobile usage may be driven by other factors, including cross-promotions from Meta’s larger social apps like Facebook and Instagram (where Threads is regularly advertised to existing users), its focus on creators, and the rapid rollout of new features. Over the past year, Threads has added features like interest-based communities, better filters, DMs, long-form text, disappearing posts, and has recently been spotted testing games.\nCombined, the daily active user increases suggest that more people are using Threads on mobile as a more regular habit.\nAccording to Meta’s official numbers, the tech giant said in August 2025 that Threads had reached over 400 million monthly active users. The company subsequently reported in October of last year that Threads had 150 million daily active users.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe growth trends have been continuing for many months. Similarweb last summer reported that Threads was closing the gap with X on mobile devices after seeing 127.8% year-over-year growth as of late June 2025. \nRelatedly, Similarweb observed that X is still ahead of Threads in the U.S., but the gap is narrowing. A year ago, X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. as it does now.\nIn addition, Threads has little traction on the web while X maintains a fairly steady web audience with around 150 million daily web visits, according to Similarweb data. As of earlier this week (January 13), X was seeing 145.4 million daily web visits, while Threads saw 8.5 million daily web visits across Threads.com and Threads.net combined.\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAnahita Laverack was set on becoming an aerospace engineer, but her career took a different turn after a realization at an autonomous robotics challenge inspired her to launch Oshen, a company that builds fleets of robots that collect ocean data.\nIn 2021, Laverack, a storied sailor, decided to build and enter a robot in the Microtransat Challenge, a competition where participants build and send autonomous sail-powered micro-robots across the Atlantic Ocean. She, like everyone else that has tried this challenge, was unsuccessful.\n“I realized half the reason that all of these attempts were failing is, number one, obviously it’s hard to make micro-robots survive on the ocean,” Laverack told TechCrunch. “But number two, they don’t have enough data on the ocean to know what the weather is or even know what the ocean conditions are like.”\nLaverack set out for different conferences, like Oceanology International, to find this missing ocean data. She quickly realized that no one had really figured out a good way to collect it yet. Instead, she found people asking if they could pay her to try to collect the data herself. She figured that if people were willing to pay her for this data, she could try to build a way to capture it.\nThose conversations were the basis for Oshen, which Laverack founded alongside Ciaran Dowds, an electrical engineer, in April 2022. \nThe company now builds fleets of autonomous micro-robots, called C-Stars, that can survive in the ocean for 100 days straight and are deployed in swarms to collect ocean data.\nBut Oshen started small. Laverack said she and Dowds chose not to pursue venture capital right away when launching the company. Instead, they combined their savings to buy a 25-foot sailboat, lived at the cheapest marina in the United Kingdom, and used the vessel as their testing platform while getting the company off the ground.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor two years, Oshen would iterate on the bots on shore and immediately take them out on the water to test them.\n“In the summer, that’s not too bad,” Laverack said. “The problem is you really need your boats to work in all seasons. When your robot breaks, [and] it’s a winter storm that’s raging, a 25-foot sailboat shouldn’t really be going out in those conditions. So, that led to some adventure, which I wouldn’t say any more about, but there were certainly some interesting events there.”\nGetting the tech just right was difficult, Laverack said, because it’s not as easy as just taking an existing larger robot and shrinking it down. These bots needed to be mass deployable and cheap despite also needing to be technologically advanced enough to operate and collect data for long periods of time on their own.\nMany other companies have successfully gotten two of the three correct, Laverack said. Oshen’s ability to get all three started to attract customers across defense and government organizations.\nThe company caught the attention of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) two years ago, but Laverack said that their tech just wasn’t ready to be deployed reliably yet. The organization reached back out two months before the 2025 hurricane season after Oshen had successfully deployed the robots into winter storms in the U.K. This time, Oshen jumped at the chance and quickly built and sent over 15 C-Stars.\nFive of these C-Stars were thrown overboard and made their way into position by the U.S. Virgin Islands where NOAA predicted Hurricane Humberto was headed.\nLaverack said they were expecting the bots to just collect data leading up to the storm, but instead, three of the bots were able to weather the entire storm — minus a few missing parts — and collected data the whole time, becoming, she says, the first ocean robot to collect data through a Category 5 hurricane.\nNow, the company has moved to a hub for marine tech companies in Plymouth, England, and has started racking up contracts with customers, including the U.K. government, for both weather and defense operations.\nLaverack said the company plans to raise venture capital soon to keep up with demand.\n",

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration suffered a series of legal setbacks this week after judges allowed work to restart on several offshore wind farms under construction on the East Coast.\nThe Department of the Interior had ordered a stop to five projects totaling 6 gigawatts of generating capacity in December, citing national security concerns. The judicial orders will allow three projects to resume construction: Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off — you guessed it — Virginia.\nThe developers each filed lawsuits shortly after the Trump administration issued the stop work order, which had been effective for 90 days.\nWhen announcing the halt just days before Christmas, the government cited concerns the wind farms would interfere with radar operations. It’s a valid concern, and one the government and project developers grappled with throughout the siting and permitting process. Wind farms can be located to minimize disruption to existing radar facilities, and the radar equipment itself can be upgraded to filter out noise generated by whirling turbine blades.\nPresident Trump himself has made it no secret that he’s not a fan of offshore wind: “I’m not much of a windmill person,” he told oil executives last week.\nIn early hearings, judges weren’t impressed with the government’s line of reasoning. In three separate courtrooms in Virginia and Washington, DC, the Trump administration’s arguments were met with skepticism.\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, pointed out the government failed to address several of plaintiff Equinor’s arguments in its lawsuit. Equinor, which is developing Empire Wind, had alleged the Interior department’s order was “arbitrary and capricious.” “Your brief doesn’t even include the word arbitrary,” Nichols said, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNichols also questioned why the Trump administration was asking for construction to be halted when its main concern regarding national security appeared to be over the operation of the wind farm.\nU.S. District Judge Jamar Walker, who heard Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind developer Dominion Energy’s lawsuit, questioned the government along a similar line. He also said the Interior department’s order was overly broad when viewed in context of the Virginia project.\nTwo projects remain in limbo as their lawsuits work their way through the courts. Ørsted, which is developing Sunrise Wind, has a hearing scheduled for February 2, while Vineyard Wind 1’s developers only filed their lawsuit on Thursday.\nThe East Coast could deliver up to 110 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2050, according to a Department of Energy study published in 2024. That would provide a significant boost to some of the most densely populated cities — and data center regions — in the country. The Northeast currently has some of the highest electricity costs in the nation, while the Mid-Atlantic’s grid operator has recently come under fire for rising electricity prices in its territory. Offshore wind, as one of the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, has the potential to slow or reverse the trend.\nThe potential is even bigger when viewed on a national scale. Offshore wind could generate 13,500 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which is three times more than the U.S. currently consumes.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTikTok has quietly released a new stand-alone short drama app called PineDrama in the U.S. and Brazil. The app offers access to microdramas, which are essentially bite-sized TV shows that can be watched in a series of one-minute episodes. Think TikTok, but every video you come across is a short episode of a fictional story.\nPineDrama is available on iOS and Android. It’s free and currently ad-free, though that could change in the future.\nThe news was first reported by Business Insider. \nYou can find content through the app’s “Discover” tab, where you can sort through “All” or “Trending” dramas, or through endless vertical recommendations that are tailored to your taste. PineDrama features a variety of genres, including thriller, romance, family, and more. Examples of popular shows include “Love at First Bite” and “The Officer Fell for Me.”\nThe app features a “Watch history” section where you can jump back into the various series you’re watching. There’s also a “Favorites” section where you can save the dramas you like the most. You can also share thoughts with other viewers in the comment section and enter a full-screen viewing experience that gets rid of the caption and sidebar.\nImage Credits:TikTok\nThe move comes as TikTok launched a “TikTok Minis” section in its app late last year, where users can watch microdramas. With the launch of PineDrama, TikTok is taking on popular microdrama platforms like ReelShort and DramaBox. While the microdrama industry wasn’t that popular until recent years, it’s racing toward $26 billion in annual revenue by 2030, as reported by Variety.\nShort-form storytelling hasn’t always found success, even with notable backing. In 2020, DreamWorks co-founder and former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg launched a short-form streaming platform called Quibi with $1.75 billion in funding. The platform offered episodes under 10 minutes featuring popular Hollywood actors, but failed to gain traction and was shut down six months later.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nReelShort and DramaBox succeeded where Quibi failed because while Quibi tried to compress Hollywood TV into shorter episodes, ReelShort and DramaBox created low-budget stories that hook viewers within the first few seconds, followed by continuous cliffhangers, all featuring non-union talent. Additionally, they target fans of soapy romance and revenge thriller stories, while Quibi tried to target everyone.\nTikTok is now looking to replicate this success with PineDrama. The company already dominates the short-form social media space and is now aiming to take on another media category.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nEarlier this week, the California attorney general’s office announced that it was investigating xAI over reports that the startup’s chatbot, Grok, was being used to create nonconsensual sexual imagery of women and minors. On Friday, the government followed up by sending a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding that it take immediate action to stop the production of nonconsensual intimate images and CSAM — child sexual abuse material.\n“Today, I sent xAI a cease-and-desist letter, demanding the company immediately stop the creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual, intimate images and child sexual abuse material,” said California AG Rob Bonta in a press release. “The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to immediately comply. California has zero tolerance for [CSAM].”\nThe AG’s office additionally claimed that xAI appeared to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual nudes, the likes of which are being “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” The agency said it expects xAI to prove that it is taking steps to address these issues within the next five days. \nAt the heart of the backlash is Grok’s “spicy” mode feature, which xAI created to generate explicit content. The issue has spread beyond California; Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, and Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform altogether. Despite xAI instituting some restrictions on its image-editing features late Wednesday, the California AG’s office moved ahead with its cease-and-desist letter.\nX’s safety account has previously denounced this kind of user activity, saying: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” TechCrunch reached out to xAI for comment and was met with an automated email that says “Legacy Media Lies.” TC also reached out to the California AG’s office for more context.\nThe advent of free generative AI tools has led to a disturbing swell of non-consensual sexual material. Many platforms have been grappling with this problem, not just X. The sordid activity has drawn the attention not just of state leaders but also of Congress. Indeed, on Thursday, lawmakers sent a letter to the executives of several companies — including X, Reddit, Snap, TikTok, Alphabet, and Meta — asking how they planned to stem the proliferation of sexualized deepfakes.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nRunpod, an AI app hosting platform that launched four years ago, has hit a $120 million annual revenue run rate, founders Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh tell TechCrunch.  \nTheir startup journey is a wild example of how if you build it well and the timing is lucky, they will definitely come.\nThe story includes bootstrapping their way to over $1 million in revenue; landing a $20 million seed round after VC Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, saw some Reddit posts; and gaining another key angel investor, Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond, because he was using the product and reached out over the support chat, the founders tell TechCrunch. \nIt all began in late 2021 when the two friends, who worked together as corporate developers for Comcast, decided the hobby they were doing wasn’t fun anymore. \nThey had built setups of specialized computers used to generate Ethereum in their respective New Jersey basements. While they did successfully mine a bit of the cryptocurrency, it wasn’t enough to pay back their investment, they said. Plus, mining was going to end after the much-ballyhooed network upgrade called “The Merge.” \nOn top of that, it was “boring” after a couple of months, Lu said. \nBut they had talked their wives into letting them spend a good $50,000 on the hobby between them, they estimated. Lu and Singh knew that home harmony depended on finding a way to use those GPUs. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe devs had been engaged in machine learning projects at work, so they opted to convert their mining rigs into AI servers. This was before ChatGPT, even before DALL-E 2. \nAs they repurposed the rigs, “We were seeing how really god-awful the software stack was for dealing with these GPUs,” Lu said. As developers, they found a problem they wanted to solve.  \nRunpod was born “because we felt that the actual experience of developing software on top of GPUs was just hot garbage,” Lu described. \nA few months later in early 2022, they were ready to share what they had built. Runpod is a platform for hosting AI apps, emphasizing speed, easily configured hardware (including a serverless option that automates configuration), and dev tools like APIs, command-line interfaces, and other integrations.  \nBack in 2021, they only had a few such integrations (like support for popular web app tool Jupyter notebooks). The next problem: finding beta testers. \n“As first-time founders, we didn’t really know how to market or how to do anything,” Lu recalled. “So I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.” \nSo, they posted in a couple of AI-oriented subreddits. The offer was simple: free access to their AI servers in exchange for feedback. It worked. They landed beta customers, which led to paying customers. Within nine months, they had quit their jobs and hit $1 million in revenue, they said. \nBootstrapping growth\nBut that led to another problem. “Six months in, business users were like, ‘Hey, I want to actually run real business stuff on your platform. But I cannot run it on servers that are in people’s basements,” Lu said. \nIt had not occurred to the New Jersey founders to raise capital from VCs. Instead they formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to grow capacity. But it was stressful. The founders needed to stay three steps ahead. \n“If we don’t have the GPUs, the market sentiment, the user sentiment changes. Because when they don’t see capacity from you, they go somewhere else,” Singh described. \nMeanwhile, their user base was growing on Reddit and Discord, especially after ChatGPT launched.\nVCs were also on the prowl for investments. Malik saw them on Reddit and reached out, their first VC call. But Lu didn’t know how to pitch to an investor. “Radhika was super helpful, even at the first conversation,” he said. She basically explained to him how a VC thinks and told him she’d stay in touch.  \nMeanwhile, Lu had a business to run that had to pay for itself. “It was almost two years where we really didn’t have any funding,” he said. So Runpod never offered a free tier. It had to at least pay for itself, even if it wasn’t throwing off much profit. Unlike other AI cloud services that began as crypto miners, these founders refused to take on debt, they said. \nBy May 2024, with AI app fever spreading, their lucky decision to launch AI hosting for devs two years earlier was paying off. Their business had grown to 100,000 developers, and they landed a $20 million seed deal co-led by the VC arms of both Dell and Intel, with participation from big names like Nat Friedman and Chaumond.  \nThey haven’t raised more money since but are now planning to, armed with a business that, they believe, should command a healthy Series A. \nToday, Runpod counts 500,000 developers as customers, ranging from individuals to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multimillion-dollar annual spend, the founders said. \nTheir cloud spans 31 regions globally and counts customers like Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow as users.\nCompetition is also fierce. Devs have all the major clouds to choose from (AWS, Microsoft, Google), plus plenty of industry-specific choices like CoreWeave and Core Scientific. \nBut they also see their place in the world a bit differently — as a dev-centric platform. They don’t see coding ever going away but changing. Programmers will become AI agent creators and operators. \n“Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu said.  \n",

    "body": "\nIf you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.\nTake Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.\nDavid Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.\nBut that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.\nNow, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.\nBut the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and one of Peter Thiel’s firms leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about this new office was seemingly meant to send a message.)\nEven Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”\nThe proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine. Previously the Silicon Valley Editor of TechCrunch, she was named Editor in Chief and General Manager of TechCrunch in September 2023. She’s also the founder of StrictlyVC, a daily e-newsletter and lecture series acquired by Yahoo in August 2023 and now operated as a sub brand of TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Connie by emailing connie@strictlyvc.com or connie@techcrunch.com, or via encrypted message at ConnieLoizos.53 on Signal.\r\n\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nPrivate equity firm Everstone Capital is bringing together India’s Wingify — a company that helps businesses test different versions of their websites to improve sales and customer engagement — and France’s AB Tasty to build an over $100 million a digital experience optimization company with more than $100 million in annual revenue, just a year after it bought a controlling stake in Wingify for $200 million.\nThe combined business will serve more than 4,000 customers globally and generate more than $100 million in annual revenue, with about 90% coming from the U.S. and Europe and teams spanning North America, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, the companies said on Tuesday. Wingify co-founder Sparsh Gupta will lead the merged entity as CEO, while Everstone will remain the largest institutional shareholder.\nThe deal comes as digital experience tools, including those for A/B testing and personalization, are increasingly consolidating, as enterprises look to deploy AI across marketing, product and growth teams without stitching together multiple vendors. The merged company will invest more heavily in AI-led capabilities over time, while keeping customer experience unchanged in the near term and expanding the depth of its platform gradually, Gupta said in an interview.\nEverstone is injecting significant additional capital as part of the transaction, Gupta told TechCrunch, describing it as primarily aimed at “cleaning up” AB Tasty’s cap table and enabling the two businesses to come together under one platform. Financial terms were not disclosed, though Gupta indicated the deal includes a cash component alongside some equity rollover for existing leadership, allowing them to maintain ownership stakes in the new entity.\nGupta framed the tie-up as a natural convergence between two long-time rivals. “Both the businesses have been operating as friendly competition,” he said, adding that the merger reflects growing demand from enterprises for more integrated, holistic digital experience platforms.\nThe combined entity will be led by an executive team drawn from both organizations. Alongside Gupta as CEO, Wingify co-founder Ankit Jain will serve as Chief Product and Technology Officer, while AB Tasty’s co-founders will take on senior roles: Rémi Aubert will become Chief Customer and Strategy Officer and Alix de Sagazan will serve as Chief Revenue Officer, the companies said.\nRémi Aubert, Sandeep Singh, Alix de Sagazan, Sparsh Gupta, and Ankit Jain (Left to Right)Image Credits:Wingify\nBoth Wingify and AB Tasty are profitable, Gupta said, and the merger is focused on building out the combined platform rather than cost-cutting. “There’s no layoffs that are planned as part of this merger,” he added, describing the rationale as “value creation at this point in time.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe combined company will have close to 800 employees across 11 offices globally, with roughly 350 staff based outside India, Gupta said, adding that the merged entity will be headquartered in New Delhi.\nCo-founded in 2010 by Paras Chopra and Gupta, Wingify remained bootstrapped for more than a decade, with VWO becoming its flagship product, helping businesses improve online conversion rates through A/B testing and customer experience optimization. Everstone acquired a majority stake in the startup in January 2025, which also marked a significant exit for Chopra, as TechCrunch reported earlier. That deal set the stage for Everstone’s platform-building strategy that has now led to the AB Tasty combination.\nWingify counts more than 3,000 brands as customers, including Forbes, Walt Disney, Amway, Hilton Vacations, TAP Portugal, and Cigna, across sectors such as e-commerce, SaaS, travel and media.\nFounded in 2014 and headquartered in Paris, AB Tasty provides experimentation and personalization software used by more than 1,000 brands, including L’Oréal and Samsonite.\nThe combined company will compete in the same category as players such as Optimizely and Adobe, giving Singapore-headquartered Everstone and Wingify a larger footprint in Europe while deepening the merged platform’s product suite across testing, feature delivery, and AI-led personalization, subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.\nThe deal adds to a growing wave of consolidation in marketing and product software, as private equity firms and strategic buyers look to assemble scaled, AI-ready platforms serving global enterprise customers. A recent PitchBook report shows enterprise SaaS M&A surged to 270 deals in Q3 worth $65 billion, with deal volumes up 26.2% quarter-over-quarter, and private equity accounting for 66.7% of deals. More broadly, PwC last year flagged [PDF] consolidation as a key value-creation strategy for private equity firms, and EY highlighted sustained private equity-led momentum in tech M&A in 2024 as buyers pursue platform scale and AI capabilities.\nGupta told TechCrunch that Everstone will retain majority control of the combined business and hold majority board rights following the transaction. The board will have five to six seats in total, including representation from Everstone and Gupta, alongside three to four independent directors, he added.\nEverstone said it will back the combined company with additional support, including an advisory board of industry experts and operators. “Together, VWO and AB Tasty will have among the most comprehensive product offerings in the category,” said Sandeep Singh, managing director at Everstone Capital.\n",

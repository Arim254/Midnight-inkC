The app first launched as a way to expand Reels-viewing beyond mobile, and now users can also browse posts from their Instagram feeds directly on their TVs.\nBy bringing reels to TVs, Instagram is looking to better compete with YouTube, which largely dominates the TV space. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. Rival TikTok also has a TV app. \nThe new app is personalized to each user, as it shows reels based on the content and creators they enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels are organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle.\nReels play automatically, which means you won’t have to keep scrolling to watch the next video. The Instagram for TV app lets you like, view comments, and re-share reels. \nUsers can pair the app with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home. Or, they can choose to create a new account just for TV viewing. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Apps\n\n",

Investors buying the shares include Thrive Capital, Coatue, Andreessen Horowitz, and Stripe itself.\nIn February 2025, Stripe announced its previous tender offer, which valued the company at $91.5 billion. So that’s about a 74% increase in valuation over the year. The annual announcement isn’t by chance. Stripe has timed this news with its annual letter from founders Patrick and John Collison that showcases its year of product releases, and some insights into global usage of its products for a year.\nFor instance, Stripe says that stablecoin payments’ volume doubled worldwide to around $400 billion in 2025, 60% of which it estimates comes from B2B payments. That growth is one reason Stripe has invested heavily in crypto foundations recently, acquiring crypto wallet service Privy in July, and unveiling its own blockchain for payments, Tempo, in September. As for Bridge, the stablecoin orchestration platform that Stripe acquired last year, it saw its volume more than quadruple, the company says.\nCorrection: This story originally stated that the global stablecoin volume was on Stripe’s network and has now been corrected.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Fintech\n\n",

The company said that a new agent being introduced in Opal will allow users to create mini apps that can let them plan and execute tasks using text prompts.\nThe feature uses the Gemini 3 Flash model and automatically chooses tools to execute tasks. For instance, it can use Google Sheets to maintain memory across sessions, such as a shopping list for an e-commerce-related app. The new agent creates and plans the next step for the tasks on its own.\nImage Credits: Google\nGoogle said these agents are natively interactive, which means that if they need more information, they would ask users to enter it or offer them choices to determine next steps, if needed. With this addition, users without technical knowledge could build complex workflows within their apps, the company claims.\nThe vibe-cooling tool Opal was first introduced for U.S. users in July 2025. The tool lets anyone create mini web apps or remix existing apps. In October 2025, the company rolled out Opal to users in 15 more countries, including Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and Singapore. And in December, Google added the tool to the Gemini web app, allowing users to create custom apps through a visual editor without writing any code.\nBeyond Google, many other startups are also building tools that let users build apps via natural language prompts. Lovable and Replit are among the more popular ones, but other startups like former Replika founder’s Wabi, Softbank and Lightspeed-backed Emergent, and Accel-backed Rocket.new are also gaining prominence.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAI has brought the startup world the rise of a new phenomenon: startups that almost instantly hit multimillion ARR (annual recurring revenue).\nStories abound of founders going from zero to $10 million, or as much as $100 million, in annual recurring revenue in a matter of months.\nTo be fair, this, alone, isn’t a harbinger of long-term success. VCs say that durable growth is far more important than ultra-speedy growth. Investors want to back companies where the rate at which customers cancel or stop paying is low, meaning customers are happy. They want that annual or monthly recurring revenue to stick around and grow, not wobble and crash.\nEven so, the phenomenon is real. As part of Stripe’s annual report, released on Tuesday, the payments giant revealed that it had more new businesses start using its products in 2025 than ever before, with more than half — specifically 57% — outside the United States. This 2025 cohort grew 50% faster than those who started using Stripe products in 2024, it said. While Stripe did not reveal the hard numbers, it did say that 2025 saw double the number of these fledging startups hit $10 million in ARR within three months compared to the number that did so in 2024.\nThe letter also noted that Stripe Atlas —  the company’s business incorporation tool  — saw a 41% increase in company formations last year. Of those new startups, 20% charged their first customer within 30 days, up from just 8% in 2020, further underscoring how quickly this new generation of founders is moving.\nIn comparison, in 2024, founders were still publicly celebrating hitting $10 million in ARR in three years — which is still, by most business standards, a metric worth boasting about.\nSo for all of those on the social media saying things like “Bootstrapping to $10M ARR is easier and less risky than creating a VC-backed unicorn, ” or things like, “the AI-native startups hitting $10M ARR with just three people are rewriting the entire playbook,” well, now there’s a smattering of data to back that up.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSpotify and Liquid Death have teamed up to launch what might be the wildest product collaboration of the year: the Eternal Playlist Urn, a wireless Bluetooth speaker shaped like a cremation urn. Yes, you read that right.\nThe Eternal Playlist Urn is not really meant to hold ashes, but is instead a collector’s item, with only 150 available for purchase in the U.S. For $495, buyers receive a 7-inch-by-11.4-inch urn with a Bluetooth speaker built into the lid. (We question the audio quality, since all the tech is crammed into the lid of this tiny urn.)\nAccording to Spotify, the urn offers “the world’s first ever music-streaming urn,” making death “a lot less boring.” With this product, the idea is that even the dearly departed can keep jamming to their favorite tunes for eternity, or at least that’s the company’s joke.\n“Life needs music. So does the afterlife. That’s why Spotify has partnered with Liquid Death to create the Eternal Playlist Urn, the world’s first wireless speaker designed to bring your music somewhere it’s never been before,” Spotify stated in a blog post. \nWhen you get the urn, you can create your own Eternal Playlist on Spotify by answering questions like “What’s your eternal vibe?” or “What’s your go-to ghost noise?” Spotify will then use your answers and listening history to generate a custom playlist, which syncs directly to the urn’s speaker and can be shared with friends and family.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nWhile Spotify hasn’t released a branded smart speaker, it partnered with Ikea in 2022 on a portable Bluetooth lamp speaker with Spotify Tap functionality, making this the company’s second hardware collaboration with another brand. The company also released “Car Thing,” an in-car entertainment device, which was later discontinued.\nThis isn’t the first time Liquid Death has pushed the limits of extreme marketing. The brand is known for its outrageous campaigns, including a life-sized Yeti Casket-shaped cooler. While some may find the humor a little morbid, fans of dark, irreverent comedy seem to be intrigued by it. The cooler had over 800 bidders and sold for $68,200.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhether you view this as a clever stunt, a funny gag, a tasteless joke, or simply absurd, the Eternal Playlist Urn is a testament to how far brands will go to capture our attention.\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nMeta plans to purchase potentially up to $100 billion worth of AMD chips, enough to drive roughly six gigawatts of data center power demand, the companies announced Tuesday.\nAs part of the multiyear agreement, AMD has issued Meta a performance-based warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock — or about 10% of the company — for $0.01 each, structured to vest alongside certain milestones. The full stock award is conditional on AMD’s share price, which would need to hit $600 for Meta to receive its final tranche, per The Wall Street Journal. AMD’s stock closed at $196.60 on Monday.\nUnder the agreement, Meta will purchase AMD’s MI540 series of GPUs and its latest generation of CPUs. CPUs are increasingly becoming a core pillar of the AI inference compute stack because they’re efficient, easier to scale, and don’t tie companies solely to Nvidia. \n“The CPU market is absolutely on fire,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said Tuesday morning during an investor briefing. “There is significant demand. It has continued to grow, and it really is a result of the AI infrastructure deployments as inferencing scales, as agentic AI scales, and our portfolio is in an extremely good position.”\nAMD has been slowly gaining ground as AI firms look to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, which has been the longstanding leader in AI chips and has charged a premium for the title. Last October, AMD and OpenAI struck a similar deal trading equity for an agreement to buy chips. \nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the firm’s partnership with AMD is “an important step” as it diversifies its compute and works toward “personal superintelligence.” Zuckerberg has defined personal superintelligence as AI systems designed to deeply understand and empower individuals in their everyday lives.\nMeta has pledged to invest at least $600 billion in U.S. data centers and AI infrastructure over the next several years, including a projected capital expenditure spend of $135 billion in 2026. Meta recently unveiled plans for a $10 billion gas-powered data center campus in Indiana designed for 1 gigawatt of compute capacity.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe AMD partnership comes a couple of weeks after Meta struck a multiyear deal to expand its data centers with millions of Nvidia’s latest CPUs and GPUs. The Facebook-maker is also working on its own in-house chips but has reportedly hit delays.\nThis article has been updated with more information from AMD CEO Lisa Su. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nTwitch announced on Tuesday that it’s revamping its suspensions policy to shift away from its previous all-or-nothing penalty system. Until now, a temporary suspension on Twitch meant losing access to the platform altogether, including the ability to chat, watch streams while logged in, and access basic information. Now, the company is implementing two suspension types: streaming suspensions and chatting suspensions.\nThe company notes that while its previous approach was easier to implement, its new targeted enforcement system means that the restrictions will match the specific offense committed. \nIf a user violates Twitch’s Community Guidelines during a livestream, their account will be suspended from going live, and chat on their channel will be temporarily disabled. During a streaming suspension, the user can still watch streams while logged in, chat on other channels, and access their user dashboard. Plus, viewers will still be able to watch their existing clips and videos.\nSimilarly, if someone violates the company’s Community Guidelines in chat, they will receive a suspension from chat but will still be able to stream their own content or watch other streamers. Notably, users who receive a chat suspension can still chat in their own channel, but they will be prevented from participating in chats on other streams.\n“Higher severity violations present a greater risk to our community, therefore they will receive both chatting and streaming suspensions simultaneously to prevent further harm,” Twitch explained in a blog post. “And, as is the case today, those who commit the most serious violations will receive an indefinite suspension and lose all access to Twitch. There is no place for serious violations on Twitch.”\nTwitch isn’t changing the length of temporary suspensions, as streaming and chatting suspensions will last anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days.\nThe company says that with each new violation, the length of the suspension will increase, and that accumulating multiple temporary suspensions can still lead to an indefinite suspension from Twitch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTwitch determines the severity of a violation by considering the extent of harm it causes or has the potential to cause. It defines harm as any action that leads to physical, emotional, social, or financial damage to a user or to Twitch.\nThe company is working on additional suspension types that will roll out in future updates.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nYouTube is expanding its more affordable, $7.99 per month Premium Lite subscription service with new features, including the ability to download videos for offline access and watch videos in the background, even if the screen is off or you’re using other apps. These options were previously only available to customers on its full plan, which costs $13.99 per month. \nThe company said the additions were the result of user feedback, as customers in its pilot program shared that they wanted these specific features to make the subscription more attractive. \nLaunched last March, YouTube Premium Lite introduced a more modestly priced subscription tier that would remove ads from “most” videos on the platform, including those across popular verticals like gaming, fashion, beauty, cooking, news, and more. However, ads would continue to be shown on music content and music videos. Plus, customers on the Lite plan won’t have access to the ad-free YouTube Music app.\nWith the arrival of these new features, ad-free music content will now be the only reason to upgrade to the full Premium subscription. It will also likely make the Lite tier more attractive to customers who didn’t want to pay just for ad-free content but wanted other upgrades as well.\nThe Lite subscription tier was first introduced in Thailand, Germany, and Australia, before coming to the U.S. last year. It’s now available across a number of other global markets, including Canada, Brazil, the U.K., India, Mexico, and other parts of Europe and Asia.\nYouTube’s subscription business has been steadily growing. Combined with ads, YouTube’s overall revenue reached $60 billion in 2025, according to information shared by parent company Alphabet earlier this month during Q4 earnings.\nThe company also reported that YouTube’s ad revenue increased 9% to $11.38 billion in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the “subscriptions, platforms and devices” group’s revenue increased 17% to $13.6 billion in Q4, which the company attributed to strong growth in YouTube subscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and YouTube Premium.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlphabet reported more than 125 million YouTube Music and YouTube Premium users worldwide in March 2025. The company didn’t share an updated metric during its Q4 earnings earlier this month but said that it now has more than 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services, including YouTube Premium and others, like Google One.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nOura announced on Tuesday that it’s launching its first proprietary AI model to enable its AI chatbot, Oura Advisor, to deliver personalized insights around women’s health. The company says the model supports questions spanning the full reproductive health spectrum, from early menstrual cycles through menopause. \nThe new model is rolling out in Oura Labs, the company’s opt-in experimental feature hub within the Oura app.\nOura says the new model draws on established medical standards, research, and knowledge sources reviewed by its in-house team of board-certified clinicians and women’s health experts. It also integrates biometric signals and long-term trends to deliver personalized guidance.\nAs people are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for health guidance, from cycle changes to perimenopause symptoms, Oura says there is a need for models designed specifically for women. \nImage Credits:Oura\n“This custom model is a fundamental shift in how we responsibly deploy AI in health to meet the needs of our members,” said Ricky Bloomfield, MD, chief medical officer at Oura, in a press release. “Women’s health is too complex—and too often overlooked—to rely on one-size-fits-all systems. By designing a model specifically for women and grounding it in trusted clinical science and real-world biometric data, we’re setting the standard for how responsible intelligence should be built and expanded across more areas of health, pairing rigorous science with the lived, longitudinal data that makes Oura uniquely powerful.”\nThe launch of the new women’s health AI model comes as Oura Chief Commercial Officer Dorothy Kilroy told TechCrunch last October that the company’s fastest-growing user segment isn’t gym rats, it’s women in their early twenties.\nWhen a user asks Oura Advisor a women’s health question, the chatbot prompts the new model to reference its research and knowledge sources while also analyzing the user’s relevant biometric signals across sleep, activity, cycle, and pregnancy data, as well as stress and more.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe new model is intentionally designed to be non-dismissive, reassuring, and emotionally supportive, the company notes. However, it’s not designed to be a doctor, as users shouldn’t use the chatbot for a diagnosis or treatment plan. \nOura says the model is hosted entirely on Oura-controlled infrastructure, and that conversations are never shared or sold. \nUsers who want to access the new model can opt into Oura Labs by navigating to the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Oura app.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday, Anthropic unveiled its new enterprise agents program, its most aggressive push yet to integrate agentic AI into everyday workplaces. \nIn an official briefing, Anthropic’s head of Americas, Kate Jensen, told reporters that the new system would finally deliver on the promise of agentic AI. “2025 was meant to be the year agents transformed the enterprise, but the hype turned out to be mostly premature,” Jensen said. “It wasn’t a failure of effort. It was a failure of approach.”\nUnder the new program, companies can use the plug-in system to deploy pre-built agents to help with common enterprise tasks, including financial research and engineering specifications. The result is a major opportunity to grow Anthropic’s enterprise client base — and a significant threat to SaaS products currently performing those functions. \n“We believe that the future of work means everybody having their own custom agent,” Anthropic product officer Matt Piccolella told TechCrunch.\nMuch of the enterprise agents program draws on previously announced technology, particularly Claude Cowork and the plug-in system, which was announced in research preview on January 30th. The systems launched today are largely focused on making those tools easier to deploy within a company, including private software marketplaces, controlled data flows, and customized plug-ins. The result is a system for deploying Claude-powered agents with the same controls a corporate IT department would expect when deploying software.\n“Admins want to be able to have really, really, really tailored workflows and skills for their specific organization,” Piccolella said. “And this allows the admin of a Claude Cowork organization to be able to do this in a very centralized way.”\nThe stock plug-ins included at launch take aim at particular departments present within most companies, including agents designed for finance, legal, and HR departments. Each plug-in includes basic skills common across different companies, although Anthropic expects that companies will modify each plug-in to bring it in line with unique needs and customs.\nIn the case of finance, the stock plug-in gives Claude the basic information and data flows necessary to perform market and competitive research, financial modeling, and other common tasks for finance teams. The HR plug-in includes skills for generating job descriptions, onboarding materials, and offer letters, among others.\nThe launch also includes a number of new enterprise connectors, including integrations for Gmail, DocuSign, and Clay, among others. Previously unavailable, these connectors will allow agents to pull in data and context directly from the linked system. \n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nFintech giant Marquis is suing its firewall provider SonicWall, claiming that an earlier breach allowed hackers to steal sensitive information about customer firewalls that led to a ransomware attack on Marquis’ network.\nThe lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, seeks a jury trial. It claims the 2025 breach at SonicWall “exposed critical security information for Marquis and every customer that used SonicWall’s firewall cloud backup service.”\nMarquis’ chief executive Satin Mirchandani told TechCrunch in a statement that SonicWall allegedly failed to secure its backup service, which caused the company to suffer “significant reputational, operational, and financial harm.”\nNews of the lawsuit comes weeks after TechCrunch reported that Marquis was planning to seek compensation from SonicWall. The Plano, Texas-based fintech giant had told its customers that it blamed SonicWall for allowing hackers to steal sensitive information about customer firewall configuration files, including its own.\n“SonicWall allowed a threat actor to obtain the keys to bypass that line of defense and walk right into Marquis’s internal network, the very thing that SonicWall’s firewall was supposed to prevent,” reads the complaint.\nFirewalls are meant to prevent unauthorized access to a company’s network, but Marquis alleges that the hackers who scrambled its network with ransomware used information stolen from SonicWall about how its customers configure their firewalls, including emergency passcodes (known as scratch codes) that allowed access to Marquis’ internal network.\nMarquis, which allows hundreds of banks and credit unions to visualize their customers’ data, said the hackers took “personally identifiable information concerning customers of some of Marquis’s financial institution clients” in its cyberattack.\nThe stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, including bank account, debit, and credit card numbers, as well as customers’ Social Security numbers.\nA spokesperson for SonicWall did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.\nSonicWall first admitted a breach of its systems in mid-September, in which it said fewer than 5% of its customer firewall configuration backup files were exfiltrated from its storage servers, hosted on Amazon’s cloud and maintained by SonicWall. The firewall maker in October conceded that in fact every customer had their firewall backup files stolen in the breach.\nMarquis in December 2025 began notifying affected people that its networks had been breached that August. SonicWall has not said when hackers were first able to gain access to its systems. \nIt’s not yet clear what caused the breach at SonicWall. In its complaint, Marquis claims SonicWall made a code change to one of its APIs months earlier, in February 2025, that “created a vulnerability exploitable by threat actors.” Marquis said that this bug allowed the hackers to access customer firewall configuration backup files “without proper authentication” by guessing predictable firewall serial numbers.\n“While we were able to secure our network and client data quickly, our investigation revealed that our exposure to threat actors was due to SonicWall’s network breach and failure to notify us that our firewall protection was potentially compromised,” Mirchandani, said in a statement shared with TechCrunch.\nMirchandani told TechCrunch that SonicWall has not yet provided any non-public information about the root cause of its breach. \n“We hope to learn more through the litigation process,” Mirchandani said.\nMarquis still will not say how many individuals are affected by its data breach. According to a listing with the Texas’ attorney general, at least 400,000 people across the U.S. are known to be affected by the fintech giant’s breach. \nThe number of affected individuals is anticipated to rise as more data breach notifications are filed with various U.S. attorneys general.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe spillover from a ransomware attack on one of the largest government contractors in the United States keeps getting bigger: More than 25 million people have now had personal data stolen in the hack.\nConduent provides printing, mailroom services, and document and payment processing services for state government benefit operations, such as food assistance, as well as workplace and unemployment benefits for large corporations. As such, the company handles a large amount of personal information belonging to a large swath of the United States. Conduent says its technology and operational support services reach more than 100 million people.\nBut since the January 2025 cyberattack, which a ransomware group claimed credit for, the corporate giant has said little about the data breach, such as how it was caused and how many people are affected.\nAn update to the state of Wisconsin’s data breach notification page now shows the Conduent breach affects at least 25 million people across the United States.\nTechCrunch’s ongoing tally from various data breach notification letters that we have seen also amounts to about 25 million people, with Oregon (10.5 million) and Texas (15.4 million) accounting for the majority of those affected. Other data breach notices seen by TechCrunch include another few hundred thousand individuals across Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Washington.\nThe breach is known to have compromised individuals’ names, dates of birth, addresses, Social Security numbers, health insurance information, and medical data.\nConduent has said little outside of its data breach notifications, and in some cases has made it more difficult for affected individuals to learn about the breach.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nA page on Conduent’s website, titled “Incident Notice” that was published in October 2025 at the same time as its first data breach notification, does not explicitly mention a cybersecurity incident. The page contains a hidden “noindex” tag in its source code, which tells search engines to not list the page in search results, making it difficult for anyone searching the web to find it.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, Conduent spokesperson Sean Collins would not say how many notifications the company has sent to date, or why the company is hiding its incident notice from search engines.\nConduent’s breach has been billed as one of the “largest ever,” but likely trails behind the Change Healthcare hack, which affected more than 190 million people following a ransomware attack in February 2024. A Russian-speaking ransomware gang stole reams of health and medical data from Change Healthcare using a stolen credential that wasn’t protected with multi-factor authentication, prompting the healthcare tech giant to pay at least two ransoms to keep most of the stolen data off the internet.\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nCompanies are increasingly launching software to build and monitor AI agents in an effort to get enterprises to adopt AI. New Relic is no different. As the data observability company launches an AI agent platform of its own, it knows it isn’t the only game in town.\nNew Relic on Tuesday unveiled a no-code agentic platform that lets enterprises put together data observability AI agents that monitor a company’s data to catch bugs and issues before they disrupt products. Called New Relic Agentic Platform, it lets companies deploy prebuilt agents and manage existing bots as well.\nIt also supports the model context protocol (MCP), which connects AI applications to external data sources and integrates with other New Relic tools.\nNew Relic isn’t looking to be the only platform that companies use to manage and deploy all of their AI agents, Brian Emerson, the startup’s new chief product officer, told TechCrunch. Instead, the aim is to offer clients the same agent-building capabilities they are getting elsewhere for observability as well.\n“We’re not building this as general purpose,” Emerson said. “We’re building it for outcomes that we care about inside observability. It’s also a world that allows us to work with the rest of the ecosystem or tools that exist out there, but bring it back into the context of problems we’re trying to solve around our personas and the observability domain.”\nSoftware that lets users manage AI agents has proliferated in recent months as companies look to figure out how to quell enterprises’ fears about giving AI agents access to their data and software.\nSalesforce was arguably the first to release an agent platform in late 2024, calling it Agentforce. OpenAI launched its own version of the technology, OpenAI Frontier, earlier this year. Research organization Gartner has called such agent platforms “necessary infrastructure” and a critical component of getting enterprises to adopt AI.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSticking with the theme of increasing enterprise tech adoption, New Relic also revealed new tools focused on OpenTelemetry (OTel), an open source observability framework.\nThe company said its application performance monitoring (APM) agents are now equipped with OTel capabilities, letting enterprises manage OTel data streams alongside their other data sources in one place. This is aimed at solving a previous fragmentation problem that was holding up mass enterprise adoption of the OTel framework.\n“Just send your OTel data to us,” Nic Benders, chief technology strategist at New Relic, said. “What we’ve discovered in this process is that it’s kind of a burden for a lot of teams out there in the world to run all of the OTel [data] collectors. So having an OTel like fleet management is something that’s very important.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

It uses Google DeepMind’s Lyria 3 music-generation model, which can turn text and even image inputs into audio outputs.\nGoogle announced last week that its Lyria 3 capabilities would be introduced into the flagship Gemini app, but ProducerAI makes it possible for users to communicate with the AI model more like it’s a “collaboration partner,” to use the words of Elias Roman, Google Labs’ senior director of Product Management.\n“ProducerAI has allowed me to create in new ways,” Roman wrote in the blog post. “I’ve experimented with new genre blends, expressed how I feel with personalized birthday songs for my loved ones, and made custom workout soundtracks for myself and friends.”\n\n\n\nGoogle also shared that three-time Grammy-winning rapper Wyclef Jean used the Lyria 3 model and Google’s Music AI Sandbox on his recent song “Back From Abu Dhabi.”\n“This is not just a machine where you’re clicking a button a hundred times, and then you’re done. It’s a careful kind of curation where you’re going through and saying, ‘Oh, I think that’s something we can use,’” said Jeff Chang, director of Product Management at Google DeepMind, in a video the company put out.\nJean recalls wanting to know what a flute would sound like in a track he already recorded, and being able to use Google’s tools to quickly add a flute sound to the mix. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“What I want everybody to understand […] is you’re in the era where the human has to be the most creative,” Jean said in the video. “There’s one thing that you have over the AI: a soul. And there’s one thing that AI has over you: the infinite information.”\nAI in the music industry\nSome musicians have ardently opposed the use of AI tools in the music-making process, since it’s almost a given that a generative AI tool was trained on copyrighted data from artists without their consent. Hundreds of musicians, including stars like Billie Eilish, Katy Perry, and Jon Bon Jovi, signed an open letter in 2024 calling on tech companies not to undermine human creativity with AI music-generation tools.\nA cohort of music publishers also recently sued the AI company Anthropic for $3 billion, claiming that the company illegally downloaded more than 20,000 copyrighted songs, including sheet music, song lyrics, and musical compositions. (Anthropic was already ordered by the court to offer a $1.5 billion settlement to authors whose books were pirated for AI training.)\nOther artists, however, have embraced the potential of this technology as a way to improve audio quality, rather than as a creative aid.\nPaul McCartney used AI-powered noise reduction systems — the kind of technology that allows Zoom or FaceTime to block out unwanted background noises on your video calls — to clean up a decades-old, low-quality John Lennon demo. The resulting “new” Beatles track, “Now and Then,” won a Grammy in 2025.\nMeanwhile, AI music-generation tools like Suno have created synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\nThe law remains unclear on the legality of using copyrighted works as training data — one federal judge, William Alsup, ruled last year that training on copyrighted data is legal, but pirating it is not. \n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nPlug-in hybrid vehicles are often touted as a bridge to battery-electric vehicles, promising to slash emissions by operating as EVs for short trips while relying on fossil fuels for longer ones. \nThey only deliver on that promise if they’re regularly charged. Real-world data drawn from the vehicles’ onboard computers shows that’s often not the case.\nUsing that data, the Fraunhofer Institute could determine how much of that energy came from charging when plugged in. It found that less than a third of 1 million PHEVs in Germany plugged in either occasionally or not at all.\nU.S. automakers that are pushing future PHEV models as appealing alternatives for American drivers should take note. By blending gas with electricity, these automakers hope to boost fleet-wide efficiency without a wide rollout of EVs.\n“We’re looking to make CO2 reductions across our lineup, but we’re doing it in a very efficient way,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said this month in an earnings call.\nYet the new study shows that PHEVs seldom deliver on their efficiency promises.\nAt best, Toyota drivers used electricity for 44% of the energy used for driving, suggesting they plugged in the most frequently. The worst? Porsche drivers, at just 0.8%, an average of 7 kilowatt-hours over two years. In other words, the average Porsche PHEV driver charged their battery less than 50% of its capacity — once.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStudies have previously shown that PHEVs produce about 3.5 times more emissions than their official ratings would suggest. This new study explains why since it directly assesses how much electricity the vehicles gained from charging. (PHEVs, like all hybrids, can operate in a mixed mode, using both gas and electricity. The study used data straight off the vehicles to disentangle the two.)\nOne of PHEV’s many shortcomings are their anemic batteries, capable of powering the vehicle for short distances. Some can only traverse a handful of miles, while many sold in recent years can operate on battery power for about 20 to 30 miles. Regulators in Europe and automakers have been proposing longer ranges for future models, hoping that a more capable battery will encourage people to charge their batteries more frequently.\nThat’s not guaranteed, though. The vehicles are likely to remain compromised when driving on electrons. That’s because most PHEVs are based on fossil fuel platforms — the electric motors and power electronics aren’t capable of delivering 100% of the vehicle’s power needs. When a driver floors it, the gas engine has to kick in. In other vehicles, the engine turns on in cold weather to heat the cabin. When that happens, “why bother plugging in” is apparently a question most PHEV drivers have asked themselves.\nWhich raises another question: Why bother with PHEVs at all?\nPHEVs have been touted as a way to ease cautious consumers into full EVs. The argument goes something like this: Drivers will become habituated with plugging in while EV charging networks are built out. By the time they’re ready for their next vehicle, the networks will be ready and customers can ease into an EV.\nBut if nobody is plugging in their PHEVs, they’re definitely not developing the habit. Without full charges, the electric drivetrain isn’t benefiting anyone. The public still suffers from worse air pollution, and drivers are carting around hundreds of pounds of weight and enduring more recalls and costlier service visits as a result of the complex drivetrain. \nTweaking the PHEV formula to make them more reliant on batteries could help. The interim solution is called an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), and it’s designed to run on battery power until the charge is depleted, at which point the fossil fuel engine recharges it. So far, no EREV has required the owner to plug in — they could easily drive the vehicle for its lifetime on gas. BMW used to make an EREV in the i3, but it stopped production years ago. Ford and Stellantis have both announced EREV pickup trucks, which have yet to go on sale.\nMeanwhile, EV charging networks continue to expand. It’s possible that by the time automakers are making PHEVs and EREVs in large quantities, drivers will no longer need a comfort blanket in the form of a gas engine. (My household came to that conclusion two years ago. After a decade split between a BMW i3 EREV and a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid PHEV, we traded up for a Kia EV9.)\nLegacy automakers, which have second-guessed their electrification strategies more times than I care to count, could be forced to change tack once more.\nPHEVs might have been a nifty solution on paper, but they’ve failed to deliver in the real world. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

While ad sales improved under former CEO Linda Yaccarino, its 2025 revenues were still lower than they were prior to Musk’s acquisition. \nAccording to eMarketer’s forecast last May, X’s ad business was expected to start revitalizing sometime last year, which Bloomberg confirmed, but would remain half the size it was before the sale.\nX says the new aspect ratios now being supported include 4:5 (1440 x 1800 pixels) and 2:3 (1080 × 1620 pixels). The company already supports other formats, including 1:1 (1080 × 1080 pixels), 16:9 (1920 × 1080 pixels), 9:16 (1080 × 1920 pixels), and 1.91:1 (2064 × 1080 pixels).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’re committed to empowering advertisers to hit their performance goals with greater ease and impact,” said Monique Pintarelli, head of global advertising at xAI, in a statement. (xAI acquired X last year.) \n“With full aspect ratio support, brands can now repurpose creatives directly on X—eliminating reformatting, duplication, or compromise—while unlocking faster testing, brand consistency, and incremental reach among our highly engaged, real-time audience for superior results,” she added.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Social\n\n",

The move comes a week after the design company struck a similar partnership with Anthropic to integrate Claude Code.\nThis integration lets users start working with a design in Figma or code in Codex, and move between the two platforms easily using Figma’s MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.\nPreviously, users could bring details from Figma design files, Figma Make, or FigJam into Codex for code-based implementation.\n“With this integration, teams can build on their best ideas—not just their first idea—by combining the best of code with the creativity, collaboration, and craft that comes with Figma’s infinite canvas,” Loredana Crisan, Figma’s chief design officer, said.\n\nLoading the player…\n\n“The integration makes Codex powerful for a much broader range of builders and businesses because it doesn’t assume you’re ‘a designer’ or ‘an engineer’ first. Engineers can iterate visually without leaving their flow, and designers can work closer to real implementation without becoming full-time coders,” Codex product lead Alexander Embiricos said in a statement.\nOpenAI first launched Codex as a command-line coding assistant last year to compete with Anthropic’s much lauded Claude Code. Later, the company built the coding tool into ChatGPT, and earlier this month launched a dedicated MacOS app for Codex. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe MacOS app was downloaded a million times within the first week of release.

    "body": "\nWalmart has agreed to pay $100 million to settle a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over deceptive pay practices within its Spark Driver service, which uses gig workers to deliver online orders from local stores to customers. The retailer was accused of misleading drivers about their potential base pay and tip amounts, and then deceived customers by saying that 100% of tips went to the drivers, when they did not.\nIn its original complaint, the FTC was joined by Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit alleged that Walmart, since 2021, had made false representations about Spark driver earnings. \nAmong these, Walmart was accused of frequently splitting a customer’s order between drivers, which would lead to splitting the tip. Meanwhile, customers were told their driver — as in one single driver — would get the full tip. In batch orders, Walmart would remove tips from some of the orders without informing the driver. Walmart also promised tips to drivers in advance of taking orders, but then failed to collect a tip from the customer, leaving the driver without a tip entirely.\nOther issues had to do with reductions Walmart made to drivers’ base pay after they had accepted an offer or other misrepresented incentives that could have provided drivers with extra cash. \nWalmart also told customers that drivers would get 100% of their tips, but that wasn’t always true. \nThe lawsuit alleged that these practices caused drivers to lose millions of dollars they were promised and generated thousands of consumer complaints. \nAs a result of the settlement, Walmart will have to implement an earnings verification program to ensure drivers are paid the promised earnings and tips. It’s also prohibited from adjusting the base pay, incentives, or tips after the initial offer, except if the driver fails to provide the service or a customer cancels. Walmart has been banned from misrepresenting earnings in future driver offers, as well.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Labor markets cannot function efficiently without truthful and non-misleading information about earnings and other material terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement about the settlement agreement. “Today’s settlement reflects the Trump-Vance FTC’s focus on ensuring a healthy labor market for American workers, which is critical to the nation’s success.”\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nEinride has secured an oversubscribed $113 million PIPE (private investment in public equity) ahead of its public debut that’s expected for the first half of 2026. \nThe Swedish startup is most well-known for building both electric trucks and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight with no room for a human driver. Einride announced its plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Legato Merger Corp., last November. \nThe deal values Einride at a pre-money valuation of $1.35 billion — down from the $1.8 billion figure initially attached to the SPAC deal. Despite a drop in valuation, there’s still clearly investor appetite for the firm. The PIPE exceeded the company’s earlier target of up to $100 million. \nEinride’s PIPE comes from new and existing investors, including a global asset management company based on the West Coast of the United States, and Stockholm-based EQT Ventures.\nIn total, Einride has secured around $213 million tied to this transaction, including $100 million previously announced crossover financing. \nThe SPAC, which will see Einride trading on the New York Stock Exchange, had been expected to deliver roughly $220 million from Legato’s trust account. With the addition of the $113 million PIPE, the companies now project total gross proceeds of about $333 million before redemptions and expenses. Though they say they may seek additional capital before closing. \nThe proceeds will support Einride’s technology roadmap, global expansion, and autonomous deployments in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. \nOutside of Sweden, Einride operates a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE for companies like Heineken, PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has also done limited deployments of its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers including Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the U.S. \nEinride is not the first autonomous vehicle company to have pursued a SPAC merger in recent years for additional funding. Aurora Innovation went public via a SPAC merger valued at $13 billion in 2021 and has since launched a commercial self-driving trucks operation (with a human observer on board). Kodiak AI also took the SPAC road to the public market in 2025.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nBumble announced on Thursday that it’s adding a series of AI-driven features intended to help turn matches into lasting connections, including those that offer feedback and guidance on users’ bios, photos, and prompts.\nThe dating app’s new AI-suggested profile guidance tool will roll out globally and give “personalized, actionable feedback” on users’ bios and prompts. For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”\nAccording to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend ten years ago, but it’s still new information to many users. \nIn Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”\nOf course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.\n“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”\nBumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”\nTinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool called Chemistry, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches. \nMeta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature that asks to use its AI on your camera roll that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.\nAs these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking more real-world experiences that are not intermediated by an app.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8:03 AM PST · February 26, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nCisco says hackers have been exploiting a bug in one of its popular networking products used by large enterprises for at least three years, prompting the U.S. government and its allies to urge organizations to take action.\nThe bug, which has a maximum-rated vulnerability severity score of 10.0, allows hackers to remotely break into networks running its Catalyst SD-WAN products, which allow large companies and government agencies with multiple offices to connect their private networks over long distances.\nBy exploiting this bug over the internet, hackers can gain the highest level of permissions to these devices and maintain persistent hidden access inside a victim’s network, allowing them to spy or steal data over a long period of time.\nCisco said after discovering the bug, its researchers traced evidence of exploitation as far back as 2023. Some of the affected organizations are said to be critical infrastructure. The company did not provide specifics, but “critical infrastructure” can refer to everything from power grids and water supply to the transportation sector.\nSeveral governments, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, warned in an alert that threat actors are targeting organizations “globally.”\nU.S. cybersecurity agency CISA ordered all civilian federal agencies to patch their systems by end-of-day Friday, citing an imminent threat and unacceptable risk to the federal government. The federal cybersecurity agency, which is currently running at reduced capacity due to a partial government shutdown, said it was aware of ongoing exploitation.\nNeither Cisco nor the governments attributed the attacks to a specific threat group or nation state, if known, but tracked one cluster of activity as UAT-8616.\nIn December, Cisco warned of a similarly rated 10.0 vulnerability in the Async software that runs most of its products, which was being actively used to hack into its customer networks.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFor all their potential, AI agents have been slow to make an impact in the enterprise, and one new startup is betting that the reason they haven’t is a lack of context. \nLaunched as part of Y Combinator’s 2025 summer cohort, Trace is a workflow orchestration startup aimed at filling that gap. The company maps complex corporate environments and processes so that agents have the context they need to scale quickly.\n“OpenAI and Anthropic are building these brilliant interns that can be leveraged within the company,” says Trace CEO Tim Cherkasov, referring to the AI labs’ tools. “We’re building the manager that knows where to put them.”\nOn Thursday, the London-based company said it had raised $3 million in seed funding from Y Combinator, Zeno Ventures, Transpose Platform Management, Goodwater Capital, Formosa Capital, and WeFunder. Angel investors Benjamin Bryant and Kevin Moore also invested.\nTrace’s system starts by building a knowledge graph from a company’s existing tools — systems like email, Slack, and Airtable that shape the day-to-day working life of the firm. With that context in place, users can prompt the system with a high-level task — like “We need to design a new microsite” or “Lets develop our 2027 sales plan” — and Trace will come back with a step-by-step workflow, delegating some tasks to AI agents and assigning others to human workers. When the system does invoke an AI agent, it will prompt it with the specific data needed to complete its sub-task. \nThe idea is to automate away the delicate work of on-boarding AI agents, one of the biggest blockers for actual deployment within companies.\nWith so many companies focused on agentic AI, Trace will have plenty of competition. Earlier this week, Anthropic launched its own take on enterprise agents, focused on pre-built plugins for specific departmental functions. And many of the workplace productivity services Trace will be drawing from, like Atlassian’s Jira, are launching their own agents, which will potentially compete with the startup’s system. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBut Trace’s founders believe their knowledge-graph approach will be the key to success, as they can build context engineering deep into the structure of agentic deployment.\n“2024 and 2025 was still about prompt engineering. Now we’ve moved from prompt engineering to context engineering,” says CTO Artur Romanov. “Whoever provides the best context at the right time is going to be the infrastructure on top of which the AI-first companies will be built. And we hope to be that infrastructure.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nInstagram will start alerting parents if their teen repeatedly tries to search for terms related to suicide or self-harm within a short period of time, the company announced on Thursday. The alerts are launching in the coming weeks to parents who are enrolled in parental supervision on Instagram. \nThe Meta-owned social platform says that while it already blocks users from searching for suicide and self-harm content, these new alerts are designed to make sure parents are aware if their teen is repeatedly trying to search for this content so that they can support their teen.\nSearches that may trigger an alert include phrases encouraging suicide or self-harm, phrases indicating a teen might be at risk of harming themselves, and terms such as “suicide” or “self-harm.” \nInstagram says parents will receive the alert via email, text, or WhatsApp, depending on the contact information they’ve provided, along with an in-app notification. The notification will include resources designed to help parents approach conversations with their teen.\nImage Credits:Instagram\nThe move comes as Meta and other big tech companies are currently facing several lawsuits looking to hold social media giants accountable for harming teens. \nDuring testimony for a lawsuit taking place in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California this week, Instagram head Adam Mosseri was grilled by prosecutors in an ongoing social media addiction case over the app’s delayed rollout of basic safety features, including a nudity filter for private messages to teens.\nAdditionally, during testimony in a separate lawsuit before the Los Angeles County Superior Court, it was revealed that an internal research study at Meta found that parental supervision and controls had little impact on kids’ compulsive use of social media. The study also found that children who faced stressful life events were more likely to struggle with regulating their social media use appropriately.\nGiven the ongoing lawsuits accusing the company of failing to protect teens on its platforms, the timing of these new alerts isn’t exactly surprising.\nThe company notes that it will aim to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, as overuse could reduce their overall effectiveness.\n“In working to strike this important balance, we analyzed Instagram search behavior and consulted with experts from our Suicide and Self-Harm Advisory Group,” Instagram explained in a blog post. “We chose a threshold that requires a few searches within a short period of time, while still erring on the side of caution. While that means we may sometimes notify parents when there may not be a real cause for concern, we feel — and experts agree — that this is the right starting point, and we’ll continue to monitor and listen to feedback to make sure we’re in the right place.”\nThe alerts are rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada next week, and will become available in other regions later this year.\nIn the future, Instagram plans to launch these notifications when a teen tries to engage the app’s AI in conversations about suicide or self-harm. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

It looked great on paper but didn’t really work in real life,” Lucena said.  \nShe had learned firsthand that hiring is typically based on markers of success like college degrees, previous work experience, and a gut instinct. But she knew there had to be a better way. So she developed Mappa and spent years creating a proprietary dataset based on hundreds of interviews that allowed her team to analyze behavior based on biomarkers indicated through people’s speech patterns. Through this process, the Mappa team found that to make the right hire the first time, a candidate can’t just be great on paper; they also have to be compatible.  \n“There’s no trait that’s good or bad inherently; it’s more of what environment do you put that person in, and what roles are better aligned with people’s sort of tendencies and styles. So that’s how we’ve been thinking about defining compatibility,” Lucena said in the podcast interview. \nMappa is powered by an all Latinx team that knows how frustrating it is to be overlooked based on superficial biases or a lack of the “correct” experiences. She describes them as underdogs that understand this problem on a personal level.  \n“We are all underdogs. We are all folks that have been overlooked in some degree. And I guess that makes it even more important that we are the ones building this,” Lucena said. “Having people like us building this technology, at the level we are doing, with the quality we are able to get to the market and serving our clients the way we do. It also opens up a door for others to come and join and know that there are multiple ways still to build technology.” \nLucena’s best advice for early-stage founders who are hiring is to take your time and be sure the compatibility is there from the beginning to avoid the hassle of hiring, firing, and rehiring for the same role.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIsabelle Johannessen is our host.

The new model, which is technically Gemini 3.1 Flash Image, can create more realistic images than its predecessor. The model will also now become the default in the Gemini app for its Fast, Thinking, and Pro modes.\nThe company first released Nano Banana in August 2025, prompting people to generate millions of images in the Gemini app, especially in countries like India. In November, the company released Nano Banana Pro, which allows users to create more detailed and high-quality images.\nThe new Nano Banana 2 retains some of the high-fidelity characteristics of the Pro model but produces images faster. The company says you can create images with a resolution ranging from 512px to 4K, in different aspect ratios.\nImage Credits: Google\nNano Banana 2 can maintain character consistency for up to five characters and fidelity of up to 14 objects in one workflow for better storytelling. Users can also issue complex requests with detailed nuances for image generation, Google says. In addition, users can create media with more vibrant lighting, richer textures, and sharper detail.\nImage Credits: Google\nWith the launch, Nano Banana 2 will become the default model for image generation across all apps in the Gemini app. The company is also making it the default model for image generation in its video editing tool, Flow. \nIn Search, Nano Banana 2 will become the default for Google Search results via Google Lens and in AI Mode across 141 countries on the Google app and on the web across desktop and mobile.\nOn Google’s higher-end plans, Google AI Pro and Ultra, subscribers can continue use Nano Banana Pro for specialized tasks by regenerating images via the three-dot menu.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits: Google\nFor developers, Nano Banana 2 will be available in preview through the Gemini API, Gemini CLI, and the Vertex API. It will also be available through AI Studio and the company’s development tool Antigravity, which was released last November. \nThe company said that all images created through the new model will have a SynthID watermark, which is Google’s mark to denote AI-generated images. The images are also interoperable with C2PA Content Credentials, created by an industry body consisting of companies like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Meta. Google said that since launching the synthID verification in the Gemini app in November, people have used it over 20 million times. \n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nFor years now, when we think of mobile gaming, we think of app stores. Developers invest countless hours, months, or even years creating games just to surrender a significant portion—up to 30%—of their earnings to major players like Apple and Google. However, a newcomer has entered the scene, aiming to revolutionize this model.\nMeet Jest, a marketplace for messaging games that recently emerged from stealth with $7 million in seed funding. Jest believes that the future of mobile gaming distribution won’t come from an app store, but rather from within the messaging app. \nJest’s launch coincides with the rise of Rich Communication Services (RCS), an enhanced version of SMS that enables more engaging experiences through rich media, interactive features, and embedded payments.With RCS adoption growing, the landscape is shifting. In 2024, Apple joined the RCS movement with iOS 18, and by May 2025, RCS was supporting over a billion messages daily in the U.S., according to Google.\n“Mobile game developers have largely been locked into app store distribution as the primary way to reach players,” Deyan Vitanov, CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “RCS games live in the messaging inbox, the stickiest surface on mobile, where people are already spending huge amounts of time talking to friends and family. We’re building on an interaction pattern people already use every day.”\nImage Credits:Jest\nJest offers users the ability to send games directly in their chat threads, without having to visit an app store. (Games launch in the web browser and require Wi-Fi to play.) \nThis convenience is particularly impactful as consumers are downloading fewer games. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year decline following a 6.6% drop from 2023 to 2024, according to Appfigures’ annual report.\nJest’s strategy is proving effective. By the end of January, just four months into its beta phase, the platform had already achieved two significant milestones: more than 1 million messaging games played and over 300,000 messages exchanged. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’re seeing 3-4 times better retention than traditional mobile apps. That’s a fundamental shift in the engagement curve. On the user acquisition front, we’ve completely validated that people will sign up and play games through messaging, with our early partners reporting 30-60% lower acquisition costs compared to mobile apps. It’s remarkably simple. Just tap on a link, and you’re in,” Vitanov shared with us. \nImage Credits:Jest\nAdditionally, what’s most appealing about Jest’s marketplace is the revenue model for developers: an impressive 90/10 split, with 90% of earnings going directly to them. This stands in contrast to the typical 30% commission taken by traditional app stores, offering a promising new avenue for gaming studios.\n“There’s also a clever network effect built in. If one studio acquires a user but another studio monetizes them, we split the economics: 70% to the monetizing studio, 20% to the acquiring studio, and 10% to Jest. This creates powerful incentives where even viral games that don’t monetize well can generate revenue streams for their developers when those users play other games on the platform,” Vitanov added. \nNotably, Jest has already attracted interest from several development partners, including teams behind popular titles such as “Episode,” “Puppy Mansion,” and “Kingdom Maker.” \nThe seed funding, led by Innovation Endeavors, will go toward scaling the platform and onboarding the first group of gaming studios. \nTo further accelerate growth, Jest has also launched a dedicated Games Fund to support studios at every stage of franchise development on the platform.  This fund will deploy capital across three tiers: $1 million for flagship titles, $200,000 for promising mid-stage titles, and $40,000 for exploratory projects and experimental concepts.\nCurrently, Jest is live in the U.S. and is set to expand to 14 additional countries by the third quarter of 2026.\n",

    "body": "\nSalesforce pulled out all the stops to convince investors that the AI revolution won’t be its death when it announced fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\nSalesforce reported a solid quarter of $10.7 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year. For the year, it reported $41.5 billion in revenue, up 10% over the previous year, with both results boosted by its $8 billion acquisition of data management company Informatica last May.\nNet income landed at $7.46 billion, and the company offered strong guidance for the year ahead, projecting revenue of $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion — a 10% to 11% increase. It also said its “remaining performance obligation,” or RPO, is over $72 billion. That’s a figure that shows revenue under contact that has not yet been delivered or recognized as earned revenue.\nThe numbers, though, could only do so much. Software-as-a-service stocks, with Salesforce as their poster child, have been getting hammered lately. Investors fear the rise of AI agents will undermine these companies, making their per-employee-seat business models obsolete. The situation has been dubbed the “SaaSpocalypse.”\nThe concept hung so heavily in the air during the earnings call that CEO Marc Benioff mentioned the term at least six times.\n“You’ve heard about the SaaSpocalypse? And it isn’t our first. We’ve had a few of them,” he said, later adding, “If there is a SaaSpocalypse, it may be eaten by the Sasquatch because there are a lot of companies using a lot of SaaS because it just got better with agents.”\nIn an attempt to convince the world of its continued health, Salesforce threw everything and the kitchen sink into this earnings report. The company increased its dividend by nearly 6% to $0.44 per share. It launched a new $50 billion share buyback program. That’s always a favorite with shareholders because it both creates a sturdy buyer of shares and reduces the number of shares in circulation (which can boost the stock price).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company also revamped the earnings call itself. It was part podcast, part infomercial, and part normal Q&A with a few questions from Wall Street analysts.\nInstead of running through the numbers, Benioff interviewed three Salesforce customers on camera to testify to their love of its new agentic options: the CEO of home appliance company SharkNinja; the CEO of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts; and, just to hammer the point, the CEO of SaaStr, the software industry conference and media company. We’ll truncate the interviews to the shortest summary: They all love Salesforce’s AI agent products.\nSalesforce also introduced a new metric for its agentic products: agentic work units (“AWU”). The idea here is that instead of simply counting “tokens” — the standard unit of AI processing volume — AWU attempts to measure something more meaningful: whether an agent actually completed a task. (Salesforce logged 19 trillion tokens last quarter, which sounds like a lot but really is not in the AI world.)\n“You can ask it a question and it can write you a poem, but that’s not really all that valuable in the enterprise world,” Salesforce president and CMO Patrick Stokes said on the call. So AWU is intended to measure when the agent writes to a record or does some other verifiable piece of work.\nOn top of that, Salesforce also presented its own architectural vision of the coming world of agents. It shows SaaS software like itself owning most of the tech stack, with the AI model makers on the bottom as unseen, interchangeable, and commoditized work engines.\nThis was a direct counter to one of the causes of a SaaSpocalypse sell-off earlier this month, after OpenAI released its enterprise agent, Frontier. OpenAI’s architectural vision shows OpenAI owning most of the stack, with systems-of-record SaaS providers (the databases and business-software platforms where companies store their core data) on the bottom as the unseen engines.\nAnd if all that wasn’t enough to influence investors: Benioff was dressed in a black leather jacket, echoing the signature look of the CEO clearly crushing it in the AI world: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.\n",

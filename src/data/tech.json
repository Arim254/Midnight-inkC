Major platforms — including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva — announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players.\n“Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday.\nOpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s OpenAI Developer platform, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added. \nThis is a big step for OpenAI toward expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\nApple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Artur Widak/NurPhoto / Getty Images\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4:56 PM PST · December 18, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nTikTok has reached a deal to cede a substantial portion of its U.S. operation to a group of American investors, thus ending a years-long tussle in which the federal government has sought to force the platform to do just that.\nThe new partnership is described as a “new TikTok U.S. joint venture” in an internal memo from ByteDance CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by TechCrunch. \nThat arrangement will see major American investors take over significant control of the U.S.-based business. The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.”\nThat new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. “A trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,” the document says. \nThe closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was originally reported by Axios.\nMuch of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in an executive order signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC previously reported that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, except to say that it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.\nThe U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok’s U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing national security concerns as the rationale.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s “free delivery” claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.\nThe agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.\nAdditionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.\nInstacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.\n“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,” said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.\nInstacart acknowledged the settlement in a blog post and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe settlement comes as Instacart is currently under fire over a recent study that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores. Instacart responded to the controversy by stating that retailers determine their own prices, and any pricing tests conducted through its AI tool are random and not influenced by user data. Reuters reported on Wednesday the FTC has begun an investigation into the delivery platform’s AI pricing tool.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nDXS International, a U.K.-based company that provides healthcare tech for England’s National Health Service (NHS), disclosed a cyberattack in a statement on Thursday.\nIn a filing with the London Stock Exchange, the company said it experienced a “a security incident affecting its office servers,” discovered on December 14. The company said it “immediately” contained the breach working together with the NHS, and hired a cybersecurity firm to investigate “the nature and extent of the incident.”\n“There was minimal impact on the company’s services and the company’s front-line clinical services remain unaffected and operational,” read the filing.\nAt this point, the specific nature of the breach is not known, nor whether any patients’ medical information was stolen. \nHowever, earlier this week, a ransomware group called DevMan took credit for the breach. In a post on its dark web site, which TechCrunch has seen, the hackers listed the company on December 14 and claimed to have stolen 300 gigabytes of data from the company.\nDXS said it also notified law enforcement and regulators, including the UK’s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office, or ICO, about the cyberattack.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about the breach at DXS International? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nDXS chief operating officer Steven Bauer did not respond to a series of questions. Instead, Bauer sent TechCrunch a statement echoing the public filing. \nRashana Sweidan Vigerstaff, a spokesperson for the ICO, told TechCrunch that the ICO is assessing the information provided by DXS, while also not responding to several questions.   \nNHS England spokesperson Katie Baldwin told TechCrunch that the health service is “not aware of any patient services being impacted.”\nOn its website, DXS says it provides software that helps to reduce costs for doctors and primary care physicians. As such, the company’s software touches patient records and data. The company also says that in some cases, its solutions are hosted on the NHS’ Health and Social Care Network (HSCN), which is a system for healthcare organizations across the U.K. to access and share information. \nGenerally speaking, the NHS does not store patient’s medical data in a centralized system.\nUpdated with responses from DXS and the ICO.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSwedish vibe-coding startup Lovable has more than tripled its valuation in just five months.\nStockholm-based Lovable on Thursday said it had raised $330 million in a Series B funding round that was led by CapitalG and Menlo Ventures, at a $6.6 billion valuation. Khosla Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and Databricks Ventures also participated, as did other investors.\nThis raise comes mere months after Lovable raised a $200 million Series A round that valued the company at $1.8 billion in July.\nOne of the quickest to capitalize on the AI boom, Lovable has built a “vibe-coding” tool that lets people use text prompts to write code and build complete apps. The company launched in 2024, and has grown blazing fast: It reached the vaunted $100 million ARR milestone within eight months, and just four months later, doubled that to surpass $200 million in annual recurring revenue.\nThe company counts major software names like Klarna, Uber, and Zendesk as customers, and claims that more than 100,000 new projects are built on its platform every day, and more than 25 million projects were created in its first year.\nLovable said it would use the new funding for building deeper integrations with third-party apps, expanding its features for enterprise use-cases, and to flesh out its platform with the infrastructure needed — like databases, payments, and hosting — to build full-fledged applications and services.\nLovable co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said onstage at this year’s Slush conference in Helsinki, Finland that he credits the company’s ability to scale to his decision to ignore calls from investors to relocate the company to Silicon Valley.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said onstage at the November conference. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘Look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country.’ There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”\nIn November, the company was called out for not paying VAT, a tax that applies to most goods and services in the European Union (EU). Osika confirmed that this was true in a LinkedIn post, saying that the company would remedy the situation, and shut down comments saying taxes like this are why the EU isn’t a good home for high-growth startups.\nVibe coding continues to be a hot area of investing for VCs. Cursor, another vibe-coding darling, raised $2.3 billion in November at a $29.3 billion valuation. Like Lovable, this was also the company’s second funding round of the year, seeing its valuation double between June and November.\nTechCrunch reached out to Lovable for any additional information.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nAmazon is adding a new feature to Alexa+ that adds a conversational AI to Ring doorbells, letting users manage deliveries, turn down sales folks, and let family or friends leave a message when they are not around.\nCalled Greetings, the feature helps Ring determine who is visiting your house based on their apparel, actions, and what they are holding, and responds accordingly. For example, if the system sees a person in a delivery uniform dropping off a package, it will respond based on your instructions. \nThe feature adds settings that let you specify where delivery people can leave packages, and direct them toward water or snacks you might have kept out. If a delivery person needs a signature, Alexa can also ask them when they might return, and pass that message to the user.\nIt can also handle sales reps or service vendors. You can set an instruction such as “If someone comes to the door trying to sell something, politely let them know we’re not interested.” \nAnd if you’re busy or not home, Alexa can greet friends or family when they visit, and ask them to leave a message for you.\nIt goes without saying that the tech presents the risk of misidentifying people and responding inappropriately — if, for example, a friend works in logistics and comes to see you after work in their delivery uniform, Ring may, via Alexa, ask them to leave a package somewhere instead of letting them leave a message.\nThe new feature follows a controversial facial recognition feature for Ring called “Familiar Faces” that lets you create a catalog of the faces of up to 50 people who visit you regularly. Once labeled, these people will be named in the Ring app’s timeline and notifications when they visit. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAmazon says Greetings uses Ring’s video descriptions to determine who the main subject in front of the camera is for generating responses, and it doesn’t identify who the person is.\nThe feature is compatible with Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd Gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd Gen) and is available to users on the Ring Premium Plan who have enabled video descriptions.

    "body": "\nAs online platforms grapple with how to establish trust at a global scale and address growing concerns about authenticity, the adoption of profile verification on LinkedIn is picking up pace in 2025. India is emerging as the fastest-growing market for profile verification, highlighting the country’s expanding influence on how digital work networks operate.\nLinkedIn members are adding around 30 million verifications to their profiles each year, with adoption up more than 38% year-over-year in 2025, according to Oscar Rodriguez, LinkedIn’s vice president of trust products. The increase follows the company’s announcement last week that more than 100 million users have added at least one verification.\nIn 2022, LinkedIn began rolling out profile verification to provide clearer signals of authenticity on the platform. It initially focused on confirming members’ workplace or identity, including through company email addresses, before expanding to government-issued ID checks, and has since been extended to company pages and job listings.\nMost LinkedIn members who have added a verification to their profile have done so by confirming their association with a workplace, typically using a company email address or similar credentials, rather than verifying their personal identity.\nAbout 60% of verified members have confirmed a workplace affiliation, typically using a company email address, while roughly 27% have verified their identity using a government-issued ID, Rodriguez said.\nThe pace of India growth\nGeographically, the U.S. accounts for the largest share of verified users, representing about 40% of the more than 100 million members who have added at least one verification, the company said. India follows closely, alongside other major markets, including the U.K., Canada, Brazil, and France.\nWhile the U.S. continues to account for the largest overall share of verified users, India has emerged as LinkedIn’s fastest-growing market for profile verification, Rodriguez said, with adoption rising about 80% over the past 12 months.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIndia is already one of LinkedIn’s largest and fastest-growing user markets globally, with more than 160 million users, and the pace of verification adoption there is unfolding alongside broader growth in professional networking, hiring, and remote work on the platform. This underscores how shifts in India’s workforce are increasingly shaping LinkedIn’s global usage patterns.\nAs verification adoption has grown, LinkedIn has also begun extending those signals beyond its own platform. \nEarlier this year, the Microsoft-owned company launched its “Verified on LinkedIn” program, allowing partner platforms to display LinkedIn verification badges. Zoom is the most recent partner for this move, joining companies such as Adobe and G2. The company also recently introduced a self-serve API to make it easier for other organizations to integrate verification into their own services.\nLinkedIn says profile verification is associated with higher engagement on the platform, with verified members seeing up to 60% more profile views and around 50% more interaction on their posts compared with unverified users. Verified company pages also tend to attract more attention, recording significantly higher views and follower growth, the company stated.\n“Verifications provide a powerful signal of authenticity on LinkedIn, helping to support authenticity and trust,” said Rodriguez. “Members with verifications are far more likely to represent real people, and jobs with verifications of the page, and hirer maintain significantly higher integrity and safety standards.”\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMultiple reports suggest that live sports viewing has declined for certain sports, especially among Gen Z. To solve this, leagues and broadcasters are trying to make sports more engaging for fans with different kinds of viewing experiences, stats, and analysis.\nOne way to do this is using volumetric video generation that lets users view the play from various angles, giving an inside-the-video-game experience. The core technology uses numerous cameras to capture the footage in 3D for everyone to look at it from various viewpoints. Canada-based Peripheral Labs wants to make this technology affordable for leagues and teams so it can reach more broadcasters and fans.\nPeripheral Labs was founded by Kelvin Cui and Mustafa Khan in 2024. Both have worked on driverless cars for the University of Toronto’s team, winning several trophies. Khan has worked as a researcher at Huawei, and Cui has experience working on chassis systems as a software engineer at Tesla.\n“Both Mustafa and I are huge sports fans. He has been a massive Arsenal fan, and I grew up watching the Vancouver Canucks since I was seven. When Mustafa showed me his research about 3D reconstruction, my brain said it would be cool to watch hockey like this [in a free-flowing, multi-angle way]. This is how we started on Peripheral Labs,” Cui said in a call with TechCrunch. \n\n\n\nThe company said the idea of volumetric generation isn’t new. But with the new AI models and advances in computer vision, its founders are confident the technology is ready for the masses.\nThe duo is using their experience with self-driving cars to apply concepts of robotics perception and 3D vision for the 3D reconstruction of video in sports. This system can reduce the camera requirement from over 100 to as few as 32, helping decrease cost and operational overhead, according to Cui and Khan. The startup aims to keep the hardware cost as minimal as possible for teams and broadcasters and sign multi-year contracts for its platform.\nThe software platform will bring biomechanical data of players and stats for teams and leagues using its own sensor stack, which is similar to the sensors on self-driving cars that capture the scene with depth. It will enable new ways to control the viewing of the play for broadcasters and fans using photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology. For instance, if fans wanted to track only the player with the ball, they could do that. They can also freeze a moment in-game to see different angles for a foul or a critical moment in play.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“While we work with off-the-shelf cameras, the way we package it with our experience in robotics and ML is what gives us an edge both in terms of platforms and also scaling from small practice enclosures to big soccer and football stadiums,” Cui said.\nOn the software side, the platform said it can observe different joints, including finger movements of players, to measure flexion. For instance, in the video above of two people playing football (soccer), the system measures flexion of knees and ankles. This could give coaches more ideas about body positioning and the flexibility of a player, and help them improve.\nThe startup has raised a $3.6 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Daybreak Capital, Entrepreneurs First, and Transpose Platform.\nJoe Ros, a partner at Entrepreneurs First, noted the fund was surprised by how big a following the founders and their autonomous driving team have at the University of Toronto. He noted investors are often hesitant to invest in sports-related startups, but Peripheral Labs is also an entertainment play.\n“Their ultimate viewer is the consumer, and their demand for sports content is evergreen, not cyclical. With Peripheral, the new standard for that consumption will be immersive, volumetric video. And the work they’re doing now in sports will give them the data, tech, and deployment moat to be the only person in the market able to enable this,” he told TechCrunch over email.\nPeripheral Labs said the startup was selective about the VCs they were bringing in, who could help in different areas like product development and go-to-market advice. The company has 10 engineers on its staff and aims to increase headcount with a focus on platform and hardware development to reduce costs for the company, decrease the latency of the system, and also increase the resolution of 3D reconstruction.\nThe startup hasn’t made any public announcements about the partners it is working with, but said it is in conversation with several teams and leagues in North America. The company competes with other startups like Arcturus Studios in the volumetric capture for sports.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe last decade is filled with examples of fintechs that have reshaped how U.S. businesses manage money. Brex simplified corporate cards. Ramp automated spend controls. Mercury rebuilt startup banking. But this wave of financial innovation has largely skipped one major part of the economy: nonprofits.\nGivefront, a YC-backed startup founded by 21-year-old Harvard dropout Matt Tengtrakool and UC Berkeley’s Aidan Sunbury, aims to change that. The company is building a financial platform designed specifically for nonprofits, including food banks, animal rescues, non-governmental organizations, churches, and homeowner associations.\nNonprofits generate roughly 6% of the U.S. GDP and contribute trillions of dollars each year, yet most still rely on outdated financial tools. Givefront believes that modern spend management, compliance, and reporting infrastructure — tailored to nonprofit realities — can unlock significant efficiency gains across the sector.\nBefore starting Givefront, Tengtrakool experimented with a microloan aggregation startup in Nigeria. He later worked inside several nonprofits while studying computer science and statistics at Harvard, including running a few organizations himself. At one nonprofit, he helped grow donations to nearly $500,000. Tengtrakool says these experiences revealed a clear gap that nonprofits face. They have strict regulatory and reporting requirements but lack the tools that modern businesses take for granted.\n“I’ve always been interested in financial systems, and this work fits naturally with that,” the chief executive told TechCrunch. “While helping run these nonprofits with a few other students, we realized most of them didn’t have adequate financial tools to ensure compliance or protect their tax-exempt status. The tools they relied on were completely out of sync with what’s considered modern in the startup world.”\nTengtrakool initially built the first version of Givefront to solve those problems internally. What started as tooling for organizations he worked with soon expanded to local nonprofits across the country. Over time, the team narrowed its focus to a unified financial platform built exclusively for registered nonprofit organizations, about 1.9 million of them in the U.S.\nGivefront entered Y Combinator Winter 2024 with a broad vision spanning banking and accounting. The team quickly learned, however, that convincing nonprofits to replace accountants or core banking relationships required a slow and painful sales process, ushering a pivot to cards and spend management.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It’s much easier to get an organization to switch the card they use than to replace their entire accounting stack,” Tengtrakool said.\nAlthough Givefront offers features similar to corporate spend platforms like Ramp and Brex, its exclusive focus on nonprofits sets it apart.\nNonprofits operate under constraints most businesses never face. They manage restricted and unrestricted grants, report spending to donors and foundations, track volunteer expenses, and file IRS Form 990 disclosures. Many nonprofits manage dozens of grants at once, each with its own spending and reporting rules.\nLegacy nonprofit systems such as Blackbaud, Sage, and MIP still dominate the market, but they often lack real-time spend controls, modern approval workflows, and seamless integrations with the tools nonprofits increasingly depend on.\nRather than replacing these systems outright, Givefront positions itself as a vertical layer that sits on top of them. The platform integrates with legacy accounting software while adding nonprofit-specific spend controls, receipt capture for audits, grant-based budgeting, and automated reporting.\n“Many of the workflows we’re building are deeply specific to how this part of the economy works,” Tengtrakool said. “Our workflows and integrations are a 10x improvement when compared to traditional corporate or spend management tools.”\nGivefront generates revenue from card interchange and subscriptions tied to its bill pay feature. Over time, Givefront plans to expand revenues by launching adjacent products, including payroll, banking, budgeting, and potentially investment and endowment management.\nSince launching its cards roughly six months ago, Givefront has onboarded hundreds of organizations and reports more than 200% month-over-month growth in revenue and total payment volume. The company expects to serve about 1,000 nonprofits by the end of the year, with a longer-term goal of reaching 5,000 organizations by mid-next year.\nTengtrakool says the team’s youth, which also includes a 17-year-old founding engineer, has served as both an advantage and a challenge so far. Some nonprofit leaders find the team’s age refreshing, while others hesitate to trust financial infrastructure to such a young group. \nChurches and religious organizations have driven the strongest adoption, he says. Many rely on volunteer treasurers instead of full-time finance staff, and Givefront’s automation significantly reduces their operational burden.\nThe company recently closed a $2 million round, led by Script Capital with participation from Y Combinator, C3 Ventures, Phoenix Fund, and angels, including the CEOs of Chariot and Wealthfront. The seed investment will help the company scale distribution, grow its team, and expand its cards and bill pay offerings.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Luma AI\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6:52 AM PST · December 18, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nLuma, the a16z-backed AI video and 3D model company, released a new model called Ray3 Modify that allows users to modify existing footage by providing character reference images that preserve the performance of the original footage. Users can also provide a start and an end frame to guide the model to generate transitional footage.\nThe company said Thursday the Ray3 Modify model solves the problems of preserving human performance while editing or generating effects using AI for creative studios. The startup said the model follows the input footage better, allowing studios to use human actors for creative or brand footage. Luma mentioned the new model retains the actor’s original motion, timing, eye line, and emotional delivery while transforming the scene.\nWith Ray3 Modify, users can provide a character reference for transformation to the original footage and convert the human actor’s appearance into that character. This reference also allows creators to retain information like costumes, likeness, and identity across the shoot.\nWhat’s more, users can also provide start and end reference frames to create a video using the new Ray3 Modify model. This is helpful for creators in directing transitions or controlling character movements or behavior while maintaining continuity between scenes.\n\n\n\n“Generative video models are incredibly expressive but also hard to control. Today, we are excited to introduce Ray3 Modify that blends the real-world with the expressivity of AI while giving full control to creatives. This means creative teams can capture performances with a camera and then immediately modify them to be in any location imaginable, change costumes, or even go back and reshoot the scene with AI, without recreating the physical shoot,” Amit Jain, co-founder and CEO of Luma AI, said in a statement. \nLuma said the new model is available to users through the company’s Dream Machine platform. The company, which competes with the likes of Runway and Kling, released video modification capabilities in June 2025.\nThe model release comes on the back of a fresh $900 million funding round, led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, for the startup announced in November. Existing investors like a16z, Amplify Partners, and Matrix Partners also participated in the round. The startup is also planning to build a 2GW AI cluster in Saudi Arabia along with Humain.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nEthereal Exploration Guild, an Indian space tech startup better known as EtherealX — developing a fully reusable medium-lift launch vehicle — is close to securing about $21 million in a new funding round co-led by TDK Ventures, with Accel among the participants, TechCrunch has learned.\nInitially planned as a $15 million Series A, the round has drawn strong investor demand and is now expected to reach about $20.5 million, three people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The funding comes more than a year after the startup raised a $5 million seed round in August 2024.\nTDK Ventures is co-leading the round with Vietnam-based venture capital firm BIG Capital, with Accel also participating, the sources said.\nThe funding talks follow EtherealX securing $130 million worth of contracts from six customers, the sources told TechCrunch, underscoring early commercial demand for its launch services.\nFounded in 2022 by Manu J. Nair alongside former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Shubhayu Sardar, who serves as chief operating officer, and aerospace engineer Prashant Sharma, the chief technology officer, EtherealX is aiming to take on SpaceX with a medium-lift launch vehicle called Razor Crest Mk-1. The rocket, designed to be fully reusable, is expected to place up to eight tonnes into low Earth orbit and will also be capable of delivering payloads to geostationary transfer and trans-lunar injection orbits.\nThe Bengaluru-based startup says its launch system will offer cost efficiencies to customers while helping to address a global shortage of launch capacity, with a first launch targeted for early 2027.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch last year, Nair said EtherealX’s rocket could offer launch prices ranging from about $350 to $2,000 per kilogram. By comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 typically charges between $1,600 and $2,000 per kilogram.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“At the price point at which we will enter the market, we’ll comfortably capture 30% to 40% of it,” Nair said at the time.\nIndia has emerged as one of the few countries globally with a geographic and regulatory advantage for space launches, offering access to multiple orbital inclinations from a single launch site. Its growing space tech ecosystem is also attracting global investors seeking markets that can complement space development in the United States, Europe, and other key regions.\nEtherealX has secured 16 acres of land in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which it plans to make operational early next year. The startup has also been developing key components, including a liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump assembly for its upper-stage engine, known as Pegasus 2.0, according to a recent LinkedIn post by Nair.\nIndia is aiming to dramatically expand its footprint in the global commercial space industry, targeting an 8% to 10% market share over the next decade from less than 2% today, with much of that growth expected to be driven by private startups. The country is working toward a $40 billion to $45 billion space economy within the next eight to 10 years, Indian Space Minister Jitendra Singh said recently.\nNair declined to comment. TDK Ventures, Accel, and BIG Capital did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple announced it will allow alternative app stores in Japan and will permit developers to process payments for digital goods and services outside of its own in-app purchase system in iOS. The iPhone maker is not making these changes because it wants to be more open; it’s being forced — in this case, to comply with the country’s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which is now going into effect.\nWith this update, Apple’s App Store revenues are being impacted in another major market due to anticompetition laws and regulations. The company already has to comply with Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which previously required the tech giant to allow for alternative app stores and other changes.\nIn the U.S., Apple has been strong-armed into changing its in-payments system by way of the courts, after a lawsuit from Fortnite maker, Epic Games. Though it was not declared a monopoly, the court decided Apple needed to give developers the right to process payments outside of its system if they chose. (The specifics around that order are still being worked out after an appeal partially reversed an earlier ruling.)\nAs usual, in its announcement about the changes in Japan, Apple warned that alternative app marketplaces and payments open “new avenues for malware, fraud, scams, and privacy and security risks.” To mitigate those risks, the company said it worked with Japanese regulators to require an authorization process for app marketplaces (“Notarization”), which it says is designed to protect children specifically from inappropriate content and scams.\nThe fact that Apple has come up with a process to dial back the risk for alternative app stores indicates there has always been a technical solution at hand to balance the needs for both openness and security.\nAs in the EU, Apple has come up with a complex fee structure to ensure it doesn’t lose much in the form of App Store revenue, while seemingly complying with the letter of the law.\nImage Credits:Apple / screenshot by TechCrunch\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, of course, was not silent on this matter, saying Fortnite will still not return to iOS in Japan because Apple is charging a 21% fee on third-party in-app purchases.\nIn a post on X, he wrote, “Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan. Apple chose poorly. Again.”\n\nSadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised. Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people… pic.twitter.com/7hu5eGMQX6— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) December 18, 2025\n\nHe also pointed out the difference between Apple and other game store providers, like Microsoft, by asking, “Can you imagine the gamer and regulator uproar that would ensue if Microsoft required all games from Steam and Epic Games Store to call its commerce surveillance API and report all transactions back to Microsoft?”\n“That’s what Apple just announced in Japan,” he added. \nApple noted that developers will need to agree to the latest update to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, which includes the new options for Japan, by March 17, 2026.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

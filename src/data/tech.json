It has now raised a total of $700 million, the company says, from backers including Sequoia, Nvidia, Kleiner Perkins, Blackstone, Bond, Craft Ventures, Mayo Clinic, and others. \nOpenEvidence is an AI-powered medical information platform, similar to what WebMD was for the previous internet generation, but it’s geared toward doctors. This puts it somewhat more in competition with Anthropic’s Claude for Healthcare, which is intended for patients, payers, and providers, whereas ChatGPT’s new health product is aimed more at consumers.\nThe company says that the free, ad-supported platform served 18 million clinical consultations from verified healthcare professionals in the U.S. in December alone. That compares to about 3 million searches per month a year ago. It also said that it had surpassed $100 million in revenue. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Biotech & Health\n\n",

    "body": "\nYouTube Shorts viewers might soon see AI versions of their favorite creators when scrolling through their feeds. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced on Wednesday that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using their own likeness. \n“This year you’ll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,” Mohan wrote in his annual letter. “Throughout this evolution, AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.”\nShorts, which Mohan said now averages 200 billion daily views, is one of YouTube’s most popular mediums. The company continues to invest in Shorts to sustain its viewership. While YouTube didn’t share additional details about these likenesses, the new capability will join the platform’s current AI tools for Shorts, including the ability to generate AI clips, AI stickers, AI auto-dubbing, and more. \nYouTube will also equip creators with new tools to manage the use of their likeness in AI-generated content, according to Mohan.\nWhile YouTube will allow creators to feature their own likeness in their videos, the Google-owned platform recently launched technology to prevent others from using it. Last October, YouTube rolled out likeness-detection technology to eligible creators to identify AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. Creators can then request the removal of AI-generated content.\nAs with other social platforms, YouTube has dealt with the spread of AI slop. Mohan says the company is working to maintain a high-quality viewing experience.\n“Over the past 20 years, we’ve learned not to impose any preconceived notions on the creator ecosystem,” Mohan wrote. “Today, once-odd trends like ASMR and watching other people play video games are mainstream hits. But with this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high quality viewing experience that people want. To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nYouTube is also set to expand Shorts with new formats, including image posts, which are already popular on TikTok and Instagram Reels.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8:44 AM PST · January 21, 2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nMeta on Wednesday announced it’s expanding ads on Threads to all users globally. The expansion, which starts next week, will be gradual, the company says, noting it may take months for the full rollout to complete.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly praised the social app and X rival, which has now grown to over 400 million monthly active users, as the company’s next big hit. Shortly after the app’s debut, the exec told investors that Threads had a good chance of reaching 1 billion users in a few years’ time.\nThe app has rapidly grown since its July 2023 debut, reaching 200 million users by mid-2024, 320 million as of January 2025, and then adding another 30 million as of last April, before reaching its latest milestone.\nThough Threads hasn’t yet hit that milestone, the company has been testing ads for some time. A year ago, Threads began testing ads in the U.S. and Japan, and last April, the platform opened up to global advertisers.\nThe company has made it easy for existing advertisers to expand their reach to include Threads by allowing them to automatically place ads through both Meta’s Advantage+ program and via manual campaigns. Supported formats include image and video ads, including the newer additions of the 4:5 aspect ratio format and carousel ads. Advertisers can manage their Threads ads alongside those for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in their Business Settings, which simplifies cross-posting.\nIn addition, Meta expanded the third-party verification already available on Facebook and Instagram (including feed and Reels) to the Threads feed through Meta Business Partners. This provides advertisers with independent brand safety and suitability verification for Threads — a useful feature when Threads’ nearest rival is dealing with a scourge of illegal deepfakes.\nThe company didn’t share how often users would see ads in their feed but noted that ad delivery initially would remain “low” as the feature scaled to global users.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAdobe has been aggressively adding AI features to all its products in the last few years. The company is now adding more AI tools to Acrobat, including the ability to generate podcast summaries of files, create presentations, and a way for users to edit files using prompts.\nThe company launched Adobe Spaces last year, which is a collection of files and notes that multiple users can access. Now, Adobe is allowing users to use the information stored in these files and notes to create a presentation using text prompts.\nFor instance, if a user has financial details, product plans, and competitor analysis available in a Space, they can build a pitch deck for clients that focuses on why their product can solve problems better than rivals.\nAcrobat’s AI assistant first generates an editable presentation with points that the deck would cover. You can then use Adobe Express’ theme library, stock photos, or your own images to build the presentation. Plus, you can easily apply your brand’s theme or edit individual slides using Express.\nImage Credits:Adobe\nTools like Canva and NotebookLM already offer the ability to convert documents into presentations. Besides, newer startups are also working on letting people use AI to create presentations by tapping different sources.\nAdobe is also letting users create a podcast to summarize a file or a Space within Acrobat. Notably, tools like Google’s NotebookLM, Speechify, and ElevenLabs’ Reader app also let users create personalized podcasts using various notes and documents.\nAcrobat is also getting the ability to let users edit files using prompts. The company said that users can take 12 actions, including removing pages, text, comments, and images; finding and replacing words and phrases; and adding e-signatures and passwords.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAcrobat already had sharing capabilities with Spaces, but now, when you share files with others, the files will house AI-generated summaries, with citations pointing to an exact location in the file. Contributors can also comment on files, or add or remove content. \nPlus, users can use the default AI assistant or pick other assistant roles, like “analyst,” “entertainer,” or “instructor.” You can also create a custom assistant using a prompt.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nDigital insurance company Lemonade is launching a product for users of Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system, known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised), which the insurer promises will cut per-mile rates by “approximately 50%.”\nIt’s one of the first products geared toward pricing insurance based on how software systems handle driving, and a sign that companies may look to create new lines of business as partial autonomy and true self-driving start to proliferate.\nLemonade said on Wednesday that it is leveraging “vehicle telemetry data that was previously unavailable” thanks to a “technical collaboration with Tesla,” though the insurance company declined to offer more specifics. Lemonade said it would train its own usage-based risk prediction models to determine when a driver is using Full Self-Driving or operating the vehicle themselves, and price accordingly.\nLemonade is calling the new product “Autonomous Car insurance.” Tesla’s software does not currently make cars completely autonomous, and drivers need to be ready to take over at any moment. But the product is clearly a bet that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will ultimately fulfill his long-delayed promise that his company will make that happen.\n“Traditional insurers treat a Tesla like any other car, and AI like any other driver. But a driver who can see 360 degrees, never gets drowsy, and reacts in milliseconds isn’t like any other driver,” Shai Wininger, co-founder and president of Lemonade, said in a statement. “Our existing pay-per-mile product has given us something no traditional insurer has: a unique tech stack designed to collect massive amounts of real driving data for precise, dynamic pricing.”\nThe new car insurance product will launch in Arizona on January 26, and in Oregon the following month. Lemonade claims that “the safer FSD software becomes, the more our prices will drop.” The company’s existing auto insurance offering is available for “most popular cars” in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.\nTesla has offered its own car insurance to customers for years now, though in late 2025 the company was hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance (CDI). The automaker was accused, along with partner State National Insurance Company, of “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims,” “unreasonable denials,” and engaging in “unfair claims settlement practices.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTesla has denied the allegations.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

    "body": "\nIt all began in sales. That’s where Cam Badger got his start, at a pharmaceutical company. He expected to find structure and mentorship on the job but instead found “fragmented training, inconsistent coaching, and no real way to scale learning in a meaningful way,” he told TechCrunch. \nHe spent four years as a sales rep, then a sales trainer, and then worked for a medical startup where he met Dr. Benny Alouf. The two lamented about how awful many sales reps were at life science companies like pharma businesses, medical device startups, and so forth. The duo, alongside Bhrugu Giri, decided to try and fix this, launching PraxisPro, a sales coaching platform specifically targeted at medical fields.\nHe believes that better salespeople will help get more treatments into doctors’ hands, which will ultimately help their patients.\n“When commercial interactions with healthcare providers are ineffective, patients don’t get a fair shot at therapies that could meaningfully change their lives,” Badger, the company’s CEO, said. \nPraxisPro launched in 2023, though its first product was not released until 2025. The company announced on Wednesday a $6 million seed round led by AlleyCorp. Others in the round include Flybridge, South Loop Ventures, and Zeal Capital Partners. \nPraxisPro is a standalone platform that can also be integrated into enterprise software. It develops small language models trained on life science data to help each company navigate the nuances and context needed to interact with healthcare providers. From there, the company has created an AI agent that helps the commercial sales team practice their communication skills before engaging with customers. \nBadger said communication is critical in medical sales. So many teams are worried about staying compliant, as each company is responsible for ensuring sales messaging complies with legal frameworks. Aside from helping train sales reps to stay compliant, PraxisPro also hopes to help better educate them to communicate patient needs with healthcare providers. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRight now, a salesperson may have 15 interactions with a healthcare provider as part of the sales process. PraxisPro has a conversational AI feature that lets sales reps practice and plan these interactions and be better prepared for what the discussion usually entails, including any pushback that might come up. \nThere are other AI role-playing tools (like Quantified and SmartWinnr), but Badger says his is different because his company is trained on smaller datasets and specifically focuses on the life sciences sector. The fresh capital will be used toward research and development, he said.\nIn many ways, this was the tool he wished he had when he was still working as a sales rep all those years ago. He struggled, he said, and almost lost his job, but managed to work his way up to become one of the company’s top performers. Now, he wants to give others a hand. \n“If we can give commercial teams the ability to prepare, practice, and engage at a higher level, consistently and responsibly, then we’re not just improving commercial operations, but we’re helping ensure that innovative therapies reach the patients who need them most,” he said. \nThis article was updated to clarify the name of the co-founder. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nDays ahead of a scheduled trial, social media company Snap has settled a lawsuit accusing the platform of causing social media addiction, according to reports from multiple outlets.\nAccording to the New York Times, the settlement was announced Tuesday in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles County. The lawsuit against Snap was brought by a 19-year-old known in court documents as K.G.M., accusing the social media app of designing algorithms and features that caused addiction and mental health issues.\nThe terms of the settlement were not disclosed.\nThe lawsuit also names other platforms, including Meta, YouTube, and TikTok. No settlement has been reached with these platforms. Notably, Snap is still a defendant in other similar social media addiction cases filed against it.\nAccording to documents unveiled in the ongoing cases, Snap employees raised concerns around risks to the mental health of teens dating back at least nine years. The company has said these examples were “cherry-picked” and were taken out of context.\nPlaintiffs in these cases are drawing parallels to Big Tobacco — referring to lawsuits in the 1990s against cigarette companies that concealed health risks — alleging that the platforms obscured information about potential harms from their users. They argue that features like infinite scroll, auto video play, and algorithmic recommendations have tricked users into continuously using apps, leading to depression, eating disorders, and self-harm, according to the NYT.\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel had been scheduled to testify in the trial, which would have marked the first time a social media company faces a jury in an addiction lawsuit — no platform has lost such a case at trial yet. The remaining case against Meta, TikTok, and YouTube is set to proceed with jury selection beginning next Tuesday, January 27, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expected to take the witness stand.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIf plaintiffs prevail, legal experts predict the cases could result in multibillion-dollar settlements and potentially force platforms to redesign their products. But the companies have so far defended themselves in part by arguing that those same design choices — like algorithmic recommendations, push notifications, and infinite scroll — are similar to a newspaper deciding what stories to publish and are protected speech under the First Amendment.\nSnap did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin has just announced a satellite internet network called TeraWave which will be capable of offering data speeds up to 6Tbps, and geared towards enterprise, data center, and government customers.\nThe TeraWave constellation will use a mix of 5,280 satellites in low-Earth orbit and 128 in medium-Earth orbit, and Blue Origin plans to deploy the first ones in late 2027. It’s not immediately clear how long Blue Origin expects it will take to build out the whole network.\nThe low-Earth orbit satellites Blue Origin is building will use RF connectivity and have a max data transfer speed of of 144 Gbps, while the medium-Earth variety will use an optical link that can achieve the much higher 6Tbps speed. For reference, SpaceX’s Starlink currently maxes out at 400 Mbps — though it plans to launch upgraded satellites that will offer 1 Gbps data transfer in the future.\n“TeraWave adds a space-based layer to your existing network infrastructure, providing connectivity to locations unreachable by traditional methods,” the new website for the satellite network reads.\nThe announcement of the TeraWave network comes just a few months after Bezos’ other company, Amazon, announced a rebrand of its own satellite network geared toward consumers. That network, called Leo, will ultimately consist of around 3,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit and offers more traditional broadband speeds.\nTaken together, these two networks could provide more robust competition to SpaceX’s Starlink, which has become the leading satellite internet provider with more than 9 million customers. Starlink currently sells its connectivity to regular consumers, commercial customers (like airlines), and governments. \nThat said, the two networks from Amazon and Blue Origin are distinct. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We identified an unmet need with customers who were seeking enterprise-grade internet access with higher speeds, symmetrical upload/download speeds, more redundancy, and rapid scalability for their networks. TeraWave solves for these problems,” Blue Origin said in a statement to TechCrunch. \nBlue Origin has spent years in development on a number of projects, and is best-known for the short trips to space it offers on its small New Shepard rocket. \nThe company has recently started to emerge as a multi-faceted commercial space player. In 2025, the company successfully launched its mega-rocket, New Glenn, for the first time and then repeated the feat months later. It also landed the booster stage on just its second attempt, and launched its first commercial payload for NASA.\nThe company plans to send a robotic lander to the surface of the Moon this year on the third New Glenn launch. Now, with TeraWave, it will add “satellite manufacturer and operator” to its growing list of offerings. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nU.S. autonomous drone delivery and logistics startup Zipline said Wednesday it will set up operations in Houston and Phoenix early this year, as part of an expansion that will be propelled by $600 million in fresh investment. \nThe round, which values the company at $7.6 billion, will be used to expand to at least four U.S. states in 2026, the company said. Several existing and new investors, including Fidelity Management & Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Valor Equity Partners, and Tiger Global participated in the funding round.\nFounded in 2014, Zipline developed its own drone delivery ecosystem, including the logistics software, launch and landing systems, and the aircraft. The company got its commercial start in 2016 using its autonomous drones to deliver blood in Rwanda. Today, Zipline’s drones deliver food, retail, agriculture, and health products in five African countries, several cities in the United States, and Japan.\nLast year, Zipline launched a home delivery service in the U.S. that lets customers order food and retail goods via an app. The home delivery service uses Zipline’s Platform 2 drones, which are designed to carry up to eight pounds and travel to customers within a 10-mile radius. Its larger Platform 1 drones are used for long-range deliveries for enterprise, business, and government that can cover 120 miles round trip. The P2 platform started in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex with Walmart, and more than a dozen restaurant brands, according to Zipline.\nIt has also announced plans to launch in Seattle. Other commercial partners include Panera, Chipotle, Crumbl, Blaze Pizza, Wendy’s, and Little Caesars.\nThat geographic expansion in the United States has fueled Zipline’s delivery numbers. In 2024, the company completed 1 million drone deliveries to customers; this week, Zipline said it had surpassed 2 million deliveries. The company also said its U.S. deliveries have grown by about 15% week-over-week for the last seven months.\nCo-founder and CEO Keller Cliffton views 2026 as the company’s breakout year. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Autonomous logistics has been maturing for more than a decade, and the last year has made it unmistakably clear that when deliveries are faster, cleaner, safer, and cheaper, demand isn’t just high, it grows exponentially,” Cliffton said in a statement. “In 2026 autonomous logistics will become an everyday staple for people across several states in the U.S. That transformation starts with Houston and my home town of Phoenix, which we’ll begin serving early this year, and then expand to even more places across the country throughout the year.”\nZipline isn’t alone in the nascent industry of drone delivery. Other competitors include Flytrex, DroneUp, Amazon Prime Air, and Wing, the Alphabet-owned subsidiary that has also partnered with Walmart. Wing announced plans to expand to another 150 Walmart stores through 2027.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nI have long dreamed of a better world: one where I would unlock my phone to find a notification that my grandma has challenged me to a game of Scrabble. I would play my word. She would play hers. We would play back and forth over a few days, and the entire time, neither of us would have to see any overwhelming technicolor ads with deceptive skip buttons that blast us with even more pop-ups. It’s a simple life.\nYou would think such an app already existed. You would be wrong. Until now. (Zynga, I will never forgive you for what you’ve done to Words With Friends).\nAt last, The New York Times Games has brought my humble dreams to life with a Scrabble-like multiplayer app called Crossplay, available now on iOS and Android.\nCrossplay is not a Scrabble clone exactly, but unless you are the type of Scrabble lover that goes to tournaments or memorizes the Scrabble dictionary, it’s basically Scrabble. The game board and tile distribution are a bit different, and there’s a slight rule change around what happens once the bag runs out of tiles. Those differences may have been done for legal reasons. As a casual player, I barely noticed them.\nLike other social word games, Crossplay allows you to invite friends to play, or you can get matched with strangers near your skill level. For New York Times Games subscribers, the game will have no ads at all, but free users might see some banner ads. Still, it beats paying $10 a month to remove ads from Words With Friends, yet still have to deal with a cartoon-like interface, among other features that annoy me.\nBehold: one game that looks normal, and one that looks like Cocomelon for adultsImage Credits:Crossplay (left), Words With Friends (right)\nWhile Scrabble purists may quibble about the slight rule changes, they may find delight in a feature of the game called CrossBot. Like the WordleBot and ConnectionsBot, CrossBot analyzes each move of your game to determine where you may have made a better move. It ranks your gameplay in terms of both luck and strategy, then highlights both your best moves, and those where you faltered.\nThe New York Times has been publishing its Crossword puzzle since 1942, but its digital gaming business kicked into high gear in 2022 when it bought Wordle after it went viral. According to data from ValueAct Capital, a hedge fund that invests in the Times, users spent more time in the Games app than the actual News app by the end of 2023.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nI’m not the only one who was craving a multi-player word game without egregious distractions — Jonathan Knight, head of Games at The New York Times, thinks this is what makes its Games vertical so successful.\n“Games like Spelling Bee and Wordle found a way to take the magical ‘solve a puzzle’ feeling and create a very mainstream, quick, snackable version of that that works well on your phone, that’s very sharable with friends and family, and that I think is very respectful of your time,” Knight told TechCrunch. “You can just decide to do it in the morning, or at night before you go to bed, and then go to bed.”\nAccording to The New York Times, Wordle was played 4.2 billion times in 2025. Connections was played 1.6 billion times.\nWhen TechCrunch spoke to Wordle creator Josh Wardle shortly before he sold his game, he shared a mindset similar to Knight’s. He told us, “people have an appetite for things that transparently don’t want anything from you.”\nSure, a publicly traded company like The New York Times isn’t as pure of heart as an indie developer making a game for his partner, but the spirit of the game has persisted. Even as Wordle’s viral moment passed, people kept up with their daily habit, according to Knight.\n“The share rate on Wordle — the percentage of users that share every day — has not changed since we acquired the game,” he said. “It’s a really cool way to bring people together. You know, we see the Pope talking about his Wordle, sharing with his brother.”\nNow, Knight’s team wants to extend the quiet simplicity of its games philosophy to Crossplay.\n“We wanted people to be able to just get in and play the game with friends and family, and then get on with your day,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nYouTube TV has been slowly expanding its multiview feature over the past few years, which initially allowed sports fans to watch up to four channels simultaneously on one screen. Soon, viewers will finally have the chance to watch any content they choose. \n​In his annual letter published on Wednesday, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan revealed that the platform will soon introduce a “fully customizable multiview” experience. This upgrade aims to provide greater personalization by letting viewers create their own multiview layouts, tailoring their screens to their individual interests across sports, news, entertainment, and more.\n​YouTube TV first rolled out the multiview feature for sports broadcasts in 2023, allowing fans to watch multiple games simultaneously. The feature later expanded to include other categories, such as news and weather, though it was initially restricted to a set list of preselected channels, including CNN, MSNBC, HGTV, and Food Network. Later on, YouTube TV began testing a way for a small group of users to customize which channels they wanted to watch side by side without restriction. \nThis new capability is expected to appeal to families and larger households with diverse viewing preferences, as it allows different genres to be watched together on a single screen.\n​To try out multiview, press the down button on your remote, then look for the Multiview icon or the “Watch Multiview” option, and select it. From there, you can pick up to three more live channels to add to your screen. \n​Additionally, Mohan highlighted YouTube TV’s upcoming launch of genre-specific channel packages, designed to give subscribers more flexibility over what content they pay for. For example, viewers can choose specialized packages focused on sports, news, family programming, or entertainment, tailoring their subscriptions to their interests and potentially saving on costs. \nHowever, YouTube TV hasn’t shared much about these packages, like how much they’ll cost or when they’ll launch. We can likely expect more information to be announced in the coming months as the platform prepares for rollout.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nDeepinder Goyal, the co-founder and CEO of food delivery service Zomato and its parent Eternal, is stepping down from his role and handing the top job to Albinder Dhindsa, the CEO of its quick-commerce division Blinkit.\nGoyal on Wednesday said he would remain on Eternal’s board as vice chairman as he shifts focus to “higher-risk exploration and experimentation,” which he says may be harder to pursue within the constraints of a listed company.\n“This is a change in title, not in commitment toward outcomes,” Goyal said in a letter to Eternal’s shareholders. “Eternal remains my life’s work.”\nGoyal co-founded Zomato with Pankaj Chaddah in 2008 as a restaurant discovery and reviews platform called FoodieBay while both were working at Bain & Company. In 2009, they quit to focus on the business full-time and rebranded it as Zomato in 2010 amid a naming conflict with eBay, before expanding into food delivery in 2015.\nChaddah left the company in 2018, and Zomato later consolidated its position by acquiring Uber Eats’ India business in 2020 and Blinkit (formerly Grofers) for $568 million in 2022.\nThe leadership change comes as Eternal reported (PDF) strong momentum in its third quarter, with profit rising about 73% to ₹1.02 billion (around $11.13 million) from a year earlier, on adjusted revenue ₹166.92 billion (about $1.8 billion), up 190% from a year ago. \nBlinkit remained the company’s fastest-growing business, with net order value jumping 121% to ₹133 billion (roughly $1.45 billion) in the last quarter.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOutside Eternal, Goyal has been working on other projects for the last few months, including a longevity-focused initiative called Continue Research and an experimental brain-health wearable dubbed “Temple.” He is a co-founder of the aviation startup LAT Aerospace and is an angel investor.\nThe handover could be an indicator of Blinkit’s rising influence inside Eternal, as the company’s growth skews toward quick commerce and away from its mainstay, food delivery. \nQuick commerce in India is booming even as the sector faces rising scrutiny over working conditions for the thousands of gig workers employed in the industry. The country’s labor ministry recently asked platforms to drop their “10-minute delivery” marketing and put in place measures to improve conditions for their delivery personnel.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

While the company is tight-lipped about the upcoming product, OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane said in an Axios-hosted panel at Davos the AI startup is on track to announce its first hardware device in the second half of this year.\nLast November, Sam Altman described the potential device to be more “peaceful and calm” than iPhones. Previous reporting suggests the company wants to build a screen-free and pocketable device.\nWhile the company is not spilling any details, more recent reporting from Asian publications and leakers suggests OpenAI’s first device could be a pair of earbuds. According to reports, this device is codenamed “Sweet Pea” and will have a unique design as compared to existing earbuds. The earbuds could work on a custom 2-nanometer processor and handle AI tasks locally instead of sending requests to the cloud.\nA separate report from a large Taiwanese newspaper noted that OpenAI was exploring a partnership with China-based Luxshare for manufacturing, but might eventually lean in favor of Taiwan’s Foxconn. The report also said in the first year of sales, OpenAI aims to ship 40 to 50 million units.\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT has nearly a billion weekly users, but the company has to rely on other devices and platforms for distribution. With its own device, it might want to take more control of the development and distribution of the AI assistant and also release exclusive and purpose-built features.\nHowever, replacing existing earbuds like AirPods in users’ daily lives is going to be challenging if there’s not a strong integration with operating systems.\nUntil now, there hasn’t been a standout AI device success story. Last year, the Humane AI Pin got sold to HP. Rabbit is still just chugging along after the initial hype of 2024. And the Friend AI companion necklace received a swift backlash for its marketing tactics.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, big tech companies are making moves into wearables. Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses are increasingly improving in scope and scale to the point where the Facebook-maker can’t keep up with demand.

    "body": "\nOpenAI’s first sales leader, Aliisa Rosenthal, has found a new career: venture capital. She’s joining Acrew Capital as a general partner, working alongside founding partner Lauren Kolodny and the firm’s other partners, Rosenthal and Kolodny tell TechCrunch.\nRosenthal left OpenAI about eight months ago after a three-year sprint at the AI lab that saw the launch of DALL·E, ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, Sora, and other products. “I wasn’t initially looking to join a VC fund,” she told TechCrunch. “I was out there meeting with lots of AI startups.” \nBut after growing OpenAI’s enterprise sales team from two people to hundreds, she saw the appeal when Kolodny pitched her on venture capital. Instead of helping one startup with its go-to-market strategy, she could help a portfolio of them.\nIn her time at OpenAI, “I learned a lot about behavior, both on the side of the buyers, how people are thinking about these purchases, and the gap between what most organizations think is possible and what they can actually deploy today,” she said.\nFor instance, she has firsthand insight into what kind of moat an AI startup can build that won’t leave it vulnerable when model makers like OpenAI launch competing products.  \nWill OpenAI “just build everything and put every company out of business? You know, they are doing a lot already: they’re in consumer, they’re in enterprise, they’re building a device. I don’t think they are going to go after every potential enterprise application,” she says. \nSo one moat is for enterprise AI startups to offer specialization. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nContext as moat\nAdditionally, she thinks the key to a good startup moat will be “context” — or the information the AI stores in its context window memory as it works on requests.  \n“Context is dynamic. It’s adaptable. It’s scalable. And I think what we’re seeing is going beyond sort of the basic RAG towards this idea of a context graph, which is persistent,” she says referring to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) the de facto method as of 2025 to minimize hallucinations by training LLMs on trusted, specific sources (and having the LLM cite them). \nThere’s still a lot of tech that needs to be developed for this area, though, from memory to reasoning beyond pattern recognition. \n“I expect real innovation here. I think this year we will see new approaches — the idea of context and memory,” Rosenthal says. \nBut beyond startups working directly on context engineering, Rosenthal thinks enterprise apps that bake it in will have the advantage. \n“Ultimately, when we talk about moat, I think who owns and manages this context layer will become a large advantage for AI products,” she says. \nAnother opportunity she sees: startups not building atop a major lab’s state-of-the-art models, with their high prices.  \n“I think there is room in the market for cheaper models that are lighter weight and innovate on inference costs,” she says. These are models that are not, perhaps, at the top of the leaderboards of various benchmarks but “are still very useful” and more affordable. \n“Where I’m really excited to invest is on the application layer. I’m really interested in what will be the durable applications built on all of these different models, not just on the foundational models,” she says. She’s seeking startups with “interesting use cases” or that use AI to help enterprise employees work more efficiently.  \nAs for where she’s going to find these startups, she’ll be working her network among OpenAI’s alums for starters. Now that the AI outfit is 10 years old, the alums network has grown. Many have already founded startups that have raised big bucks at high valuations, ranging from OpenAI’s biggest competitor, Anthropic, to buzzy early-stage companies like Safe Superintelligence.\nThere is also a growing precedent for high-level ex-OpenAI folks to become seed-stage investors. About a year ago, Peter Deng, OpenAI’s former head of consumer products, joined Felicis. He’s been crushing it ever since, and clearly having fun, getting in on big deals for hot startups like LMArena and Periodic Labs.  \n“I actually had a call with Peter a few months ago, and he helped me make the decision,” Rosenthal said of her choice to become an investor. \nBut Rosenthal may have a secret weapon to win deals. She also has deep contacts among AI enterprise users — the type of buyers and beta testers these early AI startups need. \nEnterprises still don’t understand how much AI can do for them. “There’s a really large gap that I am very optimistic can be filled. It leaves a huge green field for applications and companies.”\n",

    "body": "\nThe ground beneath our feet holds so much energy that experts at the Department of Energy (DOE) think geothermal power could generate 60 gigawatts — or nearly 10% of U.S. electricity — by 2050. \nZanskar co-founder and CEO Carl Hoiland thinks that lofty number is too low, mostly because it’s discounting conventional geothermal’s potential.\nThe DOE’s figures assume advances in enhanced geothermal, which uses fracking techniques to access hot rock deep underground. Companies like Fervo and Sage Geosystems have been pursuing that angle, and experts agree it has tremendous potential. By contrast, conventional geothermal, which taps naturally fractured hot spots, has been stagnant, generating just 4 gigawatts in the United States, up only about a gigawatt in the last decade or so.\nConventional geothermal has been held back by outdated assumptions, Hoiland told TechCrunch.\n“They underestimated how many undiscovered systems there are, maybe by an order of magnitude or more,” Hoiland said. With modern drilling techniques, “you can get a lot more out of each of them, maybe even an order of magnitude or more from each of those. All of a sudden the number goes from tens of gigawatts to what could be a terawatt-scale opportunity.”\nZanskar is relying on AI to help break conventional geothermal out of its malaise. In the process, the startup has resuscitated a flagging power plant in New Mexico and discovered two new sites with over 100 megawatts of combined potential.\nThose successes have helped Zanskar land a $115 million Series C led by Spring Lane Capital with participation from the All Aboard Fund, Carica Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Imperative Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Munich Re Ventures, Obvious Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, StepStone Group, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Tranquillion, Union Square Ventures, University Growth Fund, and UP.Partners.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMany potential geothermal sites have been overlooked because people have been searching for evidence on the surface like a hot spring or a volcano, Hoiland said. But about 95% of all geothermal systems lack such a tell, he added. “We just keep finding them by accident. That is a great application for AI.”\nTo find new geothermal resources, Zanskar first feeds supervised machine learning models a range of data, including past accidental discoveries. When they have identified a promising site, the company sends a team to the site to validate the discovery.\nZanskar then has to come up with a plan to develop it. For that, the team uses another AI approach, one developed for this very purpose called “Bayesian evidential learning” (BEL). In BEL, existing data helps build a series of assumptions known as “priors,” and then models work to falsify those hypotheses, spitting out probabilities for each. Where there are gaps, the startup has built a geothermal simulator to fill in the blanks.\nSo far, Zanskar’s approach has been working. The previous funding round allowed the startup to explore three sites, each of which it considered a success. “Three of three,” said Zanskar co-founder and CTO Joel Edwards. “What does it look like when you try 10?”\nThe company has enough sites in the pipeline to support at least a gigawatt of generating capacity, Hoiland said. For now, they’ve been focused on the U.S. West, which has the most potential. He would like to find at least 10 confirmed sites to help Zanskar court project finance investors, which provide access to lower-cost capital than VCs. If the company can make that work, then it might get through the valley of death that has claimed many other climate tech startups.\nHoiland is not convinced that Zanskar has solved all the challenges associated with finding geothermal resources, but he’s optimistic the company is on the right path.\n“We now know this is the future of exploration,” he said. “This is going to change geothermal in very short order.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

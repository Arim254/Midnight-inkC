As part of the deal, Nvidia will hire Groq founder Jonathan Ross, president Sunny Madra, and other employees.\nCNBC reported that Nvidia is acquiring assets from Groq for $20 billion; Nvidia told TechCrunch that this is not an acquisition of the company and did not comment on the scope of the deal. But if CNBC’s numbers are accurate, this purchase is expected to be Nvidia’s largest ever, and with Groq on its side, Nvidia is poised to become even more dominant in chip manufacturing.\nAs tech companies compete to grow their AI capabilities, they need computing power, and Nvidia’s GPUs have emerged as the industry standard. But Groq has been working on a different type of chip called an LPU (language processing unit), which it has claimed can run LLMs at 10 times faster and using one-tenth the energy. Groq’s CEO Jonathan Ross is known for this sort of innovation — when he worked for Google, he helped invent the TPU (tensor processing unit), a custom AI accelerator chip.\nIn September, Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation. Its growth has been quick and significant — the company said that it powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from about 356,000 last year.\nUpdated, 12/24/25 at 5:40 p.m. ET, with clarification from Nvidia about the nature of the deal.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Waymo\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t8:55 AM PST · December 24, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nWaymo is shipping a software update to help its robotaxis navigate disabled traffic lights during power outages “more decisively,” the company said Tuesday in a blog post that explains why its self-driving vehicles got stuck at intersections during a blackout in San Francisco this past weekend.\nWaymo said the self-driving system in its robotaxis treats dead stop lights as four-way stops, just like humans are supposed to. That should have allowed the robotaxis to operate normally in spite of the massive outage.\nInstead, many of the vehicles requested a “confirmation check” from Waymo’s fleet response team to make sure what they were doing was correct. All Waymo robotaxis have the ability to make these confirmation checks. With such a widespread outage on Saturday, there was a “concentrated spike” in these confirmation requests, Waymo said, which helped create all the congestion caught on video.\nWaymo said it built this confirmation request system “out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment” but that it is now refining it to “match our current scale.” \n“While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the [self-driving software] with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively,” the company wrote.\nThe software update will add “even more context about regional outages” to the company’s self-driving software. Waymo also said it will improve its emergency response protocols by “incorporating lessons from this event.” \nWhile a lot of focus has been placed on the instances where Waymo’s robotaxis got stuck during the power outage, the company shared that its vehicles “successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology,” the company wrote. \nSaturday’s mess is the latest example of how Waymo is still uncovering unforeseen issues with its software and its approach to designing a reliable fleet of self-driving vehicles. The company already had to ship multiple software updates to make its robotaxis wait for stopped school buses, which prompted a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation and led to a recall. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAfter a federal judge on Tuesday blocked Texas from implementing a new age-verification law for app stores, Apple announced it will pause previously announced plans for the state as it continues to monitor the “ongoing legal process.”\nApple said its previously announced developer tools for age assurance would remain available for testing and use.\nThe law, SB 2420, or the App Store Accountability Act, would have required app stores, like those run by Apple and Google, to verify user ages and require parental consent for those under 18 to download apps or make purchases. In addition, it would have required the age data be shared with developers.\nA judge, citing First Amendment concerns, blocked the law’s enforcement that was set to take effect in January. The ruling was a win for tech giants and a setback to Texas lawmakers, who said the legal fight will continue. The Texas attorney general’s office noted in a court filing that it plans to appeal the decision, a report from Reuters noted.\nTo comply with the coming law, Apple had announced in October a series of new requirements for apps in Texas, which included all users under the age of 18 would have to join a Family Sharing group, where parents or guardians would provide consent for all App Store downloads, app purchases, and in-app transactions. Parents would be able to revoke their consent for an app at any time.\nApple also said its Declared Age Range API, a technology the company debuted to help it comply with the growing number of age-assurance laws worldwide, would be updated in the months ahead to provide the required age categories for new account users in Texas. Apple had planned to launch new APIs for developers to request parental consent again if their app was significantly updated.\nApple had objected to this law, and similar laws arriving next year in Utah and Louisiana, on the grounds of privacy, not kids’ protection. \n“While we share the goal of strengthening kids’ online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores,” Apple explained in a developer announcement earlier this year.\nApple on Thursday announced other developer tools for complying with new age-assurance laws will remain available for testing, including its Declared Age Range API, Significant Change API under PermissionKit, New age rating property type in StoreKit, and App Store Server Notifications. In addition, the Declared Age Range API is still available worldwide across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, and later.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nItaly has ordered Meta to suspend its policy that bans companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots on the popular chat app.\nThe Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) on Wednesday said it had found enough cause in its ongoing investigation into whether Meta was abusing its dominant position in the market to offer its Meta AI chatbot within WhatsApp to order the suspension of the policy.\n“Meta’s conduct appears to constitute an abuse, since it may limit production, market access, or technical developments in the AI Chatbot services market, to the detriment of consumers,” the Authority wrote. “Moreover, while the investigation is ongoing, Meta’s conduct may cause serious and irreparable harm to competition in the affected market, undermining contestability.”\nThe AGCM in November had broadened the scope of an existing investigation into Meta, after the company changed its business API policy in October to ban general-purpose chatbots from being offered on the chat app via the API.\nMeta has argued that its API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots and that people have more avenues beyond WhatsApp to use AI bots from other companies. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.\nThe policy doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude are prohibited from being distributed via the API.\nThe European Commission this month also launched an investigation into the new policy, raising concerns that it may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCalling the Authority’s decision “fundamentally flawed,” Meta said WhatsApp’s business API isn’t a route to the market for AI companies. \n“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. The Italian authority assumes WhatsApp is somehow a defacto app store. The route to market for AI companies are the app stores themselves, their websites and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform. We will appeal,” Meta said in an emailed statement.\nNote: This story was updated to add Meta’s response to the decision.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

After a lot of trial and error prototyping with ideas like cryogenics, the solution he settled on — which he showed off earlier this year at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 — is steam.\nBoysen’s company has developed a system that uses computer vision to spot weeds in lawns and fields and golf courses, and kill them with nothing but vaporized water. It can be attached to mowers, or tractors, or even ATVs. At the moment, Naware is flexible, and Boysen is visibly eager for his idea to spread fast — much like the weeds he’s trying to kill.\nIn a world of agentic AI and billion-dollar software companies, Naware stands out as a classic garage startup story. Boysen said his team first tested the use of steam by ordering a “rinky dink” garment steamer off of Amazon. After that, they ordered seven more. \n“They’re not real industrial,” Boysen said. “And so there’s a lot of research helping to develop that, to get to the point of: ‘How do we make this effective and make it repeatable so it can scale?’”\nDeveloping the steamer tech was one challenge, but the bigger one may have been identifying the weeds, Boysen said. It’s well-established that artificial intelligence software can be trained to accurately recognize objects or patterns, but the “green-on-green” problem was tough, he said — especially because the software has to recognize the weeds in real time while the rig is prowling over a lawn. (And yes, it’s using Nvidia GPUs.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHe thinks they’ve gotten there, though. He said Naware is targeting companies that do lawn care for athletic fields and golf courses, and claims his company can save customers like that “anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000 on chemicals alone.”\nOn top of that, he said customers will save money by not having to pay for people whose only job is to spray those chemicals. Naware has been doing paid pilots to test and dial in the product, but Boysen’s pitch has already attracted prospective partners, he said.\n“We’re going after the strategic partnerships. We’re in discussions with $5 billion companies that do equipment manufacturing that are interested in our product. And we’re a couple conversations into that — I can’t say their name, but you’ll figure it out,” he laughed.\nSuccess, Boysen said, will take three things: those partnerships, securing patents, and funding. Boysen has been bootstrapping Naware for now but said he’ll open its first fundraising round in the coming months.\n“I’ve got to get a funding round that just crushes anybody else trying to think about it,” he said. “I’ve got to deliver the promise that I can kill weeds, and it’s effective. And we’ll make it work. I’m not concerned about that.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nAfter 33 years, Bernardo Quintero decided it was time to find the person who changed his life — the anonymous programmer who created a computer virus that had infected his university decades earlier.\nThe virus, called Virus Málaga, was mostly harmless. But the challenge of defeating it sparked Quintero’s passion for cybersecurity, eventually leading him to found VirusTotal, a startup that Google acquired in 2012. That acquisition brought Google’s flagship European cybersecurity center to Málaga, transforming the Spanish city into a tech hub.\nAll because of a small malware program created by someone whose identity Quintero had never known. Moved by nostalgia and gratitude, Quintero launched a search earlier this year. He asked Spanish media outlets to amplify his quest for tips. He dove back into the virus’s code, looking for clues his 18-year-old self might have missed. And he eventually solved the mystery, sharing the bittersweet resolution in a LinkedIn post that went viral.\nThe story begins in 1992, when a young Quintero was prompted by a teacher to create an antivirus for the 2610-byte program that had spread across the computers of Málaga’s Polytechnic School. “That challenge in my first year at university sparked a deep interest in computer viruses and security, and without it my path might have been very different,” Quintero told TechCrunch.\nQuintero’s search was aided by his programmer instincts. Earlier this year, he stepped down from his team manager role to “go back to the cave, to the basement of Google.” He didn’t leave the company; instead, he went back to tinkering and experimenting without managerial duties.\nThat tinkering mindset also led him to reexamine Virus Málaga and look for details he’d missed years earlier. First, he found fragments of a signature, but thanks to another security expert, he discovered a later variant of the virus with a much clearer cue: “KIKESOYYO.” “Kike soy yo” would translate to “I am Kike,” a common nickname for “Enrique.” \nAround the same time, Quintero received a direct message from a man who is now the general digital transformation coordinator for the Spanish city of Cordoba and who claimed he witnessed one of his Polytechnic School classmates create the virus. Many details added up, but one stood out in particular: The man knew that the virus’s hidden message — called a payload, in cybersecurity terms — was a statement condemning the Basque terrorist group ETA, a fact that Quintero had never disclosed.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe tipster then gave Quintero a name — Antonio Astorga — but also shared the news that he had passed away. \nThis hit Quintero like a ton of bricks; now, he would never be able to ask Antonio about “Kike.” But he kept following the thread, and the plot twist came from Antonio’s sister, who revealed that his first name was actually Antonio Enrique. To his family, he was Kike.\nCancer took away Antonio Enrique Astorga before Quintero could thank him in person, but the story doesn’t stop here. Quintero’s LinkedIn post sheds new light to the legacy of “a brilliant colleague who deserves to be recognized as a pioneer of cybersecurity in Málaga” — and not just for helping Quintero discover his vocation.\nAccording to his friend, Astorga’s virus had no other goal than to spread his anti-terrorist message and proving himself as a programmer. Mirroring Quintero’s path, Astorga’s interest in IT endured, and he became a computing teacher at a secondary school that named its IT classroom after him in his memory. \nAstorga’s legacy also lives on beyond these walls, and not just through his students. One of his sons, Sergio, is a recent software engineering graduate with an interest in cybersecurity and quantum computing — a meaningful connection for Quintero. “Being able to close that circle now, and to see new generations building on it, is deeply meaningful to me,” Quintero said.\nFor Quintero, who suspects their paths will cross again, Sergio is “very representative of the talent being formed in Málaga today.” This, in turn, is a result of VirusTotal forming the root of what eventually became the Google Safety Engineering Center (GSEC) and spearheading collaborations with the University of Málaga that made the city a true cybersecurity talent hub.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "description": "\nWaymo appears to be testing adding Google’s Gemini AI chatbot to its robotaxis in an effort to integrate an AI assistant that would accompany riders ",
    "body": "\nWaymo appears to be testing adding Google’s Gemini AI chatbot to its robotaxis in an effort to integrate an AI assistant that would accompany riders and answer their queries, according to findings by researcher Jane Manchun Wong.\n“While digging through Waymo’s mobile app code, I discovered the complete system prompt for its unreleased Gemini integration,” Wong wrote in a blog. “The document, internally titled ‘Waymo Ride Assistant Meta-Prompt,’ is a 1,200+ line specification that defines exactly how the AI assistant is expected to behave inside a Waymo vehicle.”\nThe feature hasn’t shipped in public builds, but Wong says the system prompt makes it clear that this is “more than a simple chatbot.” The assistant is said to have the ability to answer questions, manage certain in-cabin functions like climate control, and, if required, reassure riders. \n“While we have no details to share today, our team is always tinkering with features to make riding with Waymo delightful, seamless, and useful,” Julia Ilina, a spokesperson for Waymo, told TechCrunch. “Some of these may or may not come to our rider experience.”\nThis wouldn’t be the first time Gemini has been integrated into the Alphabet-owned self-driving company’s stack. Waymo says it has used Gemini’s “world knowledge” to train its autonomous vehicles to navigate complex, rare, and high-stakes scenarios. \n\nWong writes the assistant is instructed to possess a clear identity and purpose: “a friendly and helpful AI companion integrated into a Waymo autonomous vehicle” whose primary goal is “to enhance the rider’s experience by providing useful information and assistance in a safe, reassuring, and unobtrusive manner.” The bot is directed to use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon, and is instructed to keep its responses succinct to one to three sentences. \nAccording to the system prompts, when a rider activates the assistant via the in-car screen, Gemini can choose from a set of pre-approved greetings personalized with the rider’s first name. The system can also access contextual data about the rider, like how many Waymo trips they’ve been on. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe prompts currently let Gemini access and control in-car features, like the temperature, lighting and music. Notably absent from the function list are volume control, route changes, seat adjustment, and window control, Wong pointed out. If a rider asks for a feature that Gemini can’t control, the bot is to reply with “aspirational phrases,” like, “It’s not something I can do yet.”\nInterestingly, the assistant is directed to maintain a clear distinction between its identity as Gemini the AI bot and the autonomous driving technology (the Waymo Driver). So when replying to a question such as, “How do you see the road?” Gemini shouldn’t say “I use a combination of sensors,” and instead should reply, “The Waymo Driver uses a combination of sensors…”\nThe system prompts include a range of compelling tidbits, such as how the bot is meant to handle being asked questions about competitors like Tesla or the now-defunct Cruise, or which trigger keywords will get it to stop talking. \nThe assistant is also directed to avoiding speculating on, explaining, confirming, denying, or commenting on real-time driving actions or specific driving events. So if a passenger asks about a video they saw of a Waymo hitting something, the bot is instructed to not answer directly and deflect.\n“Your role is not to be a spokesperson for the driving system’s performance, and you must not adopt a defensive or apologetic tone,” the prompt reads.\nThe in-car assistant is allowed to answer general knowledge questions like about the weather, the height of the Eiffel Tower, what time the local Trader Joe’s closes, and who won the last World Series. It is not allowed to take real-world actions like ordering food, making reservations, or handling emergencies. \nWaymo isn’t the only company integrating AI assistants into driverless vehicles. Tesla is doing something similar with xAI’s Grok. The two different car assistants serve different functions, however. Gemini appears to be programmed to be more pragmatic and ride-focused, while Grok is pitched more as an in-car buddy that can handle long conversations and remember context from previous questions. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence. Her work has also appeared in Forbes, Bloomberg, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, and other publications. \r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Rebecca by emailing rebecca.bellan@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at rebeccabellan.491 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nThe excitement for the European startup market was hard to ignore at the annual Slush conference in Helsinki last month. But the actual data on the state of the region’s venture market shows a different reality.\nThe upshot: The European market has not recovered from the global venture capital reset that occurred in 2022 and 2023. But there is evidence it is on the cusp of a turnaround, including Klarna’s recent exit and the region’s homegrown AI startups garnering attention from local investors and beyond.\nInvestors poured €43.7 billion ($52.3 billion) into European startups in 2025 across 7,743 deals through the third quarter, according to PitchBook data. That means the yearly total is on pace to match — not exceed — the €62.1 billion invested in 2024 and €62.3 billion in 2023. \nIn comparison, U.S. venture deal volume in 2025 had already surpassed 2022, 2023, and 2024 by the end of the third quarter, according to PitchBook data.\nDeal recovery isn’t Europe’s biggest problem, though — it’s VC firm fundraising. Through Q3 2025, European VC firms raised a mere €8.3 billion ($9.7 billion), which puts Europe on track for its lowest overall fundraising yearly total in a decade.\n“Fundraising, LP to GP, is definitely the weakest area within Europe,” Navina Rajan, a senior analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. “We’re on track for around 50% to 60% decline in the first nine months of this year. A lot of that is made up now by emerging managers versus experienced firms, and the mega funds that closed last year haven’t repeated this year.”\nWhile Rajan doesn’t share the same fever that oozed out of attendees at Slush, she pointed to a few positive data points that suggest the European market is turning around.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor one, the participation of U.S. investors in European startup deals is back on the rise. Rajan said that figure dipped to a low in 2023 when U.S.-based VCs participated in just 19% of European venture deals. It has been steadily on the rise since, she said.\n“They seem pretty optimistic on the European market,” Rajan said. “Just from an entry point of view, because you think about valuations, especially within AI tech and in the U.S., it’s just impossible to get in now, whereas, if you’re in Europe and your multiples are lower, and you’re new as an investor, it just provides a better entry point for perhaps similar tech.”\nSwedish vibe-coding startup Lovable is one example of this shift. Vibe-coding companies have raised a lot of VC money in the United States. But U.S. investors also clearly love Lovable. The company just announced a new $330 million Series B round that was both led by and participated in by a slew of U.S.-based VCs, including Salesforce Ventures, CapitalG, and Menlo Ventures, among others.\nFrench AI research lab Mistral has seen similar love from U.S.-based firms. Mistral landed a €1.7 billion Series C round in September that included Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, and Lightspeed.\nKlarna’s recent exit also suggests a turnaround is underway.\nSwedish fintech giant Klarna went public in September after raising $6.2 billion across two decades in the private market. That exit likely recycled some capital back to European LPs or gave them confidence in a changing exit environment.\nFor Victor Englesson, a partner at Swedish EQT, the recent European success stories, like Klarna, have started to change how founders in Europe approach building their companies.\n“Ambitious founders have seen what great looks like in companies like Spotify, Klarna, Revolut and are now starting companies with that type of ambition,” Englesson told TechCrunch. They’re not starting companies with like, I want to win in Europe, or I want to win in Germany. They start companies with a mindset that I want to win globally. I don’t think we have seen that to the same extent before.”\nThat mindset has EQT, and others, bullish on Europe. \n“For EQT, we’ve invested $120 billion in Europe [over the] last five years,” Englesson said. “We’re going to invest $250 billion [over the] next five years in Europe. So we are extremely committed to Europe.”\n",

    "body": "\nIf you’re a parent with young children, then you’ll probably hear this a lot on Christmas Eve: “Where’s Santa right now?” With tracking tools like the NORAD Santa Tracker and Google’s Santa Tracker, everyone can know when Father Christmas will arrive. Plus, there are now some new AI tools to bring the holiday magic.\nHere’s how to follow Santa’s journey this Christmas Eve with the help of AI.\nTrack Santa Claus with NORAD\nNORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) had the first ever Santa tracker in 1955. While it used to be just a boring animation of Santa’s sleigh and reindeer flying across a map, NORAD has added tons of features since then, such as fun mini-games, videos, stories, and Christmas music.\nRecently, NORAD’s Santa Tracker teamed up with OpenAI to introduce new AI-powered features. These include an image generator that transforms your selfie into an animated elf character, a tool for generating toy ideas and converting them into printable coloring book pages, and a fill-in-the-blank storytelling tool that allows families to add names, places, and other details to create a fun holiday story to read aloud.\nImage Credits:NORAD\nRather than a 2D model, the NORAD Santa tracker has a 3D visual depiction of Santa’s journey, as the platform was built on Cesium’s open source 3D mapping library. It also uses Bing Maps satellite imagery, making the globe look more “realistic.”\nAlong with the tracker tool, users can also see a “Santa Cam,” which has videos of Santa making his way around the world to deliver presents to every kid on the nice list.\nNORAD’s website has Santa’s North Pole Village, which includes a holiday countdown, arcade-style games, kid-friendly music, an online library, and various videos that can be watched on NORAD’s official YouTube channel.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNORAD Santa tracker is available on noradsanta.org, or you can download the official NORAD Tracks Santa Claus app on Apple’s App Store or the Google Play Store. The website is available in English, Chinese, French, Spanish, Japanese, German, Italian, and Portuguese.\nYou can also track Santa through NORAD Tracker’s social media accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter/X, and Instagram.\nFor a more personable experience, call 1-877-HI-NORAD (1-877-446-6732), and you’ll speak with a volunteer from the organization’s call center who’ll update you on Santa’s location.\nTrack Santa Claus with Google\nGoogle’s Santa Tracker launched in 2004 and simulates the tracking of Santa. The website features a live map of Santa’s current location, his next stop, a live video feed of his route, and the estimated arrival time for each location. It also shows the total distance that Santa has traveled so far and the number of presents he has delivered.\nImage Credits:Google\nThroughout December, the page operates as Santa’s Village, where users can play mini-games, take quizzes, watch animated videos, and explore other interactive activities. For instance, players can build their own elf in Google’s “Elf Maker” game as well as host a concert with “Elf Jamband.” Kids can also learn how to code with easy and fun tutorials like “Code Boogie.”\nAdditionally, users can enlist the help of Google Assistant to learn about Santa’s whereabouts. You can ask, “Hey, Google, where’s Santa?” or even “What’s new at the North Pole?” which lets you tune in to Google’s North Pole Newscast, where you can hear what Santa and his elves are up to that day. Google Assistant also lets you call Santa himself.\nThis story was updated after publication. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nThere was a time when most Americans had little to no knowledge about their local data center. Long the invisible but critical backbone of the internet, server farms have rarely been a point of interest for folks outside of the tech industry, let alone an issue of particularly captivating political resonance.\nWell, as of 2025, it would appear those days are officially over. \nOver the past 12 months, data centers have inspired protests in dozens of states, as regional activists have sought to combat America’s ever-increasing compute buildup. Data Center Watch, an organization tracking anti-data center activism, writes that there are currently 142 different activist groups across 24 states that are organizing against data center developments.\nActivists have a variety of concerns: the environmental and potential health impacts of these projects, the controversial ways in which AI is being used, and, most importantly, the fact that so many new additions to America’s power grid may be driving up local electricity bills.\nSuch a sudden populist uprising appears to be a natural response to an industry that has grown so quickly that it’s now showing up in people’s backyards. Indeed, as the AI industry has swelled to dizzying heights, so, too, has the cloud computing business. Recent U.S. Census Bureau data shows that, since 2021, construction spending on data centers has skyrocketed a stunning 331%. Spending on these projects totals in the hundreds of billions of dollars. So many new data centers have been proposed in recent months that many experts believe that a majority of them will not — and, indeed, could not possibly — be built.\nThis buildout shows no signs of slowing down in the meantime. Major tech giants — including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — have all announced significant capital expenditure projections for the new year, a majority of which will likely go toward such projects.\nNew AI infrastructure isn’t just being pushed by Silicon Valley but by Washington, D.C., where the Trump administration has made artificial intelligence a central plank of its agenda. The Stargate Project, announced in January, set the stage for 2025’s massive AI infrastructure buildout by heralding a supposed “re-industrialization of the United States.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the process of scaling itself exponentially, an industry that once had little public exposure has suddenly been thrust into the limelight — and is now suffering backlash. Danny Cendejas, an activist with the nonprofit MediaJustice, has been personally involved in a number of actions against data centers, including a protest that took place in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year, where locals came out to decry the expansion of Colossus, a project from Elon Musk’s startup, xAI.\nCendejas told TechCrunch that he meets new people every week who express interest in organizing against a data center in their community. “I don’t think this is going to stop anytime soon,” he said. “I think it’s going to keep building, and we’re going to see more wins — more projects are going to be stopped.”\nEvidence in support of Cendejas’ assessment is everywhere you look. Across the country, communities have reacted to newly announced server farms in much the same way the average person might react to the presence of a highly contagious plague. In Michigan, for instance, where developers are currently eyeing 16 different locations for potential data center construction, protesters recently descended upon the state’s capitol, saying things like: “Michiganders do not want data centers in our yards, in our communities.” Meanwhile, in Wisconsin — another development hot spot — angry locals appear to have recently dissuaded Microsoft from using their town as a headquarters for a new 244-acre data center. In Southern California, the tiny city of Imperial Valley recently filed a lawsuit to overturn its county’s approval of a data center project, expressing environmental concerns as the rationale.\nThe discontent surrounding these projects has gotten so intense that politicians believe it could make or break particular candidates at the ballot box. In November, it was reported that rising electricity costs — which many believe are being driven by the AI boom — could become a critical issue that determines the 2026 midterm elections.\n“The whole connection to everybody’s energy bills going up — I think that’s what’s really made this an issue that is so stark for people,” Cendejas told TechCrunch. “So many of us are struggling month to month. Meanwhile, there’s this huge expansion of data centers…[People are wondering] Where is all that money coming from? How are our local governments giving away subsidies and public funds to incentivize these projects, when there’s so much need in our communities?”\nIn some cases, protests appear to be working and even halting (if only temporarily) planned developments. Data Center Watch claims that some $64 billion worth of developments have been blocked or delayed as the result of grassroots opposition. Cendejas is certainly a believer in the idea that organized action can halt companies in their tracks. “All this public pressure is working,” he said, noting that he could sense a “very palpable anger” around the issue.\nUnsurprisingly, the tech industry is fighting back. Earlier this month, Politico reported that a relatively new trade group, the National Artificial Intelligence Association (NAIA), has been “distributing talking points to members of Congress and organizing local data center field trips to better pitch voters on their value.” Tech companies, including Meta, have been taking out ad campaigns to sell voters on the economic benefits of data centers, the outlet wrote. In short: The tech industry’s AI hopes are pegged to a compute buildout of epic proportions, so for now it’s safe to say that in 2026 the server surge will continue, as will the backlash and polarization that surround it.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nMill may have started with households, but co-founder and CEO Matt Rogers says the food waste startup has long aspired to expand to commercial customers. \n“This has been part of our plan since our Series A deck,” Rogers told TechCrunch.\nNow, with an official deal locked in with Amazon and Whole Foods the company’s plan to profit from handling other people’s food waste is a bit more public. \nWhole Foods will deploy a commercial-scale version of Mill’s food waste bin in each of its grocery stores beginning in 2027. The bins will grind and dehydrate waste from the produce department, reducing costly landfill fees while also providing feed for the company’s egg producers. Both trim the company’s overhead and lower its ecological footprint.\nAt the same time, Mill’s bins will collect data to help Whole Foods understand what gets wasted and why, helping the grocer further control costs. “Ultimately, our goal is not just to make their waste operations more efficient, but also to move upstream so they actually waste less food,” Rogers said.\nThe company started selling food waste bins to households a few years ago. As can be expected from a team that made the Nest thermostat, the devices are well designed and — to lean on a Silicon Valley cliché — they can be a delight to use. My kids got a kick out of the bins while testing the first and second generations.\n“Starting in consumer was very intentional because you build the proof points, you build the data, the brand, loyalty,” Rogers said. Many members of the Whole Foods team were already familiar with Mill when the two companies started talking.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“It’s actually kind of our enterprise sales strategy,” Rogers continued. “We have conversations with senior leadership at our various ideal customers, and if they haven’t had Mill at home yet, we say, ‘Hey, try Mill at home, see what your family thinks.’ It is a surefire way of getting folks excited.”\nThe startup began having conversations with Whole Foods about a year ago, Rogers said. In the ensuing months, Mill demonstrated the consumer version in some of the chain’s grocery stores. \nMill has also developed an AI that uses a range of sensors to determine whether food that enters the bin should still be on the shelf. Minimizing “shrink” — the industry’s term for sales lost through waste or theft — can give grocers an edge in a cutthroat market.\nAdvances in large language models have been key, Rogers said. When he and Mill co-founder Harry Tannenbaum were at Nest, it took dozens of engineers and a “Google budget” more than a year to train Nest Cameras to recognize people and packages. With new LLMs, Mill only needed a handful of engineers and far less time to deliver superior results, according to Rogers, who said “AI is a huge enabler.”\nThe use of AI allowed Mill to deliver a commercial version faster, diversifying its customer base and source of revenue. \n“If you are a single channel, single customer business, you’re fragile,” Rogers said. “I grew up at Apple during the iPod era,” he said. “Apple at the time was a single leg business. iPod was like 70% of company revenue. This was why we did the iPhone. Steve [Jobs] pushed us really hard on the iPhone because he was worried that folks like Motorola — who were working on smartphones at the time — would start to eat our lunch on the iPod business and that that would crush us. We needed to build another leg of the stool.” \nAnd it seems that Mill isn’t finished adding legs to its figurative stool. Rogers said it’s working on building out a municipal business as well.\n“We’re continuing to add more legs to the stool and adding more diversity to the business,” he said. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "\nFrench startup Ÿnsect shot into the spotlight when “Iron Man” star Robert Downey Jr. touted its merits on the Late Show during Super Bowl weekend 202",
    "body": "\nFrench startup Ÿnsect shot into the spotlight when “Iron Man” star Robert Downey Jr. touted its merits on the Late Show during Super Bowl weekend 2021. Now, nearly four years later, the insect farming company has been placed into judicial liquidation — essentially bankruptcy — for insolvency. \nThe company’s demise is hardly a surprise, as Ÿnsect had been embattled for months. Still, there is plenty to unpack about how a startup can go bankrupt despite raising over $600 million, including from Downey Jr’s FootPrint Coalition, taxpayers, and many others.\nUltimately, Ÿnsect failed to fulfill its ambition to “revolutionize the food chain” with insect-based protein. But don’t be too quick to attribute its failure to the ‘ick’ factor that many Westerners feel about bugs. Human food was never its core focus. \nInstead, Ÿnsect focused on producing insect protein for animal feed and pet food, two markets with very different economics and margins that the company never quite chose between.\nThat indecision extended to its M&A strategy. In 2021, Ÿnsect acquired Protifarm, a Dutch company raising mealworms for human food applications, adding a third market to the mix. Even as the company announced the deal, then-CEO Antoine Hubert admitted it would take a couple of years for human food to represent just 10% to 15% of Ÿnsect’s revenue. \n“We still see pet food and fish feed being the largest contributor to our revenues in the coming years,” Hubert declared at the time. In other words, Ÿnsect was acquiring a company in a market segment that would remain marginal for years — at a time when the startup desperately needed revenue growth.\nAnd revenue was the problem. According to publicly available data, Ÿnsect’s revenue from its main entity peaked at €17.8 million in 2021 (approximately $21 million) — a figure reportedly inflated by internal transfers between subsidiaries. By 2023, the company had racked up a net loss of €79.7 million ($94 million).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo how did a company with such meager revenue raise over $600 million? The answer wasn’t hype-driven crossover funds paying ambitious multiples during the 2021 funding frenzy. Instead, Ÿnsect attracted impact-focused investors like Astanor Ventures and public investment bank Bpifrance that bought into a compelling sustainability vision.\nIts pitch to them was simple — offering an alternative to resource-intensive proteins like fishmeal and soy. That same thesis also attracted significant capital to competitors like Better Origin and Innovafeed, and it seemed promising. \nBut the vision collided with market reality. Animal feed is a commodity market driven by price, not sustainability premiums. In a perfect world, insect protein would be fully circular, with insects fed on food waste that would otherwise go to landfill. But in practice, factory-scale insect production typically ends up relying on cereal byproducts that are already usable as animal feed — meaning insect protein just adds an expensive extra step. For animal feed, the math simply wasn’t working.\nŸnsect eventually recognized this. Pet food proved to be a different equation: it is less price-driven than animal feed and a far better market for insect protein, even with competition from other alternative proteins such as lab-grown meat. By 2023, the company refocused its strategy on pet food and other higher-margin segments, with Hubert citing broader economic pressures. \n“In an environment where there is inflation on energy and raw materials but also on the cost of capital and debt, we cannot afford to invest loads of resources in markets which are the least remunerative (animal feed), while you have other markets where there is a lot of demand, good returns and higher margins,” Hubert said at the time.\nThe 2023 pivot to pet food came too late. By then, Ÿnsect had already committed to a massive, capital-intensive bet that would ultimately doom the company. That bet was Ÿnfarm, a “giga-factory” in Northern France that the company billed “the world’s most expensive bug farm.” Built for insect production at scale, the facility consumed hundreds of millions in funding — money spent before Ÿnsect had proven its business model or figured out its unit economics.\nTo oversee Ÿnfarm’s launch, Ÿnsect brought in Shankar Krishnamoorthy, a former executive at French energy giant Engie. When that move to pet food failed to save the company, Krishnamoorthy replaced Hubert as CEO.\nŸnsect then shut down the production plant it had acquired from Protifarm and cut jobs. But shuttering one facility while operating a giga-factory built for the wrong market couldn’t solve the fundamental problem.\nFor Professor Joe Haslam, who teaches a course on Scaling Up in the MBA Program at IE Business School, “Ÿnsect’s struggles are not a mystery and not mainly about insects. They are the result of a mismatch between industrial ambition, capital markets, and timing, compounded by some execution and strategy choices.”\nThe fact that Ÿnsect failed doesn’t mean the entire insect farming sector is doomed. Competitor Innovafeed is reportedly holding up better, in part because it started with a smaller production site and is ramping up incrementally.\nFor Prof. Haslam, Ÿnsect exemplifies a broader European problem. “Ÿnsect is a case study in Europe’s scaling gap. We fund moonshots. We underfund factories. We celebrate pilots. We abandon industrialization. See Northvolt [a struggling Swedish battery maker], Volocopter [a German air taxi startup, and Lilium [a failed Germany flying taxi company],” he said.\nThe failure has prompted some soul-searching. Hubert himself co-founded Start Industrie, an association advocating for policies to support French industrial startups — a recognition that Europe needs more than just funding to build the next generation of deep-tech companies.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nAutomaker Stellantis and Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai have signed a nonbinding agreement to build robotaxis for deployment in Europe.  \nThe collaboration will integrate Pony’s self-driving software into Stellantis’ electric medium-size van platform, which is built with advanced sensors to support autonomous vehicles.\nThe companies plan to first deploy test vehicles based on the Peugeot e-Traveller model. Testing will begin in Luxembourg, Pony’s European headquarters, in the coming months, with plans to roll out more vehicles across European cities starting in 2026.  \nThe tie-up comes a few months after Pony announced a partnership with Uber to deploy in international markets, including Europe and the Middle East. It also comes after the company received an autonomous vehicle testing permit from Luxembourg in April. \nAs Pony.ai works to expand beyond its existing markets in China and carve out market share in Europe, the company is also chasing a second IPO. Already listed on the Nasdaq, Pony is also pursuing a secondary listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.  \n",

    "body": "\nSenate Republicans shared a deepfake video of Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, designed to make it seem like Democrats are celebrating the ongoing government shutdown, which has lasted 16 days.  \nIn the deepfake, an AI-generated Schumer repeats the phrase “every day gets better for us,” an actual quote taken out of context from a Punchbowl News article. In the original story, Schumer discussed the Democrats’ healthcare-focused shutdown strategy, and said they were not going to back away from Republicans’ playbook of threats and “bambooz[ling].” \nThe shutdown is happening because Democrats and Republicans cannot agree to pass a bill funding government through October and beyond. Democrats are trying to hold on to tax credits that would make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans, secure a reversal to Trump’s Medicaid cuts, and block cuts to government health agencies.\nThe video was posted Friday on the Senate Republicans’ X account. According to X’s policies, the platform prohibits “deceptively shar[ing] synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm.” Harmful content includes media that could “mislead people” or “cause significant confusion on public issues.” \nEnforcement actions include removing content, labeling warnings, or reducing visibility. X has not, as of the time of this writing, removed the deepfake or added a warning label — though the video does include a watermark denoting its AI origins. \nThe Schumer video is not the first time X has allowed deepfakes of politicians to remain on the platform. In late 2024, X owner Elon Musk shared a manipulated video of former vice president Kamala Harris in the lead-up to the election, sparking debate about misleading voters.  \nTechCrunch has reached out to X for comment. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nUp to 28 states have enacted laws prohibiting deepfakes of political figures, specifically around campaigns and elections, though most don’t outright ban them if they have clear disclosures. California, Minnesota, and Texas have banned deepfakes intended to influence elections, deceive voters, or harm candidates. \nThe latest post comes weeks after President Donald Trump posted deepfakes on Truth Social depicting Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, making false statements about immigration and voter fraud. \nResponding to criticism of the lack of honesty and ethics, Joanna Rodriguez, the National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director, said: “AI is here and not going anywhere. Adapt & win or pearl clutch & lose.” \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nWhatsApp is attempting to solve its spam problem by curbing how many messages individual users and businesses can send to unknown people without getting a response.\nWhile the app started as an easy way to send messages to personal contacts, over time, it has become more complex with groups, communities, and business messaging. With those changes, people are getting more messages than ever, and it is hard to catch up with all of them.\nAll messages users and businesses send to others will count against this new per-month limit, unless they get a response. For instance, if you meet someone at a conference and send three messages, that counts against the limit.\nWhatsApp hasn’t said what the limit will be, as it’s testing different limits during this time.  \nHowever, when a business or an individual is about to hit the limit, the app will display a warning to those users with a pop-up showing the count, so they can avoid getting blocked from sending messages.\nThe company told TechCrunch that this test will be live in multiple countries in the coming weeks. It also said that average users won’t usually hit the limit, and their messaging experience won’t be affected. Instead, the controls are designed to be effective against people and businesses that blast messages and spam people.\nWhen I look at my WhatsApp inbox, I often find over 50 unread messages. When I try to see who sent them, a number of them are from businesses and unknown people. People around me have had similar experiences, as WhatsApp acts as a multiuse communication tool for a market like India, where I’m based.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOver the last year, WhatsApp has tried to curb some of this spammy behavior through tools and guardrails. In July 2024, the company started testing limits on how many marketing messages a business can send to people in a month. In 2024, it started floating an option for users to unsubscribe from marketing messages from businesses. This way, they can receive updates or get support from a business without getting spammed.\nEarlier this year, WhatsApp started experimenting by putting a limit on the number of broadcast messages users and businesses can send to others. The company said that it has started expanding this experiment in more than a dozen countries, including India, one of the company’s biggest markets with over 500 million users.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple announced on Friday that it has secured exclusive U.S. broadcasting rights to Formula 1. The new five-year agreement between the tech giant and Formula 1 will make Apple TV the exclusive streaming home for all Formula 1 races starting in the 2026 season, taking over from current broadcaster ESPN.\nAll practice, qualifying, Sprint sessions, and Grand Prix races will be available to Apple TV subscribers. Select races and all practice sessions will also be available for free in the Apple TV app throughout the season, Apple says.\nApple reportedly bid $140 million to $150 million annually for the rights, which is significantly more than the $85 million annually that ESPN currently pays for Formula 1. Apple’s deal is valued at about $750 million over the five-year term.\nThe move comes a few days after Apple rebranded its streaming service from “Apple TV+” to just “Apple TV,” ditching the plus sign. \nIt also follows Apple’s partnership with Formula 1 for the original film “F1 The Movie” starring Brad Pitt, which grossed $629 million worldwide this year, making it the highest-grossing sports movie of all time. The film is set to debut on Apple TV on December 12.\nIn addition to broadcasting Formula 1, Apple says it will amplify the sport across Apple News, Apple Maps, Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+. Plus, the Apple Sports app will feature live updates for every qualifying, Sprint, and race for each Grand Prix across the season, with real-time leaderboards, season driver and constructor standings, Live Activities to follow on the Lock Screen, and a Home Screen widget.\n“We’re thrilled to expand our relationship with Formula 1 and offer Apple TV subscribers in the U.S. front-row access to one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports on the planet,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services, in a press release. “2026 marks a transformative new era for Formula 1, from new teams to new regulations and cars with the best drivers in the world, and we look forward to delivering premium and innovative fan-first coverage to our customers in a way that only Apple can.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFormula 1 is the latest sport to join Apple TV’s lineup, alongside Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball. \nApple notes that Formula 1 is one of the fastest-growing leagues in the world, with a U.S. fanbase that reached 52 million in 2024. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIn Evelyn Mora’s early career, she realized that fashion designers, although often deeply focused on sustainability, couldn’t stage environmentally friendly large-scale fashion shows.  \nIn 2021, she launched VLGE, a gaming and immersive-world-building platform that specializes in working with brands. It lets brands build their own worlds, fill them with interactive content and games, and export said worlds to other platforms like Roblox. The product is revolutionizing what shopping could be in the future — a world where brands can create interactive worlds to connect with Gen Z rather than hosting fashion shows and filming campaigns.\nVLGE has worked with names such as Lancôme, Charlotte Tilbury, and Vogue Scandinavia, and has raised a total of $5 million in capital from investors such as Lammot J. du Pont of the du Pont family, L’Oréal Group, and the British Fashion Council.\nIt made headlines for launching the world’s first 3D and gamified fashion week. On Thursday, it announced plans to take things one step further. It said 50 fashion brands would launch their shoppable worlds for World Fashion Week, all powered by VLGE. World Fashion Week is an initiative of VLGE and is supposed to act as a bridge for creators to launch shoppable games on other platforms, like Roblox.\nImage Credits:Lucie Baudi\nMora said this is the brand’s first large-scale activation, showing how the platform can let users build across browsers and, first, on Roblox, in real time. She decided to focus on making Roblox easier for brands to use because of the market potential, she said. VLGE is also compatible with Unreal Engine and is working on compatibility with Meta Horizon World.\n“This is significant because Roblox has become fashion’s most powerful youth frontier, yet until now, world-building there has been costly, technical, and complex,” Mora told TechCrunch. “We make it instant, affordable, scalable, and interoperable, bridging the gap between e-commerce, gaming, and cultural creation.” \nIn other words, anyone building on VLGE can launch on Roblox instantly, without needing to know Roblox’s coding language or having any substantive background in tech at all. “They also don’t need to pay tens of thousands and wait for months to launch.” (It can cost anywhere between $10,000 and $100,000 for a brand to pay an agency to build a world on Roblox.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVLGE offers four payment tiers: Freemium, and three paid tiers for creators, small businesses, and enterprises, respectively. \nMora is banking on gamified commerce becoming the next frontier in fashion and said VLGE plans to launch an online store, an e-tail store, that will sell both physical items by emerging brands and 3D assets that can be exported into Roblox. The technology showcases how the fashion world is trying to make use of the increasing prominence of games and immersive worlds when it comes to connecting with the next generation.\n“This moment isn’t just about fashion; it’s about the infrastructure that will power the next generation of commerce for the new generation,” Mora said.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSouth Korean telco giant SK Telecom is making big changes at its new AI division, AI CIC, just weeks after it was launched. Staff employed by the unit are being offered a voluntary retirement program as part of a broader effort to bring together the company’s various AI-related divisions, SK Telecom confirmed to TechCrunch.\n“In late September, SK Telecom announced the launch of the AI CIC (Company-in-Company) unit and confirmed that detailed organizational restructuring would be specified by the end of October,” a spokesperson at SK Telecom told TechCrunch. “This special retirement program is entirely a supportive measure and is not intended as a restructuring or downsizing measure.”\nThe voluntary retirement program will not involve forced layoffs and is meant to support employees whose roles, organizations, or work locations may change, the spokesperson said. Employees who opt to stay with the company may be reassigned to regional offices.\nDetails of the voluntary retirement program have been communicated to staff across all experience levels, including both junior and senior employees, industry sources told TechCrunch. The AI unit has about 1,000 employees, per media reports.\nAI CIC is meant to bring together SK Telecom’s various AI-related units under a centralized organization, per the spokesperson. “This integration involves streamlining overlapping roles and functions, which may inevitably lead to changes such as role transitions, organizational realignments, or relocations,” they said.\nThe new division will oversee the development of SK Telecom’s personal AI agent, A. (pronounced “A-dot”), as well as its AI data center operations, enterprise AI business, and global AI partnerships and investments.\nSeverance packages are reportedly expected to vary based on employees’ tenure and position, but the spokesperson told TechCrunch the company has set no such internal targets. “As participation is entirely voluntary, it is difficult at this stage to predict [how many employees] it may impact on the organization as a whole,” the spokesperson said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe restructuring comes as SK Telecom seeks to streamline operations and boost efficiency, with a specific focus on AI. The company plans for the AI division to record annual revenue of ₩5 trillion (around $3.5 billion) by 2030, and expects AI-driven B2C and B2B services as well as related infrastructure to drive that growth.\nThe telecom giant recently unveiled an AI infrastructure effort, offering Nvidia Blackwell GPUs-as-a-service, and earlier this month partnered with OpenAI to develop AI data centers in southwestern Korea as part of the “Stargate Korea” initiative.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nThe Department of Energy said Thursday that it had finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to upgrade around 5,000 miles of transmission lines.\nThe grid upgrades would ease the flow of electricity in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The project, which will address lines owned by American Electric Power (AEP), won’t add any new routes, but it will help existing ones carry more power.\nAEP is one of the largest utilities and transmission line owners in the U.S., with operations spanning 11 states. The 5,000 miles that will be upgraded represent around 13% of the company’s total network.\nThe loan guarantee was initiated under the Biden administration just days before President Trump was inaugurated. Previously, the Trump administration has cited approvals occurring between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling projects.\nIt’s unclear what distinguished this grid modernization project from others that the Trump administration is considering canceling or in the process of canceling. \nIn Minnesota, the Department of Energy is moving to cancel a $467 million grant that would have helped unlock 28 gigawatts of new generating capacity, most of which would have been solar and wind. Another in Oregon would have issued $250 million in grants to connect half a dozen renewable projects.\nBut the largest transmission project the Trump administration wants to axe is a $630 million grant to modernize California’s grid. In many ways, it’s similar to the AEP project, looking to wring more out of the existing grid to ease congestion. As planned, the California project would test advanced conductors and dynamic line rating devices, both of which would allow old rights-of-way to carry more electricity. That’s frequently a cheaper option than building new power lines.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe AEP project will also rewire the lines with new conductors. The loan guarantee will allow the utility giant to secure a lower interest rate, saving the company at least $275 million, which it says will benefit its customers.\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright said that the loan will “ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States.” Already, the states included in the project have among the lowest electricity rates in the nation.\nThe loans are to be issued from the Loan Programs Office, which the GOP has renamed the Energy Dominance Financing Program. The office was established under the Energy Policy Act in 2005. Historically, the office had focused on clean energy and manufacturing projects. The loss rate on its loans is around 3%, far below that of private sector lenders.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

The features, which will be rolled out next year, include the ability to block certain characters and monitor conversation topics.\nStarting in the coming months, parents will be able to turn off chats with AI characters entirely for teens. This action won’t block access to the Meta AI chatbot — the company’s general-purpose AI chatbot — which will only discuss age-appropriate content.\nParents will also be able to turn off chats with individual characters if they prefer more selective control. Plus, they will receive information about the topics teens are discussing with AI characters and Meta AI.\nThe company said it plans to roll out these controls on Instagram early next year. They will be available in English in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia.\n“We recognize parents already have a lot on their plates when it comes to navigating the internet safely with their teens, and we’re committed to providing them with helpful tools and resources that make things simpler for them, especially as they think about new technology like AI,” the company said in a post written by Instagram head Adam Mosseri and newly appointed Meta AI head Alexandr Wang.\nEarlier this week, Meta said that its content and AI experiences for teens will follow a PG-13 movie rating standard and will avoid sensitive topics such as extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.\nThe company added that currently, teens are only allowed to interact with a limited number of characters that follow age-appropriate content guidelines. Parents can also set time limits on teens’ interactions with AI characters. Earlier this year, Instagram announced that it is using AI to identify attempting to skirt age limits by faking their age on the app.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn the past few weeks, multiple platforms, including OpenAI, Meta, and YouTube, have released tools and controls focused on teen safety.

    "body": "\nAustin Russell, the billionaire founder of Luminar, has made a bid to acquire the lidar maker five months after he was replaced as CEO following an ethics inquiry.\nThe takeover effort was disclosed in an SEC filing by Russell early Friday morning. It would involve his new company, Russell AI Labs, purchasing 100% of the outstanding shares of Luminar’s Class A Common Stock for an undisclosed price. \nIf it happens, Luminar would remain publicly traded, and Russell AI Labs may “acquire a different, larger global automotive technology company” and merge it with Luminar “to create a unified technology platform business (‘Luminar 2.0’),” according to the filing. If that happens, Russell may also invest in the newly combined company.\nThe proposal was made on October 14, “at the suggestion of certain shareholders” of Luminar and “the invitation of certain members of the board” — though the filing does not name names. Some of those board members approached Russell about the idea in September, according to a source familiar with the negotiations who was granted anonymity to speak about them. Luminar and Russell AI Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe proposed acquisition is just as sudden and surprising as Russell’s replacement in May. Luminar announced Russell’s resignation on May 19, the same day the company reported its first-quarter earnings. The company tapped former Xerox executive Paul Ricci to take over.\nThe company offered no details about why Russell was out aside from saying the board’s audit committee had conducted a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry.” Luminar has yet to explain what that inquiry found. It has been sued by shareholders multiple times over the move and the way it was disclosed.\nThat said, Russell is no stranger to takeover attempts. In 2023, he launched a bid to buy Forbes. But that ultimately failed after some of the investors in the acquisition reportedly didn’t follow through. The bid process was also marred by an alleged connection to a Russian oligarch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRussell has remained on Luminar’s board and was supposed to be “available to the incoming Chief Executive Officer on transition and technology matters,” according to the release. But he’s been absent in at least one way, by failing to have signed (in his capacity as a board member) any of the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission since being replaced.\nIn the meantime, Russell co-founded Russell AI Labs in September along with Markus Schäfer, CTO and board member of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Murtaza Ahmed, a former partner at the SoftBank Vision Fund. The new company claims it “backs and builds transformative AI and frontier technology companies” and has already taken a $300 million stake in agentic AI company Emergence. \nThis story has been updated with new information in the fourth paragraph about Luminar board members approaching Russell.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nChatGPT’s mobile app growth may have hit its peak, according to a new analysis of download trends and daily active users provided by the third-party app intelligence firm Apptopia. Its estimates indicate that new user growth, measured by percentage changes in new global downloads, slowed after April.\nThe firm looked at the global daily active user (DAU) growth and found that the numbers have begun to even out over the past month or so.\nGlobal DAUs for ChatGPT mobile app.Image Credits:Apptopia\nAlthough October is only half over, the firm says it’s on pace to be down 8.1% in terms of a month-over-month percentage change in global downloads.\nTo be clear, this is a look at download growth, not total downloads. In terms of sheer number of new installs, ChatGPT’s mobile app is still doing well, with millions of downloads per day. \nMonth-over-month change in downloads, worldwide.\nHowever, seeing the download growth stall can suggest that an app’s overall pace of growth is slowing. In ChatGPT’s case, increased competition and changes to its AI model’s characteristics could be to blame.\nDiving in deeper, other metrics indicate that average time spent per DAU in the U.S., specifically, has dropped 22.5% since July, and average sessions per DAU in the U.S. are also down by 20.7%.\nThis indicates that U.S. users are spending less time in ChatGPT’s app and are opening it fewer times per day. User churn in the U.S. has also dropped and stabilized during this time, indicating that the app is now retaining its core users and seeing fewer who just drop by briefly to experiment, then abandon the app.\nOpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. \nImage Credits:Apptopia\nBeyond simply reaching its peak, there are other factors that could have played a role here. That includes not only competition from Google’s Gemini, but also user engagement changes following an April update that was designed to make the chatbot’s AI model less sycophantic. This continued with the August release of GPT-5, which was said to be less personable, as well.\nHowever, Apptopia notes that ChatGPT’s average time spent per DAU and average sessions per DAU metrics were trending downward before the sharp rise of its competitor, Google’s Gemini, which shot up to the top charts in September thanks to the release of Google’s new AI image model, Nano Banana.\nSo while Gemini’s growth may have influenced some of the more recent drops in ChatGPT’s core metrics, it doesn’t explain the overall trend, the firm says. \nImage Credits:Apptopia\nPlus, Apptopia points out that if only average time spent per DAU was dropping, but not average sessions per DAU, it could have suggested that people were getting more efficient with their ChatGPT queries. But since both are on the decline, that’s not the case.\nInstead, Apptopia says it’s possible that the experimentation phase with the ChatGPT app is over, and now it’s becoming a part of users’ daily routines. People are likely using the app when they need it or remember to use it, as compared with the increased use it saw when it was still new.\nFor OpenAI, that means the company will have to invest in app marketing or release new features for it to boost some of these core metrics again, just as other established mobile apps have to do. It can no longer rely on novelty alone to provide growth.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nA Facebook feature that gives Meta AI the ability to suggest edits to photos stored on your phone’s camera roll but haven’t yet been shared is now rolling out to all users in the U.S. and Canada. The company announced on Friday that users can choose to opt in to receive these sharing suggestions, which will then prompt them to post photos to their Facebook Feed and Stories with the AI edits.\nFirst launched as a test over the summer, Facebook’s app pops up a permission dialog box requesting access to “allow cloud processing” so users can get “creative ideas made for you from your camera roll.” This box explains that the feature could offer ideas like collages, recaps, AI restyling, birthday themes, and more for the end user.\nImage Credits:screenshot of Facebook's app, June 2025\nFor the AI to work, Facebook’s app would upload images from your device to its cloud on an ongoing basis. This allows Meta’s AI to make its suggested edits. Meta says users’ media will not be used for ad targeting purposes, and it won’t use the media to improve its AI systems, unless the user takes the step of editing the media or sharing the edited photos with friends or others on its social network. \nThe feature can be disabled at any time.\nThough Meta may not train its AI on all your photos, when you agree to Meta’s AI Terms of Service, you permit your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. The terms say that, by processing your photos, Meta has the ability to “summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.” \nThe company also uses the date and presence of people or objects in your photos to craft its creative ideas, giving Meta a lot more information about you, your relationships, and your life. \nPlus, giving Meta access to photos you haven’t yet shared on Meta’s platforms could give the company an advantage in the AI race by providing a wealth of user data, behavioral insights, and ideas for new AI features.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:screenshot of Facebook's app, June 2025\nSettings for the feature are found under the Preferences section of Facebook’s Settings. On the “Camera roll sharing suggestions” page, there are two toggles. The first lets Facebook suggest photos from your camera roll when browsing the app. The second is where you could enable or disable the “cloud processing,” which lets Meta make AI images using your camera roll photos.\nMeta has been leveraging its position as a dominant social network to improve its AI technology and had previously announced it would train its image recognition AI on publicly shared data, including posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram. (EU users had until May 27, 2025, to opt out.) Last year, it also said it would train its AI on images that Ray-Ban Meta users asked the device to analyze.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "description": "\nSilicon Valley leaders including White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks and OpenAI Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon caused a stir online this week",
    "body": "\nSilicon Valley leaders including White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks and OpenAI Chief Strategy Officer Jason Kwon caused a stir online this week for their comments about groups promoting AI safety. In separate instances, they alleged that certain advocates of AI safety are not as virtuous as they appear, and are either acting in the interest of themselves or billionaire puppet masters behind the scenes.\nAI safety groups that spoke with TechCrunch say the allegations from Sacks and OpenAI are Silicon Valley’s latest attempt to intimidate its critics, but certainly not the first. In 2024, some venture capital firms spread rumors that a California AI safety bill, SB 1047, would send startup founders to jail. The Brookings Institution labeled the rumor as one of many “misrepresentations” about the bill, but Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed it anyway.\nWhether or not Sacks and OpenAI intended to intimidate critics, their actions have sufficiently scared several AI safety advocates. Many nonprofit leaders that TechCrunch reached out to in the last week asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to spare their groups from retaliation.\nThe controversy underscores Silicon Valley’s growing tension between building AI responsibly and building it to be a massive consumer product — a theme my colleagues Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and I unpack on this week’s Equity podcast. We also dive into a new AI safety law passed in California to regulate chatbots, and OpenAI’s approach to erotica in ChatGPT.\nOn Tuesday, Sacks wrote a post on X alleging that Anthropic — which has raised concerns over AI’s ability to contribute to unemployment, cyberattacks, and catastrophic harms to society — is simply fearmongering to get laws passed that will benefit itself and drown out smaller startups in paperwork. Anthropic was the only major AI lab to endorse California’s Senate Bill 53 (SB 53), a bill that sets safety reporting requirements for large AI companies, which was signed into law last month.\nSacks was responding to a viral essay from Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark about his fears regarding AI. Clark delivered the essay as a speech at the Curve AI safety conference in Berkeley weeks earlier. Sitting in the audience, it certainly felt like a genuine account of a technologist’s reservations about his products, but Sacks didn’t see it that way.\n\nAnthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering. It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem. https://t.co/C5RuJbVi4P— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) October 14, 2025\n\nSacks said Anthropic is running a “sophisticated regulatory capture strategy,” though it’s worth noting that a truly sophisticated strategy probably wouldn’t involve making an enemy out of the federal government. In a follow up post on X, Sacks noted that Anthropic has positioned “itself consistently as a foe of the Trump administration.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAlso this week, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon, wrote a post on X explaining why the company was sending subpoenas to AI safety nonprofits, such as Encode, a nonprofit that advocates for responsible AI policy. (A subpoena is a legal order demanding documents or testimony.) Kwon said that after Elon Musk sued OpenAI — over concerns that the ChatGPT-maker has veered away from its nonprofit mission — OpenAI found it suspicious how several organizations also raised opposition to its restructuring. Encode filed an amicus brief in support of Musk’s lawsuit, and other nonprofits spoke out publicly against OpenAI’s restructuring.\n\nThere’s quite a lot more to the story than this.As everyone knows, we are actively defending against Elon in a lawsuit where he is trying to damage OpenAI for his own financial benefit.Encode, the organization for which @_NathanCalvin  serves as the General Counsel, was one… https://t.co/DiBJmEwtE4— Jason Kwon (@jasonkwon) October 10, 2025\n\n“This raised transparency questions about who was funding them and whether there was any coordination,” said Kwon.\nNBC News reported this week that OpenAI sent broad subpoenas to Encode and six other nonprofits that criticized the company, asking for their communications related to two of OpenAI’s biggest opponents, Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. OpenAI also asked Encode for communications related to its support of SB 53.\nOne prominent AI safety leader told TechCrunch that there’s a growing split between OpenAI’s government affairs team and its research organization. While OpenAI’s safety researchers frequently publish reports disclosing the risks of AI systems, OpenAI’s policy unit lobbied against SB 53, saying it would rather have uniform rules at the federal level.\nOpenAI’s head of mission alignment, Joshua Achiam, spoke out about his company sending subpoenas to nonprofits in a post on X this week.\n “At what is possibly a risk to my whole career I will say: this doesn’t seem great,” said Achiam.\nBrendan Steinhauser, CEO of the AI safety nonprofit Alliance for Secure AI (which has not been subpoenaed by OpenAI), told TechCrunch that OpenAI seems convinced its critics are part of a Musk-led conspiracy. However, he argues this is not the case, and that much of the AI safety community is quite critical of xAI’s safety practices, or lack thereof.\n“On OpenAI’s part, this is meant to silence critics, to intimidate them, and to dissuade other nonprofits from doing the same,” said Steinhauser. “For Sacks, I think he’s concerned that [the AI safety] movement is growing and people want to hold these companies accountable.”\nSriram Krishnan, the White House’s senior policy advisor for AI and a former a16z general partner, chimed in on the conversation this week with a social media post of his own, calling AI safety advocates out of touch. He urged AI safety organizations to talk to “people in the real world using, selling, adopting AI in their homes and organizations.”\nA recent Pew study found that roughly half of Americans are more concerned than excited about AI, but it’s unclear what worries them exactly. Another recent study went into more detail and found that American voters care more about job losses and deepfakes than catastrophic risks caused by AI, which the AI safety movement is largely focused on.\nAddressing these safety concerns could come at the expense of the AI industry’s rapid growth — a trade-off that worries many in Silicon Valley. With AI investment propping up much of America’s economy, the fear of over-regulation is understandable. \nBut after years of unregulated AI progress, the AI safety movement appears to be gaining real momentum heading into 2026. Silicon Valley’s attempts to fight back against safety-focused groups may be a sign that they’re working.\n\n\n\n",

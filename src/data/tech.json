States with contested AI laws would also reportedly be threatened with the loss of federal broadband funding.\nNow, Reuters reports that the executive order has been put on hold. If signed, the order would probably face significant opposition, including from Republicans who previously criticized the proposed moratorium on state regulation.\nAI regulation has also been a controversial topic in Silicon Valley, with some industry figures — especially those in the Trump administration — attacking companies like Anthropic for supporting AI safety bills including California’s SB 53.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

    "body": "\nIn order to accelerate the construction of new power plants needed to provide energy for its data centers, Meta is looking to get into the business of trading electricity.\nBloomberg reports that both Meta and Microsoft are asking for federal approval to trade power (Apple has already received this approval). According to Meta, this will allow it to make long-term commitments to buy electricity from new plants, while mitigating the risk by having the ability to resell some of that power on wholesale power markets.\nMeta’s head of global energy, Urvi Parekh, told Bloomberg that power plant developers “want to know that the consumers of power are willing to put skin in the game.”\n“Without Meta taking a more active voice in the need to expand the amount of power that’s on the system, it’s not happening as quickly as we would like,” Parekh said.\nAs an example of the unprecedented energy needs underlying tech companies’ ambitious AI data center plans, Bloomberg notes that at least three new gas-powered plants will need to be built to power Meta’s Louisiana data center campus.\n",

Congress has put tight handcuffs on reorganizations, and plans typically require either congressional approval or the opportunity for congressional review,” Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, told E&E News.\nThe creation of the Office of Fusion was likely spurred to encourage commercialization of the technology. Previously, fusion fell under the Office of Science, which is focused on research rather than commercialization.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Climate\n",

    "body": "\nSierra, a 21-month-old, San Francisco-based startup that builds customer service AI agents for enterprises, announced on Friday that it reached $100 million in annual revenue run rate (ARR). The company’s rapid growth suggests that businesses across industries are embracing AI agents.\nThe startup’s growth rate surprised even its seasoned co-founders, former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor, who wrote on their blog: “That’s a heck of a lot quicker than we expected.”\nSierra’s customers include tech companies like Deliveroo, Discord, Ramp, Rivian, SoFi, and Tubi, as well as well-established businesses outside of the tech sector, such as ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM.\nTaylor and Bavor said they expected tech companies would feel comfortable experimenting with AI customer service agents, but they were astounded that older businesses also became Sierra’s customers.\nThe company says it can build AI agents that can handle tasks like authenticating patients for healthcare providers, processing returns, ordering replacement credit cards, and helping customers apply for mortgages — essentially automating customer service work that previously required human agents.\nSierra faces competition from startups like Decagon and Intercom, but the company claims to be the leader in the AI customer service category.\nSierra was last valued at $10 billion when it raised a $350 million round led by Greenoaks Capital in September. Other investors in the company include Sequoia, Benchmark, ICONIQ, and Thrive Capital.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBased on its $100 million ARR, Sierra is currently valued at a 100x revenue multiple, a hefty valuation despite its exceptionally fast growth.\nThe startup employs an outcomes-based pricing model, charging customers for completed work rather than charging flat subscription fees.\nTaylor and Bavor met at Google in 2005, where Taylor hired Bavor as an associate product manager.\nA Stanford computer science graduate, Taylor co-created Google Maps before founding FriendFeed, which Facebook acquired. At Facebook, he served as CTO and helped create the iconic “Like” button. He later founded Quip, a Google Docs competitor that Salesforce acquired for $750 million in 2016. \nTaylor went on to serve as Salesforce co-CEO alongside Marc Benioff for over a year. After Taylor left Salesforce in 2023, Bavor — who had spent 18 years at Google leading products like Gmail and Google Drive — invited him to lunch, where they decided to launch Sierra.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 along party lines on Thursday to scrap rules that required U.S. phone and internet giants to meet certain minimum cybersecurity requirements.\nThe FCC’s two Trump-appointed commissioners, chairman Brendan Carr and his Republican colleague Olivia Trusty, voted to withdraw the rules that require telecommunications carriers to “secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications.” The Biden administration had adopted these rules prior to leaving office earlier this year.\nThe FCC’s sole Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, dissented. In a statement following the vote, Gomez called the now-overturned rules the “only meaningful effort this agency has advanced” since the discovery of a sweeping campaign by a China-backed hacking group called Salt Typhoon that involved hacking into a raft of U.S. phone and internet companies.\nThe hackers broke into more than 200 telcos, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen, during the years-long campaign to conduct broad-scale surveillance of American officials. In some cases, the hackers targeted wiretap systems that the U.S. government previously required telcos to install for law enforcement access.\nThe FCC’s move to change the rules sparked rebuke from senior lawmakers, including Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Peters said he was “disturbed” by the FCC’s effort to roll back “basic cybersecurity safeguards” and warned that doing so will “leave the American people exposed.”\nSen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the rule change “leaves us without a credible plan” to address the basic security gaps exploited by Salt Typhoon and others.\nFor its part, the NCTA, which represents the telecommunications industry, praised the scrapping of the rules, calling them “prescriptive and counterproductive regulations.”\nBut Gomez warned that while collaboration with the telecommunications industry is valuable for cybersecurity, it is insufficient without enforcement.\n“Handshake agreements without teeth will not stop state-sponsored hackers in their quest to infiltrate our networks,” said Gomez. “They won’t prevent the next breach. They do not ensure that the weakest link in the chain is strengthened. If voluntary cooperation were enough, we would not be sitting here today in the wake of Salt Typhoon.”\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

The screenshots, which TechCrunch has seen, show dashboards containing links to company resources, including a user’s Okta dashboard used by employees for accessing internal apps.\nThe hackers claimed in the Telegram channel to have compromised CrowdStrike through a recent breach at Gainsight, a customer relationship management company that helps Salesforce customers track and manage their own customers’ data. The hackers said they used information stolen from Gainsight to break into CrowdStrike.\nBut CrowdStrike says the hackers’ claims are “false,” and says it terminated the insider’s access after the company “determined he shared pictures of his computer screen externally.”\n“Our systems were never compromised and customers remained protected throughout. We have turned the case over to relevant law enforcement agencies,” CrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch.\nSeveral other tech companies were allegedly hacked as part of the same campaign. Gainsight did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\nScattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a collective of hackers made up of several hacking groups, notably ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$. The group’s members use social engineering techniques to trick employees into granting them access to their systems or databases. \nIn October, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claimed to have stolen more than 1 billion records from corporate giants who rely on Salesforce to host their customer data. The hackers published a data leak site listing data stolen from companies, including insurance giant Allianz Life, the airline Qantas, carmaker Stellantis, credit bureau TransUnion, the employee management platform Workday, and others. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIn the early days of social media, posting a rant about the latest episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” on Myspace felt like the ultimate Thursday night activity. And discovering a Facebook group called “Team Jacob Forever” was one of the best finds.\nNowadays, finding that perfect niche community can seem impossible, but a new social app called Phictly aims to change that.\nAvailable on iOS and Android devices, the app lets users form clubs centered on their favorite books, TV shows, and movies, creating niche communities where people can discuss their specific interests without judgment.\nFor instance, users can dive into clubs for fantasy reads and gossip about Violet and Xaden in Rebecca Yarros’ “The Fourth Wing,” or reminisce about the early days of “Grey’s Anatomy.”\nImage Credits:Phictly\nThe app was created by Nyleena Aiken after she started a book club with her sisters and struggled to find books that interested everyone. She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time.\n“Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone’s fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.”\nKey features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. For example, those who enjoy speed reading or binge-watching can create or join clubs that last just a day or two, while those who prefer a slower pace can participate in clubs lasting up to 30 days.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnother notable feature allows users to post spoilers while hiding them until others reach that part of the story. Each spoiler is initially blurred, giving users the choice of when to reveal it, which helps everyone stay on the same page. Phictly also includes a “Talk Points” feature, allowing users to set check-in dates to discuss specific episodes or chapters and give everyone the opportunity to join the conversation.\nSimilar to Goodreads, users can also track what they are currently reading or watching, log titles, and set personal goals for their reading or viewing habits.\nFuture updates will introduce a matching system that pairs users based on shared interests, favorite genres, and common TV shows and books. The app will eventually expand to include clubs focused on video games.\nPhictly is free to download but may soon offer a premium subscription with additional features, such as the ability to create a private profile.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSpaceX rolled out an upgraded version of its Starship rocket booster in South Texas on Thursday to begin testing, and just a few hours later, something inside it exploded.\nLivestreamers who watch SpaceX’s Starbase complex closely caught the explosion in the pre-dawn hours Friday, around 4:00 a.m. local time. Other creators in the area have since captured photos that offer a closer look at the damage.\nUnlike the more fireball-type explosions SpaceX has dealt with while developing its rockets in the past, this one appears to have blown out an entire side of the lower section of the booster — and left the rest of it standing. It also happened very early in the process. The booster didn’t even have rocket engines installed yet, according to Ars Technica.\nSpaceX said in a post on X that it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened. The company says no one was hurt, as the area was cleared for testing. \n“The teams need time to investigate before we are confident of the cause,” SpaceX wrote Friday.\nThe booster was the first major piece of what SpaceX is referring to as Starship version three, or “V3.” Starship V3 is supposed to be larger, more powerful, more reliable, and capable of docking other Starships in orbit around the Earth — a crucial piece of SpaceX’s plan for getting to the moon and Mars. (The company flew the final V2 design in October.)\nIt’s not immediately clear what kind of impact the explosion could have on SpaceX’s next steps. But any significant delay to its testing program could put SpaceX’s overall plans at risk. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company has been aiming at a very busy 2026 for Starship. That includes demonstrating the ability to transfer fuel to Starship from a “tanker” version of the rocket while in orbit. SpaceX needs to prove that capability to NASA before it can proceed with crewed missions to the moon, which it is reportedly targeting for 2028.\nActing NASA administrator Sean Duffy has already criticized SpaceX for not moving quickly enough on its moon-mission progress, and has said he may want to give Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin a chance to take the contract instead.\nBlue Origin is picking up the pace on developing its own mega-rocket. Just last week, the company launched its New Glenn rocket for the second time and delivered its first commercial payload for NASA. The company also landed its first New Glenn rocket booster. On Thursday, the company revealed an even larger design for New Glenn that will more directly compete with Starship.\nThis story has been updated with new information from SpaceX.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nSilicon Valley folks tend to write off the startup market across the pond as too small or not hungry enough, but that sentiment could not be more different from how Europeans view their potential.\nHelsinki’s annual Slush conference this year showed a venture market that feels like it is on the brink of transformation, one that’s ready for its first trillion-dollar startup.\nFounders, venture investors and government officials alike acknowledged the hurdles that have traditionally held Europe back from reaching its true scale and potential. For many years, European founders moved to the U.S. to start their companies or exited earlier than they needed to since they were operating in a market that lacked local customers and cash.\nFirms including OMERs Ventures and Coatue made concerted efforts to enter Europe by opening offices in London after the pandemic, but have since shuttered those shops. OMERs, for example, let much of its European team go. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley firms have claimed in the last few years that to focus on innovation, startups and investors need to retreat to San Francisco.\nLargely, people think the kinks have been worked out: Multiple venture investors told TechCrunch at Slush that the notion of the market being undercapitalized, or that deeper U.S. pockets aren’t interested, is overblown.\nOne investor specifically said there is absolutely more U.S. capital in the European market now than five years ago. Plus, some headlines draw more attention than others: When OMERs Ventures announced its retreat, IVP and Andreessen Horowitz both said they were opening offices in London. (Andreessen later closed its office, too, alas.)\nThough the lure to head to the U.S. remains strong, European companies are also starting to find success in resisting pressure from U.S. investors to move to the Valley to build their companies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVibe-coding platform Lovable’s co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said during Slush that he credits the company’s rapid growth — $200 million in annual recurring revenue in only a year since launch — to the fact that the startup stayed put in Europe, instead opting to recruiting veteran Silicon Valley talent to Stockholm.\nTaavet Hinrikus, a partner at Plural who was the first hire at Estonia-founded Skype, said at Slush that the European market is about a decade behind the U.S., but startups have gone fully mainstream now in a way they hadn’t 10 years ago.\nAnother VC added that when he originally began investing in startups decades ago, startups and their revenue didn’t account for a noticeable portion of the region’s GDP or revenue, but now things have changed fundamentally, and the share startups hold will continue to grow.\nThe growing number of European success stories like Spotify and Klarna have also buffed up the region’s profile, giving founders the confidence to not exit early. They’ve also given startup employees the skills and financial security to strike out on their own.\nRegulators aren’t sitting by, either, and lately have been trying to make it easier for startups to find success. The EU is moving toward regulation changes that would allow startups to register in all EU countries at once, as opposed to just their native country, next year. Such steps present their own challenges, but the move is a step forward.\nHurdles remain, of course. European enterprises remain less likely than their American counterparts to experiment and implement startup tech. But the vibe at Slush could not be more optimistic. Europe looks ready to come into its own, even if it took a little longer to get there.\nAs Slush’s welcome banner put it: “Still doubting Europe? Go to Hel.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nHi, thanks as always for reading TechCrunch. We want to talk with you quickly about something important. \nA growing number of scammers are impersonating TechCrunch reporters and event leads and reaching out to companies, pretending to be our staff when they absolutely are not. These bad actors are using our name and reputation to try to dupe unsuspecting businesses. It drives us crazy and infuriates us on your behalf. It ebbs and flows. Judging by the increased number of emails we’re receiving, asking, “Does this person really work for you?” it appears to be happening more actively at the moment.\nAnecdotally, this isn’t just happening to us; fraudsters are exploiting the trust that comes with established news brands to get their foot in the door with companies across the media industry.\nHere’s an example of the most common scheme we’ve been tracking: Impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company’s products and requesting an introductory call.\nSharp-eyed recipients sometimes catch discrepancies in email addresses that don’t match our real employees’ credentials (see a list of bogus email addresses below). But more newly, they are hearing from fake reporters who claim to have address conventions that do match our own, making it tricker to recognize a TechCrunch employee from someone else claiming to be one. Indeed, the schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters’ writing styles, and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. Equally troubling, victims who agree to phone interviews tell us the fraudsters use those exchanges to dig for even more proprietary details. A PR rep told Axios that someone posing as a TechCrunch reporter raised suspicions when they shared a scheduling link.\nWhy are they doing this? We don’t know, though a reasonable guess is that these are groups looking for initial access to a network or other sensitive information. In fact, former colleagues at Yahoo say these attempts align with a persistent threat actor they’ve been tracking who has historically engaged in TechCrunch impersonation to facilitate account takeover (ATO) and data theft, targeting cryptocurrency, cloud, and other tech companies using various pretexts.\nAs for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they’re legitimate, please don’t just take their word for it. We’ve made it easy for you to verify.\nStart by checking our TechCrunch staff page. It’s the quickest way to see if the person contacting you actually works here. If the individual’s name isn’t on our roster, you’ve got your answer right there.\nIf you do see someone’s name on our staff page, but our employee’s job description doesn’t square with the request you are receiving (e.g., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business!), a bad actor may be trying to con you.\nIf it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask. You can learn how to reach each writer, editor, sales executive, marketing guru, and events team member in our bios.\nWe know it’s frustrating to have to double-check media inquiries, but these groups are counting on you not taking that extra step. By being vigilant about verification, you’re not just protecting your own company — you’re also helping preserve the trust that legitimate journalists depend on to do their jobs.\nThank you. And for your future reference, here’s a list of some of the TechCrunch impersonating domains that we’ve seen created within the last few months:\nemail-techcrunch[.]comhr-techcrunch[.]cominterview-techcrunch[.]commail-techcrunch[.]commedia-techcrunch[.]comnoreply-tc-techcrunch[.]comnoreply-techcrunch[.]compr-techcrunch[.]comtechcrunch-outreach[.]comtechcrunch-startups[.]infotechcrunch-team[.]comtechcrunch[.]aitechcrunch[.]biz[.]idtechcrunch[.]bztechcrunch[.]cctechcrunch[.]chtechcrunch[.]com[.]pltechcrunch[.]gltechcrunch[.]gstechcrunch[.]idtechcrunch[.]ittechcrunch[.]latechcrunch[.]lttechcrunch[.]net[.]cntechcrunch1[.]com\n",

    "body": "\nJust weeks before Australia’s social media ban for users under 16 takes effect, the country’s watchdog, eSafety, has added Twitch to the list of banned platforms.\nPinterest, however, was excluded, in line with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) rules.\nTwitch will no longer allow Australians under 16 to create accounts starting December 10, a Twitch spokesperson told TechCrunch. Existing accounts for users under 16 will be deactivated on January 9. Globally, Twitch is open to users 13 and older, and anyone under the legal age of adulthood in their region must have a parent or guardian involved, the spokesperson said.\nPinterest did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAustralia’s eSafety stated that Twitch is categorized as an “age-restricted social media platform” because the service is built around online social interaction and engagement features like livestreaming. Pinterest, on the other hand, is mainly used for collecting images and ideas, so it isn’t included in the age-restricted rules.\nAustralia has said its underage social media ban, which will go into effect on December 10, will apply to Meta‘s Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X, YouTube (except YouTube Kids and Google Classroom), Reddit, and the local streaming service, Kick. These platforms will be required to block account access for users under 16, according to a statement by the internet regulator. \nAbout a year ago, Australia passed a law banning social media use for children under 16. At the time, major tech companies like Google and Meta called on the government to delay enforcement until the country finished its age-verification trial. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe regulator provides a self-assessment tool to help platforms determine if they must follow the SMMA rules. \nOther countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., are taking similar steps to control who sees what content on the internet, though their approaches differ. Twenty-four U.S. states have so far enacted age-verification laws as of August 2025. Utah became the first to require app stores to verify users’ ages and obtain parental consent for minors downloading apps.\nThe U.K.’s Online Safety Act came into effect in July, mandating social media and other online platforms to block children’s access to harmful content or face huge fines. The U.K. requires strong age checks for high-risk content, like self-harm and eating disorder content, to protect users under 18.\n\n\n\tKate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

    "body": "\nElon Musk’s X has begun rolling out a new feature for user profiles that will display information about the account, including where it’s based, how many times the account has changed its username, the account’s original join date, and how the user downloaded the X app. The new information is meant to reduce inauthentic engagement on the platform, where bots often pretend to be humans — a problem that could get even harder to police in the age of AI.\nX’s plans for the feature were first announced in October, when X’s head of product Nikita Bier said the company would experiment with displaying this information on profiles, starting with his own account and those of X employees. The idea is that, by exposing these details, users would be able to make a more informed decision about whether they’re interacting with an authentic account or if the account was a bot or bad actor, looking to sow discord or spread misinformation.\nFor instance, if an X account’s bio claimed the user was from a U.S. state, but their account information shows that they’re based overseas, you might suspect they had another agenda. \nLast weekend, Bier responded to a post where a user had asked Elon Musk to require accounts to display information about where they’re based by saying to the user, “Give me 72 hours.”\nIn the days since, more people have seen the “About this account” feature become available on their own profiles.\nTo view your account information on the web or in the X mobile app, you’ll click on the “Joined” date on your profile. From here, you’re taken to a page that shows the date you joined Twitter/X, where your account is based, how many username changes have been done and when the last one was, and how you’re connected to X — like via the U.S. App Store or Google Play, for instance.\n\nBut while some users globally are reporting that the feature has appeared on their own profiles, TechCrunch is not able to access this account information on other people’s profiles as of press time. That could be because X wants to give users time to preview their information for accuracy and adjust their settings before it rolls out more broadly.\nSpecifically, X allows users to adjust whether or not the feature displays their country or if it only displays their geographical region. Originally, the company had said this would be an option in areas where free speech could have penalties, but we’re finding that even U.S. users can choose to set their profile to display either their country or their region/continent. (Country is the default, however.)\nImage Credits:X\nTo make the change, you can access the “About your account” setting under the X app’s “Privacy and Safety” settings. \nOne reverse engineer digging through the app’s code (see below) also found that X appears to be working on an additional feature that would display a warning on your account if you were using a VPN to mask your location. It’s unclear if or when that feature would go live, but if it does, it would flag to others that the user’s “country or region may not be accurate.”\nX did not respond to a request for comment about the rollout. However, Bier joked about all the recent sightings, indicating that people were seeing the feature as it began to roll out.\n\nX will show a warning on your account if you try to use a VPN to hide where your account is from when the upcoming \"About Your Account\" feature launches. \"One of our partners has indicated that you  may be connecting via a proxy—such as a VPN—which may change the country or… pic.twitter.com/vAOus842Br— Aaron (@aaronp613) November 15, 2025\n\nX is not the first social network to provide this level of transparency to users. Instagram has long offered a similar “About this account” feature, for instance.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nConventional wisdom suggests that climate tech is entering a winter season, where political and investor interest and investment levels are cooling — an ironic contrast with the climate itself, which keeps delivering years of record warmth. \nA new report from the International Energy Agency suggests there has never been a better time to go all-in on climate tech. In comparing it with the IEA’s stance from a decade ago, it’s clear the world’s expectations about the future have changed dramatically in less than a generation. \nIn 2014, the International Energy Agency assumed that, absent any international effort to rein in carbon pollution, emissions would continue to go up and to the right. Even the most optimistic forecast at the time predicted a linear increase, just with a lower slope. Those scenarios essentially took the trend line from the previous few years and extended it through 2050.\nFast forward to today, and the IEA’s current worst-case scenario is essentially 2014’s best case. A decade ago, without any major changes, the world was headed toward 46 metric gigatons of CO2 per year by 2040. If countries cut emissions as they had pledged, the best we could have hoped for was 38 metric gigatons per year by 2040.\nForecasts from the IEA have shifted significantly in the last decade.Image Credits:International Energy Agency/TechCrunch under a CC BY 4.0 (opens in a new window) license.\nToday, if countries continue with business as usual, the IEA expects emissions will level off at 38 metric gigatons per year. If countries follow through on their pledges, the IEA suggests we’ll hit about 33 metric gigatons per year by 2040. It’s still far off from what’s needed to hit net zero by 2050, but it’s a significant shift in a short amount of time.\nIf the IEA’s earlier projections turned out to be overly pessimistic compared with where we are today, what does that say about today’s projections?\nHow you answer that question depends on how you interpret trend lines. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen forecasting the future, do you analyze today’s data? Or do you look at that data in conjunction with how our expectations about the future have changed over time? (An even nerdier way to look at it is, do you view the world through a lens of algebra or calculus?)\nPut another way, will the world hit net zero in 2050? Today’s trend lines suggest we’ll miss that target by a wide margin. But if you look at how expectations have changed over the last decade, you might come up with a different answer. Instead, you might think the rate of change has increased, that we might be in the middle of an inflection point that starts to bend global emissions downward.\nThere are a few recent anecdotes to support the idea that we’re at an inflection point. \nIn Germany, sales of electric vehicles have set new records even after the government repealed incentives in 2023. In developing countries, renewables are reshaping the economies of developing countries, which were long thought to be among the last to adopt clean power. And China, which had previously refused to commit to reducing its carbon emissions, has now said its emissions will peak before 2030. \nHow the world views the future of carbon emissions has changed significantly over the past decade. A range of technologies have made that happen, including cheap solar and wind power paired with inexpensive batteries. \nIn the near future, geothermal energy and grid-optimizing software could propel the next leaps in optimism. For investors who agree, the upside could be dramatic.\nFor many climate tech investors, these days probably feel pretty gloomy. But amidst the gloom, there are still bright patches to be found.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "description": "\nGoogle has confirmed that hackers have stolen the Salesforce-stored data of more than 200 companies in a large-scale supply chain hack.\nOn Thursday, ",
    "body": "\nGoogle has confirmed that hackers have stolen the Salesforce-stored data of more than 200 companies in a large-scale supply chain hack.\nOn Thursday, Salesforce disclosed a breach of “certain customers’ Salesforce data” — without naming affected companies — that was stolen via apps published by Gainsight, which provides a customer support platform to other companies.  \nIn a statement, Austin Larsen, the principal threat analyst of Google Threat Intelligence Group, said that the company “is aware of more than 200 potentially affected Salesforce instances.”\nAfter Salesforce announced the breach, the notorious and somewhat-nebulous hacking group known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which includes the ShinyHunters gang, claimed responsibility for the hacks in a Telegram channel, which TechCrunch has seen. \nThe hacking group claimed responsibility for hacks affecting Atlassian, CrowdStrike, Docusign, F5, GitLab, Linkedin, Malwarebytes, SonicWall, Thomson Reuters, and Verizon.\n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about these Salesforce and Gainsight data breaches? Or other data breaches? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\nGoogle would not comment on specific victims.\nCrowdStrike’s spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch in a statement that the company is “not affected by the Gainsight issue and all customer data remains secure.” CrowdStrike confirmed to TechCrunch that it terminated a “suspicious insider” for allegedly passing information to hackers.\nTechCrunch reached out to all the companies mentioned by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. \nVerizon spokesperson Kevin Israel said in a statement that “Verizon is aware of the unsubstantiated claim by the threat actor,” without providing evidence for this claim. \nMalwarebytes spokesperson Ashley Stewart told TechCrunch that the company’s security team is “aware” of the Gainsight and Salesforce issues and “actively investigating the matter.”\nA spokesperson for Thomson Reuters said the company is “actively investigating.”\nMichael Adams, the chief information security officer at Docusign told TechCrunch in a statement that “following a comprehensive log analysis and internal investigation, we have no indication of Docusign data compromise at this time.” However, Adams said that, “out of an abundance of caution, we have taken a number of measures including terminating all Gainsight integrations and containing related data flows.”\nAt the time of publishing, none of the other companies responded to requests for comment.\nHackers with the ShinyHunters group told TechCrunch in an online chat that they gained access to Gainsight thanks to their previous hacking campaign that targeted customers of Salesloft, which provides an AI and chatbot-powered marketing platform called Drift. In that earlier case, the hackers stole Drift authentication tokens from those customers, allowing the hackers to break into their linked Salesforce instances and download their contents.\nAt the time, Gainsight confirmed it was among the victims of that hacking campaign. \n“Gainsight was a customer of Salesloft Drift, they were affected and therefore compromised entirely by us,” a spokesperson for the ShinyHunters group told TechCrunch.\nSalesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda told TechCrunch that “as a matter of policy, Salesforce does not comment on specific customer issues.”\nGainsight did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\nOn Thursday, Salesforce said there is “no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” effectively distancing itself from its customers’ data breaches.\nGainsight has been publishing updates about the incident on its incident page. On Friday, the company said that it is now working with Google’s incident response unit Mandiant to help investigate the breach, that the incident in question “originated from the applications’ external connection — not from any issue or vulnerability within the Salesforce platform,” and that “a forensic analysis is continuing as part of a comprehensive and independent review.”\n“Salesforce has temporarily revoked active access tokens for Gainsight-connected apps as a precautionary measure while their investigation into unusual activity continues,” according to Gainsight’s incident page, which said Salesforce is notifying affected customers whose data was stolen. \nIn its Telegram channel, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters said it plans to launch a dedicated website to extort the victims of its latest campaign by next week. This is the group’s modus operandi; in October, the hackers also published a similar extortion website after stealing victims’ Salesforce data in the Salesloft incident. \nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a collective of English-speaking hackers made up of several cybercriminal gangs, including ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$, whose members use social engineering tactics to trick company employees into granting the hackers access to their systems or databases. In the last few years, these groups have claimed several high-profile victims, such as MGM Resorts, Coinbase, DoorDash, and more.\nThis story was updated to include comments from Docusign, Thomson Reuters, and Verizon.\n",

    "description": "\nByju Raveendran, the embattled founder of Indian ed-tech giant Byju’s, has blasted a U.S. bankruptcy court’s order directing him to pay more than $1.",
    "body": "\nByju Raveendran, the embattled founder of Indian ed-tech giant Byju’s, has blasted a U.S. bankruptcy court’s order directing him to pay more than $1.07 billion. He is denying wrongdoing, accusing lenders of misleading the court, and vowing to appeal a ruling that marks a dramatic fall for a onetime poster boy of India’s startup boom.\nThe Delaware bankruptcy judge issued a default judgment after finding that Raveendran had repeatedly ignored court orders and provided “evasive, incomplete” responses regarding about $533 million that Byju’s U.S. unit allegedly transferred in 2022 and never recovered. The judge also cited issues with a separate limited-partnership stake later valued at roughly $540.6 million. The ruling, dated November 20, stems from legal action by lenders seeking to claw back funds linked to the $1.2 billion term loan they extended to the ed-tech startup in 2021.\nEarlier this year, in April, a group of U.S. lenders led by GLAS Trust sued Raveendran and his wife, Byju’s co-founder Divya Gokulnath, in the Delaware bankruptcy court over the missing $533 million in loan proceeds. The couple denied wrongdoing at the time and accused lenders of attempting a hostile takeover of the company. They later said they planned to pursue a $2.5 billion lawsuit against GLAS Trust and others in India and other jurisdictions, though no such filing has publicly surfaced. This was in addition to the complaint Byju’s filed in the New York Supreme Court challenging the acceleration of the term loan in 2023.\nThe court’s latest order followed a September 29 hearing on the default request, where the judge cited a months-long pattern of noncompliance. The judge noted that Raveendran skipped hearings, missed extended deadlines, and ignored a prior contempt order imposing $10,000 in daily sanctions that remain unpaid.\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon said the relief granted in the case was “extraordinary,” adding that “the circumstances of this case are, frankly, unique and unlike anything the undersigned has encountered before, thereby making such relief… richly warranted.” The judge has given the parties seven days to respond to the ruling.\n“We consider that the U.S. Court erred in its judgment of this matter and will be filing the necessary appeals and other contestations related to this judgment and related orders,” said J. Michael McNutt, senior litigation advisor at Lazareff Le Bars, representing Raveendran, in a prepared statement to TechCrunch. “The court, in our view, ignored relevant facts.”\nRaveendran’s legal counsel argued that the court issued the judgment without giving him an opportunity to present a defense and instead relied on an earlier contempt order. The counsel also argued that the ruling failed to acknowledge that GLAS Trust was aware the Alpha loan funds were not used for the personal benefit of Raveendran or other founders but rather for Think & Learn, the startup’s parent company, the counsel said.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe counsel said Byju’s founders are preparing claims against GLAS Trust and others in multiple jurisdictions, expected to seek at least $2.5 billion in damages and, absent a settlement, to be filed before the end of 2025.\nNonetheless, the default judgment marks a stunning fall for Raveendran and his eponymous company, once India’s most valuable startup with a $22 billion valuation and backed by global investors including Tiger Global, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Prosus. The company is now mired in lawsuits, funding droughts, mass layoffs, and a battle for control as lenders and creditors race to recover what they can.\nRaveendran previously challenged the Delaware court’s jurisdiction, but the judge rejected that argument in an earlier ruling, writing that “Raveendran’s conduct that gives rise to the litigation here relates to his activities … in the United States fundraising and serving as a director, officer, or manager of a United States corporation.”\nEarlier this week, a filing in the Delaware bankruptcy case alleged that most of the $533 million missing from Byju’s U.S. unit, Alpha, was “round-tripped back to Byju Raveendran and associates.” In a response, Raveendran denied the allegation, saying the funds were not used for personal gain.\nMeanwhile in India, Byju’s is undergoing a court-supervised sale process after insolvency proceedings began last year, with early bidders including Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG) and Ronnie Screwvala’s UpGrad.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

So far, users either had to link their account to services like Last.fm to track their music, or wait until the end of the year for Spotify to release its personalized year-in-review, Wrapped, to find out what they listened to.\nThe streaming giant is now changing that with a new feature called “Listening stats” that will show users weekly numbers about their listening habits.\nStats will surface your top artists and top songs for a particular week, and will let you share those numbers with others using Instagram or WhatsApp, or with your friends directly on Spotify through the app’s new messaging feature. Spotify said the weekly highlights will also include special moments, like a milestone, a newdiscovery, or a fan moment.\nImage Credit: Spotify\nThe stats page also has an option to create a playlist based on the songs you already like and what you might want to listen to next based on your listening habits.\nTo access your stats, tap on your profile image, and then select the “Listening stats” tab. From there, you will be able to check out what you’ve been listening to, and share the stats.\nListening stats is currently rolling out to free and premium users in over 60 countries. Spotify said it will still release annual recaps via Wrapped, which is usually highly anticipated, as users get to share each other’s top artists and other insights. \nThe new listening stats might give users a better understanding of their listening patterns on a more regular basis, but it might kill the surprise element of discovering some tidbits about themselves at the end of the year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

    "body": "\nJeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is finally ready to try a second launch of its super heavy-lift rocket New Glenn. The company announced on Wednesday that it will attempt the launch as early as Sunday, November 9, from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nNew Glenn’s first flight took place back in January, and it was mostly successful. The rocket’s second stage made it into orbit, but the first stage exploded on its return to Earth before Blue Origin could attempt to land it on a drone ship in the ocean.\nEarlier this year, the company said it would try to launch New Glenn for a second time in “late spring.” That timeline slipped a few times, though. Blue Origin is being extra careful with the second launch in part because it will be carrying cargo on behalf of paying customers this time. The main cargo is NASA’s twin ESCAPADE spacecraft, which are headed to Mars. A Viasat tech demonstrator will also be on board.\n",

    "body": "\nLucid Motors’ chief engineer Eric Bach is leaving the company after more than a decade, the company has announced.\nBach, who also served as Lucid Motors’ Senior Vice President of Product, has been with the company since 2015. He joined Lucid after spending three years as Tesla’s Director of Engineering, where he worked alongside Lucid Motors’ former CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson. Bach spent more than 10 years at Volkswagen before Tesla.\nTechCrunch has learned that Lucid’s VP of Engineering, James Hawkins, is also no longer with the company after spending 10 years there. Lucid Motors declined to specifically comment on his departure.  \nBach’s and Hawkins’ departures are part of a wider shake-up announced Wednesday. Lucid Motors’ Vice President of Quality, Jeri Ford, is retiring as well. She will be replaced by Marnie Levergood, who is coming to the company from Scout Motors.\nAt the same time, Lucid Motors’ current Senior Vice President of Powertrain, Emad Dlala, is being elevated to oversee all of “Engineering and Digital.” Dlala was promoted once already earlier this year and has been with the company since 2015.\nThe executive shake-up comes as Lucid enters its ninth month without a permanent CEO after Peter Rawlinson suddenly resigned in February. Former chief operating officer Marc Winterhoff has been serving as CEO on an interim basis ever since.\nThe loss of Bach and Ford is the latest in a line of executive departures at Lucid Motors. The company’s head of investor relations, Senior Vice President of Operations, Managing Director for Europe, and the Vice Presidents of Software Quality and Marketing have all left within the last year.\nThe changes are happening at a critical moment in Lucid Motors’ history. The company finally launched its long-awaited luxury SUV, the Gravity, which the company expects will ultimately be more successful than the Air sedan, which it has struggled to sell. \nLucid Motors is also working on a midsized vehicle that will be priced closer to $50,000 in 2026, though it has said it likely needs to raise more money before that happens. On Wednesday, Lucid Motors announced that its majority owner — Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund — had boosted the cap of a loan agreement from $750 million to around $2 billion, which provides the company liquidity until 2027.\nThis story has been updated with more information about departures and the amended loan agreement announced Wednesday.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nWith so much money flooding into AI startups, it’s a good time to be an AI researcher with an idea to test out. And if the idea is novel enough, it might be easier to get the resources you need as an independent company instead of inside one of the big labs.\nThat’s the story of Inception, a startup developing diffusion-based AI models that just raised $50 million in seed funding led by Menlo Ventures, with participation from Mayfield, Innovation Endeavors, Microsoft’s M12 fund, Snowflake Ventures, Databricks Investment, and Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures. Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy provided additional angel funding.\nThe leader of the project is Stanford professor Stefano Ermon, whose research focuses on diffusion models — which generate outputs through iterative refinement rather than word-by-word. These models power image-based AI systems like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and Sora. Having worked on those systems since before the AI boom made them exciting, Ermon is using Inception to apply the same models to a broader range of tasks.\nTogether with the funding, the company released a new version of its Mercury model, designed for software development. Mercury has already been integrated into a number of development tools, including ProxyAI, Buildglare, and Kilo Code. Most importantly, Ermon says the diffusion approach will help Inception’s models conserve on two of the most important metrics: latency (response time) and compute cost.\n“These diffusion-based LLMs are much faster and much more efficient than what everybody else is building today,” Ermon says. “It’s just a completely different approach where there is a lot of innovation that can still be brought to the table.”\nUnderstanding the technical difference requires a bit of background. Diffusion models are structurally different from auto-regression models, which dominate text-based AI services. Auto-regression models like GPT-5 and Gemini work sequentially, predicting each next word or word fragment based on the previously processed material. Diffusion models, trained for image generation, take a more holistic approach, modifying the overall structure of a response incrementally until it matches the desired result.\nThe conventional wisdom is to use auto-regression models for text applications, and that approach has been hugely successful for recent generations of AI models. But a growing body of research suggests diffusion models may perform better when a model is processing large quantities of text or managing data constraints. As Ermon tells it, those qualities become a real advantage when performing operations over large codebases.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDiffusion models also have more flexibility in how they utilize hardware, a particularly important advantage as the infrastructure demands of AI become clear. Where auto-regression models have to execute operations one after another, diffusion models can process many operations simultaneously, allowing for significantly lower latency in complex tasks.\n“We’ve been benchmarked at over 1,000 tokens per second, which is way higher than anything that’s possible using the existing autoregressive technologies,” Ermon says, “because our thing is built to be parallel. It’s built to be really, really fast.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nDecentralized open source social network Mastodon is rolling out its latest release, version 4.5, which brings support for Quote Posts to all server operators, along with other features for admins, conversation improvements, and more.\nThe addition of quote posts is one of the bigger changes to how Mastodon’s social network operates, as the social network attempts to compete against larger rivals, like X and Threads. Quoting can be a conversation driver and is considered a baseline feature for text-first social networks. But Mastodon wanted to ensure the feature launched with more user protections so as not to change the culture of its network.\nOn X, quote posts (formerly known as retweets when X was Twitter) contributed to a culture of “dunking,” where users would often deride others by responding to their post with cruel jokes or insults. That remains a concern today, and other new competitors, like Threads and Bluesky.\nTo address this problem, Mastodon’s version of quote posts come with added safety controls.\nImage Credits:Mastodon\nThe feature was also initially rolled out to the larger Mastodon servers at mastodon.online and mastodon.social in September, ahead of the 4.5 software update, giving users time to adjust the format.\nMastodon gives users several ways to control how their posts can be quoted. For instance, users decide who can quote them through the feature’s settings. Here, you can choose between options like “Anyone,” “Followers only,” or “Just me.” Additionally, users can control the visibility of quote posts by setting them to be visible to the public, to followers only, or a setting called “quiet public,” which makes the quotes public but removes them from Mastodon’s search, trends, and public timeline.\nIn addition, users can override their default settings on a post-by-post basis, if need be, which could be useful at those times when you want to quote someone without attracting unwanted attention. \nMastodon will also alert the user being quoted in the app, so they can remove their original post from the other person’s quote post, if they feel the need to. Plus, users can opt to block others to prevent them from seeing and quoting their posts in the future.\nWhile the broader rollout of quote posts is the major addition in the 4.5 software release, the update also fixes issues where users on older servers running 4.4 and earlier versions would sometimes miss seeing replies.\nImage Credits:Mastodon\nServer operators are also gaining new tools to optionally disable content feeds, set a local feed as their homepage, block specific users, and more. The moderation interface has been updated to display needed context, like link previews and quote posts in messages, to aid in decision-making. \nImage credits: Mastodon\nMeanwhile, the 4.5 release also brings native emoji support to Mastodon’s web interface. \nMastodon continues to be one of the larger networks on the fediverse, the name for the open social web powered by the ActivityPub social networking protocol. Overall, the fediverse has nearly 12 million users, according to growth tracker FediDB, with Mastodon accounting for north of 8 million of that figure. However, its monthly active user number is only ~670,000.\nThreads, which integrates with ActivityPub, isn’t counted in these figures because it’s not a full integration. Threads has more than 400 million monthly users and 150 million daily active users.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nDiscord has rolled out updates to its Family Center, giving guardians more insights into their teens’ usage patterns, including purchases, top interactions, and time spent. The goal is to help parents monitor whether their teen is spending excessive time or money on Discord.\nThe communication platform first launched Family Center in 2023 with an activity dashboard showing which servers their teens have joined and a weekly email summary for guardians about their teen’s activity. The platform is now expanding these monitoring abilities.\nGuardians can now see total purchases made by the teen in the last week, including items from Discord’s Shop and Nitro subscriptions (Discord’s premium membership service).\nImage Credits: Discord\nThey can also view the total time spent on voice and video calls in DMs, groups, and servers over the past week. Plus, Discord will display the top five users and servers teens interacted with in the last seven days. This comes after other social networks Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat have also implemented restrictions on who can contact teens.\nDiscord is also adding new parental controls to the app with settings that can only be altered by guardians. They can now control who can DM their teen and whether sensitive content should be filtered. Guardians can also manage data privacy controls for teens, determining how Discord uses their data, including whether to show them personalized ads.\nImage Credits: Discord\nThe company also said that when teens report content on the platform, they now have an option to notify their parents or guardians of their action. However, Discord said it won’t disclose what content was reported and encourages teens to discuss this directly with their guardians instead.\n“The new features allow guardians who have linked Family Center accounts to play a more active role in creating a safer space online for teens while still respecting their privacy,” Discord said in a blog post. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn recent months, several companies, including Meta, YouTube, and OpenAI, have rolled out updates to bolster their tools around teen safety.

The tech giant also made the feature available in more languages, including Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese.\nGoogle first launched AI Mode in March to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search. Since then, the tech giant has continuously updated the tool with added functionality. \nYesterday, Google launched new agentic capabilities in AI Mode to allow users to get help with booking event tickets and beauty and wellness appointments in AI Mode. Google first introduced agentic capabilities to AI Mode back in August, when it rolled out the ability for people use the feature to find restaurant reservations. \nAI Mode launched a Canvas feature in July that helps you build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel.

    "body": "\nPaul Erlanger and Se Yong Park, co-founders of consumer crypto trading app Fomo, took an unusual route to raising capital that is paying off for them. \nTheir app launched in May and they just announced a $17 million Series A round led by Benchmark — an atypical crypto bet for the top-tier VC firm — bringing total funding to $19 million. \nInstead of a classic seed round, the founders drew up a list of 200 people they dreamed of having as angel investors. \n“We knew that every single person would be valuable to us in the business,” Erlanger told TechCrunch. \nThen they worked their networks for warm intros— both had previously worked at the popular crypto trading platform dYdX. Failing that, they made cold calls. And 140 of their dream angels wrote checks after hearing their pitch.\nThey landed such big names in the crypto world as Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron; co-founder of Solana, Raj Gokal; and former Coinbase CTO and super-angel Balaji Srinivasan, the founders said.\n“There’s a lot of people we never got to, like Elon Musk,” Park said with a grin, but of the ones who did take their call, less than a handful said no, he said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe angels liked their idea of a super app that gives consumers access to every crypto asset ever (millions of them), available on any blockchain, with, they promise, no technical friction. The app also has a social component baked into it, where users can follow friends and leaders they respect to see their trades. \nWhile Fomo doesn’t yet have every asset from every blockchain available, the founders said they are on track to be close to that goal in six months. And among the millions of assets they do offer today, users can trade everything from major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana to meme coins and altcoins, they say.  \nThe ultimate vision is to one day allow consumers to trade all kinds of other assets on the app, from prediction markets to standard securities like bonds. \nA month after Fomo’s May launch, the founders added a feature that dramatically changed their company’s trajectory: support for Apple Pay. This essentially let users download the app and quickly start trading. \n“We saw a massive influx of users and revenue,” Erlanger said.  Fomo instantly soared to about $150,000 in revenue per week and $3 million in volume a day, the founders said. \nThe app collects transaction fees on each trade of 0.50% (with a minimum fee of $0.95 for transactions on Solana, and no minimum fee on other, less-expensive blockchains like Base and BNB Chain). But it doesn’t make users pay so-called “gas fees,” or the fees blockchains charge to process transactions. That’s a real selling point for users interested in holding the major coins, Park said. \nTheir many-angels strategy paid off because not one but three people reached out to Benchmark early-stage investor Chetan Puttagunta to offer an introduction, Puttagunta told TechCrunch. \nPuttagunta was a long-shot choice for a lead investor of the Series A round that Erlanger and Park were actively pursuing. Benchmark is selective with its picks and doesn’t invest much in crypto startups. It backed Chainalysis in 2018, along with Toncoin and a few others.  \nBut Puttagunta (who’s backed such companies as Elastic, Cursor, Manus and LangChain) saw Fomo’s fast growth and was convinced to take a chance, and a board seat.  \n“Paul and Se and the entire team have a clear vision to make crypto assets both easy to discover and trade,” Puttagunta said. “Their vision is clearly resonating with truly exceptional growth since they launched a few months ago.”  \nBenchmark was the only institutional check the founders took, with the rest of the round going to existing angels and new ones.\nSo far, it looks like Benchmark’s bet could pay off. Since the round closed in September, Fomo has added more assets from more blockchains to its app and has seen growth go even crazier. The founders say they have onboarded over 120,000 users. “We’re now doing about $20-$40 million in volume a day, and about $150,000 in revenue a day,” Erlanger said. \n",

    "body": "\nLagos-based Ventures Platform, one of Africa’s most active early-stage investors, has raised $64 million so far for its second fund, targeting a final close of $75 million, founding partner Kola Aina tells TechCrunch.\nAmong the investors is the Nigerian government, through its Investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises (iDICE) program, which marks the first time this government has invested in a VC fund. That’s significant, since Nigeria’s burgeoning startup community is home to the largest number of startup unicorns on the continent.\nOther limited partners in Ventures Platform’s second fund include IFC, British International Investment (BII), Proparco, Standard Bank, MSMEDA, and AfricaGrow, along with European family offices such as Alder Tree Investment and prominent global backers like former Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel. Aina says 70% of the investors from its previous fund returned. \nNigeria choosing this firm for a debut investment is perhaps not surprising. Since its founding in 2016, Ventures Platform has built a reputation for spotting breakout startups in the country early, something it hopes to replicate in other African markets.\nVentures Platform launched its first institutional fund, a $46 million vehicle, in 2022 to focus primarily on pre-seed and seed rounds.\nWith the second fund, the firm will also pursue Series A investing, while “investing with more conviction” and seeking larger ownership stakes, Aina said. This should be good news for the region’s founders, as Series A funding has become harder to obtain after years of pullback from Silicon Valley firms.\nWhile Ventures Platform plans to deepen its presence in Nigeria, the firm has begun establishing a presence in Francophone West Africa and North Africa, regions where it has already made a few investments, to gain earlier access to promising deals.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo far, the pan-African venture capital firm has funded over 90 startups across the continent. Most of these investments, the firm says, are “painkiller” businesses across fintech, healthtech, agritech, edtech, and AI—companies that solve for non-consumption, or in simpler terms, serve markets where people have little to no access to a service.\nAina points to portfolio companies Visa-backed unicorn Moniepoint and Stripe-owned Paystack, two fintechs that unlocked new markets for online payments and small business banking.\n“Many small businesses couldn’t sell beyond their immediate vicinity before Paystack because they couldn’t accept online payments,” he said. “Moniepoint, on the other hand, has driven financial inclusion to the nooks and crannies of this country. That’s market creating innovation.”\nOther notable portfolio companies include Left Lane-backed remittance app LemFi, Gates Foundation-backed SeamlessHR, Norfund-backed OmniRetail, QED-backed fintech Raenest, and healthtech Remedial Health.\nEven as innovation accelerates and funding in Africa’s tech ecosystem has surpassed $12 billion since 2015, stakeholders are voicing fresh concerns about the shortage of exits and liquidity events. That reality has made fundraising harder for many of the continent’s VCs, most of them emerging managers who, as a collective globally, have faced a tough climate over the past two years.\nVentures Platform, however, in that time, managed to attract both local and international LPs for two funds despite the market uncertainty.\n“We have LPs who understand how venture ecosystems in other markets have developed and know we’ll get there in the long term. Another reason is that we’ve recycled capital from our prior syndicates,” Aina said, referring to the firm returning four out of its six vintages (including five angel syndicates) between 2016 and 2022. The investor also claims that the first fund ranks among the top performers globally based on TVPI and IRR for its vintage year.\nStill addressing questions around exits as well as the continent’s funding slowdown (from $5 billion in 2021 to $2 billion last year), Aina adds that Africa’s long-term potential hasn’t waned and describes the continent as the “purest asymmetric play for non-consensus alpha”—venture-speak for high-risk, high-upside bets.\n“If you’re a global capital allocator looking for true diversification, Africa is the place,” he said. “By 2050, one in four humans will be African. Our GDP growth rate is double that of the U.S., and yet most of the value is still offline. The opportunity is huge if you have the patience and the local context.”\n",

    "body": "\nWhile Roy Lee, the founder of Cluely, argues that startups should be thinking harder about social media virality, he also admits that brand awareness alone won’t lead to sustained growth.\n“I can’t say if it’s a mistake, but maybe we launched too early,” Lee said onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 last week. “The whole idea [was] let’s launch something that barely works, and if we can get enough initial users, they will find out the use cases for us.”\nCluely burst onto the tech scene in April with rage-bait marketing for a product it claimed would help users “cheat on everything.” Lee first made headlines when he was suspended from Columbia University for building a tool used for cheating on coding job interviews. He channeled that notoriety into Cluely, a startup that claimed to help users “cheat on everything” by delivering undetectable information during online conversations.\nIn late June, Cluely introduced its enterprise product, which claimed to serve multiple use cases, including helping with sales calls, customer support, and remote tutoring.\nBut earlier this week, the startup shifted and narrowed its scope when it introduced a new website that calls its product an AI assistant for meetings. The company’s plan now is to “become the best AI note taker, starting with the consumer,” Lee said onstage. As an AI notetaker, Cluely is clearly entering a crowded market but Roy touted functionality such as “sending follow-up emails.”\nBut he deflected questions on how well sales and retention were going, except to say: “I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time,” Lee said.\nThe startup’s ability to grab attention helped it secure a $15 million Series A from Andreessen Horowitz in June. That month, a16z partner Bryan Kim said on the firm’s podcast that he backed Cluely because Lee had figured out how to convert the attention into paying customers.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhen the company introduced its product this summer, Lee boasted that the startup’s ARR skyrocketed from $3 million to $7 million within just one week. “Every single person who has a meeting or an interview is testing this out,” Lee told TechCrunch then.\nBut four months later, Lee is no longer eager to flaunt his company’s financial metrics. “What I’ve learned is you should never share revenue numbers.”\nLee claimed that there’s no upside to revealing his company’s performance: “If you’re doing well, nobody is going to talk about how well you’re doing, but if you’re doing poorly, then everybody will only talk about how poorly you’re doing.”  \nHowever, dozens of founders at fast-growing AI startups have no qualms about publicly revealing their ARR numbers, making the sharing of explosive growth a standard practice amid the AI boom.\nCluely’s experience thus far suggests that when it comes to software, social media attention only goes so far if the company doesn’t have a strong product to keep customers once it intrigues them.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAfter Zohran Mamdani clinched the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday night, his campaign announced former FTC chair Lina Khan will be one of the transition team’s four co-chairs.\nKhan has been an ally of Mamdani’s, praising him in a New York Times op-ed about his outreach to small business owners. But her appointment to a formal role on his transition team sends a message to Wall Street and the tech industry, whose most powerful players have already been critical of Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who ruffled the feathers of the tech elite by criticizing billionaires and proposing a 2% tax on incomes over $1 million.\n“What we saw last night was New Yorkers not just electing a new mayor, but clearly rejecting a politics where outsized corporate power and money too often end up dictating our politics,” Khan said in a speech on Wednesday.\nKhan described Mamdani’s victory as “a clear mandate for change where New Yorkers can get ahead, and where all workers and small businesses can thrive — not just get by.”\nAirbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, as well as investors like Bill Ackman and Mike Bloomberg, each spent millions of dollars to oppose Mamdani and advocate for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who finished second in the polls. DoorDash also gave $1 million to a pro-Cuomo super PAC. Mamdani’s platform, however, advocated for increased regulation of delivery apps and protections for their subcontracted gig workers.\nLike Mamdani, Khan has enemies in high places. As an outspoken critic of tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google, Khan moved to block various high-profile tech mergers during her tenure in the Biden administration. When those actions failed, many in Silicon Valley still held Khan responsible for slowing down the flow of acquisition deals.\nEven those who supported the Biden-Harris presidential ticket, like LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and billionaire investor Vinod Khosla, were public about their criticisms of Khan; in an interview with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos last year, Khosla described Khan as “not a rational human being.”\nKhan, a professor at Columbia Law School, is described as “the nation’s leading antimonopoly champion” on Mamdani’s transition website.\nIn addition to Khan, the other three co-chairs include Grace Bonilla, president and CEO of the non-profit United Way of New York City; Maria Torres-Springer, the former first deputy mayor of New York City; and Melanie Hartzog, president and CEO of the non-profit New York Foundling. \nThe four will be led by Elana Leopold, an adviser to Mamdani’s campaign who held various senior roles across the Bill de Blasio mayoral administration.\n“Lina is focused on getting set up to assist the transition on economic policy and personnel,” Douglas Farrar, a spokesperson for Khan, told TechCrunch.\nUpdated, 11/5/25, 2:20 PM ET with comment from Douglas Farrar.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nGoogle is adding Gemini to Maps in India, along with road safety alerts and more information about routes.\nThe AI integration, launched in the U.S. on Wednesday, brings hands-free AI assistance to Maps, as well as contextual suggestions while navigating and information about places of interest. \nMiriam Daniel, vice president and head of Google Maps, said the rollout required significant localization.\n“When we say localizing for India, it’s not just the language,” she said at a virtual briefing. “It’s also adapting to how Indians use the product, how Indians will talk, how they will ask for questions, how they will identify places, the geopolitical places, the street names, you know, everything is sort of different in India.”\nGemini in Maps will be available to all Android and iOS users in India in the coming weeks, Google said. At launch, Gemini will support nine Indian languages.\nGoogle is also adding a set of India-specific navigation and commuting updates. Drivers will now get visual and audio alerts when they’re passing accident-prone stretches. Google said it is working on these alerts with local authorities, and the feature will roll out to Android users in Gurugram, the Cyberabad region of Hyderabad, Chandigarh and Faridabad.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle has come under scrutiny in India over the reliability of some navigation routes, after a car drove off an unfinished bridge in Uttar Pradesh, killing three men, late last year.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The real world conditions can keep changing, and it’s very dynamic, and sometimes it changes in an instant. Maps can’t be accurate 100% of the time,” said Anal Ghosh, senior program manager for Google Maps, when asked about warnings for incomplete roads or unfinished bridges. “So we would encourage users to ensure that they’re keeping their eyes on the road.”\nGoogle said it has partnered with the country’s highways regulator, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), to receive near real-time data on road closures, diversions and repair work. The company said the partnership will also allow Maps to show wayside amenities such as public restrooms, restaurants and fuel stations along national highways.\nOther new features include proactive notifications about major disruptions or delays on routes, even when users are not navigating. These alerts are rolling out to Android users for highways and major roads in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. \nImage Credits:Google\nThe app will also display speed limits during navigation, using data from local traffic authorities. This feature is rolling out to Android and iOS users in nine cities: Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Hyderabad (including the Cyberabad region), Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai and Noida.\nBuilding on the flyover navigation feature launched last year, Maps is now getting voice support for flyovers. This feature is rolling out to Android and iOS users over the coming weeks.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

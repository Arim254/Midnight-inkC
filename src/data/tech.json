Instead, Bloom wrote, “GPT-5 found references, which solved these problems, that I personally was unaware of.”\nSebastien Bubeck, an OpenAI researcher who’d also been touting GPT-5’s accomplishments, then acknowledged that “only solutions in the literature were found,” but he suggested this remains a real accomplishment: “I know how hard it is to search the literature.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

It also comes with a rechargeable battery, a USB connection, and a fingerprint sensor to identify who’s using the toilet.\nThe Dekoda is currently available for pre-order, with shipments scheduled to begin on October 21. In addition to the hardware purchase fee, customers will need to pay between $70 and $156 for a subscription.\nIf you’re uneasy about the privacy implications of putting a camera right below your private parts, the company says, “Dekoda’s sensors see down into your toilet and nowhere else.” It also notes that the resulting data is secured via end-to-end encryption.\nKohler isn’t the only company seeking to take pictures of your poop — we’ve also written about the toilet camera offered by a startup called Throne.\n",

    "body": "\nMeta-owned chat app WhatsApp changed its business API policy this week to ban general-purpose chatbots from its platform. The move will likely affect WhatsApp-based assistants of companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Khosla Ventures-backed Luzia, and General Catalyst-backed Poke.\nThe company has added a new section to address “AI providers” in its business API terms, focusing on general-purpose chatbots. The terms, which will go into effect on January 15, 2026, say that Meta won’t allow AI model providers to distribute their AI assistants on WhatsApp.\n\nProviders and developers of artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies, including but not limited to large language models, generative artificial intelligence platforms, general-purpose artificial intelligence assistants, or similar technologies as determined by Meta in its sole discretion (“AI Providers”), are strictly prohibited from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether directly or indirectly, for the purposes of providing, delivering, offering, selling, or otherwise making available such technologies when such technologies are the primary (rather than incidental or ancillary) functionality being made available for use, as determined by Meta in its sole discretion.\n\nMeta confirmed this move to TechCrunch and specified that this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a travel company running a bot for customer service won’t be barred from the service.\nMeta’s rationale behind this move is that WhatsApp Business API is designed for businesses serving customers rather than acting as a platform for chatbot distribution. The company said that while it built the API for business-to-business use cases, in recent months, it saw an unanticipated use case of serving general-purpose chatbots.\n“The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said in a comment to TechCrunch.\nMeta said that the new chatbot use cases placed a lot of burden on its system with increased message volume and required a different kind of support, which the company wasn’t ready for. The company is banning use cases that fall outside “the intended design and strategic focus” of the API.\nThe move will effectively make WhatsApp unavailable as a platform to distribute AI solutions like assistants or agents. It also means Meta AI is the only assistant available on the chat app.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLast year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT on WhatsApp, and earlier this year, Perplexity launched its own bot on the chat app to tap into the user base of more than 3 billion people. Both of the bots could answer queries, understand media files, answer questions about them, reply to voice notes, and generate images. This likely generated a lot of message volume.\nHowever, there was a bigger issue for Meta. WhatsApp’s Business API is one of the primary ways the chat app makes money. It charges businesses based on different message templates like marketing, utility, authentication, and support. As there wasn’t any provision for chatbots in this API design, WhatsApp wasn’t able to charge them.  \nDuring Meta’s Q1 2025 earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg pointed out that business messaging is a big opportunity for the company to bring in revenue.\n“Right now, the vast majority of our business is advertising in feeds on Facebook and Instagram,” he said. “But WhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly [active users], with more than 100 million people in the US and growing quickly there. Messenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.”\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Coinbase, Fortnite, Signal and Zoom faced lengthy outages, as did Amazon’s own services, including its Ring video surveillance products.\nMillions of companies and organizations rely on AWS to host their websites, apps and other critical online systems. The company has data centers all over the world, and Amazon is said to have at least 30% of the total cloud market.\nAmazon did not give a reason for what caused the outage. \nBefore this, the most recent global internet outage was in 2024, when cybersecurity giant Crowdstrike published a buggy update to its anti-malware engine, causing millions of computers around the world to crash and resulting in airport delays and mass outages. Systems globally took several days to return to normal.\nPrior to that, a malfunction at DNS provider Akamai in 2021 caused some of the world’s largest websites to drop off the internet for several hours, including FedEx, Steam and the PlayStation Network.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nBilal Abu-Ghazaleh had just moved to London few days before our call, splitting his time between there and Dubai.\nAfter nearly a decade in the U.S., including a stint at Scale AI, he’s bringing that experience to his next venture: 1001 AI , a company creating AI infrastructure for critical industries across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).\nThe startup recently raised a $9 million seed round led by CIV, General Catalyst, and Lux Capital. Other backers include global and regional angels such as Chris Ré, Amjad Masad (Replit), Amira Sajwani (DAMAC), Khalid Bin Bader Al Saud (RAED Ventures), and Hisham Alfalih (Lean Technologies).\nAbu-Ghazaleh said his two-month-old company promises to cut inefficiencies in high-stakes sectors like aviation, logistics, and oil and gas through an AI-native operating system for decision-making. \n“Just looking at the top three or four industries like airports, ports, construction, and oil and gas, we see more than $10 billion in inefficiencies across the Gulf alone,” the founder and CEO said in an interview with TechCrunch. “That’s just in markets like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Even without counting other sectors, these industries represent a massive opportunity.”\nFor example, any efficiencies found in airport operations can compound the savings, impacting both the airport and its airlines. Meanwhile, he said nine out of ten of the regions mega-projects fall behind schedule or go over budget, meaning even small increases in efficiencies can save these projects serious money. \n1001 AI hopes to sell its decision-making AI to new projects after it launches its first product, which is scheduled by year’s end. The startup is in talks with some of the Gulf’s largest construction firms and airports, said Abu-Ghazaleh.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBorn and raised in Jordan, Abu-Ghazaleh moved to the U.S. for college and later joined the Bay Area’s startup scene. After an early product role at computer vision startup Hive AI, he joined Scale AI in 2020 during its rapid expansion. There, he rose through the ranks from operations associate to director of the company’s GenAI operations, scaling its contributor network responsible for annotating and labeling training data.\nHe was later set to join Scale’s international public sector unit, which builds AI solutions for foreign governments. But when Meta invested in Scale, the company shifted direction, and Abu-Ghazaleh left to found 1001 AI.\nThe Gulf, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, has become one of the world’s most aggressive adopters of AI. From sovereign-backed ventures like G42 in Abu Dhabi to Saudi Arabia’s National Center for AI, governments are investing billions to build local AI infrastructure and attract global talent.\nFor Abu-Ghazaleh, that mix of appetite, budget, and urgency makes the region a perfect testing ground. But unlike most AI startups focused on software or enterprise tools, 1001 targets real-world physical operations, an area where the company’s investors believe the potential is even greater in the Middle East.\n“We’re extremely bullish on AI that solves physical-world problems at scale i.e, optimizing how airports turn around flights, how ports move cargo, how construction sites operate,” said Deena Shakir, partner at Lux Capital. “The MENA region offers significant potential in this space with mission-critical infrastructure that’s under-digitized and ripe for transformation.”\nWhile the product is still under development, Abu-Ghazaleh offered a glimpse into how it works. The system pulls in data from a client’s existing software, models operational workflows, and issues real-time directives to improve efficiency.\n“Today, an operations manager might manually call someone to reroute a fuel truck or send a cleaning crew to another gate,” said Abu-Ghazaleh. “With our system, that orchestration happens automatically. The AI orchestrator uses real-time data to reroute vehicles, reassign crews, and adjust operations without human intervention.”\nUnlike most early-stage AI startups that target specific industries, Abu-Ghazaleh says 1001 can be accessible by many because operational flows across industries often look the same.\nThat model borrows from the rigor of consulting and contract work. The team spends weeks embedded with clients, running co-development sprints to tailor its systems to each operation’s realities, the CEO said. \n“Bilal is building the decision engine to automate that complexity with Scale-proven execution and the regional gravity to make 1001 the platform this market builds on,” commented Neeraj Arora, managing director at General Catalyst.\nThe new funding will accelerate early deployments across aviation, logistics, and infrastructure, while fueling recruitment in engineering, operations, and go-to-market role as it grows its team across Dubai and London. \n1001 AI plans to launch its first customer deployment by the end of the year, starting with construction. Over the next five years, Abu-Ghazaleh wants the company to become the Gulf’s go-to orchestration layer for these industries before expanding globally.\n",

It’s from that feeling that I reverse-engineered the product experience,” he says. “I created an Xcode project and started iterating directly from there, sculpting the code experience, so to speak.” \nThe experience he landed on was a simple user interface where there’s a tiny camera preview button at the bottom of the screen. You tap the button to make an AI-generated “summer” photo. As you click, the photos appear on your screen, in a sort of camera roll-style view. Each photo features you, or rather an AI version of you, exploring the world and looking fairly content while doing so. \nBehind the scenes, Gemini’s Nano-Banana image-model is doing the heavy lifting, as the app prompts the model for different variations of the summer photo output.\n\nThe app isn’t saving your selfies, Del Rey says, unless you have its optional auto-generation mode enabled. Plus, users can delete their account at any time with just two taps, which erases everything.\nWhile Nano-Banana is relatively cheap, it does cost money. For that reason, you can’t generate unlimited photos for free with Endless Summer. Instead, you’ll hit a paywall after your first six images, with a prompt suggesting payment options even before then. \nThe pricing isn’t too bad if you’re looking to just dabble with the personalized AI imagery out of curiosity — or because you’re lamenting having missed your summer vacay this year. \nIt’s $3.99 to make 30 images, $17.99 for 150, and $34.99 for 300. You can enable or disable a “Room Service” mode that auto-delivers two photos to you every morning, featuring your latest summer escapades and world travels. You can also set your gender in the app or leave it to guess (“Auto” mode), and turn on or off an option that auto-saves the AI images to your iPhone’s Camera Roll.\nA recent option in the app lets you generate Halloween photos instead of summer photos, featuring you in different costumes.\n\nThe photos themselves have a vintage film aesthetic, which makes them look like the casual lifestyle pics they’re supposed to resemble. That brings a sense of nostalgia to the app, as it evokes a mid-2000s feel.\nThis reflects other modern trends around online photo sharing. Whether that’s adopting retro technology, like zoomers carrying disposable cameras, or posting Instagram photo dumps of blurry pics, there’s a desire among some for a less-curated, less “technically perfect” version of life.  \nHow bizarre is it that it’s AI bringing that to you now? \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe Department of Energy said Thursday that it had finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to upgrade around 5,000 miles of transmission lines.\nThe grid upgrades would ease the flow of electricity in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The project, which will address lines owned by American Electric Power (AEP), won’t add any new routes, but it will help existing ones carry more power.\nAEP is one of the largest utilities and transmission line owners in the U.S., with operations spanning 11 states. The 5,000 miles that will be upgraded represent around 13% of the company’s total network.\nThe loan guarantee was initiated under the Biden administration just days before President Trump was inaugurated. Previously, the Trump administration has cited approvals occurring between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling projects.\nIt’s unclear what distinguished this grid modernization project from others that the Trump administration is considering canceling or in the process of canceling. \nIn Minnesota, the Department of Energy is moving to cancel a $467 million grant that would have helped unlock 28 gigawatts of new generating capacity, most of which would have been solar and wind. Another in Oregon would have issued $250 million in grants to connect half a dozen renewable projects.\nBut the largest transmission project the Trump administration wants to axe is a $630 million grant to modernize California’s grid. In many ways, it’s similar to the AEP project, looking to wring more out of the existing grid to ease congestion. As planned, the California project would test advanced conductors and dynamic line rating devices, both of which would allow old rights-of-way to carry more electricity. That’s frequently a cheaper option than building new power lines.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe AEP project will also rewire the lines with new conductors. The loan guarantee will allow the utility giant to secure a lower interest rate, saving the company at least $275 million, which it says will benefit its customers.\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright said that the loan will “ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States.” Already, the states included in the project have among the lowest electricity rates in the nation.\nThe loans are to be issued from the Loan Programs Office, which the GOP has renamed the Energy Dominance Financing Program. The office was established under the Energy Policy Act in 2005. Historically, the office had focused on clean energy and manufacturing projects. The loss rate on its loans is around 3%, far below that of private sector lenders.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nMarc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, appears to be walking back comments calling for the National Guard to patrol San Francisco.\n“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” Benioff said in a post on X. “My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused. “\nBenioff stirred up controversy last week after giving an interview with The New York Times in which he declared his support for President Donald Trump’s threats to deploy National Guard troops in San Francisco and other cities led by Democratic politicians.\nWhile Benioff’s comments were apparently prompted by his concerns over public safety costs at the massive Dreamforce conference that the company held in San Francisco last week, the previously liberal-leaning billionaire also used the interview to embrace Trump, at one point saying, “I fully support the president,” and adding that Trump is “doing a great job.” (At the end of the interview, he reportedly asked his shocked PR person, “Too spicy?”)\nAnd although Benioff’s pro-Trump stance seemingly aligns with a larger rightward shift among tech executives, his call for the National Guard to come to San Francisco quickly led to pushback from longtime allies and Democratic politicians. Well-known VC Ron Conway stepped down from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, with Conway reportedly telling Benioff in an email, “I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired.” \nAn event scheduled to feature Benioff and San Francisco Mayor Dan Lurie was also canceled, with organizers citing rain.\nState Senator Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, told Politico, “I’m grateful that Marc walked back his call for the National Guard to be deployed in San Francisco. Marc has done so many good things for our city — and supported so many civic needs — and I’m glad to see this shift.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTrump has already deployed the National Guard in other cities including Washington, DC and Chicago, while a judge has thus far blocked his attempts to do the same in Portland.

    "body": "\nWikipedia is often described as the last good website on an internet increasingly filled with toxic social media and AI slop. But it seems the online encyclopedia is not completely immune to broader trends, with human pageviews falling 8% year-over-year, according to a new blog post from Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation.\nThe foundation works to distinguish between traffic from humans and bots, and Miller writes that the decline “over the past few months” was revealed after an update to Wikipedia’s bot detection systems appeared to show that “much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.”\nWhy is traffic falling? Miller points to “the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,” particularly as “search engines are increasingly using generative AI to provide answers directly to searchers rather than linking to sites like ours” and as “younger generations are seeking information on social video platforms rather than the open web.” (Google has disputed the claim that AI summaries reduce traffic from search.)\nMiller says the foundation welcomes “new ways for people to gain knowledge” and argues this doesn’t make Wikipedia any less important, since knowledge sourced from the encyclopedia is still reaching people even if they don’t visit the website. Wikipedia even experimented with AI summaries of its own, though it paused the effort after editors complained.\nBut this shift does present risks, particularly if people are becoming less aware of where their information actually comes from. As Miller puts it, “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.” (Some of those volunteers are truly remarkable, reportedly disarming a gunman at a Wikipedia editors’ conference on Friday.)\nFor that reason, he argues that AI, search, and social companies using content from Wikipedia “must encourage more visitors” to the website itself.\nAnd he says Wikipedia is taking steps of its own, for example by developing a new framework for attributing content from the encyclopedia. The organization also has two teams tasked with helping Wikipedia reach new readers, and it’s looking for volunteers to help.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMiller also encourages readers to “support content integrity and content creation” more broadly.\n“When you search for information online, look for citations and click through to the original source material,” he writes. “Talk with the people you know about the importance of trusted, human curated knowledge, and help them understand that the content underlying generative AI was created by real people who deserve their support.”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration is taking its social media attacks on Democratic opponents to an unlikely platform, with the White House and numerous other government agencies joining Bluesky on Friday.\nIn its first post, the new White House account uploaded a highlight reel of Trump footage and memes, along with the message, “What’s up, Bluesky? We thought you might’ve missed some of our greatest hits, so we put this together for you.”\nOther government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of State, the Department of War, and the Department of Transportation all appeared to follow the White House by creating new Bluesky accounts, and all of them quickly posted messages attacking Democrats over the ongoing government shutdown.\n“We heard this is a great place to have an open and honest dialogue, so we’re here to talk about how the Democrat shutdown is undermining our country on the world stage,” wrote the Department of State. (Legal experts have suggested that similar statements from government agencies likely violate the Hatch Act.)\nThe messages were generally written in a cheerful, trolling tone, suggesting that the administration’s social media teams were anticipating and even hoping for a negative response on a social network that’s widely known as a left-leaning alternative to Elon Musk’s X. And Bluesky users delivered, with many responses to the initial White House post bringing up Trump’s relationship with infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n“The reason they’re coming after this place is because they can’t control the people on it and it drives them nuts,” wrote The Onion CEO Ben Collins.\nAt the same time, many popular Bluesky accounts urged their followers to simply “block and move on,” with comedian Paul F Tomkins declaring that it’s “Weirdly fun to block the White House.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLess than 48 hours after joining, the White House has already become one of the most blocked accounts on Bluesky. According to ClearSky, which tracks Bluesky blocking stats, the White House account is blocked by around 91,000 accounts, while being followed by only 10,000. The only account that’s been blocked by more Bluesky users belongs to Vice President JD Vance, who joined back in June. \nWhile the various new government accounts hadn’t quite reached those heights by Sunday morning, they accounted for all of the top 5 most blocked accounts in the last 24 hours.  And other right-wing accounts seemed to be boasting about following the Trump administration to Bluesky and getting widely blocked.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

This allows Meta’s AI to make its suggested edits. Meta says users’ media will not be used for ad targeting purposes, and it won’t use the media to improve its AI systems, unless the user takes the step of editing the media or sharing the edited photos with friends or others on its social network. \nThe feature can be disabled at any time.\nThough Meta may not train its AI on all your photos, when you agree to Meta’s AI Terms of Service, you permit your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. The terms say that, by processing your photos, Meta has the ability to “summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.” \nThe company also uses the date and presence of people or objects in your photos to craft its creative ideas, giving Meta a lot more information about you, your relationships, and your life. \nPlus, giving Meta access to photos you haven’t yet shared on Meta’s platforms could give the company an advantage in the AI race by providing a wealth of user data, behavioral insights, and ideas for new AI features.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:screenshot of Facebook's app, June 2025\nSettings for the feature are found under the Preferences section of Facebook’s Settings. On the “Camera roll sharing suggestions” page, there are two toggles. The first lets Facebook suggest photos from your camera roll when browsing the app. The second is where you could enable or disable the “cloud processing,” which lets Meta make AI images using your camera roll photos.\nMeta has been leveraging its position as a dominant social network to improve its AI technology and had previously announced it would train its image recognition AI on publicly shared data, including posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram. (EU users had until May 27, 2025, to opt out.) Last year, it also said it would train its AI on images that Ray-Ban Meta users asked the device to analyze.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSenate Republicans shared a deepfake video of Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, designed to make it seem like Democrats are celebrating the ongoing government shutdown, which has lasted 16 days.  \nIn the deepfake, an AI-generated Schumer repeats the phrase “every day gets better for us,” an actual quote taken out of context from a Punchbowl News article. In the original story, Schumer discussed the Democrats’ healthcare-focused shutdown strategy, and said they were not going to back away from Republicans’ playbook of threats and “bambooz[ling].” \nThe shutdown is happening because Democrats and Republicans cannot agree to pass a bill funding government through October and beyond. Democrats are trying to hold on to tax credits that would make health insurance cheaper for millions of Americans, secure a reversal to Trump’s Medicaid cuts, and block cuts to government health agencies.\nThe video was posted Friday on the Senate Republicans’ X account. According to X’s policies, the platform prohibits “deceptively shar[ing] synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm.” Harmful content includes media that could “mislead people” or “cause significant confusion on public issues.” \nEnforcement actions include removing content, labeling warnings, or reducing visibility. X has not, as of the time of this writing, removed the deepfake or added a warning label — though the video does include a watermark denoting its AI origins. \nThe Schumer video is not the first time X has allowed deepfakes of politicians to remain on the platform. In late 2024, X owner Elon Musk shared a manipulated video of former vice president Kamala Harris in the lead-up to the election, sparking debate about misleading voters.  \nTechCrunch has reached out to X for comment. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nUp to 28 states have enacted laws prohibiting deepfakes of political figures, specifically around campaigns and elections, though most don’t outright ban them if they have clear disclosures. California, Minnesota, and Texas have banned deepfakes intended to influence elections, deceive voters, or harm candidates. \nThe latest post comes weeks after President Donald Trump posted deepfakes on Truth Social depicting Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, making false statements about immigration and voter fraud. \nResponding to criticism of the lack of honesty and ethics, Joanna Rodriguez, the National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director, said: “AI is here and not going anywhere.

    "body": "\nLee Roberts meets me at the University Club of San Francisco on a Friday morning, hours before his football team will lose to Cal in heartbreaking fashion – a fumble at the goal line, because little about the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s expensive experiment with Bill Belichick has gone according to script.\nBut Roberts, the Chancellor of UNC, doesn’t know this yet. Right now, he’s in California to talk about artificial intelligence, which is both forward thinking and also – I’d hazard a guess – a welcome distraction from a lot else happening at the 235-year-old school.\n“No one’s going to say to [students after they graduate from college], ‘Do the best job you can, but if you use AI, you’ll be in trouble,’” Roberts tells me, leaning into his central thesis about preparing students for the real world. “Yet we have some faculty members who are effectively saying that to students right now.”\nRoberts has joined me in between other meetings in the city with AI companies because UNC has decided to make AI its north star. It’s a business bet, really. Roberts spent three decades in finance, most recently as managing partner of a private investment firm, and served as state budget director under a Republican governor. He taught budgeting as an adjunct at Duke but never worked in academic administration before becoming UNC’s interim chancellor in January of last year, a post made permanent eight months later.\nNever mind that the university just lost 118 federal grants totaling $38 million as part of a sweeping effort by the federal government to terminate more than 4,000 grants across 600 institutions. Never mind that more than 900 people last year signed a statement saying they wouldn’t recognize Roberts as chancellor when he was appointed, calling the process a political “coronation” rather than a search. Never mind that Belichick’s much-touted return to football is currently a 2-4 trainwreck, with write-ups about the team’s dysfunction becoming routine fodder for sports writers. Roberts is focused on the future.\nAt UNC, Roberts explains, there’s a spectrum between faculty who are “leaning forward” with AI and those who have “their heads in the sand.” It’s diplomatic phrasing for what is clearly a culture war playing out in faculty lounges across UNC and – it’s probably safe to assume – at other schools across the world. While one UNC professor is assigning more research than students could complete without AI (“much closer to a real world scenario,” says Roberts), others are treating chatbots like anabolic steroids. If you use them, you’re cheating.\n“We have 4,000 faculty members,” Roberts says, as a cable car clatters past the open window beside our table. “And they pride themselves, as they should, on their independence and autonomy in how they teach their classes.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt sounds a little like code for: tenured professors can’t be forced to do anything. So Roberts is creating “incentive-based programs” to move the ball forward, like promoting one of the school’s deans into the role of Vice Provost for AI at the university. That individual, Jeffrey Bardzell, has been a professor for more than 20 years and has “experience both in technology and as a humanist,” says Roberts, adding that Bardzell is “exceptionally well-placed to help the faculty as a whole come further up to speed.”\nUNC is barreling ahead on other fronts in the meantime. In its biggest development to date, the university announced this month that it is merging two schools – the School of Data Science and Society and the School of Information and Library Science – into one yet-to-be-named entity with AI studies at the center of the Venn diagram.\nUNC isn’t alone in betting big on AI. At least 14 colleges now offer bachelor’s degrees in AI, and universities like Arizona State University have made headlines for integrating AI tools across all disciplines.\nStill, creating this new school has worried some of the school’s library science students, who wonder what will happen to their degrees, according to a report in The Daily Tar Heel, the school’s independent student newspaper. At least one faculty member also complained anonymously in a statement to the paper, saying Roberts pushed for the school without a “cogent idea” of what it will entail, adding that the “careers of faculty, staff and students at both of these schools are being sacrificed to Roberts’ ego.”\nRoberts tells me the implementation will be collaborative, not top-down. He’s also clear that the move is proactive, not reactive. “This is not about shutting anything down,” he says. “It’s not predominantly a cost-savings move,” he continues, a possible nod to those lost federal research dollars, which amount to 3.5% of UNC’s overall research funding.\nRoberts doesn’t minimize the devastation of losing grants – “in many cases, [people] lose their life’s work,” he acknowledges – but he’s also quick to note that 3.5% is “well within our average annual variance.” He adds that he has been spending “a lot of time talking with policymakers and legislators in Washington about the tremendous good that federal research funding represents. We need to be especially vigilant right now, when there’s so much uncertainty around [these dollars] that it’s really changing the basic structure of how large research universities have been funded.”\nOf course, it raises questions about resources in the aggregate. Though UNC’s AI push is the topic du jour, I ask about the $10 million the school is paying Bill Belichick annually as part of a five-year deal signed back in January. I’m from Cleveland, I tell Roberts. I remember when Belichick cut Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar, a hometown hero. The city never forgave him.\nRoberts is ready for this. College sports are changing rapidly, he says. Every peer institution spends at least as much on football; many spend more. Football drives revenue for 28 other sports. UNC just won its fourth national championship in women’s lacrosse, its 23rd in women’s soccer. None of that happens without football money.\n“If we had hired somebody else and we were [down some games], everybody would be saying, ‘Hey, man, you could have had Bill Belichick,’” Roberts offers.\nIn reality, the prevailing narrative about Belichick isn’t just about wins and losses. Even if, ultimately, that’s exactly what it’s about, numerous outlets have published stories describing chaos inside the program, with players, parents, coaches, and administrators all painting a picture of a legendary NFL coach whose style doesn’t translate to college kids.\nBut Roberts isn’t making decisions based on “a couple of news stories,” he says. “Coach Belichick, in my view, has done a really good job integrating with our campus,” Roberts says. He shows up at other teams’ games. He sends pizzas to fraternities on Saturday nights. He grew up on a college campus – his father was the coach at Navy.”\nHours after our conversation, UNC will lose to Cal when wide receiver Nathan Leacock loses control of the ball just as he’s crossing into the end zone for what would have been the game-winning touchdown. I can only imagine what the immediate reaction is like back in Chapel Hill.\nMy sense is that Roberts will brush it off. He may never be forgiven for not having a traditional academic background, but he also can’t afford to care that this bothers some people. I note that the 900-person petition took issue with the fact that, among the top 50 universities, Roberts is the only leader without higher education administration experience. The petition ran in The Daily Tar Heel, which has been critical of Roberts’ chancellorship throughout.\n“I don’t think it was 900 students,” Roberts corrects me. “I think it was 900 people, regardless of whether they were students, faculty, staff, or just people in the world who signed an online petition.”\nI ask how he felt about the whole episode. “No matter what your background was before you came into a job like this, you would have a lot to learn,” Roberts says. If you were a provost, you’d know nothing about “the business or finance or budgetary or political or operational or real estate sides of the university.” If you came from business, you’d need to learn the academic side.\nIt’s a reasonable point. The modern university chancellor is part CEO, part diplomat, part fundraiser, part sports executive. Presumably, no one arrives with all the skills required. “I think almost no matter what you did previously before coming into a job like this, there would be a learning curve,” Roberts says.\nWhat strikes me about Roberts is that he seems relatively unbothered. The federal funding cuts are within the normal range. The Belichick hire is a wait-and-see situation. As for some of the faculty’s resistance to AI, it’s a puzzle to be solved.\nHe’s also making big bets just as higher education is being squeezed every which way. Federal funding is uncertain. Birth rate declines threaten future enrollment. The value of a college degree is in question, with more students graduating to find the only jobs available to them are low-wage gigs they could have landed without spending staggering amounts on college. Now AI threatens to upend the whole model.\nBut Roberts sees opportunity where others might see a crisis. He also thinks the window of opportunity is shorter than some might imagine. “The challenge of AI is that we have to work relatively quickly, and we also have to cooperate across academic disciplines,” he says. “And those are two things that universities, historically, are not especially good at.”\nWhether Roberts’ game plan works remains to be seen. What’s clear is that he’s betting moving fast and shaking things up is better than moving slowly and preserving tradition at highly ranked UNC. \n“We’re going to try to make Carolina the number one public university in America,” he tells me.\nIt’s an ambitious vision, and as he delivers it, for better or worse, he sounds very much like a Silicon Valley CEO.\nTo hear this interview with Roberts, listen to TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast; new episodes drop every Tuesday.\n",

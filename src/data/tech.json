    "description": "Known for its blazing fast internet and home to some of the world’s biggest tech giants, South Korea has also faced a string of data breaches and cybersecurity lapses that has struggled to match the pace of its digital ambitions.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>South Korea is world-famous for its blazing-fast internet, near-universal broadband coverage, and as a leader in digital innovation, hosting global tech brands like Hyundai, LG, and Samsung. But this very success has made the country a prime target for hackers and exposed how fragile its cybersecurity defenses remain.  </p>\n<p>The country is reeling from a string of high-profile hacks, affecting credit card companies, telecoms, tech startups, and government agencies, impacting vast swathes of the South Korean population. In each case, ministries and regulators appeared to scramble in parallel, sometimes deferring to one another rather than moving in unison. </p>\n<p>Critics argue that South Korea’s cyber defenses are hindered by a fragmented system of government ministries and agencies, often resulting in slow and uncoordinated responses, <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250922/calls-grow-for-cybersecurity-control-tower\" target=\"_blank\">per local media reports</a>. </p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250922001000315#:~:text=In%20response%2C%20the%20government%20announced,advanced%20cyberattacks%20remains%20in%20doubt.\" target=\"_blank\">no clear government agency acting as “first responder”</a> following a cyberattack, the country’s cyber defenses are struggling to keep pace with its digital ambitions. </p>\n<p>“The government’s approach to cybersecurity remains largely reactive, treating it as a crisis management issue rather than as critical national infrastructure,” Brian Pak, the chief executive of Seoul-based cybersecurity firm Theori, told TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p>Pak, who also serves as an advisor to SK Telecom’s parent company’s special committee on cybersecurity innovations, told TechCrunch that because government agencies tasked with cybersecurity work in silos, developing digital defenses and training skilled workers often get overlooked. </p>\n<p>The country is also facing a severe shortage of skilled cybersecurity experts.  </p>\n<p>“[That’s] mainly because the current approach has held back workforce development. This lack of talent creates a vicious cycle. Without enough expertise, it’s impossible to build and maintain the proactive defenses needed to stay ahead of threats,” Pak continued.  </p>\n<p>Political deadlock has fostered a habit of seeking quick, obvious “quick fixes” after each crisis, said Pak, all the while the more challenging, long-term work of building digital resilience continues to be sidelined. </p>\n<p>This year alone, there has been a major cybersecurity incident in South Korea almost every month, further mounting concerns over the resilience of South Korea’s digital infrastructure.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-january-2025-nbsp\">January 2025 </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>GS Retail, the operator of convenience stores and grocery markets across South Korea,<a href=\"https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-retail/2025/01/06/VVNMSAYGDBFMPL5TGSDN2M52R4/\" target=\"_blank\"> confirmed</a> a data breach that exposed the personal details of about 90,000 customers after its website was attacked between December 27 and January 4.

The breach exposed around 200GB of data and is believed to have affected roughly <a href=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/lotte-cardholder-data-breach-impacts-nearly-3-million-customers-with-280000-at-risk-of-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\">3 million customers</a>.

A Russian-linked hacking group claimed it stole over a terabyte of internal files, including sensitive customer data, and even leaked samples on the dark web.</li>\n<li>North Korea-linked hackers, believed to be the Kimsuky group, have been spying on foreign embassies in South Korea for months by disguising their attacks as routine diplomatic emails. According to Trellix, the campaign has been active <a href=\"https://therecord.media/north-korean-hackers-target-foreign-embassies?\" target=\"_blank\">since March and has targeted at least 19 embassies and foreign ministries</a> in South Korea. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h-september-2025-nbsp-nbsp\">September 2025  </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>KT, one of South Korea’s biggest telecom operators, has reported a cyber breach that exposed subscriber data from more than 5,500 customers. The attack was linked to illegal “fake base stations” that tapped into KT’s network, enabling hackers to intercept mobile traffic, steal information like IMSI, IMEI, and phone numbers, and even make unauthorized micro-payments. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In light of the recent surge in hacking incidents, the South Korean Presidential Office’s National Security is stepping in to tighten defenses, <a href=\"https://www.lightreading.com/regulatory-politics/south-korea-forms-interagency-body-to-curb-data-breaches-as-kt-reports-new-incidents?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">pushing for a cross-ministerial effort that brings multiple agencies together in a coordinated</a>, whole-of-government response.  </p>\n<p>In September 2025, the National Security Office announced that it would implement <a href=\"https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250922008700315\" target=\"_blank\">“comprehensive” cyber measures</a> through an interagency plan, led by the South Korean president’s office. Regulators also signaled a legal change giving the government power to launch probes <a href=\"https://www.ajupress.com/view/20250922154604642\" target=\"_blank\">at the first sign of hacking — even if companies haven’t filed a report</a>. Both steps aim to address the lack of a first responder that has long hindered South Korea’s cyber defenses. </p>\n<p>But South Korea’s fragmented system leaves accountability weak, placing all authority in a presidential “control tower” could risk “politicization” and overreach, according to Pak.  </p>\n<p>A better path may be balance: a central body to set strategy and coordinate crises, paired with independent oversight to keep power in check. In a hybrid model, expert agencies like<a href=\"https://www.kisa.or.kr/EN\" target=\"_blank\"> KISA</a> would still handle the technical work — just with more straightforward rules and accountability, Pak told TechCrunch.  </p>\n<p>When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the South Korea’s Ministry of Science in ICT said the ministry, with KISA and other relevant agencies, is “committed to addressing increasingly sophisticated and advanced cyber threats.”  </p>\n<p>“We continue to work diligently to minimize potential harm to Korean businesses and the general public,” the spokesperson added.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on September 30.</em></p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Kate Park is a reporter at TechCrunch, with a focus on technology, startups and venture capital in Asia.

Bloomberg recently published a report about Tesla owners and passengers getting stuck in their vehicles because of the company’s hard-to-find manual releases.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Earlier this year, Anker, the Chinese company that makes Eufy security cameras, offered its users money in exchange for videos of package and car thefts. </p>\n<p>The popular internet-connected security camera maker <a href=\"https://community.eufy.com/t/help-improve-eufy-ai-earn-cash/4662267\" target=\"_blank\">said it would pay its customers $2 per video to train its AI systems</a> to help better detect thieves who steal cars and packages.  </p>\n<p>“To ensure we have enough data, we are looking for videos of both real and staged events, to help train the Al what to be on the lookout for,” the company wrote on its website.  </p>\n<p>“You can even create events by pretending to be a thief and donate those events,” the website reads. “You can complete this quickly. Maybe one act can be captured by your two outdoor cameras simultaneously, making it efficient and easy. If you also stage a car door theft, you might earn $80.” </p>\n<p>Eufy also wrote that “the data collected from these staged events is used solely for training our Al algorithms and not for any other purposes.”  </p>\n<p>This initiative shows that companies are willing to pay to get users’ data they think can be useful to train their AI models. While this gives some users the ability to get value out of their own data, there are security and privacy risks involved.  </p>\n<p>Case in point: Last week, TechCrunch found that Neon, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/neon-the-no-2-social-app-on-the-apple-app-store-pays-users-to-record-their-phone-calls-and-sells-data-to-ai-firms/\" target=\"_blank\">a viral calling app</a> that offered money to users willing to share recordings and transcripts of their calls, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/viral-call-recording-app-neon-goes-dark-after-exposing-users-phone-numbers-call-recordings-and-transcripts/\" target=\"_blank\">had a security flaw that allowed users to access any other user’s data</a>. After being alerted of the security lapse, Neon went offline.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-hundreds-of-thousands-of-videos-donated-to-train-ai\">Hundreds of thousands of videos ‘donated’ to train AI</h2>\n<p>Eufy’s campaign offering $2 per video for theft videos ran from December 18, 2024, to February 25, 2025. More than 120 users responded on the campaign’s announcement page saying they participated in it, according to comments posted by users there.  </p>\n<p>The company’s goal was to collect 20,000 videos each of package thefts and of “pulling car doors.” Eufy users could participate by filling out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5MnlPD7oI9yf9eb56ttG_otnMdFg60VwVHtlmtRDk6hJzkQ/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">a Google Form</a> where they could upload videos and their PayPal account for payment.  </p>\n<p>Eufy did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment and our questions, such as how many users participated in the campaign, how much money it paid those users, how many videos the company collected, and whether the company deleted the collected videos after training its AI systems.  </p>\n<p>Since then, Eufy has similar campaigns aimed at incentivizing its customers to send in videos to train their AI. </p>\n<p>As of the time of publication, through another in-app campaign that Eufy calls the Video Donation Program to improve its AI systems, Eufy also offers users rewards that range from an “Apprentice Medal,” which appears to simply be a badge next to the user’s name in the app, to gifts such as cameras or gift cards. </p>\n<p>Eufy is only asking for videos involving humans for this campaign. </p>\n<p>The Eufy app also shows an “Honor Wall” that ranks users who have donated the most video events. The leader of the ranking has donated 201,531 videos, according to the app.  </p>\n<p>In the app’s page for the donation program, Eufy clarifies that “donated videos are only used for Al training and improvement. Eufy will not provide the video to third parties.” </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?w=337\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=149,300 149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=768,1550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=337,680 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=595,1200 595w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=634,1280 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=213,430 213w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=357,720 357w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=446,900 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=396,800 396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=761,1536 761w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=1015,2048 1015w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=331,668 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=186,375 186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=306,617 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=263,531 263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Eufy/Anker (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Eufy also <a href=\"https://service.anker.com/article-description/How-to-Donate-eufy-Baby-Monitor-2-Videos-in-the-eufy-Care-App\" target=\"_blank\">asks users to donate</a> videos recorded with the company’s baby monitors.

Firebase is a database that was also designed to power AI apps.</p>\n<p>Supabase combines Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps). It simplified the difficult parts of setting up a database down to a few button clicks. Consequently, it became a popular back end for vibe-coding tools — which write apps with natural language prompts — like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/lovables-ceo-isnt-too-worried-about-the-vibe-coding-competition/\">fast-growing Lovable</a> and Bolt.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Agriculture is a thirsty industry, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/water-use-stress\">consuming 70% of all fresh water used worldwide</a>. In some countries, like India or Chile, it can be more than 90%.</p>\n<p>For Mario Bustamante, who lives in Chile, the problem hits close to home. “Lack of water is a big issue here,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Bustamante is betting that AI can help slash water use in farms across the world. His startup, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/instacrops/\">Instacrops</a>, was originally founded to deploy internet-of-things (IoT) sensors on farms to warn farmers about damaging frost conditions, but as the hardware became commoditized, the company pivoted to software and water use.</p>\n<p>Now, Instacrops is helping 260 farms cut their water use up to 30% while also increasing crop yields by as much as 20%. The company is part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a>, and it will be presenting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?utm_source=tc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&display=\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> later this month in San Francisco. </p>\n<p>The switch from hardware to AI turned the company on its head, allowing it to operate with fewer staff and while processing more data. </p>\n<p>“We are processing — more or less — 15 million data points per hour. Almost 10 years ago, that was the amount for a year,” Bustamante said. “We’re reducing cost, team members, and generating more impact with less.”</p>\n<p>Instacrops can install new IoT sensors or connect to a farm’s existing network and collect data from them to advise farmers when to irrigate different areas.

    "description": "The event planning startup, which has raised over $27M from a16z and others, fixed the bug after TechCrunch found that Partiful was not removing granular location data from users' profile photos.",
    "body": "<div>\n<p>Social event planning app Partiful, which calls itself “Facebook events for hot people,” has firmly replaced Facebook as the go-to platform for sending party invitations. But what Partiful also has in common with Facebook is that it’s collecting a tsunami of user data, and Partiful could have done better at keeping that data secure.</p>\n<p>On Partiful, hosts can create online invitations with a retro, maximalist vibe, allowing guests to RSVP to events with the ease of ordering a salad on a touch-screen. Partiful aims to be user-friendly and trendy, propelling the app to #9 on the iOS App Store’s Lifestyle charts. Google called Partiful the “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/partiful-is-googles-best-app-of-2024/\">best app</a>” of 2024. </p>\n<p>Now, Partiful has evolved into a powerful Facebook-like social graph, easily mapping who your friends are and who your friends’ friends are, what you do, where you go, and all of your phone numbers.</p>\n<p>As Partiful grew more popular, some users became skeptical of the company’s origins. One New York City promoter announced that it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/wait-partifuls-founders-worked-at-palantir.html\">boycotting Partiful</a> because its founders and some staff are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-mafia-former-employees-startups-anduril-2025-3\">former employees of Palantir</a>, Peter Thiel’s data mining company, which produces the software that powers ICE’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.404media.co/this-is-palantirs-justification-for-building-ices-master-database/\">master database</a> for the Trump administration’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/\">deportation crackdown</a>.</p>\n<p>Given some of the speculation around the app, TechCrunch set up a new account and tested Partiful. We soon found that the app was not stripping the location data of user-uploaded images, including public profile photos.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch found it was possible for anyone, using only the developer tools in a web browser, to access raw user profile photos stored in Partiful’s backend database hosted on Google Firebase. If the user’s photo contained the precise real-world location of where it was taken, anyone else could have also viewed the precise coordinates of where that photo was taken.</p>\n<p>Almost all digital files, like the pictures you take on a smartphone, contain <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#metadata\">metadata</a>, which includes information like the file size, when it was created, and by whom. In the case of photos and videos, metadata can include information about the kind of camera used and its settings, as well as the precise latitude and longitude coordinates of where the image was captured.</p>\n<p>The security flaw is problematic because anyone using Partiful could have revealed the location of where a person’s profile photo was snapped. Some Partiful user profile photos contained highly granular location data that could be used to identify the person’s home or work, particularly in rural areas where individual homes are easier to distinguish on a map.</p>\n<p>It’s common practice for companies that host user images and videos to automatically remove metadata upon upload to prevent privacy lapses like this. </p>\n<p>TechCrunch verified the bug ourselves by uploading a new Partiful profile photo that we had previously captured from outside of the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco, which contained the photo’s precise location. When we checked the metadata of the photo stored on Partiful’s server, it still contained the exact coordinates of where the image was taken down to a few feet.</p>\n<p>After discovering the security flaw, TechCrunch alerted Partiful co-founders Shreya Murthy and Joy Tao by email, as Partiful does not have a public means for reporting security flaws. TechCrunch shared a link to a Partiful user’s raw profile photo containing that user’s real-world location at the time the photo was taken, a residential address in Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Tao told TechCrunch on Friday that the vulnerability was “already on our team’s radar, and was recently prioritized as an upcoming fix.” </p>\n<p>Partiful initially provided a timeline to fix the flaw by “next week,” but given the sensitivity of the data involved, TechCrunch requested the fix by Friday. Partiful confirmed it fixed the bug on Saturday.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch found by Saturday that metadata was removed from existing user-uploaded photos. The profile photo that we uploaded with our real-world location also had the metadata removed. </p>\n<p>Partiful disclosed the security lapse in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/partiful/status/1974485503702376494\">a tweet</a> shortly before the publishing of this story.</p>\n<p>When asked by TechCrunch if Partiful has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if there was any direct or bulk access to user profile photos stored in its database, Partiful spokesperson Jess Eames said this was “still under investigation but we have found no evidence of this yet.”</p>\n<p>Eames said the company “regularly perform security reviews with experts in the field, not just as a one-time action but as part of our ongoing processes.” Partiful did not provide TechCrunch with the name of the experts when asked.</p>\n<p>Partiful has raised over $27 million from investors since its founding in 2022, including a $20 million Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. TechCrunch asked Partiful’s co-founders if they had commissioned a security review of their product before launch, but they would not say.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

Instead, by looking into the app’s code, a reverse engineer enabled the app’s new home screen. Here, shortcut buttons to do things like “Create Image” or access “Deep Research” were moved up on the screen and were then followed by the scrollable feed.</p>\n<p>Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson said there’s no announcement to be made “just yet.” </p>\n<p>In the examples shown, prompts suggested fun things to do with your photos, like “Teleport me to deep space,” “Give me a vintage or grunge look,” or “Turn my drawing into a storybook,” among other things. Other prompts featuring a colorful background offered different ideas of things to ask Gemini, or suggested use cases.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI may be reversing course on how it approaches copyright and intellectual property in its new video app Sora.</p>\n<p>Prior to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">Sora’s launch</a> this week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a?mod=article_inline\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> that OpenAI had been telling Hollywood studios and agencies that they needed to explicitly opt out if they didn’t want their IP to be included in Sora-generated videos.</p>\n<p>Despite being invite-only, the app quickly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/openais-sora-soars-to-no-1-on-the-u-s-app-store/\">climbed to the top of the App Store charts</a>. Sora’s most distinctive feature may be its “cameos,” where users can upload their biometric data to see their digital likeness featured in AI-generated videos.</p>\n<p>At the same time, users also seem to delight in flouting copyright laws by creating videos with popular, studio-owned characters. In some cases, those characters might even criticize the company’s approach to copyright, for example in videos where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">Pikachu and SpongeBob interact with deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/sora-update-number-1\">a blog post published Friday</a>, Altman said the company is already planning two changes to Sora, first by giving copyright holders “more granular control over generation of characters, similar to the opt-in model for likeness but with additional controls.”</p>\n<p>The key word here appears to be “opt-in,” suggesting that OpenAI will stop users from creating videos with copyrighted characters unless studios and others rightsholders have actually given Sora permission to do so.</p>\n<p>“We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction’ and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all),” Altman said.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Even with this new approach, Altman acknowledged there are likely to be “some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t.”</p>\n<p>The second change he mentioned is some unspecified form of video monetization. The company previously said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">its only plan for monetization</a> was to charge users to create extra videos during periods of high demand, and Altman’s blog post seems to elaborate on that idea by acknowledging “we are going to have to somehow make money for video generation.” He also suggesting the revenue could be shared with rightsholders.</p>\n<p>“Our hope is that the new kind of engagement is even more valuable than the revenue share, but of course we … want both to be valuable.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

On <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">its first day</a>, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on Apple’s U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider <a href=\"http://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appfigures</a>. On Friday, October 3, it <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/openai-sora-apple-app-store.html\" target=\"_blank\">became</a> the No. 1 app on the U.S. App Store.</p>\n<p>That puts it ahead of Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>The firm estimates Sora’s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30 and October 1.</p>\n<p>The day-one figure also puts Sora’s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI’s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.</p>\n<p>Since Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we’ll admit. It’s possible the new video app could have attracted even <em>more</em> installs if it were open to all users.</p>\n<p>Despite this restriction, it’s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers’ hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openai-staff-grapples-with-the-companys-social-media-push/\">chagrin of some at OpenAI</a>, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who’s to say that humanity isn’t benefiting from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking</a>, “Are my piggies enjoying their slop?”)</p>\n<p>To compare Sora’s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps’ U.S. and Canadian downloads. That’s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/18/openai-launches-an-official-chatgpt-app-for-ios/\">limited itself to U.S. users</a> at the time, while Grok <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/xai-is-testing-a-standalone-ios-app-for-its-grok-chatbot/\">limited its iOS-only</a> release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn’t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/10/anthropics-claude-sees-tepid-reception-on-ios-compared-with-chatgpts-debut/\">its Claude app to iOS last year</a>. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>For more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app’s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.</p>\n<p>It found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.</p>\n<p>Sora also hit the U.S. App Store’s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78. </p>\n<p><em>This post was originally published on October 2, 2025, 11:24 AM PT.

You click “accept” or “reject,” and then find out if you made the same choice as YC.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png 1354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=768,591 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=680,523 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=1200,923 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=1280,985 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=430,331 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=720,554 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=900,693 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=800,616 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=668,514 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=487,375 487w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=802,617 802w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=690,531 690w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-12.39.34PM.png?resize=50,38 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>YCArena</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>It’s a lot harder than it looks. YC is estimated to accept <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/investors\" target=\"_blank\">around 1% of applicants</a>, and at a certain point, some luck is required to really capture a partner’s eye — maybe your pitch is the first that a partner watched after a very rejuvenating coffee break, or maybe your company is the last video on the list and everyone’s tired.</p>\n<p>“Many rejected founders went on to build incredibly successful companies afterwards,” reads a note at the start of the game. “Rejection means nothing — even the most successful founders got rejected multiple times.”</p>\n<p>YC Arena has other games that ask you to match a company name to its logo, or guess what year a company did YC based on its description (spoiler alert: There’s a lot more AI in recent years). But the YC Partner Simulator game is the most interesting since it makes us confront our own decision-making processes.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>As a tech journalist, I thought I would be pretty good at the YC Partner Simulator. I may not be an investor, but I know what it’s like to sift through an inbox full of startup pitches and choose which ones pique my curiosity — I’ve walked the floor of TechCrunch Disrupt’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield 200 Expo</a> with the task of identifying companies to interview and write about. But this game is hard. After all, we’re working within different parameters, since the newsworthiness of a company is not directly tied to its potential to turn a profit.</p>\n<p>(For example: As I write this, there’s an AI pet sitting in my lap that I’m planning to review. Would I put money on the bet that Casio will turn a profit off the investment it takes to create <a href=\"https://www.casio.com/us/moflin/\" target=\"_blank\">a glorified Furby that retails for $430</a>? No. Do I expect that an article about my life with an AI pet will be interesting to readers? Yes.)</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>If anything, the game shows just how subjective these processes can be. But after I read YC co-founder Paul Graham’s <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/howtoapply\" target=\"_blank\">application guide</a>, my guesses started to get more accurate.</p>\n<p>“You have to be exceptionally clear and concise,” Graham wrote. “Whatever you have to say, give it to us right in the first sentence, in the simplest possible terms.” (For the record, this advice also applies to emailing journalists.) </p>\n<p>I played the game again, but this time, I paid less attention to what the company was pitching and more attention to how quickly they could convey what their company does. Of course, I wouldn’t recommend this strategy for evaluating a startup in real life (hot take: you should care what a company does!), but for the purposes of the game, I ended up choosing a company’s fate more accurately.</p>\n<p>This probably isn’t a coincidence. When OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman was president of YC, he remarked in an interview that the incubator spent just <a href=\"https://x.com/StartupArchive_/status/1929568737876717917\" target=\"_blank\">10 minutes</a> reviewing each company’s application to make a decision.</p>\n<p>“It turns out that in 10 minutes, if the only question you’re trying to answer is, ‘Does this person have the potential to be the next Mark Zuckerberg?’ … You can answer that question in 10 minutes,” Altman said in 2016. “Not with 100 percent accuracy, obviously, but good enough that our business model works.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

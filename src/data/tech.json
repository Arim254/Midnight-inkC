    "body": "\nStripe is considering a deal to buy some or all of PayPal Holdings, sources told Bloomberg, though talks are still in their very early stages and the deal may not happen.\nThe news comes the same day Stripe released its annual letter, giving updates on the business. The big news was that Stripe is making a tender offer that values the company at $159 billion, a 74% increase from last year. The investors buying employee shares this time around include Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive Capital. Stripe will also buy back some stock, the letter said.The latest valuation again makes Stripe one of the industry’s most valuable private companies. Based in Dublin, Stripe’s co-founder and CEO, Patrick Collison, told CNBC recently that going public was not on his list of priorities. PayPal Holdings (which includes the flagship product PayPal and its services, as well as other companies like Venmo) is currently a publicly traded company, with a market cap of around $40 billion.\nPayPal’s stock rose slightly after reports of Stripe’s interest in an acquisition. Stripe declined to comment.\n",

The app first launched as a way to expand Reels viewing beyond mobile, and now users can also browse posts from their Instagram feeds directly on their TVs.\nBy bringing reels to TV, Instagram is looking to better compete with YouTube, which largely dominates the TV space. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. Rival TikTok also has a TV app.\nThe new app is personalized to each user, as it shows reels based on the content and creators they enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels are organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle.\nReels play automatically, which means you won’t have to keep scrolling to watch the next video. The Instagram for TV app lets you like, view comments, and reshare Reels.\nUsers can pair the app with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home. Or, they can choose to create a new account just for TV viewing. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Apps\n\n",

But in the eyes of CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber is really just a giant code base with engineers that are “literally the builders of the company.” In fact, Uber’s engineers have gone so far as to replace Khosrowshahi with a chatbot that they’ll ask questions in preparation of meetings with the top brass.\nThat’s according to an interview Khosrowshahi gave this week on Steven Bartlett’s podcast, The Diary of a CEO.\n“One of my team members told me that some teams have built a Dara AI, you know, so that they basically make the presentation to the Dara AI as a prep for making a presentation to me,” Khosrowshahi said on the podcast. “Because you can imagine, like, you know, by the time something comes to me, there’s been a prep and a meeting of the slide deck has been beautifully honed. So they have Dara AI to tune their prep.”\nBusiness Insider earlier reported this detail.\nAbout 90% of Uber’s software engineers are using AI in their work, Khosrowshahi said, while about 30% are “power users” of AI tools, completely rethinking the architecture of the company.\n“They are manufacturing the bricks that go into the system, and they’re architects who are kind of thinking about what the system should look like,” he said.\nKhosrowshahi added: “It really is changing their productivity in a way that I’ve never, ever seen before.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Transportation\n\n",

Etched didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMatX’s latest round comes more than a year after its Series A of about $100 million, which was led by Spark Capital. TechCrunch earlier reported that the 2024 round valued the startup at more than $300 million.\nBefore co-founding MatX in 2023, Pope led AI software development for Google’s TPUs, the tech giant’s proprietary AI chips. His co-founder, Mike Gunter, was a lead designer of the TPU hardware before leaving to launch the startup.\nThe new funding will help MatX produce its chips with TSMC, with plans to start shipping them in 2027.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Hardware\n\n",

While prosecutors didn’t name the company at the time, the U.S. Treasury Department confirmed on Tuesday that the broker is Operation Zero and announced sanctions against the company. \nOperation Zero offers millions of dollars for details of security vulnerabilities in Android and iPhone devices, as well as messaging apps like Telegram. Operation Zero claims to resell the tools it acquires exclusively to the Russian government and local companies. \nThe U.S. Department of Justice alleged that the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed the end customer to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.” Williams, who previously worked for an Australian spy agency and the country’s military, admitted that he made $1.3 million in crypto from the sales between 2022 and 2025. \nL3Harris and Williams’ lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Security\n\n",

The hackers have used their social engineering skills to steal reams of data from several universities and over a billion records from Salesforce customers, including Google and Workday, and they claimed recent hacks at Pornhub and fintech lending giant Figure.\nTechCrunch has reached out to CarGurus for comment and will update this article if the company responds. \nThe customer data that was published included user account ID mappings, finance prequalification application data, and dealer account and subscription information, according to Have I Been Pwned.\nThis is the second automotive-related data breach reported by Have I Been Pwned this year.

The company said that a new agent being introduced in Opal will allow users to create mini-apps that can let them plan and execute tasks using text prompts.\nThe feature uses the Gemini 3 Flash model and automatically chooses tools to execute tasks. For instance, it can use Google Sheets to maintain memory across sessions, such as a shopping list for an e-commerce-related app. The new agent creates and plans the next step for the tasks on its own.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle said these agents are natively interactive, which means that if they need more information, they would ask users to enter it or offer them choices to determine next steps, if needed. With this addition, users without technical knowledge could build complex workflows within their apps, the company claims.\nOpal was first introduced for U.S. users in July 2025. The tool lets anyone create mini web apps or remix existing apps. In October 2025, the company rolled out Opal to users in 15 more countries, including Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and Singapore. A month later, the company made the tool available in over 160 countries. And in December, Google added the tool to the Gemini web app, allowing users to create custom apps through a visual editor without writing any code.\nBeyond Google, many other startups are also building tools that let users build apps via natural language prompts. Lovable and Replit are among the more popular ones, but other startups like former Replika founder’s Wabi, SoftBank and Lightspeed-backed Emergent, and Accel-backed Rocket.new are also gaining prominence.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

The need for a technical solution like this came about as more governments around the world have created laws to block or restrict certain apps like social media that can only be used by adults 18 and up.\nIn Brazil, for example, developers can use the Declared Age Range API to obtain the user’s age category, if the user or their parent or guardian chooses to share it. \nIn addition, Apple will block users in Australia, Brazil, and Singapore from downloading apps rated 18+, starting today, until they confirm they are adults. In this case, the App Store will perform the age confirmation automatically, but Apple notes that developers may still have separate compliance requirements they need to meet.\nAlso, developers whose games contain loot boxes — a gambling-like mechanism that lets players spend money for a random chance at in-game rewards and that lawmakers believe shouldn’t be available to kids — will see their apps’ age ratings updated to reflect an 18+ audience in Brazil, specifically.\nIn the U.S., new users in Utah and Louisiana will soon have their age categories shared with their developers’ apps through the Declared Age Range API as well. The company said it has expanded its other tools around age ratings and permissions to meet its compliance obligations.\n“New signals are now available through the Declared Age Range API, including whether age-related regulatory requirements apply to the user and if the user is required to share their age range,” reads the Apple blog post. “The API will also let you know if you need to get a parent or guardian’s permission for significant app updates for a child.”\nApple last October worked to comply with similar age-assurance requirements in Texas but put some of its plans on hold back in December, as the state’s law is being fought in court. It also updated its age ratings system last year with more granular age ranges than before and added a variety of new questions for developers submitting apps to Apple for review.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nDiscord no longer plans to roll out age verification globally in March and is delaying the launch until the second half of 2026, the company announced Tuesday.\nDiscord had faced heavy backlash from users earlier this month after it announced that all users would be put into a “teen-appropriate experience” by default until they were verified as adults.\nThe company clarified on Tuesday that 90% of users won’t need to verify their age and will be able to keep using Discord as usual, since most don’t engage with age-restricted content and the platform’s internal safety systems can already determine the age of many adult users. These internal systems work by looking at signals like how long an account has existed, whether the user has a payment method on file, and what types of servers they’re in.\n“Let me be upfront: we knew this rollout was going to be controversial,” Discord CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy wrote in the blog post announcing the change. “Any time you introduce something that touches identity and verification, people are going to have strong feelings. Rightfully so. In hindsight, we should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works.”\n“The way this landed, many of you walked away thinking we’re requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord,” he continued. “That’s not what’s happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we’re doing and why.”\nDiscord says that people who are part of the 10% of users who do need to verify their age will be given options to do so. Previously, Discord had stated that users could only verify their age by either completing a facial age estimation or submitting an ID to Discord’s vendor partners. Now Discord says that before expanding age verification worldwide, it plans to introduce additional verification methods, including the option to verify using a credit card.\n“If you choose not to verify, here’s exactly what happens: you keep your account, your servers, your friends list, your DMs, and voice chat,” Vishnevskiy said in the post. “The only thing that changes is you won’t be able to access age-restricted content or change certain default safety settings designed to protect teens. Nothing else about your Discord experience changes.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company also plans to publish information on its website about each verification vendor and their data practices, and clearly identify which vendor is being used. In addition, it now says it will only work with vendors that perform the age-verification process entirely on the user’s device.\nThe change around vendors also comes as Discord faced backlash for listing Persona, which is backed by an investment firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, as one of its partners in age verification. Thiel is chairman and co-founder of Palantir, which has attracted controversy for its work with U.S. immigration enforcement and other federal surveillance programs. Persona also attracted criticism from users for its use of third-party data and partnerships with governments.\nDiscord is trying to distance itself from Persona and told The Verge yesterday that it “ran a limited test of Persona in the UK where age assurance had previously launched and that test has since concluded.”\nDiscord also faced backlash for its age-verification plans because it had disclosed last October that around 70,000 users may have had sensitive data, such as their government ID photos, exposed after hackers breached a third-party vendor that the platform used for age-related appeals. Discord says it no longer works with the vendor involved in this breach.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAI has brought the startup world the rise of a new phenomenon: startups that almost instantly hit multimillion-dollar ARR (annual recurring revenue).\nStories abound of founders going from zero to $10 million, or as much as $100 million, in annual recurring revenue in a matter of months.\nTo be fair, this alone isn’t a harbinger of long-term success. VCs say that durable growth is far more important than ultra-speedy growth. Investors want to back companies where the rate at which customers cancel or stop paying is low, meaning customers are happy. They want that annual or monthly recurring revenue to stick around and grow, not wobble and crash.\nEven so, the phenomenon is real. As part of Stripe’s annual report, released on Tuesday, the payments giant revealed that it had more new businesses start using its products in 2025 than ever before, with more than half — specifically 57% — outside the United States. This 2025 cohort grew 50% faster than those who started using Stripe products in 2024, it said. While Stripe did not reveal the hard numbers, it did say that 2025 saw double the number of these fledging startups hit $10 million in ARR within three months compared to the number that did so in 2024.\nThe letter also noted that Stripe Atlas —  the company’s business incorporation tool  — saw a 41% increase in company formations last year. Of those new startups, 20% charged their first customer within 30 days, up from just 8% in 2020, further underscoring how quickly this new generation of founders is moving.\nIn comparison, in 2024, founders were still publicly celebrating hitting $10 million in ARR in three years — which is still, by most business standards, a metric worth boasting about.\nSo for all of those on social media saying things like, “Bootstrapping to $10M ARR is easier and less risky than creating a VC-backed unicorn, ” or things like, “the AI-native startups hitting $10M ARR with just three people are rewriting the entire playbook,” well, now there’s a smattering of data to back that up.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n",

    "body": "\nSpotify and Liquid Death have teamed up to launch what might be the wildest product collaboration of the year: the Eternal Playlist Urn, a wireless Bluetooth speaker shaped like a cremation urn. Yes, you read that right.\nThe Eternal Playlist Urn is not really meant to hold ashes, but is instead a collector’s item, with only 150 available for purchase in the U.S. For $495, buyers receive a 7-inch-by-11.4-inch urn with a Bluetooth speaker built into the lid. (We question the audio quality, since all the tech is crammed into the lid of this tiny urn.)\nAccording to Spotify, the urn offers “the world’s first ever music-streaming urn,” making death “a lot less boring.” With this product, the idea is that even the dearly departed can keep jamming to their favorite tunes for eternity, or at least that’s the company’s joke.\n“Life needs music. So does the afterlife. That’s why Spotify has partnered with Liquid Death to create the Eternal Playlist Urn, the world’s first wireless speaker designed to bring your music somewhere it’s never been before,” Spotify stated in a blog post. \nWhen you get the urn, you can create your own Eternal Playlist on Spotify by answering questions like “What’s your eternal vibe?” or “What’s your go-to ghost noise?” Spotify will then use your answers and listening history to generate a custom playlist, which syncs directly to the urn’s speaker and can be shared with friends and family.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nWhile Spotify hasn’t released a branded smart speaker, it partnered with Ikea in 2022 on a portable Bluetooth lamp speaker with Spotify Tap functionality, making this the company’s second hardware collaboration with another brand. The company also released “Car Thing,” an in-car entertainment device, which was later discontinued.\nThis isn’t the first time Liquid Death has pushed the limits of extreme marketing. The brand is known for its outrageous campaigns, including a life-sized Yeti Casket-shaped cooler. While some may find the humor a little morbid, fans of dark, irreverent comedy seem to be intrigued by it. The cooler had over 800 bidders and sold for $68,200.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWhether you view this as a clever stunt, a funny gag, a tasteless joke, or simply absurd, the Eternal Playlist Urn is a testament to how far brands will go to capture our attention.\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nTwitch announced on Tuesday that it’s revamping its suspensions policy to shift away from its previous all-or-nothing penalty system. Until now, a temporary suspension on Twitch meant losing access to the platform altogether, including the ability to chat, watch streams while logged in, and access basic information. Now, the company is implementing two suspension types: streaming suspensions and chatting suspensions.\nThe company notes that while its previous approach was easier to implement, its new targeted enforcement system means that the restrictions will match the specific offense committed. \nIf a user violates Twitch’s Community Guidelines during a livestream, their account will be suspended from going live, and chat on their channel will be temporarily disabled. During a streaming suspension, the user can still watch streams while logged in, chat on other channels, and access their user dashboard. Plus, viewers will still be able to watch their existing clips and videos.\nSimilarly, if someone violates the company’s Community Guidelines in chat, they will receive a suspension from chat but will still be able to stream their own content or watch other streamers. Notably, users who receive a chat suspension can still chat in their own channel, but they will be prevented from participating in chats on other streams.\n“Higher severity violations present a greater risk to our community, therefore they will receive both chatting and streaming suspensions simultaneously to prevent further harm,” Twitch explained in a blog post. “And, as is the case today, those who commit the most serious violations will receive an indefinite suspension and lose all access to Twitch. There is no place for serious violations on Twitch.”\nTwitch isn’t changing the length of temporary suspensions, as streaming and chatting suspensions will last anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days.\nThe company says that with each new violation, the length of the suspension will increase, and that accumulating multiple temporary suspensions can still lead to an indefinite suspension from Twitch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTwitch determines the severity of a violation by considering the extent of harm it causes or has the potential to cause. It defines harm as any action that leads to physical, emotional, social, or financial damage to a user or to Twitch.\nThe company is working on additional suspension types that will roll out in future updates.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nGoogle announced Tuesday that it will build a data center in Minnesota that’s backed by 1.9 gigawatts of clean power, including a massive 300-megawatt battery made by startup Form Energy.\nThe new data center, Google’s first in Minnesota, will be located in Pine Island, about an hour southeast of Minneapolis.\nThe tech company is working with Xcel Energy to build 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power. Both will feed Form’s battery, which will be capable of delivering its rated power for 100 hours. At 30 gigawatt-hours, it will be the largest battery in the world, helping the data center operate on clean energy for longer periods of time.\nSuch long-duration batteries help renewable energy sources continue to provide power at night or during lulls, “firming” the power source, as experts call it. Grid-scale lithium-ion batteries do this already, though for shorter periods.\nForm Energy’s batteries are unlike most other grid-scale batteries. Whereas a typical grid-scale battery today uses lithium-ion technology that’s been repurposed from chemistries used by the automotive industry, Form’s batteries store energy by rusting and deoxidizing iron. \nWhen oxygen from the air flows over pebbles of iron inside the battery, it rusts the iron, generating electricity in the process. To charge, electrical current deoxidizes the rust, turning it back into metallic iron and releasing oxygen in the process, which is drawn out of the battery.\nAs battery chemistries go, Form’s iron-air cells are heavy and not very efficient. Typical iron-air batteries can only deliver 50% to 70% of the energy used to charge them, compared with upwards of 90% for lithium-ion batteries. But for all their downsides, they come with one very large upside: they’re incredibly cheap. Form says 1 kilowatt-hour of storage will ultimately cost just $20 using their technology, which is at least three times cheaper than lithium-ion batteries.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe new project also introduces a wonky utility fee structure to Minnesota that’s intended to help utilities adopt clean technologies without running afoul of their regulators, which push utilities to use the cheapest source of electricity. \nGoogle first developed the concept in Nevada, where it’s buying power from enhanced geothermal startup Fervo. Alternately called the “clean transition tariff” or the “clean energy accelerator charge,” the agreement between Google and Xcel allows the utility to accept projects that might be considered risky by regulators, with the tech company paying a premium to ensure that regular ratepayers aren’t left holding the bag. \nSolar and wind are both proven technologies, but Form’s iron-air batteries are still relatively new. The startup’s first battery is currently being installed in Minnesota with cooperative utility Great River Energy, and it will store 150 megawatt-hours for 100 hours, sending 1.5 megawatts to the grid at its peak. \nForm makes its batteries at a factory in West Virginia. The company has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook data.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nLarge language models have a problem: they are large. Multiverse Computing, a Spanish startup, is addressing this issue with compressed models that aim to close the gap between what frontier models can do and what companies can actually afford to deploy. \nThe secret sauce is CompactifAI, a compression technology inspired by quantum computing that the Basque company has applied to models released by OpenAI. As of today, developers can access a newer version of Multiverse’s HyperNova 60B model for free on Hugging Face. The company also plans to open source more compressed models in 2026 to support a wider range of use cases.\nAccording to Multiverse, its models are smaller, but nearly as potent and accurate. At 32GB, HyperNova 60B is roughly half the size of the model it derives from — OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b — while boasting lower memory usage and lower latency. The updated version, called HyperNova 60B 2602, now also better supports ​​tool calling and agentic coding, where inference costs can be high.\nOne of the competitors Multiverse claims to have beaten with HyperNova 60B is Mistral Large 3, one of the models released by French decacorn Mistral AI. But beyond the technological rivalry, the two European AI companies also have a lot in common.\nLike Mistral, Multiverse has expanded beyond its home country, with offices in the United States, Canada, and across Europe. Both companies also have enterprise customers. In Multiverse’s case, it names Iberdrola, Bosch, and the Bank of Canada. \nAnd while Multiverse is not officially a unicorn yet, it is now rumored to be raising a fresh €500 million funding round at a valuation of more than €1.5 billion. In a statement shared with TechCrunch, the company confirmed that active discussions with potential investors toward a new funding round are ongoing, but added it would be premature to comment on valuation or funding size at this stage. Multiverse also declined to comment on reports that its annual recurring revenue (ARR) reached €100 million in January.\nIf confirmed, this would still only be a fraction of OpenAI’s $20 billion ARR; but not that far from Mistral’s, whose ARR soared to over $400 million, owing in part to growing demand for alternatives to U.S. tech. Similarly, Multiverse positions itself in its latest press release as a company that can “deliver sovereign solutions across the AI stack.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese geopolitical undertones recently helped Multiverse secure a collaboration with the regional government of Aragón, in northeastern Spain. The Spanish Agency for Technological Transformation (SETT) also participated in the AI startup’s $215 million Series B last year.

    "body": "\nWayve’s self-driving tech has attracted a diverse set of investors in the company’s latest $1.2 billion funding round, including three automakers, top venture and institutional firms, and returning backers Microsoft, Nvidia, and Uber. The total raise could reach $1.5 billion thanks to another $300 million from Uber contingent on deploying robotaxis, beginning in London.\nEveryone, it seems, wants a piece of the U.K. startup, which is now valued at $8.6 billion. The funding round illustrates the eagerness among Big Tech, legacy automakers, and the investor community to profit from the burgeoning automated driving industry. \nWayve provides what founder and CEO Alex Kendall calls the “contrarian” option in automated driving — contrarian both in its approach to tech and its business model, he told TechCrunch in an interview Tuesday.\n“I think the technology chessboard is set around where different companies have invested on the technology strategy, and now the commercial chessboard is being arranged,” Kendall said. “We took a very contrarian view on the technology side. We were the first to build end-to-end deep learning for autonomous driving, and we pioneered this approach. Now, when it comes to this phase of moving into commercialization, we’re also taking a contrarian business model approach.”\nWayve, which launched in 2017, uses a self-learning approach to its software. The company developed a software layer using an end-to-end neural network that doesn’t require high-definition maps and only uses data to teach the vehicle how to drive. \nThis data-driven learning approach underpins two products: an “eyes on” assisted-driving system and an “eyes off” fully automated-driving system that could be applied to robotaxis or consumer vehicles that can handle all of the driving in certain environments. \nThe company’s pitch to customers is the agnostic nature of its technology, which is not reliant on specific sensors or maps. The automated-driving software captures data from whatever sensors are on the vehicle and directs the system’s driving decisions. Wayve’s software can also run on whatever chip its OEM partners already have in their vehicles.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 9, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt should be noted, however, that Nvidia, which is also a backer, has had a close development relationship with Wayve since 2018. The startup’s Gen 3 platform, which was unveiled last fall, uses an in-vehicle compute autonomous vehicle development kit called Nvidia Drive AGX Thor. The Gen 3 platform will allow Wayve to offer eyes-off advanced driving-assistance systems and Level 4 — or fully driverless — features that will work on city streets and highways.\nThe company’s tech is somewhat similar to how Tesla has approached automated driving, although there are key differences in their business models. \nWayve doesn’t want to be the operator of its hands-free driving-assistance system or its “eyes-off” fully automated-driving system. (For comparison, Waymo is largely the operator of its robotaxis, although it does have partners.) Nor does Wayve want to build vehicles bundled with its own software, as Tesla does. Instead, it is selling its “embodied AI” to automakers and other tech companies like Uber. \nKendall argues that this is the business model with the largest addressable market, but he says it’s only viable because Wayve built an AI that generalizes across different hardware and environments.\n“If you build an autonomy stack that’s specific to a sensor or compute architecture, [or] if you build it where it requires mapping or something like this, then you can’t take option three,” Kendall said, referring to the business model his company has chosen.\nNissan and Uber are both Wayve customers. Nissan said the startup’s self-driving software will be used to beef up the advanced driver-assistance system in its cars starting in 2027. Meanwhile, later this year, Uber plans to launch commercial trials in vehicles equipped with Wayve’s software.\nIts relationship with Uber appears poised to stretch well beyond a pilot program, though. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s statement Tuesday hints at the scope of its partnership with and investment in Wayve. \n“We are very proud to continue to deepen our partnership with Wayve, with plans to deploy together in more than 10 markets around the world. Wayve’s powerful end-to-end approach is purpose-built for scale, safety, and effectiveness, and we’re excited to work with them across multiple OEMs and geographies, which we’ll share more about soon.”\nThe round was led by Eclipse, Balderton, and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. New investors include the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, Baillie Gifford, British Business Bank, Icehouse Ventures, Schroders Capital, and other global institutional investors, the company said. \nGlobal automakers Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis — all of which plan to use Wayve’s technology — also participated. Nvidia, which participated in Wayve’s $1.05 billion Series C round, said last year it was evaluating a $500 million strategic investment in Wayve’s next raise. While Nvidia did participate, Kendall wouldn’t disclose the exact amount of its investment or whether it came close to that $500 million figure.\nUpdated to include more information on the $300 million in additional funding from Uber. \n",

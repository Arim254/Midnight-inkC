It also comes at a time when Toyota, and the rest of the automotive industry, is trying to navigate the effects of tariffs and the end of federal tax credits for EVs.\nThe capital will be spread among five of Toyota’s factories in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Missouri, and will largely focus on adding new production lines for components used in hybrid vehicles.\nAbout $125 million will be spent to enable the production of a hybrid-electric Toyota Corolla, the first of this model to be assembled in the United States. The largest chunk, about $453 million, will go toward expanding production of 4-cylinder hybrid-compatible engines, sixth-generation hybrid transaxles, and rear motor components (called stators) at Toyota’s Buffalo, West Virginia, plant.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n",

The firm also has a $15 billion fund to invest in AI anchored by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Capital. TWG previously invested in a partnership with Elon Musk’s xAI and Palantir to sell AI agents to enterprises.  \nNow it’s backing Lambda, which operates a number of U.S. AI data centers. Lambda is a CoreWeave competitor, although it also sells its so-called “AI factories” to hyperscaler clouds. Earlier this month, Lambda announced a multi-billion dollar deal to supply Microsoft with AI infrastructure using tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs. (Nvidia is an investor in Lambda as well.) \nRemember that Microsoft had a similar deal with CoreWeave and had bought about $1 billion worth of services from CoreWeave in 2024, it’s largest customer last year by a mile. Then OpenAI swooped in and signed a $12 billion deal with CoreWeave in March. \nMeanwhile, deal watchers have been talking for months about Lambda looking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars at a valuation north of $4 billion. There was also talk of an IPO. Prior to this, Lambda raised a $480 million Series D in February, with an estimated valuation of $2.5 billion, according to Pitchbook.  \nLambda’s $1.5 billion raise far outstrips those earlier whispers of what it was seeking. Whether its valuation also soared, we can’t confirm and Lambda declined to comment on that.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n",

Boasberg pointed to apps like TikTok as evidence that Meta has competition.\n“The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly,” Boasberg wrote in his memorandum opinion. “While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

    "body": "\nAfter primarily focusing on private conversations since its founding, Snapchat is embracing public conversations with a new “Topic Chats” feature. The social network says the feature lets users chat about what’s happening in the world and across various communities, from Formula 1 to the reality TV show “Below Deck.”\nProfiles will remain private to anyone you’re not friends with, helping prevent unwanted friend requests or direct messages, Snapchat says. While a user’s display name will be visible next to their message, others won’t be able to tap through to their profile from a Topic Chat, the company told TechCrunch in an email. And unlike usernames, display names can’t be used to search for someone.\nSnapchat told TechCrunch that it will use LLM technology and other safety measures to moderate Topic Chats to keep them safe and appropriate. Additionally, messages must adhere to Snapchat’s Community Guidelines, and users can report inappropriate messages. The company says it will take action against users who violate its policies, including warning users and blocking accounts.\nUsers will be able to see which Topic Chats their friends have joined, which the company says will make it easier for people to find common interests with others.\nIn addition to messages, Topic Chats will also surface related Spotlight videos, which are the app’s TikTok-like short-form videos. \nUp until now, the only place for public conversations on Snapchat was in Spotlight comments. Snapchat says it was inspired to launch Topic Chats after seeing how its community interacts in public comments, as it wanted to give users a new way to have these conversations. \n“Snapchatters create billions of Snaps every day, sharing moments with friends and family, and as we’ve expanded services like Spotlight, we’ve also found that the Snapchat community loves commenting publicly about trending topics and events,” the company wrote in a blog post. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nUsers in Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S. will start seeing Topic Chats appear across Snapchat over the coming weeks in Chat shortcuts, in search, in the Stories page, and on Spotlight videos. If you see a big yellow button on a Story or Spotlight that says “Join the Chat,” you can click on it to enter a chatroom.\nSnapchat says messages sent in Topic Chats will be retained for up to five years.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday, Google released Gemini 3, its latest and most advanced foundation model, which is now immediately available through the Gemini app and AI search interface.\nComing just seven months after the Gemini 2.5 release, the new model is Google’s most capable LLM yet, and an immediate contender for the most capable AI tool on the market. The release also comes less than a week after OpenAI released GPT 5.1, and a mere two months after Anthropic released Sonnet 4.5 — a reminder of the blistering pace of frontier model development.\nA more research-intensive version of the model, called Gemini 3 Deepthink, will also be made available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks, once it passes further rounds of safety testing.\n“With Gemini 3, we’re seeing this massive jump in reasoning,” said Tulsee Doshi, Google’s head of product for the Gemini model. “It’s responding with a level of depth and nuance that we haven’t seen before.”\nSome of that reasoning power is already registering on independent benchmarks. With a score of 37.4, the model marked the highest score on record on the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark, meant to capture general reasoning and expertise. The previous high score, held by GPT-5 Pro, was 31.64. Gemini 3 also topped the leaderboard on LMArena, a human-led benchmark that measures user satisfaction.\nAccording to Google, the Gemini app currently has more than 650 million monthly active users, and 13 million software developers have used the model as part of their workflow.\nAlongside the base model, Google also released a Gemini-powered coding interface called Google Antigravity, allowing for multi-pane agentic coding similar to agentic IDEs like Warp or Cursor 2.0. Specifically, Antigravity combines a ChatGPT-style prompt window with a command-line interface and a browser window that can show the impact of the changes made by the coding agent.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The agent can work with your editor, across your terminal, across your browser to make sure that it helps you build that application in the best way possible,” said DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nAs part of Microsoft’s Ignite conference, Stack Overflow on Tuesday revealed a new set of products that aims to position it as a valuable part of the enterprise AI stack. This new version of the company, built around the Stack Internal enterprise product, looks to remake its classic problem-solving forum into a tool for translating human expertise into an AI-accessible format.\nAt its simplest, Stack Internal is an enterprise version of the web forum, but with the additional security and admin controls you’d expect. The new tools are specifically designed to feed into internal AI agents using the model context protocol, with certain variations designed specifically for Stack Overflow.\nAs CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar tells it, Stack Overflow was already seeing a number of enterprise customers use its API for training, which inspired the new product direction. The company also has content deals with a number of AI labs, allowing them to train models on public Stack Overflow data in exchange for a blanket fee. \nWhile Chandrasekar wouldn’t name specific clients or figures, he described the arrangements as “very similar to the Reddit deals,” which have brought in more than $200 million for that platform.\nA critical part of the new products is a layer of metadata that Stack Internal exports alongside the question and answer pairs. That data includes basic information like who answered the question and when, as well as content tags and more complex assessments of internal coherence. These factors are then used to create a general reliability score, which informs the AI agent how much each answer can be trusted.\n“The customer can set up their own tagging system or we can dynamically create that for them,” said CTO Jody Bailey. “What we’ll be doing in the future is really leveraging that knowledge graph to connect concepts and pieces of information, rather than requiring the AI systems to do that on their own.”\nWhile Stack Internal is producing tools for enterprise agents, it isn’t building those agents itself, so it’s difficult to say what the final product will be able to do. But Bailey is particularly excited about the writing function, which would allow agents to create their own Stack Overflow queries if they can’t answer a question or notice a knowledge gap.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs Bailey sees it, that read-write functionality means that, “as we continue to evolve, it will require less and less effort from developers to capture the unique information about the way they operate their business.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

We cannot link his post directly, since X is down.\nSignal president Meredith Whittaker took the outage as an opportunity to explain the detriment of so much of the internet being run on just a few infrastructure services, like Cloudflare and AWS.\n“The question isn’t ‘why does Signal use AWS?’” she wrote on Bluesky. “It’s to look at the infrastructural requirements of any global, real-time, mass comms platform and ask how it is that we got to a place where there’s no realistic alternative to AWS and the other hyperscalers.”\nCloudflare wrote on its status page that the issue had been identified, and a fix was being implemented.

    "body": "\nPoe, Quora’s app that brings together different AI models into one platform, is launching group chat functionality. The company announced on Monday that users worldwide will be able to start group chats with up to 200 other people, then collaborate across more than 200 AI models — including text, image, video, and audio generators — within a single conversation.\nThe launch comes just days after OpenAI’s ChatGPT began piloting group chats in markets like Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. The move could potentially transform the chatbot from a one-on-one AI interaction into a collaborative space where users can also engage with friends, family, or colleagues.\nQuora says the addition of group chats to Poe could enable new types of interactive experiences for AI users. For instance, the company suggests that families or friends could use the feature to plan a trip together using Gemini 2.5’s search functionality and o3 Deep Research. Teams could also work together to brainstorm images for mood boards using the various image models on Poe, or groups could play trivia games together using one of the quiz bots on the app.\n\n\n\nThe group chats will allow users to work together using any combination of AI models or creator-made bots, including models like Claude 4.5 Sonnet, ElevenLabs v3, ElevenLabs Music, Nano Banana, GPT-5.1, Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro, o3 Deep Research, Sora 2 Pro, and Veo 3.1, among others.\nPoe users can start a group chat from the app’s home screen on the website at poe.com. As you chat, the chat history will sync in real time across your devices, so you could start chatting on desktop and then move to a mobile device without losing the thread.\nImage Credits:Quora\nQuora developed the feature over the past six months and plans to continue to improve group chats in the weeks following its launch, based on user feedback.\n“We think the space of potential group interactions mediated by AI and collaboration opportunities with AI is vast and currently under-explored,” the company shared in its announcement. “The product we are opening up today also allows anyone to create a custom bot on Poe and share it for others to use in their own groups, and we are excited to see the use cases that everyone discovers.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nFocus Friend, the screen time assistant from YouTuber and entrepreneur Hank Green, is Google Play’s app of the year.\nLaunched in August, the productivity tool lets you block yourself from distracting phone apps while encouraging you with the aid of a virtual friend — a little cartoon bean that likes to knit socks and scarves, which can later be exchanged for décor for the little bean’s room.\nThe premise behind the app is that users might be encouraged to manage their screen time better if they know their actions would impact others, even if it’s just a little bean that would be sad if you interrupted their knitting project.\nThe app was a hit at launch, reaching No. 1 on Apple’s App Store after rapidly climbing the charts. On Android, Focus Friend has north of 1 million installs, according to its Play Store listing.\nGoogle calls Focus Friend a helpful and cute app and an effective tool for helping users disconnect.\nIn a year that again saw AI assistants and tools climb the app store charts over and over again, it’s interesting to see a timer that helps you disconnect from your tech winning Google’s highest app award. On Google Play, for instance, the top apps currently include both of OpenAI’s consumer-facing tools: ChatGPT (at No. 1), and video app Sora. Other top apps focus on social media, entertainment, or shopping, like TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, Temu, and GoWish.\nClearly, consumers are rewarding apps that engage and addict, not those that encourage you to log off. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle also announced several other app winners across categories like games, watches, XR headsets, and more.

    "body": "\nOn Tuesday morning, a big chunk of the internet went down or was not working properly, including ChatGPT, Claude, Spotify, X, and more due to an outage at internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare. \nCloudflare said in its status page at around 8 a.m. ET it had identified the issues and was implementing a fix. Less than two hours later, Cloudflare said “a fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal.”\nAround the same time, Cloudflare’s chief technology officer Dane Knecht explained that a latent bug was responsible in an apologetic X post. \n“In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. This was not an attack,” Knecht wrote, referring to a bug that went undetected in testing and has not caused a failure. \nKnecht also said Cloudflare failed its customers and “the broader internet” with the outage, and promised that the company is already working to make sure “it does not happen again.” \n“I know it caused real pain today,” Knecht added, promising a more in-depth breakdown of what happened “in a few hours.”\nThe company has since noted on its status page that some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard. Cloudflare said it’s working on a fix to resolve this, and continuing to monitor for any further issues.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCloudflare’s massive outage came less than a month after a similar outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), and is another stark reminder that the entire web depends on just a handful of companies. If these giants experience an issue, the whole of the internet start to crumble. \nAccording to an estimate, Cloudflare is used by 20% of all websites on the internet. The company says it has data centers in 330 cities, and 13,000 networks “directly connect to Cloudflare, including every major ISP, cloud provider, and enterprise.” One of the main services Cloudflare offers customers is protection from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are designed to knock websites offline, which makes Tuesday’s outages somewhat ironic.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nZoox is starting to open its robotaxis to the public in San Francisco as the Amazon-owned company creeps toward a commercial service and direct competition with Waymo.\nZoox robotaxis — custom-built vehicles that lack a steering wheel or pedals — have been rolling around San Francisco streets for nearly a year. But until now, only Zoox employees and their friends and family have been able to hail a ride.\nThis is not a large-scale public launch, nor a commercial one. Instead, the company will invite some of the people who signed up for the waitlist to join its early rider initiative known as Zoox Explorer. Under that program, those select few will get access to the service and, for now, it’s free.\nRiders will slowly be moved off the waitlist as Zoox adds more robotaxis to its fleet and its service area grows. Zoox said its goal is to remove the waitlist altogether in 2026. The company wouldn’t disclose the number of riders that will be given public access or how many are on the waitlist. Today, it has about 50 robotaxis in Las Vegas and San Francisco.\nOnce given access, riders will be able to use the Zoox app to hail a ride within its service area, which covers the SoMa, Mission, and Design District neighborhoods of San Francisco.\nImage Credits:Zoox\nWhile Zoox’s service area is tiny compared to the 260 square miles that Waymo’s robotaxis operate in, the public launch does get it closer to directly competing with the Alphabet-owned company.  \nZoox, which was acquired by Amazon in 2020, has been working toward a commercial robotaxi service for more than a decade. Its test vehicles, Toyota Highlanders outfitted with sensors and self-driving software, were a common sight in the San Francisco Bay Area for years. But it’s the Foster City, California-based company’s purpose-built robotaxis that have captured the public’s attention.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Zoox has been testing our autonomous technology in San Francisco since 2017,” CEO Aicha Evans said in a statement. “It’s our home. A city of innovation and progress, with an amazing mobility ecosystem that we feel Zoox can really complement. We have seen incredible interest in Zoox in this market and are excited about this first step to bring our purpose-built robotaxi experience to more people.”\nTwo hurdles stand between Zoox and a commercial robotaxi service. The company must receive a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates ride-hailing, to be able to charge for rides in the state.\nZoox also has to convince the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to let it use the custom-built robotaxis for a commercial service.\nThe company has made some progress at the federal level. In August, NHTSA gave Zoox an exemption to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads. The decision cleared up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox’s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, which place requirements on vehicles such as having a steering wheel and pedals. \nThe exemption has allowed Zoox to give free rides in its robotaxis. It won’t be able to charge for rides until NHTSA expands that exemption to cover commercial operations.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nWaymo is taking the safety operators out of its fleet of robotaxis in Miami starting today, ahead of a commercial launch in 2026, the latest in a long series of steps taken this year to expand its nationwide footprint.\nThe company said in a blog post Tuesday it will start offering fully autonomous trips to employees in Miami. Over the next few weeks, Waymo said it will do the same in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando.\nThis latest move comes just one week after Waymo announced a major milestone: It is now offering paid rides on highways in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix. This year has also seen Waymo launch in Atlanta and Austin with big-name partners like Uber, and launch a corporate travel program.\nWaymo’s not the only company trying to scale a robotaxi service in the United States. Amazon-owned Zoox announced earlier Tuesday morning it is about to start offering free rides in its purpose-built robotaxis to members of its early rider program in San Francisco. (It did the same in Las Vegas in September.)\nTesla, meanwhile, has been trialing a service of its own in Austin for a few months. At one point this year, CEO Elon Musk tried to claim Tesla’s robotaxi service would be available to half the country by the end of 2025. As of right now, his company’s cars still have safety operators in the driver’s seats.\nAmid all that potential competition, Waymo is acting pretty confident.\n“We haven’t just built the technology; we’ve developed the definitive playbook for operating autonomous fleets, across dozens of sites, and industry-leading end-to-end rider support,” the company wrote in Tuesday’s blog post. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt will need that confidence as it heads into 2026, which is shaping up to be an even bigger year than 2025. In addition to the five aforementioned cities, Waymo plans to start offering rides in Detroit, Las Vegas, San Diego, Nashville, and London. The company is also testing in New York City, and has a permit to keep that up until at least the end of the year.\n“By the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week,” co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said at TechCrunch Disrupt last month.\nWaymo’s expansion hasn’t been flawless, though. The company’s tech is currently being probed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after one of its vehicles in Atlanta was filmed turning in front of a stopped school bus.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nZap Energy took the wraps off its latest fusion device Tuesday at a research meeting in Long Beach, California, the latest in a string of devices the company has built in its quest to bring fusion power to market.\nThe startup is in a race with several other startups that are all attempting to build fusion power plants capable of putting electricity on the grid in the early 2030s.\nZap’s Fuze-3 device has been firing pulses of plasma at the company’s headquarters near Seattle, and the results of those experiments will ultimately inform the design of the company’s future demonstration plants.\nThe Fuze-3 device was able to compress a soup of charged particles — also known as plasma — to more than 232,000 psi (1.6 gigapascals) and heat it to more than 21 million degrees F (11.7 million degrees C).\nA slow-motion look at burning plasma inside Fuze-3Image Credits:Zap Energy\nThe pressure data marks a record for the type of fusion Zap is pursuing, known as a sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch. Zap’s reactor uses electrodes to send electricity through a plasma, which causes the plasma to generate a magnetic field. If the magnetic field is strong enough, it’ll heat and compress the plasma to the point where particles in the plasma fuse.\nThe figures are useful for Zap as it pursues its goal of commercial fusion power — although it’s worth noting they’re not directly comparable with other fusion startups’ results because other companies are using different approaches. \nAchieving high-pressure plasmas is vital to any future fusion power plant. In order to generate more power than they consume, fusion reactions must deliver what’s known as the triple product, a figure that describes the temperature, pressure, and duration of a plasma inside a fusion reactor. In other words, get a plasma hot enough and dense enough for long enough, and you’ll be able to generate power.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy Zap’s own calculations, the company still has to increase the pressure of its plasma by at least tenfold before it hits scientific breakeven, a milestone reached by only one other fusion experiment. The company said it is getting close to a key third milestone proposed by Bob Mumgaard, co-founder and CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a Zap competitor.\nZap was able to break the record for plasma pressure by tweaking its reactor design to add a third electrode. In previous designs, two electrodes were able to heat the plasma sufficiently, but the company couldn’t hit the pressure numbers it wanted.\nThe company wouldn’t disclose details of the new design in response to TechCrunch’s questions. But spokesperson Andy Freeborn said it allows the company to use two power banks, giving it more control over how the plasma changes inside the reactor.\n“The plasma chamber itself doesn’t look much different, but it’s operated very differently since there are two pulses of input power rather than one,” he said.\nZap said it is working on a new generation of Fuze device, which it says will come online this winter.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIn 2023, Tayla Cannon moved from Australia to the U.S. for a job in a city she’d never seen before.  \n“No family, no friends, just a fresh start,” she told TechCrunch. A sufferer of chronic back pain, she first started working in physiotherapy, thinking it was helping make a difference in the lives of others. Yet the traditional physiotherapy model never quite lit a spark in her.  \nShe moved to interventional cardiology but only became more disillusioned with the physical rehab model with “its localized, reactive, and volume-based nature,” she said.  \nMeanwhile, in her spare time, she became a content creator, sharing her perspective online about “proactive” and “holistic” ways people can get rid of pain.  \nThat took on a life of its own. \nShe now has more than 130,000 followers on Instagram, a company called Athletic Rebuild, which provides rehab and performance coaching for athletes, and now, a platform called Rebuildr, a HIPAA-compliant and mentorship app to help rehab professionals run their own businesses online, set to launch early next year.  \n“I wasn’t trying to build a business; I was just putting my brain on the internet and helping people rethink what care could look like.”  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCannon and her works caught the eye of Slow Ventures, which announced on Tuesday that it invested $1.1 million as a seed round. She is one of the first creators to receive a check from Slow Ventures’ $60 million Creator Fund, which seeks to back content creators and influencers making an impact online.  \nCannon said she had no plan when she started sharing her thoughts on social media in 2024 and then decided to make this her profession. “There was no strategy, no roadmap, and certainty no business model behind it,” she said. She credits what most content creators do for her success — remaining authentic and sharing unfiltered but genuine thoughts.  \nExpanding a brand on social media is not without challenges, however. Her social media presence, and therefore brand, was growing fast, which was good but also a problem. She was instantly faced with the need to understand business logic, consumer acumen, and content strategy to connect with new audiences. “None of which are taught in healthcare,” she continued. “We’re trained to help people, not to build brands.” \nThe turning point came when she actually realized she was the bottleneck to her own business. “I couldn’t keep scaling something that depended solely on me. I had to build something that could grow without me,” she said, adding that she ended up hiring people to help her with her projects.  \nShe also grew her strategy when she moved from just talking about what’s broken in the world of rehab and started working on solutions to help fix it. Rebuildr is intended to be a “complete shift from localized reactive care to a proactive, holistic mode,” Cannon said, “combining consumer solutions, clinicians, education, and the software to deliver it all at scale.”  \nShe was introduced to the team at Slow Ventures through a friend who invited her to one of the firm’s events in Austin. “I had zero intention of raising capital,” she said. “I wasn’t even pitching. I wasn’t even preparing a deck.” Still, she connected with Megan Lightcap, an investor at Slow, and told her about what she was building with Rebuildr.  \n“The conversation sparked something,” Cannon said, adding that Slow has helped her “imagine a version of Rebuilder that’s even bigger” than what she envisioned.  \nOther personal trainer software out there includes TrainHeroic, Trainerize, and Everfit. Rudder hopes that her product, Rebuildr, fundamentally reshapes the rehab industry.  \n“I want to make high-quality rehab accessible anywhere in the world, not limited by geography, insurance, or 30-minute appointments,” she said.  \n",

    "body": "\nMonarch Tractor has been accused of overpromising on the autonomous capabilities of its tractors, according to a new lawsuit.\nBurks Tractor, a dealership located in Idaho, has sued Monarch for breach of contract and allegedly violating its warranty because the California-based startup’s tractors were “unable to operate autonomously.” The dealership also says the 10 tractors it purchased “continue to experience significant problems,” and calls them “defective.” \nMonarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa and a lawyer for the company did not respond to a request for comment. Monarch has denied the allegations in a court filing.\nThe previously unreported lawsuit, which was filed in September in Idaho state court and has since moved to federal court, is the latest trouble for Monarch.\nThe company has spent a few years trying to get its tractors — which are electric and supposed to be autonomous, or as Monarch calls it, “driver optional” — to catch on at wineries and dairy farms. But it’s gone through multiple rounds of layoffs over the last two years. The Ohio factory where its tractors were being built by Foxconn is now being renovated into an AI data center, and Monarch has been trying to pivot to software and tech licensing.\nBurks Tractor says in its complaint that it purchased the 10 tractors from Monarch in early 2024 with the intent of being one of the California startup’s first dealers. During those negotiations, Burks Tractor claims Monarch “expressly represented” the tractors would be fully autonomous, and the autonomy features “were not limited by location or time.”\nMonarch even provided demo videos to Burks Tractor that showed the equipment performing autonomous tasks, according to the complaint. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBurks Tractor paid Monarch $773,088 for the tractors and financed the purchase, according to the lawsuit, meaning it is still paying interest. The dealer also purchased spare parts. Monarch delivered the first five tractors in April 2024 and the remaining five in June 2025.\nThe lawsuit claims that problems began right away.\n“Upon receiving the tractors, Burks Tractor discovered that the tractors did not perform as represented and were unable to operate autonomosly,” according to the complaint. The dealer flagged this to Monarch, and the startup’s sales team “worked with Burks Tractor to try to make the autonomous tractors work autonomously,” but failed. \nBurks Tractor claims Monarch’s sales team then admitted “both verbally and in writing” the tractors’ autonomy “was limited and the tractors were unable to function autonomously indoors.” The dealer then claims it went “months without any support or follow-up to make the autonomous tractors work as promised,” despite “numerous attempts” to have Monarch “repair or replace the defective tractors.”\n“[T]he tractors continue to experience significant problems and do not operate autonomously,” the dealer claims in the lawsuit. Burks Tractor “demanded Monarch take back the defective tractors, but Monarch has refused to do so.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

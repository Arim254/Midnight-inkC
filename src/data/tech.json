We’re going to try to fix this. Social media doesn’t have to be this way.”  Another user then asked, “have y’all banned Jesse Singal yet or” to which Graber <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m25esnq4t22y\">simply replied</a>, “WAFFLES!”</p>\n<p>Singal’s presence on Bluesky was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/\">a flashpoint last year</a> — while Bluesky built an early reputation as a haven for trans users, Singal has been widely criticized for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://glaad.org/gap/jesse-singal/\">his writing on trans issues</a>. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://change.org/\">Change.org</a> petition arguing that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.change.org/p/bluesky-must-enforce-its-community-guidelines-equally\">Singal violated the social network’s community guidelines</a> and calling on Bluesky to ban him received more than 28,000 signatures, and he was the most-blocked user on Bluesky until <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://clearsky.app/\">Vice President JD Vance surpassed him</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"A screenshot of an exchange on Bluesky, concluding with CEO Jay Graber writing, \"WAFFLES!\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png 1196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=768,658 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=680,582 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=430,368 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=720,616 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=900,771 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=800,685 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=668,572 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=438,375 438w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=721,617 721w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=620,531 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-3.36.51PM.png?resize=50,43 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bluesky</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2c7ge42us2t\">a follow-up post</a>, Graber wrote, “Harassing the mods into banning someone has never worked. And harassing people in general has never changed their mind.” She also alluded to the controversy by posting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2a73ot5uk2e\">a nudge-nudge wink-wink photo of waffles</a>, as did <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jessesingal.com/post/3m2c6nmdr5s2h\">Singal</a>.</p>\n<p>Users continued to criticize her, with Graber firing back — when one compared the criticism to a customer threatening to cancel their service, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2c7peyfac2t\">she asked</a>, “Are you paying us? Where?” When another suggested that she should apologize, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2cdjn5f3k2t\">Graber said</a>, “You could try a poster’s strike. I hear that works.”</p>\n<p>It might be tempting to dismiss this whole thing as another example of leftist infighting, especially since the Bluesky Discourse has already moved on to the question of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/katelynburns.com/post/3m2h2hpqdss2s\">whether “clanker” is a slur</a>.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Or maybe, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thelouvreof.bsky.social/post/3m2fuwkm3s223\">one satirical account suggested</a>, there’s just been “a week-long gas leak at Bluesky HQ.”</p>\n<p>But the controversy also underlines ongoing tensions between the company and some of its most vocal users. It’s a tension that could be seen last month in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/bluesky-says-its-getting-more-aggressive-about-moderation-and-enforcement/\">skeptical responses to the company’s updated community guidelines</a>, and in recurring complaints that Bluesky has been too quick to ban Palestinian and trans users, while offering leniency to big accounts like Singal’s.</p>\n<p>It may be simplistic to reduce this tension to a single cause, but I suspect much of it comes from differing visions about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/\">what makes Bluesky special</a>: If you think it’s Bluesky’s community, especially that early community of marginalized users, then it can feel like a betrayal when Bluesky executives <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bix.blog/posts/2025-10-03-on-waffles-and-class-allegiance/\">seem unwilling to stand up for those users</a>.</p>\n<p>One user who posts under the name Katie Tightpussy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/katie.bzky.team/post/3m2dyass2kc2x\">speculated</a> that Bluesky leadership has come to loathe “having a large social media app that they never wanted” and suggested that they spin it off so they can return “to Protocol Land where they never have to think about the opinions of plebeians ever again.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, when Graber isn’t responding to criticism with posts about waffles, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-jay-graber-bluesky/\">she’s resisted identifying Bluesky with any specific group or political leaning</a>, instead emphasizing the decentralized protocol that allows users to build their own alternatives.</p>\n<p>Amidst the current controversy, she posted about “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2cuifnzds24\">decentralization acceleration</a>” and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2c7jc3k522t\">wrote</a>, “We’re system architects at core. We built a decentralized network so you could run your own moderation,” then suggested that the company’s “upcoming healthy discourse project is taking some swings at the interaction model that drives these dynamics on Bluesky.”</p>\n<p>Graber may even have foreseen some version of this conflict when Bluesky was starting out with vision of a decentralized system that allows users to migrate elsewhere if they’re unhappy with company leadership. As she <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/04/14/blueskys-quest-to-build-nontoxic-social-media\">reportedly wrote in Bluesky’s founding documents</a>, “The company is a future adversary.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Dr. Tom Kelly is a trauma surgeon, and everywhere, he sees doctors drowning in administrative work. He wanted change, so he set out to build it. </p>\n<p>“We wanted to build an AI care partner that would stand alongside clinicians and take care of the admin so that individual providers, like me, can feel empowered to deliver the care which we dedicated our lives to,” he told TechCrunch. </p>\n<p>Dr. Kelly teamed up with Waleed Mussa, with whom he had worked at a previous startup, and founded Heidi Health in 2021. The company began launching products in early 2024. </p>\n<p>In just 18 months, he said, the company has returned more than “18 million hours to frontline healthcare providers from more than 70 million patient visits in 116 countries.” </p>\n<p>The product, as promised, is an AI medical scribe that takes care of all the admin work that hassles doctors. It can transcribe and dictate notes, generate personalized patient summaries, and even track tasks so doctors no longer have a need for sticky notes. </p>\n<p>Heidi both built its own AI model and builds on top of other models, such as Gemini. “This model agnostic approach means that we can optimize our accuracy, latency, and cost,” he said. </p>\n<p>On Monday, the company announced a $65 million Series B led by Steve Cohen’s Point72. It also announced a new tool: an AI agent that calls patients on behalf of the doctor. The former Chief Medical Officer at Microsoft, Dr. Simon Kos, is also coming on board, along with Plaid’s head of revenue, Paul Williamson. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The company has raised $96.6 million to date. Others in the round include Goodwater Capital, Headline, Blackbird VC, LG Technology Ventures, and Alumni Ventures. </p>\n<p>“They had seen all the scribes before,” Dr. Kelly said of Point72. “They’d never seen product adoption and usage metrics like they’d seen in Heidi. They also loved that we were obsessed about the end user experience, because they saw most of our competitors were just doing top-down sales.” </p>\n<p>The fresh capital will be used to help with product development. </p>\n<p>Dr. Kelly hopes that giving doctors more access to AI tools will expand the capabilities of clinicians and remove the “drudgery” of their work. </p>\n<p>He said most of the conversations in the medical world right now are shaped by what is happening in developed countries, “but imagine a world where any healthcare provider in the world can use Heidi to increase their clinical capacity, where they can practice in a war zone, or a refugee camp, or a region hit by climate change or simply an underserved community,” he continued. “Heidi can help them reach more patients and deliver better health care results.”  </p>\n<p>AI is transforming the health tech. Others in the medical scribe space, in particular, include DeepScribe, Ambiance Healthcare, and Abridge. </p>\n<p>Heidi said it works with more than 2 million clinicians a week, ranging from hospitals to individual practices. It has a free version of the product with paid features, which Dr. Kelly believes has been a good lure for new customers. </p>\n<p>He said AI is understandably going to change everything in healthcare. But at its core, humanity is still very essential, especially when it comes to maintaining and building trust. </p>\n<p>“It’s about doubling the world’s health care capacity. That’s the true promise of AI,” he said. “We want to bring it about.” </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>An app called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/young-minds-app/\">Young Minds</a> wants to give parents control over what their kids do on the internet, while also protecting their children’s privacy and teaching them good online habits. </p>\n<p>The startup was founded by Nino Dvalidze (pictured), an entrepreneur and a mother of two from the United Kingdom. Dvalidze told TechCrunch that the idea for Young Minds came from conversations with fellow parents, who are also worried about how to keep their children safe, while also allowing them to have access to the internet, which, she admitted, is “enormously helpful in terms of education and exploration and connection with so many people outside of your immediate zone of contacts.”  </p>\n<p>Dvalidze explained that Young Minds, which will be presenting at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/\">Startup Battlefield</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</a>, has two versions: the parent app and the children app. The former gives certain control to the latter, allowing parents to set up screen time limits, to curtail certain content, but not the ability to monitor all communications on their kids’ devices. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=postinclusion_sb200startup&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc\">Disrupt runs October 27 to 29 in San Francisco</a>.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing safety as a minimum foundation,” Dvalidze said in a phone call. “We need to make sure that nothing that is not intended for the young eyes can reach them.” </p>\n<p>But the app is also designed to teach kids why certain content is blocked or why something is flagged as risky. Dvalidze said the app scans the child’s use of their tablet or phone with AI to detect and flag potentially harmful content, but the company does not store any user data.

Sora’s most distinctive feature may be its “cameos,” where users can upload their biometric data to see their digital likeness featured in AI-generated videos.</p>\n<p>At the same time, users also seem to delight in flouting copyright laws by creating videos with popular, studio-owned characters. In some cases, those characters might even criticize the company’s approach to copyright, for example in videos where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">Pikachu and SpongeBob interact with deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/sora-update-number-1\">a blog post published Friday</a>, Altman said the company is already planning two changes to Sora, first by giving copyright holders “more granular control over generation of characters, similar to the opt-in model for likeness but with additional controls.”</p>\n<p>The key word here appears to be “opt-in,” suggesting that OpenAI will stop users from creating videos with copyrighted characters unless studios and others rightsholders have actually given Sora permission to do so.</p>\n<p>“We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction’ and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all),” Altman said.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Even with this new approach, Altman acknowledged there are likely to be “some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn’t.”</p>\n<p>The second change he mentioned is some unspecified form of video monetization. The company previously said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">its only plan for monetization</a> was to charge users to create extra videos during periods of high demand, and Altman’s blog post seems to elaborate on that idea by acknowledging “we are going to have to somehow make money for video generation.” He also suggesting the revenue could be shared with rightsholders.</p>\n<p>“Our hope is that the new kind of engagement is even more valuable than the revenue share, but of course we … want both to be valuable.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Earlier this year, Anker, the Chinese company that makes Eufy security cameras, offered its users money in exchange for videos of package and car thefts. </p>\n<p>The popular internet-connected security camera maker <a href=\"https://community.eufy.com/t/help-improve-eufy-ai-earn-cash/4662267\" target=\"_blank\">said it would pay its customers $2 per video to train its AI systems</a> to help better detect thieves who steal cars and packages.  </p>\n<p>“To ensure we have enough data, we are looking for videos of both real and staged events, to help train the Al what to be on the lookout for,” the company wrote on its website.  </p>\n<p>“You can even create events by pretending to be a thief and donate those events,” the website reads. “You can complete this quickly. Maybe one act can be captured by your two outdoor cameras simultaneously, making it efficient and easy. If you also stage a car door theft, you might earn $80.” </p>\n<p>Eufy also wrote that “the data collected from these staged events is used solely for training our Al algorithms and not for any other purposes.”  </p>\n<p>This initiative shows that companies are willing to pay to get users’ data they think can be useful to train their AI models. While this gives some users the ability to get value out of their own data, there are security and privacy risks involved.  </p>\n<p>Case in point: Last week, TechCrunch found that Neon, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/neon-the-no-2-social-app-on-the-apple-app-store-pays-users-to-record-their-phone-calls-and-sells-data-to-ai-firms/\" target=\"_blank\">a viral calling app</a> that offered money to users willing to share recordings and transcripts of their calls, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/viral-call-recording-app-neon-goes-dark-after-exposing-users-phone-numbers-call-recordings-and-transcripts/\" target=\"_blank\">had a security flaw that allowed users to access any other user’s data</a>. After being alerted of the security lapse, Neon went offline.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"h-hundreds-of-thousands-of-videos-donated-to-train-ai\">Hundreds of thousands of videos ‘donated’ to train AI</h2>\n<p>Eufy’s campaign offering $2 per video for theft videos ran from December 18, 2024, to February 25, 2025. More than 120 users responded on the campaign’s announcement page saying they participated in it, according to comments posted by users there.  </p>\n<p>The company’s goal was to collect 20,000 videos each of package thefts and of “pulling car doors.” Eufy users could participate by filling out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5MnlPD7oI9yf9eb56ttG_otnMdFg60VwVHtlmtRDk6hJzkQ/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">a Google Form</a> where they could upload videos and their PayPal account for payment.  </p>\n<p>Eufy did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment and our questions, such as how many users participated in the campaign, how much money it paid those users, how many videos the company collected, and whether the company deleted the collected videos after training its AI systems.  </p>\n<p>Since then, Eufy has similar campaigns aimed at incentivizing its customers to send in videos to train their AI. </p>\n<p>As of the time of publication, through another in-app campaign that Eufy calls the Video Donation Program to improve its AI systems, Eufy also offers users rewards that range from an “Apprentice Medal,” which appears to simply be a badge next to the user’s name in the app, to gifts such as cameras or gift cards. </p>\n<p>Eufy is only asking for videos involving humans for this campaign. </p>\n<p>The Eufy app also shows an “Honor Wall” that ranks users who have donated the most video events. The leader of the ranking has donated 201,531 videos, according to the app.  </p>\n<p>In the app’s page for the donation program, Eufy clarifies that “donated videos are only used for Al training and improvement. Eufy will not provide the video to third parties.” </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?w=337\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg 1179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=149,300 149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=768,1550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=337,680 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=595,1200 595w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=634,1280 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=213,430 213w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=357,720 357w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=446,900 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=396,800 396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=761,1536 761w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=1015,2048 1015w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=331,668 331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=186,375 186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=306,617 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=263,531 263w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/enahance-my-ai-eufy.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Eufy/Anker (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Eufy also <a href=\"https://service.anker.com/article-description/How-to-Donate-eufy-Baby-Monitor-2-Videos-in-the-eufy-Care-App\" target=\"_blank\">asks users to donate</a> videos recorded with the company’s baby monitors.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>AI coding tools are getting better fast. If you don’t work in code, it can be hard to notice how much things are changing, but GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 have made a whole new set of developer tricks possible to automate, and last week Sonnet 4.5 did it again.  </p>\n<p>At the same time, other skills are progressing more slowly. If you are using AI to write emails, you’re probably getting the same value out of it you did a year ago. Even when the model gets better, the product doesn’t always benefit — particularly when the product is a chatbot that’s doing a dozen different jobs at the same time. AI is still making progress, but it’s not as evenly distributed as it used to be. </p>\n<p>The difference in progress is simpler than it seems. Coding apps are benefitting from billions of easily measurable tests, which can train them to produce workable code. This is reinforcement learning (RL), arguably the biggest driver of AI progress over the past six months and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\" target=\"_blank\">getting more intricate all the time</a>. You can do reinforcement learning with human graders, but it works best if there’s a clear pass-fail metric, so you can repeat it billions of times without having to stop for human input.  </p>\n<p>As the industry relies increasingly on reinforcement learning to improve products, we’re seeing a real difference between capabilities that can be automatically graded and the ones that can’t. RL-friendly skills like bug-fixing and competitive math are getting better fast, while skills like writing make only incremental progress. </p>\n<p>In short, there’s a reinforcement gap — and it’s becoming one of the most important factors for what AI systems can and can’t do. </p>\n<p>In some ways, software development is the perfect subject for reinforcement learning. Even before AI, there was a whole sub-discipline devoted to testing how software would hold up under pressure — largely because developers needed to make sure their code wouldn’t break before they deployed it. So even the most elegant code still needs to pass through unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and so on. Human developers use these tests routinely to validate their code and, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/how-googles-dev-tools-manager-makes-ai-coding-work/\" target=\"_blank\">as Google’s senior director for dev tools recently told me</a>, they’re just as useful for validating AI-generated code. Even more than that, they’re useful for reinforcement learning, since they’re already systematized and repeatable at a massive scale. </p>\n<p>There’s no easy way to validate a well-written email or a good chatbot response; these skills are inherently subjective and harder to measure at scale. But not every task falls neatly into “easy to test” or “hard to test” categories. We don’t have an out-of-the-box testing kit for quarterly financial reports or actuarial science, but a well-capitalized accounting startup could probably build one from scratch. Some testing kits will work better than others, of course, and some companies will be smarter about how to approach the problem. But the testability of the underlying process is going to be the deciding factor in whether the underlying process can be made into a functional product instead of just an exciting demo.  </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Some processes turn out to be more testable than you might think. If you’d asked me last week, I would have put AI-generated video in the “hard to test” category, but the immense progress made by <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s new Sora 2 model</a> shows it may not be as hard as it looks. In Sora 2, objects no longer appear and disappear out of nowhere. Faces hold their shape, looking like a specific person rather than just a collection of features. Sora 2 footage respects the laws of physics in both <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nunil1/sora_2_vs_veo_3_on_physics_test_sora_2_is_first/\" target=\"_blank\">obvious</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/pallavmac/status/1973141663557226806\" target=\"_blank\">subtle</a> ways. I suspect that, if you peeked behind the curtain, you’d find a robust reinforcement learning system for each of these qualities. Put together, they make the difference between photorealism and an entertaining hallucination. </p>\n<p>To be clear, this isn’t a hard and fast rule of artificial intelligence. It’s a result of the central role reinforcement learning is playing in AI development, which could easily change as models develop. But as long as RL is the primary tool for bringing AI products to market, the reinforcement gap will only grow bigger — with serious implications for both startups and the economy at large. If a process ends up on the right side of the reinforcement gap, startups will probably succeed in automating it — and anyone doing that work now may end up looking for a new career. The question of which healthcare services are RL-trainable, for instance, has enormous implications for the shape of the economy over the next 20 years. And if surprises like Sora 2 are any indication, we may not have to wait long for an answer.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>The tie between startups and the U.S. government have strengthened in recent years, a shift buoyed by an interest in using AI, automation, space, robotics, and climate tech for defense. And while that has provided another welcome path to capital, the relationship is getting complicated.</p>\n<p>A growing share of startups have the U.S. government as customers, or are aiming for permits and defense-related contracts. When the government is operational, that connection can provide a needed boost and revenue to startups. But when the government ceases to function, as it did starting October 1, those close ties can stifle or even halt progress for startups.</p>\n<p>This week on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/\">Equity</a>, Anthony Ha, Max Zeff, and I (Kirsten Korosec) talk about how a prolonged U.S. government shutdown poses more risk for startups than in the past — not to mention put a damper on an active IPO season. The three of us dug into a few other topics too, including the how AI companies are trying to monetize and the U.S. government’s latest push to take ownership stakes in the tech and industrial sectors.</p>\n<p>“This also feels like a reflection of how the startup landscape has changed in say the last decade and especially over the last few years,” Ha said during the Equity podcast, adding the focus was on consumer internet startups for a long time. “Obviously there’s a lot more going on in defense tech, a lot more in deep tech where you maybe need various kinds of regulatory approvals,” he continued. “And so, it feels like much broader swaths of the startup landscape now depend on the government in various ways, in ways that wasn’t necessarily true 10 years ago.”</p>\n<p>But it’s not just startups. The Trump Administration has also continued to extend its reach, and ownership, into the tech industry, too. </p>\n<p>The Trump Administration has renegotiated yet another federal loan — it’s third in recent months followed by one with Intel and rare earth miner MP Materials — and taken an equity stake as part of the newly hashed out deal. </p>\n<p>The U.S. government took a 5% stake in Canadian miner Lithium Americas and another a 5% ownership in a Lithium Americas-GM joint venture to mine lithium in Nevada. The equity stakes will be acquired through no-cost warrants, which are financial instruments that give the government the right to purchase shares at a set price. The new terms came out of a renegotiation with the DOE’s Loan Programs Office <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/trump-administration-wants-10-stake-in-canadian-lithium-miner-that-sells-to-gm/\">of a $2.26 billion loan</a> that was awarded to Lithium Americas under the Biden Administration.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Watch the full episode to hear more about the government’s relationship with startups and tech companies as well as the entertainment industry’s reaction to AI-generated actress Tilly Norwood, and an eye-popping seed round for Periodic Labs.</p>\n<figure><p>\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/II-h_nlMCNU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n</p></figure>\n<p><em>Equity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>OpenAI has acquired Roi, an AI-powered personal finance app. In keeping with a recent trend in the AI industry, only the CEO is making the jump.  </p>\n<p>Chief executive and co-founder Sujith Vishwajith <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_suje/status/1974190926177460670?s=46\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the acquisition on Friday, and a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch he is the only one of Roi’s four-person staff to join OpenAI. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The company will wind down operations and end its service to customers on October 15. </p>\n<p>The Roi deal marks the latest in a string of acqui-hires from OpenAI this year, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/openai-hires-team-behind-gv-backed-ai-eval-platform-context-ai/\">Context.ai</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/openai-hires-team-behind-ai-recommendation-startup-crossing-minds/\">Crossing Minds</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/openai-hires-the-team-behind-xcode-coding-assistant-alex-codes/\">Alex</a>.</p>\n<p>While it’s not clear whether any of Roi’s technology will transfer over to OpenAI or which unit Vishwajith will join, the acquisition clearly aligns with OpenAI’s bet on personalization and life management as the next layer of AI products. Roi brings a specialized team that has already tried to solve personalization in finance at scale — a challenge whose lessons can be applied more broadly.   </p>\n<p>New York-based Roi was founded in 2022 and has raised $3.6 million in early-stage funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Spark Capital, Gradient Ventures, and Spacecadet Ventures, according to PitchBook data. Its mission was to aggregate a user’s financial footprint, including stocks, crypto, DeFi, real-estate, and NFTs, into one app that can track funds, provide insights, and help people make trades.  </p>\n<p>“We started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience,” Vishwajith wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_suje/status/1974190926177460670?s=46\" target=\"_blank\">post on X</a>. “Along the way we realized personalization isn’t just the future of finance. It’s the future of software.” </p>\n<p>Beyond tracking trades, Roi gave users access to a financially savvy AI companion that responded in ways that made sense for them. When signing up, users could personalize Roi by providing information like what they do for a living and how they wanted Roi to respond to them. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>In one telling example that <a href=\"https://x.com/investwithroi/status/1886506081087807532\" target=\"_blank\">Roi posted on X</a>, the sample user wrote: “Talk to me like I’m a Gen-Z kid with brain rot. Use as little words as possible and roast me as much as you want I don’t mind.” In response to a query about the status of the user’s portfolio, Roi replied: “Suje, you got cooked lil bro. Cause of the tariff announcements, you took an L today of $32,459.12…Based on your risk preference this might be an opportunity to buy the dip.” </p>\n<p>The exchange highlights the philosophy behind Roi and its co-founder — that software shouldn’t just provide generic answers but should adapt, learn, and communicate in ways that feel personal, human, and most importantly, keep you engaged.  </p>\n<p>As the Roi team wrote in a blog post: “The products we use every day won’t remain static, predetermined experiences. They’ll become adaptive, deeply personal companions that understand us, learn from us, and evolve with us.” </p>\n<p>That vision dovetails with OpenAI’s existing consumer efforts, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-launches-chatgpt-pulse-to-proactively-write-you-morning-briefs/\" target=\"_blank\">Pulse</a>, which generates personalized news and content reports for users as they sleep; the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\" target=\"_blank\">Sora</a> app, a TikTok competitor filled with AI-generated content, including personal cameos from users; and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/openai-takes-on-google-amazon-with-new-agentic-shopping-system/\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Checkout</a>, a feature that lets users shop and make purchases directly in ChatGPT.  </p>\n<p>The deal also comes as OpenAI beefs up its consumer applications team,  <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/instacart-ceo-fidji-simo-is-joining-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">led by former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo</a>. It’s a further signal that OpenAI isn’t just trying to be an API provider, but wants to build its own end-user apps. Roi’s talent and tech could slot right into these apps and help make them more adaptive.  </p>\n<p>Vishwajith, alongside his co-founder Chip Davis, used to work at Airbnb, where he developed a knack for optimizing user behavior to drive revenue. By his <a href=\"https://x.com/aka_suje/status/1628097851770417152\" target=\"_blank\">account</a>, a simple change of 25 lines of code led to $10+ million in additional cash.  </p>\n<p>Being able to bring in meaningful revenue via consumer apps is more important than ever to OpenAI as it continues to burn through <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/openai-is-building-five-new-stargate-data-centers-with-oracle-and-softbank/\" target=\"_blank\">billions on data centers and infrastructure</a> to power its models.  </p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

This has allegedly caused “financial harm” and “distress to policyholders.”</p>\n<p>CDI first approached Tesla about these issues in 2022, according to the filings, yet it claims things have only gotten worse. “In 2025, the Tesla Companies have already had more complaints, more justified complaints, and committed more violations than in the three previous years combined,” the regulator wrote. </p>\n<p>Tesla and State National could face penalties up to $5,000 for each “unlawful, unfair, or deceptive act” and up to $10,000 for each “willful” act, according to the filings. The companies have 15 days to respond. </p>\n<p>The enforcement action could have knock-on legal effects for Tesla. In July, the company was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit over allegations that the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/teslas-auto-insurance-arm-hit-with-consumer-class-action-california-2025-07-17/\" target=\"_blank\">company purposely delayed and minimized claim payouts</a>. CDI wrote Friday that Tesla’s actions may have created “potential third-party liability exposure.” Tesla and State National did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Tesla launched its in-house insurance product in 2019. The idea was to offer cheaper premiums and faster service. But it got off to a rocky start. The website repeatedly crashed, and when it didn’t, it offered quotes that were far <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20839607/tesla-car-insurance-broken-high-rate-quotes-california\" target=\"_blank\">higher than owners expected</a>. Still, Musk promised it would be a “revolutionary” product.</p>\n<p>Just three years later, according to CDI’s filings, the regulator noticed a “marked uptick in claims-related consumer complaints” against Tesla. So in December 2022, CDI started meeting with Tesla and State National. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The regulator said it learned Tesla’s “Head of Claims” position had been vacant for months. It also accused the companies of not reporting the claims-handling problems.</p>\n<p>As a result, CDI subjected Tesla and State National to a sort of probationary period: the regulator monitored the companies’ efforts to reduce these violations for six months. Tesla and State National “conceded” that they had underestimated the volume of claims and the staffing required to handle them, according to CDI, and promised to beef up hiring.</p>\n<p>It took Tesla until April 2023 to hire a new Head of Claims. Through the rest of that year, Tesla and State National “reported improvements in the quality” of their claims handling and the “resolution of consumer complaints.” </p>\n<p>Later that year, Reuters published <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\">an investigation into Tesla’s insurance arm</a> that showed things weren’t so rosy. </p>\n<p>CDI came to the same realization in 2024. The regulator noticed a “significant increase” in both consumer complaints against Tesla and “violations of the law,” according to the filings. CDI had received just 83 consumer complaints against Tesla in 2022, but in 2024, that number jumped to 829. In 775 of those cases, CDI found Tesla had violated the state’s insurance code.</p>\n<p>Things have only gotten worse, according to CDI. Through September 22 of this year, the regulator has received 1,481 complaints against Tesla, and identified 1,969 insurance code violations.</p>\n<p>In total, since 2022, CDI said Tesla has accumulated nearly 3,000 violations of state insurance law. The majority of those violations involve Tesla failing to respond to customers within the mandatory 15-day period. CDI said it identified 166 violations in which Tesla filed to conduct a “thorough, fair, and objective investigation” into a claim.</p>\n<p>“CDI repeatedly notified [Tesla] of its claims-mishandling issues and violations of law,” the regulator wrote. “While [Tesla] repeatedly committed to improvements, the number of justified complaints and violations continued to mount, demonstrating [Telsa’s] failure to correct its practices.”</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Sean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

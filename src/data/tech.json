On Thursday, it announced a $400 million Series F funding round at a $9 billion valuation. The New York-based outfit has now raised over $1.7 billion. This funding comes just six months after the previous $540 million round at a $6 billion valuation.\nThe new round was led by funds managed by Blackstone with participation from existing investors including Accel, Coatue, Lightspeed, Redpoint, Sapphire, Sequoia, and others.\nCyera offers what it calls data security posture management, a service that helps companies map out where all their sensitive data lives across cloud systems and databases, track how employees and applications use it, and identify security vulnerabilities. The rise of AI — which has increased both the volume of data that companies handle and concerns about data leaks — has helped Cyera sign up one-fifth of the Fortune 500 companies as customers and more than triple revenue in its last year, the company says, causing investors to eagerly pile in.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Startups\n\n",

Disney made the announcement at its Tech + Data Showcase event at CES 2026.\nThe company said in the blog post that the experience “will evolve as it expands across news and entertainment and delivers a more personalized, dynamic experience that reinforces Disney+ as a must-visit daily destination.”\nDisney told Deadline that the videos could include original short-form content, repurposed social clips, scenes from TV shows or movies, or a combination.\n“We’re obviously thinking about integrating vertical video in ways that are native to core user behaviors,” Erin Teague, EVP of Product Management for Disney Entertainment and ESPN, told Deadline. “So, it won’t be a kind of a disjointed, random experience.”\nThe move comes as Disney launched a personalized vertical video feed in the ESPN app last year. \nBy introducing short-form video content to Disney+, the company is targeting younger users who are accustomed to watching quick clips on their phones rather than long-form content like TV shows and movies. \nDisney+ won’t be the first streamer to explore vertical video, as Netflix launched a vertical feed last year that lets users scroll through clips from its original titles.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n",

    "body": "\nOpenAI is kicking off the new year with yet another acqui-hire. The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting. \nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.\nConvogo’s product will be wound down. \nThe startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo. \nIn the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes. \n“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”\nThe Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem — as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm — or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI, as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Convogo deal also signals that OpenAI, like its competitors, is using M&A as a talent and capability accelerator. The main exception to that rule is OpenAI’s acquisition of Jonny Ive’s io Products, which is continuing its product roadmap as the two companies work together to create a piece of AI hardware. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

Some shops in Tehran’s traditional bazaar have been closed for 11 days, according to The New York Times.\nIran’s government has responded by violently cracking down on the protesters.  \nThe Iranian government, which maintains a tight control over the country’s internet access, is behind the internet blackout, according to Rashidi.\nRepresentatives for the Iranian government in the United States did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

He resigned from the board in 2018 after his bid to take over as CEO was rejected by the other co-founders, who put Altman up for the job. Officially, Musk cited potential conflicts of interest with Tesla’s own AI development for self-driving cars. \nSince leaving OpenAI, he’s been a vocal critic of the firm’s transition to a for-profit model, and even made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy OpenAI in February 2025, which Altman rejected. OpenAI, which was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, first began to move away from its pure nonprofit roots in 2019 by creating a for-profit subsidiary with a “capped-profit” model that limited investor returns. This was designed to help OpenAI raise the massive amounts of funding it needed to scale and attract top talent. \nMusk’s lawsuit was unable to stop OpenAI from converting into a nonprofit, and in October 2025, the corporation completed its formal restructuring process. The for-profit branch became a Public Benefit Corporation, with the original nonprofit retaining a 26% equity stake. \nMusk is now seeking monetary damages from what he says are “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI. He says he invested about $38 million in early funding, as well as guidance and credibility, based on assurances that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch Musk’s lawsuit is “baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDistrict Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said her decision was based on evidence suggesting OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure would be maintained, as Musk alleges. A jury trial for March has been tentatively scheduled.\nThis article has been updated with commentary from OpenAI.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nFor the past two weeks, X has been flooded with AI-manipulated nude images, created by the Grok AI chatbot. An alarming range of women have been affected by the non-consensual nudes, including prominent models and actresses, as well as news figures, crime victims, and even world leaders. \nA December 31 research paper from Copyleaks estimated roughly one image was being posted each minute, but later tests found far more. A sample gathered from January 5-6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. \nBut while public figures from around the world have decried the choice to release the model without safeguards, there are few clear mechanisms for regulators hoping to rein in Elon Musk’s new image-manipulating system. The result has become a painful lesson in the limits of tech regulation — and a forward-looking challenge for regulators hoping to make a mark.\nUnsurprisingly, the most aggressive action has come from the European Commission, which on Thursday ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot. The move doesn’t necessarily mean the commission has opened up a new investigation, but it’s a common precursor to such action. It’s particularly ominous given recent reporting from CNN that suggests Elon Musk may have personally intervened to prevent safeguards from being placed on what images could be generated by Grok.\nIt’s unclear whether X has made any technical changes to the Grok model, although the public media tab for Grok’s X account has been removed. In a statement, the company specifically denounced the use of AI tools to produce child sexual imagery. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the X Safety account posted on January 3, echoing a previous tweet by Elon Musk.\nIn the meantime, regulators around the world have issued stern warnings. The United Kingdom’s Ofcom issued a statement on Monday, saying it was in touch with xAI and “will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” In a radio interview on Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the phenomenon “disgraceful” and “disgusting,” saying “Ofcom has our full support to take action in relation to this.”\nIn a post on LinkedIn, Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant said her office had received a doubling in complaints related to Grok since late 2025. But Inman-Grant stopped short of taking action against xAI, saying only, “We will use the range of regulatory tools at our disposal to investigate and take appropriate action.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBy far the largest market to threaten action is India, where Grok was the subject of a formal complaint from a member of Parliament. On January, India’s communications regulator MeitY ordered X to address the issue and submit an “action-taken” report within 72 hours — a deadline that was subsequently extended by 48 hours. While a report was submitted to the regulator on January 7, it’s unclear whether MeitY will be satisfied with the response. If not, X could lose its safe harbor status in India, a potentially serious limitation on its ability to operate within the country.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\n​XBrew Lab debuted its countertop nitro beverage machine, EverNitro, at CES this week, offering nitro coffee enthusiasts a more accessible way to enjoy the drink — without the waste and expense of traditional cartridge-based machines.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with nitro coffee, it’s cold brew coffee infused with nitrogen gas. This process creates tiny bubbles, resulting in a silky-smooth, naturally sweeter taste — similar to drinking a Guinness. Many people also note that nitro coffee is less bitter.\nEverNitro is positioning itself against competitors such as NitroBrew as a long-term more affordable all-in-one solution. “We offer the quality of a commercial tap with the footprint of a coffee maker. While others sell you gas, we give you technology to harvest it for free,” founder and CEO Terry Tan said.\n​The company claims EverNitro delivers 95% nitrogen purity and highlights its ability to generate nitrogen directly from the surrounding air. By eliminating the need for single-use cartridges, the device provides a less expensive, environmentally friendly solution for home use.\nImage Credits:XBREW Lab\nAfter testing it ourselves, we were pleasantly surprised. The machine is simple to use, and it fits easily on a counter or stores comfortably on a shelf — making it a nice addition to any kitchen or bar setup. The canister accommodates coffee, cocktails for that bar-quality touch, or other beverages. Users can select their preferred pressure, which ranges from 0 to 8 BAR (a metric unit of pressure).\nThe entire process, from loading your beverage to enjoying the finished drink, takes only minutes. There’s also a companion app that delivers updates. \nThe device launched on Kickstarter in October and raised over $570,000 — a testament to strong interest in this product despite its premium price point. The Lite option costs $470 and includes just the machine and canister, while backers can purchase it for $290. The Pro version is $583 (or $337 for backers) and comes with the machine, two canisters, a coffee bean preservation jar, and whipped cream kits.​ Yet, for comparison’s sake, a countertop unit of NitroBrew costs about $1,000.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLooking ahead, Tan told TechCrunch that the team is “exploring how gases can fundamentally elevate the texture of all beverages, not just coffee. Imagine a machine that doesn’t just dispense; it intelligently mixes a cocktail or brews a coffee and then automatically selects the perfect gas profile to enhance its body and mouthfeel.”\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nCES is always chock-full of robots, and this year electronics giant LG announced a new bot, dubbed CLOid, that it claims will revolutionize household chores (as in, you won’t have to do them anymore).\nCLOid is described as an AI-powered home robot, designed to assist its user with a wide variety of domestic tasks — from folding laundry to making breakfast to patrolling a home for signs of trouble. The company says that, eventually, it envisions the device “evolving into an ambient-care agent that supports everyday life.”\nThe bot was announced during LG’s keynote earlier this week, but it was also available for inspection via rolling presentations on the convention room floor. I went to check one out, where I saw the bot, alongside a human presenter, performing a variety of tasks for an enthusiastic audience.\nCLOid has autonomous movement, so it can get around by itself, and comes equipped with a variety of cameras and sensors that, when paired with LG’s smart home ThinQ app, can leverage situational and environmental data to make proactive suggestions for how to make its user’s life better, LG says. \nThe bot also has speakers so it can communicate with its user. LG says that CLOid runs off a vision language model that converts “images and video into structured, language-based understanding” and a vision language action program that can convert verbal commands into action (you know, like Siri).\nThe last few years have seen the introduction of a number of domestic robots, including Amazon’s Astro and Enabot’s EBO X. CLOid follows in their footsteps but seems designed for a broader array of domestic tasks than its predecessors. Unlike Astro and EBO (which are little more than squat, rolling automatons), CLOid has a large upper body and two arms — a physicality clearly designed to lift stuff and interact with its environment.\nYou’d think that would lead to some impressive results, right? Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOid didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCLOid was cute, and seemed affable enough, but the biggest thing you notice is how slow it is. During Tuesday’s presentation, when his human counterpart asked CLOid to make him some breakfast, the robot trundled over to the refrigerator, waited for the automatic door to open, and then stared into the fridge’s depths for an uncomfortably long period of time before ultimately selecting milk.\nYes, even the most lethargic human would likely win in a race against CLOid. However, speed isn’t really the issue here. The idea is to make sure that the bot’s human companion doesn’t have to do any work at all. It’s part of what LG refers to as its “Zero Labor Home” model, where automation takes care of all of those boring but essential domestic chores. You can be off brushing your teeth or answering a call from your boss while the bot is in the next room, prepping pancakes. That’s the idea, at least.\nFrom the available presentation, it’s a little unclear when that idea will become a reality. I was unable to find out if and when the bot would actually be available to the public. A disclaimer at the bottom of the presentation’s videos read: “Products and solutions shown in this video are under development and not been released for commercial use, thus specifications may vary.” \nAn on-site LG communications staffer told me that CLOid would be available in the future, but she didn’t know when. I reached out to LG’s Home Solutions team for more information.\nThus, like a lot of other robots on display at CES, CLOid felt a little more like an ad for its company’s potential than an accurate representation of what it is currently offering. The bot also seemed well positioned to help market LG’s new AI home ecosystem, which represents a broader array of impressive smart home products, the bulk of which seem like easier lifts for consumers than a new robot in their home. \nI got a brief tour of some of the latest editions of those products. In addition to the return of the LG Wallpaper (having spent a few minutes staring into its insanely thin but beautifully hypnotic surface, I can safely say I want one), the company had a variety of appliances on display this week, including an AI-powered oven that can identify particular ingredients and recommend recipes for you, and an AI refrigerator that you can talk to. All of these devices are supposed to synch with CLOid and are controllable via the company’s ThinQ app.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nYou might think it’s pretty weird to hear the founders of a VR company and a social media platform publicly complaining about how things used to be better back in the dial-up days. Nevertheless, that is what happened at CES on Wednesday, when Oculus creator Palmer Luckey and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian gave a joint talk about the joys of “tech nostalgia.”\nLuckey, who initially made his fortune in VR and now runs the defense contractor Anduril, and Ohanian both seemed to agree: Stuff was better in the old days.\nThe catch, however, is that Luckey and Ohanian weren’t really criticizing technology itself (Luckey said, during his remarks, that he supported AI and felt it was changing workflows for the better); instead, they were criticizing the aesthetics of technology. Vintage consumer tech products, they argued, are superior to today’s — and it’s the styles and form factor of the past that will determine tech’s future, they claimed.\n“It’s not just about nostalgia for the old; it’s about the fact that it’s just objectively better,” Ohanian said of some older products.\nAfter going on a short tirade about how great the 1999 first-person shooter Quake: Arena is, Luckey similarly sang the praises of old-school media. “There is something that used to exist in the intentionality of building a music library — whether that was building whole albums or building mix tapes,” Luckey said, adding that, in the era of endless downloads, you clearly “lose something.”\nLuckey also pointed to younger people who are nostalgic for time periods that they don’t even remember or have any personal connection to. “Why do they think it’s good? It’s not because they’re remembering their childhoods. It’s not because they’re harkening back to some earlier time. It’s because they’re recognizing that it is literally better, some of this old stuff.”  \nCertain consumer trends would seem to suggest that Luckey and Ohanian are on to something. Nostalgia is obviously big across the board these days (look at all those 1980s period pieces coming out of Hollywood), but nostalgic tech design is a particularly thriving niche. Young people are overwhelmed and oversaturated by the internet. As a result, many have developed new interests in physical media — like collecting cassettes and vinyl. Meanwhile, new, low-tech devices with retro designs are also seeing an uptick in interest (just check out the Clicks Communicator phone that debuted at CES this year).\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGiven that consumer interests are trending this direction, Luckey and Ohanian’s enthusiasm for vintage tech could also just end up being a savvy business strategy. That is, if Americans are feeling nostalgic, you might as well monetize it.\nIndeed, Luckey has already been doing this. The defense contractor, who sports an ’80s mullet, launched a project in 2024 called ModRetro Chromatic — a Game Boy-like device that retails for $199, allows gameplay of old cartridge classics from the 1990s, and has been called one of “the best ever made” of its kind.\nOn Wednesday, Ohanian brought one of the ModRetro units onstage and proudly showed it off to the crowd. Ohanian, who has spoken very publicly about his love for Luckey’s gaming company, has also said he’s interested in creating his own vintage-style game.\nThere were a lot of colorful moments during Wednesday’s talk, most of which were generated by Luckey. At one point, he shared that he had been coming to CES since he was 16. Astute CES fans will note: You’re supposed to be 18 to get in. “I used a fake ID,” Luckey told a CES audience on Wednesday, to much laughter. “I pretended that I worked for a company that was exhibiting here,” the mogul said.\nCute retro games may be the future but so, too, is war, it would seem. Since 2017, Luckey has largely been focused on his defense startup Anduril. Earlier this year, in the wake of a Series G fundraising round, the company’s valuation swelled to $30.5 billion. Lately, the company has been collaborating with Meta on headsets for the U.S. military.\nAnduril hardly came up during Wednesday’s talk, but toward the end of the conversation, Luckey pivoted briefly to a discussion about foreign policy to make some characteristically wild claims. “I was part of the problem for a long time, making all of my stuff in China,” he said. “Geopolitically, the United States and China are going through a divorce; it’s a messy divorce — and if people think that it’s going to end with reconciliation, they’re blind. It’s not,” he said.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

Snowflake will integrate Observe’s product into its own to give customers a unified place to collect and store their telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces from software systems) and better spot potential bugs and issues in their data and software.\nObserve was founded in 2017 by Jacob Leverich, Jonathan Trevor, and Ang Li and launched its first observability product built on a centralized Snowflake database in 2018. The company was incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures and has since raised nearly $500 million in venture capital from firms including Snowflake Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, and Madrona, among others.\nNotably, both Snowflake and Observe were incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures, with Sutter Hill managing director Mike Speiser serving as Snowflake’s founding CEO from 2012 to 2014.\nJeremy Burton, the current CEO of Observe, has served on Snowflake’s board of directors since 2015.\nIntegrating Observe into Snowflake allows users to proactively monitor their data stack and spot and fix issues 10x faster than before, according to a Snowflake blog post — a task that has become harder to scale due to the sheer volume of data generated by AI agents.\nThe acquisition also creates a unified framework for telemetry data, which is automatically collected, built on Apache Iceberg and OpenTelemetry architectures.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. According to reports, the deal is valued at around $1 billion, which would make it Snowflake’s largest acquisition to date, surpassing its $800 million purchase in March 2022 of Streamlit, an open source framework that allows developers and data scientists to quickly build and share data applications without needing expertise in front-end development.\nObserve was most recently valued at $848 million as of July 2025, according to PitchBook data. TechCrunch has reached out to Snowflake for more information on the deal.\nLast year saw a wave of consolidation in the data industry as data companies looked to build out their product offerings to make themselves more attractive one-stop-shop partners in the age of AI.\nThis deal could be a sign that data company consolidation will continue in 2026. Snowflake has been particularly active, completing and announcing several AI-related acquisitions in 2025, including Crunchy Data and Datavolo, and Select Star, a data governance and metadata management platform that helps organizations understand and trace their data at scale.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nNSO Group, one of the most well-known and controversial makers of government spyware, released a new transparency report on Wednesday, as the company enters what it described as “a new phase of accountability.”\nBut the report, unlike NSO’s previous annual disclosures, lacks details about how many customers the company rejected, investigated, suspended, or terminated due to human rights abuses involving its surveillance tools. While the report contains promises to respect human rights and have controls to demand its customers do the same, the report provides no concrete evidence supporting either. \nExperts and critics who have followed NSO and the spyware market for years believe the report is part of an effort and campaign by the company to get the U.S. government to remove the company from a blocklist — technically called the Entity List — as it hopes to enter the U.S. market with new financial backers and executives at the helm.\nLast year, a group of U.S. investors acquired the company, and since then, NSO has been undergoing a transition that included high-profile personnel changes: former Trump official David Friedman was appointed the new executive chairman; CEO Yaron Shohat stepped down; and Omri Lavie, the last remaining founder who was still involved in the company, also left, as Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.\n“When NSO’s products are in the right hands within the right countries, the world is a far safer place. That will always be our overriding mission,” Friedman wrote in the report, which does not mention any country where NSO operates.\nNatalia Krapiva, the senior tech-legal counsel at Access Now, a digital rights organization that investigates spyware abuses, told TechCrunch: “NSO is clearly on a campaign to get removed from the U.S. Entity List and one of the key things they need to show is that they have dramatically changed as a company since they were listed.” \n“Changing the leadership is one part and this transparency report is another,” said Krapiva. \n“However, we have seen this before with NSO and other spyware companies over the years where they change names and leadership and publish empty transparency or ethics reports but the abuses continue.” \n\n\t\t\tContact Us\n\t\t\tDo you know more information about NSO Group? Or other spyware makers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or email.\t\t\n“This is nothing but another attempt at window dressing and the U.S. government should not be taken for a fool,” said Krapiva.\nEver since the Biden administration added NSO to the Entity List, the company has lobbied to have its restrictions lifted. After President Donald Trump took office again last year, NSO intensified these efforts. But, as of May last year, NSO had failed to sway the new administration.\nIn late December, the Trump administration lifted sanctions against three executives tied to the Intellexa spyware consortium, in what some saw as a sign of a shift in the administration’s attitude toward spyware makers.\nA lack of details\nThis year’s transparency report, which covers 2025, has fewer details than reports from previous years. \nIn an earlier transparency report covering 2024, for example, NSO said it opened three investigations of potential misuse. Without naming the customers, the company said it cut ties with one, and imposed on another customer “alternative remediation measures,” including mandating human rights training, monitoring the customer activities, and requesting more information about how the customer uses the system. NSO did not provide any information about the third investigation. \nNSO also said that during 2024, the company rejected more than $20 million “in new business opportunities due to human rights concerns.” \nIn the transparency report published the prior year, covering 2022 and 2023, NSO said it suspended or terminated six government customers, without naming them, claiming these actions resulted in a revenue loss of $57 million.\nIn 2021, NSO said it had “disconnected” the systems of five customers since 2016 following an investigation of misuse, resulting in more than $100 million in “estimated loss of revenue,” and it also said that it “discontinued engagements” with five customers due to “concerns regarding human rights.”\nNSO’s newest transparency report does not include the total number of customers NSO has, statistics that have been consistently present in previous reports.\nTechCrunch asked NSO spokesperson Gil Lanier to provide similar statistics and figures, but did not receive answers by press time.\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, a human rights organization that has investigated spyware abuses for more than a decade, criticized NSO. \n“I was expecting information, numbers,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “Nothing in this document allows outsiders to verify NSO’s claims, which is business as usual from a company that has a decade-long history of making claims that later turned out to be misrepresentation.”\n",

    "body": "\nBuilding software products has never been easier, so why are so many well-funded startups failing to take off no matter how good their product is? In this season finale episode of Build Mode, our guest has an answer: Startups have focused too much on product development and not enough on distribution excellence. Paul Irving is partner and COO at GTMfund, which operates under the thesis that distribution is the final moat in the AI era. \nThe traditional go-to-market playbook lays out a one-size-fits-all approach to hiring and scaling that may have worked in the days of traditional enterprise SaaS but won’t cut it in the crowded, AI-driven startup era of 2025. Innovation cycles are moving faster than ever, and what used to take several years can now be achieved in just a few months. So Irving and the GTMfund team advise their portfolio companies to differentiate in their distribution rather than their product. \n“The aperture for how you build your go-to-market or revenue engine and the decisions you make to get there have never had more unique and specific pathways depending on your company,” Irving said. \nIn this episode, Irving dove into several specific examples of what he’s seen work for startups. The main takeaways: AI can help small teams hone their data-driven approach and find direct lines to their customer base through creative means; in the early days, founders can’t tackle all distribution channels at once; hiring should be approached thoughtfully without a traditional mindset; and building a team of trusted advisers should be a top priority. \nEarly-stage investors, at least at GTMfund, aren’t looking for startups that have spent half their budget on paid ads or hired a full sales team. They want to see founders get creative with how they reach their unique customers. Irving laid out an example of one startup that became an active participant in several relevant Facebook groups. “If you think about it in the framework of, okay, it’s a thousand people, but 700 of them are my actual ICP and buyer because of the specific groups that either we started as a company or the ones that we’ve become the most active posters in. It can become a really unique channel if you’re looking to bring on 40, 50, 60 new customers in a given year,” he said. \nIrving argues that the aperture for going to market has never been broader, so it’s crucial for founders to carve out a creative approach for reaching their target customer. However, founders can’t and shouldn’t do it alone. A refrain throughout this conversation is the importance of a robust network. GTMfund provides their portfolio companies with a vast network of operators, but they won’t just hand founders a Rolodex — they create bespoke pairings to ensure that there will be value in the meeting for everyone involved. \n“I think what’s wonderful about the venture-backed ecosystem more generally is people’s willingness to help. They know how hard it is to build a company. They know how low the likelihood of success is in the grand scheme of things, but people are always willing. If you come and you’re curious, you teach them something as part of that as well. People are usually willing to open up doors,” Irving said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nIsabelle Johannessen is our host.

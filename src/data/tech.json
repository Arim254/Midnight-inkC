Under the deal, which was worth just under $70 million, Apple’s in-house studio will be producing the show’s future seasons. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer. \nThe deal is similar to one Apple struck with AMC Studios for sci-fi show “Silo” after season one. \n“Severance” will now be one of Apple’s marquee titles, joining popular series such as “Your Friends and Neighbors” and “Stick.”\nAccording to Deadline, the production costs for “Severance” had exceeded what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already requested advances from Apple and was considering relocating production from New York to Canada for bigger and quicker tax rebates. Since Apple definitely has the funds to back the show, the company decided to take full control.\n“Severance” is important to the streamer, as the show’s second season became Apple’s most-watched series at the time. It also had the highest number of nominations at the 2025 Emmy Awards.\nDeadline reports that the show is expected to run for four seasons, with the possibility of spin-offs, a prequel, and foreign versions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n\n",

The company’s new value is $380 billion — a huge jump from its previous Series F valuation of $183 billion.\nSome details of the round were reported earlier this week by Bloomberg.\nThe new round was led by Singaporean wealth fund GIC and investment management firm Coatue, with a number of other prominent firms — including D. E. Shaw Ventures, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX — co-leading the round. Other significant investors listed include Accel, General Catalyst, Jane Street, and the Qatar Investment Authority, among many others.\nThe infusion of funding for the AI startup takes place as it is vying for customers and cultural attention with its competitor, OpenAI. OpenAI also recently made it known that it is seeking to clinch an additional $100 billion in funding, which, were it to secure the funds, would balloon the company’s valuation to some $830 billion.\n“Whether it is entrepreneurs, startups, or the world’s largest enterprises, the message from our customers is the same: Claude is increasingly becoming more critical to how businesses work,” said Krishna Rao, Anthropic’s chief financial officer, in a press release. “This fundraising reflects the incredible demand we are seeing from these customers, and we will use this investment to continue building the enterprise-grade products and models they have come to depend on.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

Currently, the new rule only applies to car and truck tailpipe emissions, but it’s expected to be the first of several similar changes to federal air pollution regulations.\nBefore the endangerment finding can be fully repealed, though, the EPA must go through a lengthy process. The original finding took two years to put in place.\nThe move by Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, will slow the decline in emissions by about 10%, according to Axios. That’s a significant amount, but not enough to reverse the trend, partly because cheap renewables have dominated new electricity-generation capacity in recent years.\n“This action will only lead to more pollution, and that will lead to higher costs and real harms for American families,” Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, told TechCrunch in a statement.\nUnabated climate change is expected to raise mortality rates by around 2% in the U.S., and it could reduce global GDP by 17% by 2050, or about $38 trillion.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Climate\n\n",

In IBM’s case, it’s going all in.\nHardware giant IBM plans to triple entry-level hiring in the U.S. in 2026, according to reporting from Bloomberg. Nickle LaMoreaux, IBM’s chief human resource officer, announced the initiative at Charter’s Leading with AI Summit on Tuesday.\n“And yes, it’s for all these jobs that we’re being told AI can do,” LaMoreaux said.\nThese jobs will look different than the entry-level jobs IBM used to offer, she explained. According to LaMoreaux, she went through and changed the descriptions for these entry-level jobs so they were less focused on areas AI can actually automate — like coding — and more focused on people-forward areas like engaging with customers.\nThis strategy makes sense. Even if an enterprise like IBM doesn’t necessarily need the same amount of entry-level talent that it did before, fostering less experienced workers helps ensure these employees have the skills needed for the higher-level roles down the road.\nIBM didn’t specify how many people they would be hiring in this initiative. TechCrunch reached out to IBM for more information on the hiring plans.\nThis year could be a pivotal one regarding what the impact of AI on the hiring market will look like. An MIT study in 2025 estimated that 11.7% of jobs could likely already be automated by AI. A TechCrunch survey found that multiple investors think 2026 will start to show AI’s potential impact on the labor market — despite not being asked about labor specifically.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

    "body": "\nTim Spencer realized just how complicated manufacturing procurement can be while running Markai, an e-commerce startup in Asia, during the pandemic.\n“We had thousands of suppliers, and we were distributing products into dozens of countries around the world,” Spencer (pictured left) told TechCrunch. His staff was overwhelmed by the manual complexity of sourcing suppliers, negotiating pricing, tracking orders, and managing payments.\n“I found myself running this big team that was not really set up for success,” he said. He sold Markai in 2023, just as it was becoming clear that generative AI could streamline the most time-consuming procurement hurdles for manufacturers and distributors.\nLater that year, Spencer launched Didero with Lorenz Pallhuber (pictured center), a veteran of McKinsey’s procurement practice, and Tom Petit, the former technical co-founder of Landis.\nDidero, whose mission is to automate many of the complexities of global procurement, just raised a $30 million Series A co-led by Chemistry and Headline, with participation from Microsoft’s venture fund M12.\n“Global trade runs on natural language communication,” Spencer said. “It’s emails, WeChat, phone calls, purchase orders, and packing lists.”\nUntil the advent of generative AI, these fragmented pieces had to be tracked by humans who spent their days chasing suppliers and manually updating systems of record. Didero claims its platform can ingest that communication, putting a significant portion of the procurement workflow on autopilot.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDidero functions as an agentic AI layer that sits on top of a company’s existing ERP, acting as a coordinator that reads incoming communications and automatically executes the necessary updates and tasks.\n“The goal is to go from ‘I need a good’ to payment without having to lift a finger,” Spencer said.\nUnlike Levelpath, Zip, or Oro Labs, which use AI to streamline corporate purchasing, Didero focuses on the supply chain. Its platform is designed for manufacturers and distributors who need to source raw materials and inputs required to build or sell their products.\nDidero has a few smaller competitors that can handle some of the tasks that the company does. For instance, Cavela and Pietra help brands source and negotiate pricing with manufacturers, but according to Spencer, these companies serve small and medium-sized companies and don’t handle the full procurement process, from the first quote to the final payment.\nDidero has dozens of customers but named only one, Footprint, a provider of sustainable, plant-based packaging.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Thursday, OpenAI announced the release of a light-weight version of its agentic coding tool Codex, the latest model of which OpenAI launched earlier this month. GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is described by the company as a “smaller version” of that model, one that is designed for faster inference. To power that inference, OpenAI has brought in a dedicated chip from its hardware partner Cerebras, marking a new level of integration in the company’s physical infrastructure.\nThe partnership between Cerebras and OpenAI was announced last month, when OpenAI said that it had reached a multi-year agreement with the firm worth over $10 billion. “Integrating Cerebras into our mix of compute solutions is all about making our AI respond much faster,” the company said at the time. Now, OpenAI calls Spark the “first milestone” in that relationship.\nSpark, which OpenAI says is designed for swift, real-time collaboration and “rapid iteration,” will be powered by Cerebras’ Wafer Scale Engine 3. The WSE-3 is Cerebras’ third-generation waferscale megachip, decked out with 4 trillion transistors. OpenAI describes the new lightweight tool as a “daily productivity driver, helping users with rapid prototyping” rather than the longer, heavier tasks that the original 5.3 is designed for. Spark is currently enjoying a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users in the Codex app.\nIn a tweet in advance of the announcement, CEO Sam Altman seemed to hint at the new model. “We have a special thing launching to Codex users on the Pro plan later today,” Altman tweeted. “It sparks joy for me.”\nIn its official statement, OpenAI emphasized Spark as designed for the lowest possible latency on Codex. “Codex-Spark is the first step toward a Codex that works in two complementary modes: real-time collaboration when you want rapid iteration, and long-running tasks when you need deeper reasoning and execution,” OpenAI shared. The company added that Cerebras’ chips excel at assisting “workflows that demand extremely low latency.”\nCerebras has been around for over a decade but, in the AI era, it has enjoyed an increasingly prominent role in the tech industry. Just last week, the company announced that it had raised $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of $23 billion. The company has previously announced its intentions to pursue an IPO.\n“What excites us most about GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is partnering with OpenAI and the developer community to discover what fast inference makes possible — new interaction patterns, new use cases, and a fundamentally different model experience,” Sean Lie, CTO and co-founder of Cerebras, said in a statement. “This preview is just the beginning.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tLucas is a senior writer at TechCrunch, where he covers artificial intelligence, consumer tech, and startups.

    "body": "\nAfter two years of initial hesitation, YouTube has finally unveiled its dedicated app for the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhen Apple’s headset first launched, YouTube opted for a web-based approach instead of developing a dedicated app, directing viewers to use Safari to access content. Until now, anyone wanting to watch YouTube on the headset has missed out on helpful features like offline downloads — making it much less useful for travel or offline viewing. \nTo fill the gap, third-party options, such as Juno, briefly appeared on visionOS before being removed for violating YouTube’s Terms of Service.\nToday’s announcement changes the game, allowing users to enjoy their favorite content — including all standard videos and YouTube Shorts —on a theater-sized virtual screen in a fully immersive environment. \nStandout features include a Spatial tab that lets users discover spatial videos, including 3D, VR180, and 360-degree formats. For consumers with the latest Apple Vision Pro models powered by the M5 chip, the app supports 8K playback, a notable upgrade.\nAdditionally, users can interact with the new visionOS app using gesture controls, such as resizing windows or scrubbing through videos.\nThe timing of this app’s release is interesting, as YouTube initially hesitated to invest in a dedicated visionOS experience, possibly waiting to gauge the headset’s traction.

Recent estimates indicate that sales have significantly declined, with only about 45,000 new units shipped during the fourth quarter of 2025. The Financial Times reported that production was halted due to weak demand, resulting in a sharp reduction in marketing efforts across key markets.\nThe app is now available in the visionOS App Store and is compatible with both the M2 and M5 chip models.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nModal Labs, a startup specializing in AI inference infrastructure, is talking to VCs about a new round at a valuation of about $2.5 billion, according to four people with knowledge of the deal. Should the deal close at these terms, the funding round would more than double the company’s valuation of $1.1 billion announced less than five months ago, when it announced an $87 million Series B round.\nGeneral Catalyst is in talks to lead the round, the people told TechCrunch. Modal’s annualized revenue run rate (ARR) is approximately $50 million, our sources said. The discussions are early, and terms could still change.  \nModal Labs co-founder and CEO Erik Bernhardsson denied that his company was actively fundraising and characterized his recent interactions with VCs as general conversations. General Catalyst did not respond to our requests for comment.\nModal is focused on optimizing inference, the process of running trained AI models to generate answers from user requests. Improving inference efficiency reduces compute costs and cuts down the lag time between a user’s prompt and the AI’s response.\nModal is one of the handful of inference-focused companies attracting intense investor attention now. Last week, its competitor Baseten announced a $300 million raise at a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the $2.1 billion valuation it reached just months prior in September. Similarly, Fireworks AI, an inference cloud provider, secured $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October.\nIn January, the creators of the open source inference project vLLM announced they had transitioned the tool into a VC-backed startup, Inferact, raising $150 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz at an $800 million valuation. Meanwhile, TechCrunch reported that the team behind SGLang has commercialized as RadixArk, which sources told us secured seed funding at a $400 million valuation led by Accel.\nModal was co-founded by CEO Erik Bernhardsson in 2021 after he spent more than 15 years building and leading data teams at companies including Spotify and Better.com, where he was CTO.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe startup counts Lux Capital and Redpoint Ventures among its earlier backers.\nEditor’s Note: This story was updated to include a comment from Modal.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nHas AI coding reached a tipping point? That seems to be the case for Spotify at least, which shared this week during its fourth-quarter earnings call that the best developers at the company “have not written a single line of code since December.” That statement, from Spotify co-CEO Gustav Söderström, came alongside other comments about how the company is using AI to accelerate development.\nOf note, Spotify pointed out it shipped more than 50 new features and changes to its streaming app throughout 2025. And, most recently, it has rolled out more features, like AI-powered Prompted Playlists, Page Match for audiobooks, and About This Song, which all launched within the past few weeks.\nAt Spotify, engineers are using an internal system called “Honk” to speed up coding and product velocity, the company told analysts on the call. This system allows for things like remote, real-time code deployment using generative AI, and specifically Claude Code. \n“As a concrete example, an engineer at Spotify on their morning commute from Slack on their cell phone can tell Claude to fix a bug or add a new feature to the iOS app,” Söderström said. “And once Claude finishes that work, the engineer then gets a new version of the app, pushed to them on Slack on their phone, so that he can then merge it to production, all before they even arrive at the office.”\nSpotify credited the system in helping to speed up coding and deployment “tremendously.” \n“We foresee this not being the end of the line in terms of AI development, just the beginning,” Söderström said.\nThe exec also touted Spotify’s ability to build a unique dataset that other LLMs could not commoditize, the way they could other online resources, like Wikipedia. That’s because there’s not always a factual answer for music-related questions, he said. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor instance, if you asked what workout music is, you’d get different answers from different people, sometimes based on their geography. Americans tend to prefer hip-hop overall, though millions prefer death metal. And while a number of Europeans would work out to EDM, many Scandinavians like heavy metal.\n“This is a dataset that we are building right now that no one else is really building. It does not exist at this scale. And we see it improving every time we retrain our models,” Söderström noted. \nAnalysts on the call also asked about Spotify’s approach to AI-generated music. The company explained that it’s allowing artists and labels to indicate in a track’s metadata how the song was made but is still policing the platform for spam.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nAfter a particularly poor performance on its fourth-quarter earnings, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready attempted to favorably compare the digital pinboarding site to the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT.\nTrying to highlight its potential as a unique search destination, Ready asserted that the site sees larger search volume than ChatGPT. According to third-party data, ChatGPT sees 75 billion searches per month, while Pinterest sees 80 billion searches and generates 1.7 billion monthly clicks, he said.\n“That makes us one of the largest search destinations in the world. And importantly, more than half of those searches are commercial in nature, compared to, I think . . . approximately 2% [of ChatGPT searches],” Ready added.\nPinterest in the fourth quarter missed expectations on both revenue and earnings per share, reporting $1.32 billion in revenue versus $1.33 billion expected, and earnings per share of 67 cents, compared to the 69 cents projected. It also forecast that first-quarter 2026 sales will come in between $951 million to $971 million, below the $980 million expected.\nThe company blamed its shortfall on larger advertisers pulling back on spend, particularly in Europe, and a new furniture tariff implemented in October that caused issues within the home category. It said those trends could worsen in the first quarter.\nSurprisingly, Pinterest missed on earnings despite a user base that’s growing faster than expected. The company reported monthly active users were up 12% year-over-year to 619 million, when Wall Street had forecast 613 million users.\nShares dropped 20% in after-hours trading.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPinterest has long struggled to translate the high usage of its platform into ad dollars, as its users often go to Pinterest to plan and dream, not shop and buy. That challenge could become even more acute in the AI era, especially if advertisers shift their dollars to platforms where intent to buy is clearer — such as chatbot requests that ask for product recommendations.\nWhen asked about how Pinterest will navigate the shift toward AI-powered shopping, Ready pointed to the company’s visual search, discovery, and personalization features, which he said would point users to relevant products when they open the app.\n“We’re helping them complete those commercial journeys without having to type in a single prompt,” he said, also noting that Pinterest had benefited from an easier checkout flow that came from its partnership with Amazon. He said customers didn’t yet seem ready to allow an AI to make a purchase on their behalf, but said Pinterest would be ready if that time came.\n“That’ll actually be one of the easiest parts of the commercial journey to solve,” he claimed. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nRivian is, by every measure, a maker and seller of EVs. But in 2025, it was the company’s software and services that helped its annual revenue grow by 8%. \nRivian reported Thursday $5.38 billion in total revenue in 2025, up from $4.97 billion from the prior year. That rosy picture dulls a bit when looking just at its automotive revenue, which fell 15% to $3.8 billion in 2025. The fall was fueled by a $134 million drop in regulatory credit sales and lower vehicle deliveries, which were partially offset by higher average selling prices, according to Rivian. \nMeanwhile, software and services revenue grew more than threefold to $1.55 billion for the year. And the joint venture with Volkswagen Group was behind most of that growth, according to Rivian. The “services” component of this line item, which Rivian doesn’t break out, includes a variety of items, including vehicle repair, vehicle trade-ins, and maintenance services. The remainder, and the bulk of the revenue, is from software, and specifically due to the joint venture with VW Group. \nVW and Rivian formed a technology joint venture in 2024 that is worth up to $5.8 billion. The joint venture is milestone-based and in 2025 Rivian hit the mark, which meant a $1 billion payout in the form of a share sale. Under the terms of the JV, Rivian will supply VW Group with its existing electrical architecture and software technology stack. \nRivian received an initial $1 billion convertible note in 2024 and another $1 billion payment in July 2025. \nRivian is expected to continue to receive payments from VW Group through 2027. Rivian is expected to receive an additional $2 billion of capital as part of the joint venture in 2026, CFO Claire McDonough said Thursday on the company earnings call. About $1 billion of that is subject to the successful completion of winter testing, which is underway. The remaining $1 billion is nonrecourse debt, which is expected to be received in October.\nAnd while the funds provide a hefty stopgap, Rivian’s financial success in 2026 will hinge largely on the rollout of its next EV, the R2. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nRivian confirmed in its earnings report Thursday that the R2 SUV, which is designed to be cheaper to build and less expensive for customers, will come to market by June 2026. That “cheaper to build” line item is particularly crucial for Rivian, which has historically lost money on every vehicle it makes. \nRivian has spent years trying to push the cost of goods sold figure down. And it has made progress with the rollout of its second-generation flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV. For instance, McDonough said “in the fourth quarter it was able to deliver $92,000 of cogs per unit and that was about a $4,000 per unit improvement relative to the third quarter.” Rivian’s cogs per unit was $99,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe company saw its total automotive cost of revenue decrease year-over-year from $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 to $898 million in the same quarter in 2025. Notably, the company’s cost of revenue for software steadily inched up throughout 2025.\nThe R2 SUV, which will initially launch as a dual motor all-wheel-drive model, is an opportunity to further reduce costs. The company is expected to release more information about the R2, including final specs, on March 12. \nRivian’s guidance for 2026 suggests that it is banking on demand for R2 and its ability to ramp up production. The company said Thursday it expects to deliver between 62,000 and 67,000 vehicles in 2026 — which could provide up to a 59% bump from last year. Rivian delivered 42,247 vehicles in 2025, which includes its two R1 consumer vehicles and the electric delivery van (EDV). \nRivian CEO RJ Scaringe noted that the company expects some growth in EDV sales in 2026. Rivian plans to produce an all-wheel-drive version and a larger battery pack variant of the EDV, for which Amazon is its primary customer.\n“Both of those are to help unlock specific use cases within the Amazon network,” Scaringe said. “We’re working really closely with Amazon in defining the requirements of those and excited to get those launched.”\nThe company isn’t signaling profitability — on an adjusted basis — just yet. But it is offering up considerable improvement on that front. Rivian reported a $3.6 billion net loss in 2025; it expects an adjusted net loss of between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion for 2026. Rivian also projects capital expenditures will be between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion this year.\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "description": "\nWeb hosting company WP Engine has filed an amended complaint with brow-raising new allegations in its ongoing legal battle with WordPress co-founder ",
    "body": "\nWeb hosting company WP Engine has filed an amended complaint with brow-raising new allegations in its ongoing legal battle with WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg and his company Automattic (WordPress.com’s parent company). The company now claims that Mullenweg intended to target 10 different hosting companies with royalty payments for their use of the WordPress trademark and tried to get payment processor Stripe to cancel its contract with WP Engine.\nAt the heart of the dispute, Mullenweg believes WP Engine is profiting from the open source WordPress project without contributing back to the community, and demanded the hosting company pay 8% of its monthly gross revenues as a royalty fee for using the WordPress brand.\nThe suit, originally filed by WP Engine in October 2024, accused Automattic and Mullenweg of defamation and abuse of power. Automattic filed its counterclaims last year, alleging that the hosting company has been abusing the WordPress trademark and engaging in deceptive marketing practices.\nIn this latest filing, WP Engine has amended its complaint for the third time after gaining access to information that was uncovered during the discovery process. The information, now unredacted, had been previously sealed at Automattic’s request.\nNotably, one of the new claims accuses Automattic of allegedly planning to target 10 other competitors with royalty claims similar to those aimed at WP Engine.\nThe complaint also states that Newfold, a company whose portfolio includes hosting providers like Bluehost and HostGator, among others, is already paying Automattic for use of its trademarks and that Automattic is in conversations with others. (Names of the other hosts were redacted in the complaint, which referenced email conversations between those companies and Mullenweg.)\nWP Engine is also alleging that Mullenweg reached out to a Stripe executive via email to pressure the company to cancel WP Engine’s contract. This occurred after WP Engine had filed its lawsuit against Automattic, the complaint states.\nThe filing also challenges the 8% rate for the royalty payments as being somewhat arbitrary. Referencing Mullenweg’s comments at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, WP Engine claims that the Automattic founder essentially came up with the rate because it was what he thought WP Engine “could afford to pay.”\n\n\n\nAt Disrupt, Mullenweg had responded to a question about how he settled on the 8% fee by saying it was based on a “business analysis.”\n“If you estimate that would be about $32 million — they still would have been free cash-flow positive, and based on our estimates, and the negotiations over the past 18 months, we felt like that was a fair amount,” he said at the event.\nOther new claims in the filing point to aggressive language Mullenweg allegedly used against WP Engine, like threats that if the web hosting provider didn’t comply, he would start stealing its customers. “If they don’t take the carrot, we’ll give them the stick,” was one of the quotes cited from internal correspondence at Automattic, for instance.\nThe complaint also includes allegations that Mullenweg used the term “nuclear war” to describe his approach to WP Engine’s defiance.\nAsked about the new filing, Automattic shared the following statement with TechCrunch: “There is nothing new here. This is the same narrative WP Engine has been pushing for over a year, and the Court has already dismissed many of its central claims. The lawsuit is going nowhere. This latest filing simply repackages the same tired allegations in an effort to keep the story alive. WP Engine is trying to recast robust competition as something nefarious. We are confident the courts will continue to reject that theory.”\n\nUpdated after publication with Automattic’s statement. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has raised concerns over allegations that Apple is censoring conservative content on the Apple News app. \nIn a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, FTC chair Andrew Ferguson cited reports from Media Research Center, a right-leaning think tank, which accused Apple of excluding right-leaning outlets from the top 20 articles in the Apple News feed.\n“These reports raise serious questions about whether Apple News is acting in accordance with its terms of service and its representations to consumers […] I abhor and condemn any attempt to censor content for ideological reasons,” Ferguson’s letter reads.\nFerguson, a Big Tech critic who Trump appointed to lead the competition regulator, noted the FTC doesn’t have any powers to require Apple to take ideological or political positions when curating news, but he said that if the company’s practices are “inconsistent” its terms of service or “reasonable expectations of consumers,” they may be in violation of the FTC Act.\nBrendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (another Trump appointee critical of Big Tech), supported Ferguson’s stance, writing, “Apple has no right to suppress conservative viewpoints in violation of the FTC Act.”\nFerguson has urged Apple to conduct a “comprehensive review” of its terms of service and ensure that the content curated on Apple News is consistent with its policies, and “take corrective action swiftly” if the curation isn’t in line.\nThe letter comes a day after President Donald Trump shared the report by Media Research Center on his social media platform, Truth Social. Trump has repeatedly accused Big Tech companies of censoring right-leaning content, though many major platforms have rolled back several measures to curb fake news and disinformation they had imposed in the years prior to his second stint at the White House.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nApple’s relationship with the Trump administration has oscillated between warm and cold over the past year. Trump has criticized Big Tech, especially Apple, for manufacturing its devices in China, but after Cook promised to spend more than $600 billion over the next four years stateside and moved to mend fences, relations between the administration and the company have improved. Apple also dodged planned tariffs on smartphones made overseas and imported into the U.S.\nThe FTC last year also launched an investigation into “censorship by tech platforms,” seeking input from the public who felt they were silenced due to their political ideologies or affiliations. “Tech firms should not be bullying their users,” Ferguson said at the time. “This inquiry will help the FTC better understand how these firms may have violated the law by silencing and intimidating Americans for speaking their minds.”\n Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "body": "\nIf you want to buy or sell a used EV right now, what’s the first step you’d take? \nA startup called Ever wants to be the answer to that question. The company, which bills itself as the first “AI-native, full-stack auto retail business” for electric vehicles, already has thousands of customers buying and selling their EVs on the platform.\nNow it’s looking to scale with help from a $31 million Series A funding round led by Eclipse, with Ibex Investors, Lifeline Ventures, and JIMCO — the investment arm of the Saudi Arabian Jameel family (an early investor in Rivian) — as co-investors.\nOver the last decade, companies like Carvana and CarMax helped usher in the digital car-buying experience. More recently, myriad startups have tried to improve the car-buying experience with AI, pitching ideas like voice agents or smarter scheduling software. Eclipse’s Jiten Behl thinks this is the wrong approach if you want to really modernize the automotive retail experience, though.\n“These bolt-on AI tools are band-aids,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch. He likened it to how many major automakers’ first EVs were essentially combustion vehicles that were repackaged to fit electric drivetrains. That approach came with major tradeoffs compared to designing a new EV from the ground up, which was the approach companies like Tesla and Rivian took.\n“Auto retail is a perfect candidate for disrupting with AI, you know? It’s a lot of process, lot of labor, [very] rules-based,” he said. \nLasse-Mathias Nyberg, Ever co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that buying or selling a car typically triggers “hundreds or thousands of different actions” that a retailer needs to perform in order to complete the transaction. “There’s massive complexities or frictions on both sides.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIn 2022, he and his team set out to reduce or remove those complexities. What they settled on after a year of research was a digital-first auto retailer. The core tech is an orchestration layer or “operating system” that can handle all the different workflows behind a transaction, whether it’s processing information submitted by a prospective buyer or seller, or managing the vehicle inventory.\n“When you do appraisals, or pricing, or titling, it’s very deterministic in terms of what steps need to be taken. And today, there are lots of single point solution tools that are used,” he said. Most companies “use these tools together in a very inefficient manner, and you think that you are on a digital journey — but if you actually could clean-sheet it, and if you actually could use the power of agentic AI, and you can create one unified customer experience and remove all these micro-frictions.”\nNyberg claimed that building the company this way has allowed Ever’s sales team to be two to three times more productive than they would be otherwise, and he expects that to scale as the company grows. He said this extra efficiency and productivity beefs up their margins, which can be booked as profit or passed along to the customer by offering lower prices.\nEver applies this fresh approach to both its online marketplace and physical locations. Nyberg said the hybrid model is important because seeing and trying a car in person remains crucial to the shopping experience for a lot of buyers — especially those who might be assessing EVs for the first time. \nEarly reviews of Ever’s product have been mixed. Users on one particular Reddit thread from last year were split, with some drawn to how Ever is making EVs easier to buy, while others detailed struggles getting in touch with the startup’s team. Ever was just getting off the ground and was more or less operating in stealth, and so Nyberg chalks that up to a learning experience. He said his team is working hard to make sure its system can be flexible enough to accomplish everything the company has set out to do.\nThe bigger challenge may be overall interest in EVs, which has cooled a bit in the United States. Nyberg said he hasn’t ruled out Ever buying or selling used combustion cars in the future, but wants to stick to EVs in the near-term since there isn’t a retailer that is laser-focused on these vehicles.\nBehl, who spent eight years on Rivian’s leadership team, admitted he’s a “hopeless romantic when it comes to EVs,” and said he still believes the industry is moving toward electric propulsion because of the inherent benefits. And he said his “first thought” when he started doing diligence on Ever was: “I wish Rivian was doing this.”\nMore broadly, Behl said, companies like Carvana are still in the single digits of market share when it comes to automotive retail. That’s why he sees so much upside in Ever.\n“Customers are going to continue to gravitate towards better experience when it comes to buying cars, which means it is going to be a digitally-led customer experience which takes away all the friction of buying and selling a car,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, xAI took the rare step of publishing a full 45-minute all-hands meeting video on X, making it publicly accessible. Details of the Tuesday night meeting were previously reported by The New York Times, which may have influenced xAI’s decision to post the video online.\nThe full video reveals significant new details about Musk’s plans for the AI lab, including its product roadmap and its ongoing ties to the X platform.\n\nThe most immediate revelation concerned a string of departing employees, which Musk described as layoffs resulting from a changing organizational structure at the company. While reorganizations are common, the breadth of the departures has caused significant confusion, particularly as it has meant the loss of a significant portion of the founding team.\n“As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve,” Musk said on X. “This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.”\nThe new organizational system splits xAI into four primary teams: one focused on the Grok chatbot (including voice), another for the app’s coding system, another for the Imagine video generator, and finally a team focused on the Macrohard project, which spans from simple computer use simulation to modeling entire corporations.\n“[Macrohard] is able to do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do,” Toby Pohlen, who will lead the project under the new organizational structure, told his colleagues. “There should be rocket engines fully designed by AI.”\nImage Credits:xAI (screenshot)\nThe all-hands also featured claims about new usage and revenue figures for xAI and X. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, said X had “just crossed” $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions, which he attributed to a marketing push during the holidays.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBoston, MA\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdditionally, executives said the xAI’s Imagine tool is generating 50 million videos a day, and more than 6 billion images over the past 30 days, according to their internal metrics.\nBut it’s difficult to separate those figures from the flood of deepfake pornography that overtook X during that same period. The X platform saw engagement skyrocket as AI-generated explicit images became more prevalent, and with an estimated 1.8 million sexualized images generated over just nine days, the image-generation figures likely include substantial amounts of this controversial content.\nThe most eye-catching part of the presentation came at the end, when Musk reemphasized the importance of space-based data centers despite the technical challenges involved. Musk went still further, envisioning a moon-based factory for AI satellites, including a lunar mass driver — essentially an electromagnetic catapult — to launch them. With such infrastructure, Musk said, one could launch an AI cluster capable of capturing significant portions of the sun’s total energy output or even expanding to other galaxies.\n“It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” Musk said, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

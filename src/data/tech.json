It also comes as OpenAI races to rake in AI-driven commerce via new products like “Instant Checkout” that let users make purchases within conversations with retailers like Etsy and Shopify. \nThe Target app in ChatGPT will launch in beta next week, and it will let shoppers ask for ideas, browse and build multi-item baskets, shop for food, and check out, according to OpenAI.\nThe deal deepens OpenAI’s existing enterprise partnership with Target. Target will now roll out ChatGPT Enterprise across its 18,000 employees at its headquarters to be used for things like better supply chain forecasting and streamlining store processes. Target will also further integrate OpenAI’s models into digital tools that power everything from employee support and customer service to AI-driven shopping assistants and personalized gift finders.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n",

The firm also has a $15 billion fund to invest in AI anchored by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Capital. TWG previously invested in a partnership with Elon Musk’s xAI and Palantir to sell AI agents to enterprises.  \nNow it’s backing Lambda, which operates a number of U.S. AI data centers. Lambda is a CoreWeave competitor, although it also sells its “AI factories” to hyperscaler clouds. Earlier this month, Lambda announced a multibillion-dollar deal to supply Microsoft with AI infrastructure using tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs. (Nvidia is an investor in Lambda as well.) \nRemember that Microsoft had a similar deal with CoreWeave and had bought about $1 billion worth of services from the company in 2024, its largest customer last year by a mile. Then OpenAI swooped in and signed a $12 billion deal with CoreWeave in March. \nMeanwhile, deal watchers have been talking for months about Lambda looking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars at a valuation north of $4 billion. There was also talk of an IPO. Prior to this, Lambda raised a $480 million Series D in February, with an estimated valuation of $2.5 billion, according to PitchBook.  \nLambda’s $1.5 billion raise far outstrips those earlier whispers of what it was seeking. Whether its valuation also soared, we can’t confirm and Lambda declined to comment on that.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Venture\n",

Once they turn 16, they will be able to access their old account as they left it.\nIt will be a challenge, however, for Meta to determine which users are under the age of 16, since people aren’t always truthful about their age when signing up for social media services. But digital age checks are notoriously difficult to execute in a manner that’s safe and effective. Identity verification services are high-profile targets for hacks, and the implications of even a minor security vulnerability are severe, since personal information and government documents can be exposed.\nIdentity verification platforms have already proven problematic for users’ security. Last year, 404 Media found that AU10TIX, a company that verifies the identity of users on TikTok, Uber, and X, had left administrative credentials exposed online for over a year, which allowed users’ sensitive information to be exposed.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n",

Semrush had a market capitalization of about $1 billion as of Tuesday’s close.\nBy acquiring Semrush, Adobe is betting that companies will choose to invest in optimizing their content and webpages to be more visible to AI tools, as people increasingly use AI chatbots, agents, and AI browsers to do everything from getting the news and finding recipes to shopping and booking their travel. This is a fresh, big market for existing search engine optimization players like Semrush, particularly as this change in consumer behavior drives increasing traffic to websites from generative AI tools.\nIndeed, as of October, traffic to retail websites from generative AI chatbots increased 1,200% compared to a year earlier, per Adobe Analytics data.\nSemrush has been investing in what it calls “generative engine optimization,” and recently launched a tool for tracking and improving website performance using both traditional SEO techniques and optimization for AI engines, like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Grok, and Perplexity.\n“Brand visibility is being reshaped by generative AI, and brands that don’t embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe’s Digital Experience Business. “With Semrush, we’re unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.”\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Commerce\n",

Boasberg pointed to apps like TikTok as evidence that Meta has competition.\n“The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly,” Boasberg wrote in his memorandum opinion. “While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Government & Policy\n",

    "body": "\nGoogle Maps is rolling out new features designed to help users save time and feel more prepared, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tool. The navigation app is also launching an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature.\nNow, when users search for places in Maps like restaurants, hotels, or concert venues, they’ll see a new “know before you go” tips section that will surface important information about the place. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, what secret menu items are, what the best place to park is, and more. Users can click on each tip to get more information.\nThis “know before you go” tips section is rolling out now in the U.S. on Android and iOS.\nImage Credits:Google\nAs for the updated Explore tab, Google has made it easier and faster to find trending spots near you. Users can now swipe up to see trending and popular restaurants, activities, and sights nearby, such as a new cafe that just opened up or a quirky art gallery around the corner.\nThe tech giant says it’s now also easier to find curated lists from sources like Viator, Lonely Planet, and OpenTable, in addition to local influencers.\nThe updated Explore tab starts rolling out this month globally on Android and iOS.\nImage Credits:Google\nAdditionally, the company announced that EV drivers can now see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination by searching for “EV chargers” in Maps. Google is using AI to analyze historical and real-time charger availability to predict how many chargers are likely to be free upon arrival. \nEV charger availability predictions start rolling out next week on Android Auto and cars with Google built-in.\nGoogle is also making it possible for users to leave reviews under a nickname, such as “Eager Elf” or “Julia Loves Sweets.” Reviews are still associated with a Google Account behind the scenes, so users can only leave one review per business. This prevents them from swapping out nicknames to leave the business a series of bad reviews — a practice known as review bombing.  \nWednesday’s announcement follows Google Maps’ recent integration of Gemini, which lets users ask about points of interest along their route, get answers on topics like sports or news, and perform tasks such as adding events to their calendar. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The university will open its own probe into Summers’s connections with Epstein, reports the student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson. The university newspaper also reported that Summers will step back from public commitments. \nHis departure comes a day after both the House and the Senate voted to release the Epstein files. Over the past few days, a House panel released years of email exchanges between Epstein and Summers, including one in which Summers asked for advice about pursuing a relationship with a woman he described as a mentee. \nIn the exchanges, which took place between November 2018 and July 2019, Summers – who was married at the time – seemed to acknowledge his position of power over the woman he was mentoring. \n“She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it,” Summers wrote in a March 2019 email to Epstein. Epstein, who referred to himself early on in the exchanges as Summers’s “wing man,” told him in a June 2019 text: “She is doomed to be with you.”\nLater in the messages, Summers wrote that his “best shot” at getting his mentee to ostensibly sleep with him was that the woman found him “invaluable and interesting” and that “she can’t have it without romance/sex.” Throughout June, Epstein urged him to play the “long game” and keep the woman in a “forced holding pattern.” \nEpstein was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nSwedish vibe coding unicorn Lovable has doubled its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $200 million in just four months, co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said on stage at the 2025 Slush technology conference in Helsinki, Finland.\nThe milestone comes just four months after the year-old company surpassed $100 million in ARR in July.\nOsika credited the AI-assisted coding software maker’s decision not to move to Silicon Valley as the main reason for its success thus far. Osika said Lovable decided to stay in Europe despite getting a lot of early advice that the company would only be successful if it left the region and relocated to the U.S.\n“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country’. There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”\nHe added that the fact that the AI market in Europe is not as high-paced as the market in Silicon Valley has worked to his company’s benefit.\nThe company “flipped the script” by bringing strong talent from Silicon Valley companies like Notion and Gusto to work in-person in Stockholm, investor Zhenya Loginov, a partner at Accel, said. \nOsika also credited the company’s open-source community for continuing to improve its technology.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We just see all of these people in the community driving forward,” Osika said. “They’ve been active voices on Discord for, I think, the last 1,000 hours, debating some kind of WordPress operation. That was powering what we’re doing.”\nLovable’s milestone comes as vibe coding continues to gobble up venture capital and see soaring traction among users. Last week AI-coding assistant Cursor announced it raised $2.3 billion in a new funding round that valued the company at $29.3 billion in a round Accel also helped lead.\nLovable has raised more than $225 million in venture funding since it was founded a year ago. The startup most recently raised a $200 million Series A round in July led by Accel in addition to more than 20 other investors. That round valued the company at $1.8 billion.\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

The social network said it will also give users badges for controlling their TikTok usage.\nThe company is redesigning its screen time management page and adding new features to it. These include an affirmation journal with more than 120 positive prompts that let users set your intent for the day, a sound generator that can play calming sounds like rain or ocean waves, and a breathing exercise module. The company said that the page will also feature content from creators who talk about limiting screen time, using parental tools, and customizing their feeds.\nTikTok is also debuting new badges to reward people who use the platform within limits, especially teens. The company said it reviewed academic literature on digital well-being and found that overly restrictive tools can have a negative effect on teens.\nImage Credits: TikTok\nTo earn these badges, users need to complete different missions. Users can complete the sleep hours mission by avoiding using the platform at night. They can also use the new meditation tools to get a badge. TikTok is also rewarding people who set a daily screen time limit and use the app within those bounds with a badge. There are other badges for viewing the weekly screen time report and inviting others to complete these missions.\nThe company said that during its early testing, it observed that more people visited the new well-being screen compared to the previous version of the screen time menu, with the affirmation journal being the most popular tool.\nTikTok said it will display a link to these tools when someone is using the app at night or when they hit their daily screen time limit.\nThe company launched new parental control tools in July, giving guardians the ability to block certain accounts and get notifications when teens upload a public video or a story. In the past month, tech companies including Meta, YouTube, OpenAI, and Discord, have added new safety tools with an aim to increase teen safety.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nThe Internet today has a new worry. Alongside vibe coding tools, and the codebases, sites and apps built with them, security issues and blind spots have proliferated, too.\nCybersecurity company Guardio is taking aim at a fresh market born amid this flux: finding malicious code written using AI tools. The company says it has found that with AI tools, malicious actors now find it easier than ever to build scam and phishing sites as well as the infrastructure needed to run them. \nNow, Guardio is leveraging its experience building browser extensions and apps that scan for malicious and phishing sites to build a tool that looks for artifacts in code and websites made with vibe coding tools.\nIt’s already found a buyer. Earlier this month, Lovable announced a partnership with Guardio to scan all websites made on its platform and weed out the ones that may pose threats to users. The deal came after a report highlighted that several sites built on Lovable had gaping security holes.\n“Everyone is racing for innovation and market capture. But security is kind of an afterthought. And not many AI tools are partnering with any cybersecurity company to make sure that content generated on their platform is secured and used for good,” Michael Vainshtein, the startup’s CTO, told TechCrunch.\nTo fund its expansion, the company has raised $80 million in a new institutional funding round led by ION Crossover Partners. Existing backers Union Tech Ventures, Vintage Investment Partners, and Emerge also invested.\nImage Credits: Guardio\nGuardio, founded in 2018 by Vainshtein, CEO Amos Peled, and chief architect Daniel Sirota, did not disclose its exact valuation, but it did say that it has tripled its valuation since its previous fundraise: a $47 million round led by Tiger Global in 2021. The company, however, said it doesn’t consider itself a unicorn yet.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGuardio started out as a browser extension that would monitor malicious sites and alert users about data leaks. Since then, it has added phishing protection, and built mobile apps that offer identity management, spam filtering, and scam protection. The company says today it has 500,000 paying users, and claims it reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue this year. \nGuardio is also launching new visibility features to tell users more about what documents they have shared publicly, and if they have any sensitive information, along with notifying you of accounts that don’t have multi-factor authentication. The startup said these features are based on enterprise Data Loss Prevention and SaaS Security Posture Management products.\n“We use so many services, and our data is so fragmented with so many security settings to deal with. We feel every consumer is an enterprise in itself,” Vainshtein said. “While we don’t want them to become security officers of their accounts, we want to offer capabilities of visibility into their accounts that enterprises have.”\nThe startup said it is working to let users plug its tool into Outlook and Facebook to surface more details on the security risks users might face in relation to these accounts.\nPeled noted that next year, the startup plans to bring some of the new visibility features to its free subscription plan.\nGilad Shany, founder and partner at ION Crossover, said that the investment firm had been monitoring the company for years, and even though Guardio was not actively fundraising, ION started a conversation with the company last year.\n“We have been investors in both the cyber and consumer markets, and have had multiple successful IPOs and exits. Guardio is the first company we invest in at the intersection of these two markets – having a team that can lead best-in-class cyber product innovation, while having intimate knowledge about how to scale a direct-to-consumer business,” Shany said.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOn Wednesday, Spotify announced new features designed to showcase the people behind users’ favorite music, including producers, engineers, songwriters, background vocalists, and more. The company will also release tools that show how songs are connected and what inspired them.\nThe second set of tools is showcased in a new, interactive feature called SongDNA, which shows which songs are being sampled in a given track, who has covered the tune, and what other projects the song’s collaborators may have been involved in.\n\nTechCrunch reported in October that Spotify was developing the SongDNA feature as a way to help users discover music through a song’s credits, after references to the feature were spotted in the app’s code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong. With SongDNA, Spotify users could explore the other projects that the artists, musicians, and others who worked on a track are involved with. \nPreviously, the Song Credits feature had only featured the topline performance, songwriting, and production credits.\nReferences to the sampled music, meanwhile, come from the online community-built database WhoSampled, which Spotify has acquired. Notably, the streaming service TIDAL also offers interactive credits that let users explore music through the contributors behind the songs.\n\nSpotify has also planned a feature called “About the song,” which will allow listeners to explore swipeable cards in the “Now Playing” view. Those cards will offer details like what inspired the song, the stories behind the music, the cultural impact, and more. These stories are sourced from third-party resources, which will be linked in the cards.\nThis type of background information about music is something Spotify has offered in previous years, when it partnered with lyrics site Genius on a feature that offered details on certain tracks’ backstories. However, that feature was limited to those stories Genius had in its database. The upcoming feature will link out to various places on the web, screenshots show, including informational sites like Wikipedia, as well as news sites.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nSpotify says the expanded Song Credits will roll out starting Wednesday on mobile devices and will come to desktop in the months ahead.\nSongDNA and About the Song will only be available to Premium subscribers. However, these features won’t launch until early next year, initially as Spotify for Artists Preview. This will allow those involved with the music to have a chance to preview the features first and ensure the credits are accurate before they’re made available to the wider public. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nThe Trump administration announced Tuesday it would provide Constellation Energy with a $1 billion loan to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island.\nThe energy company said last year it would reopen the reactor, which had been shuttered since 2019, after Microsoft committed to purchasing all the electricity from the 835 megawatt power plant for two decades. Constellation estimated the project would cost $1.6 billion, and it expects to complete the refurbishment in 2028. \nTerms of Microsoft’s deal with Constellation weren’t disclosed. Analysts at Jefferies have estimated the tech company might be paying about $110 to $115 per megawatt-hour over 20 years of the deal. \nThat’s cheaper than a brand-new nuclear power plant would cost, but it’s a hefty premium over wind, solar, and geothermal, according to a comparison of energy costs from Lazard. Even wind and solar projects outfitted with utility-scale batteries to enable 24/7 power are cheaper.\nNonetheless, tech companies have recently fallen in love with nuclear as power demands for their data centers and AI efforts have skyrocketed. This summer, Microsoft competitor Meta signed its own deal with Constellation, buying the “clean energy attributes” of a 1.1 gigawatt nuclear power plant in Illinois.\nThe reactor at Three Mile Island that’s being restarted isn’t the infamous Unit 2, which melted down in 1979. Rather, it’s Unit 1, which was commissioned in 1974 and taken offline in 2019 as cheap natural gas eroded its profitability.\nThe debt facility is being made through the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which was formed under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to foster the growth of clean energy technologies.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe LPO is most famous for its loan to Solyndra, a U.S. solar startup that went belly-up during the Great Recession. Overall, though, experts consider the LPO a success, with a default rate of 3.3% after recoveries. Tesla, for instance, received a $465 million loan under the program in 2010 and paid it back by 2013.\nLast month, the LPO finalized a $1.6 billion loan to American Electric Power, using federal dollars to support the upgrade of around 5,000 miles of transmission lines.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, which passed during the Biden administration, created another pot of money under the LPO known as the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment program.  That program was created to restore existing power plants to operation provided they avoid or reduce pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration kept it largely in tact, rebranding it the Energy Dominance Financing Program.\nIn its press release, the Department of Energy, perhaps erroneously, says the the EDF Program was created under the Working Families Tax Cut Act. It was instead authorized under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. \n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nShivi Sharma spent a decade working in credit risk at places like American Express and Varo Bank.  \nAt some point, she realized teams were spending equal amounts of time analyzing all types of loans — regardless of whether it was worth $100,000 or $5 million — meaning assessing smaller loans was ultimately an unprofitable and time-consuming process for lenders.  \nShe and her husband, Utsav Shah, realized there was an opportunity here.  \n“She watched as the vast majority of small business owners couldn’t access the capital they needed to grow, simply because the economics didn’t work for banks,” Shah told TechCrunch.  \n“Between our skills in building AI-powered decision-making systems at scale and our expertise in credit risk and fraud risk assessments in banking in financial services, we realized we could apply next-gen AI agent workflows to solve this decades-old problem,” he continued. \nThe married couple decided to launch Kaaj in 2024, a company that helps automate credit risk analysis so that underwriting no longer takes days, but minutes. Kaaj said it’s processed more than $5 billion worth of loan applications, with clients including Amur Equipment Finance and Fundr. The company announced on Wednesday a $3.8 million seed round from Kindred Ventures and Better Tomorrow Ventures.  \nThe product works like this: A small business applies for a loan, submitting all the needed documents (like financial statements, bank statements, and tax returns) — typically, when this happens, underwriters spend days manually verifying all this information and logging it into their Loan Origination System (LOS).  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nKaaj uses AI to identify, classify, verify, and organize information into LOS. It also runs assessments to check for document tampering for the underwriter fraud team. It integrates into existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Microsoft and even shows a lender if a business is meeting the criteria of a lender’s policy.  \n“This allows a team processing 500 applications monthly to handle 20,000 applications with the same staff, making smaller loans economically viable,” Shah, the company’s CEO, said.  \nThe hope is that more small businesses will be able to access loans from banks because it becomes more cost-efficient for a bank to investigate them.  \nOthers in the market include Middesk, Ocrolus, and MoneyThumb. Sharma hopes that Kaaj will stand out from the competition by automating the entire credit analysis process rather than parts of it.  \n“We do this by deploying agentic AI workflows that mimic their teams, to help lenders analyze end-to-end loan packages,” she said.  \nThe fresh capital will be used to help accelerate product development and expand across independent and small business lenders. “We’re focused on enhancing our AI agent capabilities, expanding our module offerings, and scaling our customer base of lenders and brokers beyond our current footprint.”  \nOverall, Shah and Sharma hope Kaaj can in some ways “revolutionize” small business lending, bringing automation to what is still a very paper-heavy process.  \n“By automating the science of credit analysis, we free up human underwriters to focus on the art of deal-making and subjective assessment, which is their true competitive advantage,” he said.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJenny Button first thought of Emm during the COVID lockdown. She was using an Oura ring and the Whoop monitoring band and getting insights about her body, but there wasn’t a device that could provide data about one of the most important aspects — reproductive and menstrual health.  \n“It seemed crazy to me, because these are things that every woman wants to be able to track and better understand,” she told TechCrunch. She thought to herself: Why not make a wearable device that can tell someone more about their reproductive health? She penned a letter to one of the engineers at Dyson, made a connection, and started testing the idea.  \n“Five years later, following thousands of designs and iterations and extended user testing, we’ve revealed the world’s first smart menstrual cup,” said Button.  \nThe UK-based company has also raised a $9 million (£6.8 million)  seed round, one led by Lunar Ventures as it prepares to officially launch its product next year.  \nThe product functions like a regular menstrual cup — designed to store period blood rather than absorb it. But Emm’s medical-grade silicone is “fitted with ultra-thin, advanced sensor technology.” This sensor gathers data that will help users understand patterns about their cycles. Button hopes that it could “transform the research, diagnosis and treatment of menstrual and reproductive health conditions.”  \nShe isn’t the only one who thinks this way. Other femtech founders told The Guardian a few months ago that menstrual blood was an “overlooked opportunity in women’s health” that could offer insights not available from health tests based on circulatory blood. \nIt could, for instance, help diagnose painful and often misdiagnosed medical conditions like endometriosis.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“One in ten women today suffer from endometriosis,” Button said. “A condition that, like many others in reproductive health, takes an average of seven to ten years to diagnose.” \nThat delay “is largely due to the lack of meaningful data and poor characterization of menstrual health in clinical settings,” Button believes. “There have been no reliable tools to accurately and objectively track that aspect of health until now.” \nBeyond endometriosis, she added that one in three women experiences “severe reproductive health issues” throughout their lives.  \nData gathered from the Emm app is encrypted and stored securely, with two-factor authentication. “It’s also always anonymized or pseudonymized,” meaning personal identifiers are removed or replaced with codes, “and will only be accessed by the people at Emm who genuinely need it,” she said. \nButton used the word “strategic” to describe her funding round and said she connected with her lead investor through her network. Others in the round include Alumni Ventures (who backed Oura), The Labcorp Venture Fund and BlueLion Global. Money will be used to launch the product into the UK market next year, she said, adding that the waitlist has already topped 30,000 pre-orders to go live soon.  \nCapital will also be used for research and development. Button hopes to enter the U.S. market in early 2027.  \n“Menstrual health is only the jumping off point for Emm,” said Button. “Ultimately, I believe we will have a profound impact on women’s health more broadly,” she continued, adding she hopes to expand the product one day, perhaps into diagnosis, other digital care tools, and even therapeutics.  \n“Our mission is to accelerate diagnosis, equip people with the data to advocate for themselves, and ultimately help them take control of their own bodies and health journeys,” she said. \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTikTok, an app that was once just a place for user-generated content, is launching a new setting that lets users choose how much AI-generated content they want to see in their “For You” feed. The company is also introducing more advanced labeling technologies for AI-generated content.\nThe new AI-generated content (AIGC) control is rolling out within the app’s “Manage Topics” tool, which lets users choose what they see on TikTok. \n“Manage Topics already enables people to adjust how often they see content related to over 10 categories like Dance, Sports, and Food & Drinks,” TikTok explained in a blog post. “Like those controls, the AIGC setting is intended to help people tailor the diverse range of content in their feed, rather than removing or replacing content in feeds entirely.” \nThe move comes as companies like OpenAI and Meta are embracing AI-only feeds. In September, Meta released Vibes, a new feed for sharing and creating short AI-generated videos. A few days after Meta’s launch, OpenAI released Sora, a social media platform for creating and sharing AI-generated videos. \nSince Sora’s launch, realistic AI-generated videos have been posted to TikTok. Additionally, many TikTok users are leveraging AI to create visuals for posts about other topics, like history or celebrities.\nTikTok says that with the new AI-generated content control, users who want to see less of this sort of content can now dial things down, while those who enjoy it can choose to see more of it.\nImage Credits:TikTok\nYou can access the new capability by going into your Settings, selecting “Content Preferences” and then clicking the “Manage Topics” option. Then, you can move the slider for different topics, including AI-generated content, to adjust how much you do or don’t want to see that sort of content in your For You feed.\nThe change is rolling out in the coming weeks, TikTok says. \nTo improve its ability to label AI-generated content, TikTok is now testing a technology called “invisible watermarking.” \nTikTok already requires people to label realistic AI-generated content and uses a cross-industry technology called Content Credentials from C2PA, which embeds metadata into content that lets it and other platforms know when something is AI-generated. However, TikTok notes that these labels can be removed when content is reuploaded or edited on other platforms.\nWith the new “invisible watermarks,” TikTok will add another layer of safeguards by using a watermark that only it can read. That means it’ll be harder for others to remove it.\nTikTok will start adding invisible watermarks to AI-generated content made with TikTok tools like AI Editor Pro. It’s also adding them to content uploaded with C2PA’s Content Credentials. The company says these watermarks will help it label content more reliably. TikTok notes that it will continue reading C2PA’s Content Credentials and add them to AI-generated content made on its platform.\nRelated to these efforts, TikTok also announced that it’s launching a $2 million AI literacy fund aimed at experts, like the nonprofit Girls Who Code, to create content that teaches people about AI literacy and safety.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nYouTube TV subscribers unhappy about going more than a week without ESPN, ABC, and other Disney networks will be getting a $20 credit that can be applied to their next billing statement.\nVariety first reported on the credit, and a YouTube spokesperson confirmed the news to TechCrunch. The company says the credits are rolling out now, with subscribers receiving emailed instructions about how to apply it.\nDisney’s channels were pulled from the subscription TV service on October 31. YouTube says that if it reaches a deal, those channels will be restored within a matter of hours. As with similar disputes, this one appears to revolve around pricing, with YouTube criticizing Disney’s supposed price hike and Disney saying YouTube is “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.”\nThe subscription TV service’s last dispute with Disney was in 2022, leading YouTube TV to offer customers a $15 credit after Disney programming was removed for a day. \n",

Another potential upgrade, first reported by The Information, could improve 5G networks by allowing them to connect to satellites for increased coverage.\nThe basic features would be free, Gurman says, with customers paying carriers for more advanced support. In addition, Apple’s satellite partner Globalstar reportedly needs to improve its infrastructure to support these upgrades, which Apple is helping to finance.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Hardware\n",

    "body": "\nVenmo on Monday introduced a new rewards program, Venmo Stash, offering cash back to customers who transact with their favorite brands on the payments app and engage with Venmo’s products. \nWhile cashback rewards are a common incentive for credit cards, Venmo’s rewards — which can be up to 5% — are returned to Venmo’s Mastercard Debit Card.\nThe program is designed to incentivize continued use of Venmo’s service by bringing more funds into the ecosystem, the company explains. \nHowever, this program also represents a new way that today’s brands are attempting to reach younger users, many of whom have shown a preference for debit cards over credit cards.\nOne 2024 study cited by eMarketer indicated that only 39% of Gen Z users reported frequent credit card use, compared with 51% for older generations. Another Morning Consult survey for Cash App Afterpay from earlier this year noted that 63% of Gen Z users said they favored debit cards over other payment methods. \nAs a result, payment providers and retailers are looking to accommodate younger consumers by rolling out more debit rewards and by offering alternatives at checkout — like the use of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services such as Affirm, PayPal Pay Later, or Klarna.\nIn Venmo’s case, the program is designed to offer larger rewards as customers interact more with Venmo products. This keeps them invested in the Venmo ecosystem, the company believes. \nIt also competes with other cashback incentives offered by Venmo’s rivals, like Cash App’s offers, which are doled out to its own Cash App debit Card customers.  \nScreenshotImage Credits:Venmo\nInitially, customers earn 1% cash back for their Venmo Debit Mastercard when they spend their Venmo balance. Rewards grow to 2% when customers turn on auto reloads to keep their balance replenished automatically. And customers are able to earn 5% cash back when they receive Direct Deposits on Venmo each month. \nHowever, instead of offering a certain percentage back by spending category, like groceries, gas, or dining, Venmo’s program has customers pick from curated bundles of their favorite brands. For instance, you could pick a group of brands that includes McDonald’s, TikTok Shop, Uber, and Uber Eats, or one that offers Amazon, DoorDash, Domino’s, and Walgreens. \nThe PayPal-owned company says that, next year, the Venmo Stash will expand to offer customers rewards when they pay with Venmo at merchants within its nationwide network. \n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nGoogle Maps is adding new AI features, including a builder agent and an MCP server — a tool that connects AI assistants to Google Maps’ technical documentation — to help developers and users create interactive projects using Maps data and code. The company said it is using Gemini models across the board to power these features.\nAmong these new tools, the builder agent is a tool that, just like many other coding tools, lets you describe the kind of interactive map-based prototype you want to build in text and creates one for you. For instance, you can type “create a Street View tour of a city,” “create a map visualizing real-time weatherin my region,” or “list pet-friendly hotels in the city.”\nOnce the code is generated, you can export it, test the preview project using your own API keys as needed, or modify the project in Firebase Studio.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe same tool also has a styling agent that lets users create a customized map to match a particular style format or theme. This could help brands create maps with specific color coding.\nGoogle already provides map data grounding via the Gemini API. The company is now introducing a similar feature, called Grounding Lite, which allows developers to ground their own AI models using Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that lets AI assistants connect to external data sources.\nWith this feature, AI assistants can answer questions like, “How far is the nearest grocery store?” The company is also shipping Contextual View, a low-code Google Maps component that can provide visual understanding to users for such questions. The feature can show a list, a map view, or a 3D display as an answer.\nImage Credits: Google\nGoogle is also adding a code assistant toolkit, the MCP server, which connects with Google Maps’ documentation. Developers can use this connection to get answers about how to use the Google Maps API and data. Last month, the company launched extensions for Gemini’s command line tool to let developers access Maps data. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage credits: Google\nThe company is also trying to add more Gemini-powered features for Maps on the consumer side. Last week, it enabled users to use Gemini hands-free with Maps for navigation. For users in India, Google added incident alerts and speed limit data to the Maps app in select areas.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nNearly seven years after announcing its first fund, Sapphire Sport—the venture fund focused on sports, media, and entertainment—is spinning out from Sapphire Ventures. The fund will rebrand as an independent venture firm, 359 Capital.\nThe firm’s new name is a tribute to the sub-four-minute mile, a feat once deemed humanly impossible but ultimately achieved through rigorous dedication and perseverance. Spirito said that the name reflects the firm’s core principle of helping its portfolio founders achieve the impossible.\nThe separation from Sapphire Ventures, an investment firm with about $11 billion in assets under management, was always on “the vision board,” said Michael Spirito, managing partner and co-founder of 359 Capital. “We’re all grown up and ready to leave home.”\nSapphire Sport, which is currently halfway through investing its second fund of $181 million, has always maintained a separate group of limited partners from Sapphire Ventures. Its LPs are all deeply tied to the sports industry, including major names like City Football Group, adidas, AEG, Madison Square Garden, Sinclair, and dozens of team owners.\n“When we started in 2019, the name Sapphire Sport wasn’t just alliterative and sounded cool,” Spirito said. “Sport captured the LP group.”\nSeven years later, the sports-focused LPs still leverage their relationship with the firm to gain insights into emerging tech companies across the media and sports landscape, Spirito said.\nSome of the startups 359 Capital has backed include Beehiiv, a creator-focused newsletter; an online casino; Betty Labs, a sports media platform; Overtime, an AI search engine; Perplexity, a successful AI browser; and Tonal, a home gym system.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm’s entire portfolio of 30 companies and all of its investment staff will move over to 359 Capital. The transitioning staff includes Spirito, co-founders of Sapphire Ventures, David Hartwig and Doug Higgins, and newly promoted partner Rico Mallozzi.\nAs 359 Capital, the firm will continue to focus primarily on Series A and Series B startups, writing checks between $2 million to $10 million.

    "body": "\nAmazon Music announced on Monday the launch of “Fan Groups,” a new beta feature that lets users create and join groups based on their favorite genres and artists. The feature allows fans to chat, post, and listen to songs shared within these groups.\nThe feature is currently being tested in Canada on iOS and Android devices.\nUsers can access Fan Groups through the “Find” tab located beneath the search bar at the top of the app. From there, they can explore over 30 different groups dedicated to various musical interests, ranging from indie rock and country to Punjabi and K-pop, according to a company blog post.\nGroup members can create new posts, participate in ongoing chat threads, and share or save recommended songs. Users can also stream music without leaving the conversation or the group — they can simply tap the play button at the top to listen to all the songs added, or navigate to the separate “Music” tab next to “Posts.”\nNotably, artists can join these groups, giving them a new way to connect with fans directly. They can share exclusive content, interact more personally, and build stronger communities with their supporters.\nImage Credits:Amazon Music\nAnyone can set up a new group, and administrators can mute members and delete messages, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. Users can report content and can block other members if needed. \nThis new feature represents Amazon’s strategy to compete with Spotify, which has been working to engage users through various social features. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSpotify introduced a messaging feature in August and also a “Jam” feature that enables users to co-create playlists with friends and listen to songs together. \nSoundCloud also offers a commenting feature and has recently updated its platform to include new social functionalities, such as playlists based on what friends are listening to and a direct messaging tool for artists. Another platform, Stationhead, allows users to listen to music together during live streaming parties.\nFan Groups is set to roll out to customers in the U.S. and other markets beginning next year.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nAfter Tesla shareholders approved a new compensation package that could be worth $1 trillion, CEO Elon Musk appears to be celebrating with a normal weekend on his social media platform X.\nIn an early Saturday morning post with the surely coincidental timestamp of 4:20am EST, Musk posted a video generated by Grok Imagine, the new photo and video tool from his company xAI. \nAs Musk described it, the video was generated by his prompt, “She smiles and says, ‘I will always love you.’” And the video does, in fact, show an animated woman on a rainy street, saying those words in an obviously synthetic voice.\n\nTwenty-four minutes later, Musk posted a Grok-generated video of the actress Sydney Sweeney saying, in a distinctly un-Sydney-Sweeney-like voice, “You are so cringe.”\nWhile it’s increasingly common to see people being weird about AI-generated women and even forming romantic relationships with chatbots, many X users pounced on the “always love you” video in particular, with one describing it as “the most divorced post of all time” and another calling it “the saddest post in the history of this website.”\nRemarkably, neither of those was the most stinging critique of Musk posted to X this weekend. Instead, the prize goes to 87-year-old, award-winning author Joyce Carol Oates.\nResponding to an impressively labyrinthine series of posts in which one user approvingly quoted Musk firing back at a Texas state senator who criticized his compensation package, Oates wrote that it’s “so curious” that Musk “never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates,” whether that’s posting about friends, relatives, nature, pets, movies, music, or books.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“In fact he seems totally uneducated, uncultured,” she wrote. “The poorest persons on Twitter may have access to more beauty & meaning in life than the ‘most wealthy person in the world.’”\nTo which Musk simply responded, “Oates is a liar and delights in being mean. Not a good human.”\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nA recent letter from OpenAI reveals more details about how the company is hoping the federal government can support the company’s ambitious plans for data center construction.\nThe letter — from OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane and addressed to the White House’s director of science and technology policy Michael Kratsios — argued that the government should consider expanding the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (AMIC) beyond semiconductor fabrication to cover electrical grid components, AI servers, and AI data centers.\nThe AMIC is a 35% tax credit that was included in the Biden administration’s Chips Act.\n“Broadening coverage of the AMIC will lower the effective cost of capital, de-risk early investment, and unlock private capital to help alleviate bottlenecks and accelerate the AI build in the US,” Lehane wrote.\nOpenAI’s letter also called for the government to accelerate the permitting and environmental review process for these projects, and to create a strategic reserve of raw materials — such as copper, alumimum, and processed rare earth minerals — needed to build AI infrastructure.\nThe company first published its letter on October 27, but it didn’t get much press attention until this week, when comments by OpenAI executives prompted broader discussion about what the company wants from the Trump administration.\nAt a Wall Street Journal event on Wednesday, CFO Sarah Friar said the government should “backstop” OpenAI’s infrastructure loans, though she later posted on LinkedIn that she misspoke:  “OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments. I used the word ‘backstop’ and it muddied the point.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCEO Sam Altman also weighed in, writing that OpenAI does not “have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.”\n“We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market,” he wrote, though he said the company had discussed loan guarantees “as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US.”\nIn the same post, Altman wrote that the company expects to end 2025 “above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030,” and he said OpenAI has made $1.4 trillion in capital commitments for the next eight years.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "body": "\nAutonomous vehicles are having a moment, and it’s making it a lot easier for smaller companies to raise money.  Vay, a German startup offering remote-controlled rental cars, will get $60 million in cash from Singaporean tech heavyweight Grab, the company announced on Monday.\nThe deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of the year, may be followed by “an additional $350M as joint milestones are achieved within the first year,” Vay CEO Thomas von der Ohe wrote on LinkedIn.\nThe Berlin-based startup uses its technology and human operators to remotely drive rental cars to and from customers. Vay isn’t yet commercially deployed in real traffic in Germany, where it lacked regulatory clarity until recently, but the company is currently operational in Las Vegas, where it in January 2024. Vay now plans to use Grab’s investments to scale and expand its operations in the U.S.\nVay will need to hit certain milestones in the US to unlock additional investment from Grab, including number of U.S. cities covered, regulatory approvals obtained, and overall consumer revenue.\nThe U.S. is seeing increased competition and fast-expanding offerings of various forms of remote driving. For instance, Alphabet-owned Waymo recently announced it would deploy its robotaxi service in Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego. \nAlthough publicly traded on the Nasdaq, Grab does not operate in the U.S., where it will limit itself to supporting Vay’s growth. \nHowever, Vay describes driverless car rental as complementary to robotaxis. As for Grab, it sees Vay as serving “a growing segment of consumers who prefer not to be car owners,” Grab cofounder and CEO Anthony Tan said in a press release.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nVay’s customers may not be car owners, but they still need a driving license: once the car gets delivered, the user takes over and drives it like a regular car. But unlike their own car, they don’t need to find where to park it. Vay says its service costs about half the price of ride-hailing, thanks to this hybrid approach and hardware-light system.\nAt the same time, the two companies plan to explore synergies between Vay’s and Grab’s business in Southeast Asia. Calling itself “the everyday everything app,” Grab’s ubiquitous super-app offers ​​all-in-one taxi, ride hailing, transport, express grocery shopping and food delivery options, as well as digital payments and financial services.\nWith a growing interest in mobility, Grab recently invested in autonomous driving tech startups including May Mobility out of the U.S. and WeRide out of China. The synergies it finds with Vay may well be on the tech side — for instance, it said that driving data collected by Vay could accelerate the training of AI models to improve autonomous driving.\nThis also aligns with Vay’s vision to become more than an electric rental car fleet. The company has already expanded into commercial and business-to-business services, and closed a partnership with self-driving truck company Kodiak Robotics. Ultimately, it aims to build a “global remote driving platform,” von der Ohe told TechCrunch earlier this year.\nAccording to Crunchbase, Vay had raised $131.8 million from backers including Kinnevik, Coatue, Eurazeo, Atomico, General Catalyst, Creandum, and the European Investment Bank. If fully unlocked, Grab’s investment would be a significant turbo. But with Nvidia announcing plans to invest $500 million into British self-driving tech startup Wayve, the race is only starting.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nFive years ago, when Miles “Deuce” McBride moved to New York as a 20-year-old rookie playing for the Knicks, he found the transition to a big city overwhelming and struggled to find the right crowd.\n“When I got up here, everybody on my team was married with kids or just kind of loners,” he told TechCrunch, reflecting on his initial feelings of loneliness being the youngest player on the team. “I wish there was a way to meet people organically who have the same interests. I feel like with social media, everybody is so superficial.”\nRecognizing a common pain point for many in their twenties, McBride teamed up with veteran startup founder Joe Einhorn to create Mmotion, an app that combines elements of location tracking with social discovery features to help people find new friends based on shared interests while also recommending nearby bars, restaurants, and other social hotspots. \nImage Credits:Mmotion (Image has been modified)\nNow available in beta for users in NYC, the app diverges from traditional friendship platforms like Bumble BFF, instead competing more directly with apps like Snap Map and Find My. Instagram also recently entered the space with a new Map feature. (Mmotion’s beta will be limited to 1,000 members.)\nMmotion leverages geofencing and state tracking to follow users’ movements, highlighting people with similar interests in the vicinity. It also keeps track of where users go to recommend similar, worthwhile locations to explore. Plus, users get a private log of all their location history, acting like a personal timeline so they can easily look back on all the spots they’ve explored.\nTo access Mmotion, users must apply for a membership. Once accepted, they can enter their interests, join “Circles” or groups they’re interested in (such as those focused on hiking, attending basketball games, or visiting art galleries), and send friend requests to others nearby. The app also offers private messaging between users. \nImage Credits:Mmotion\nTo prioritize user safety, the app features encrypted location data that is only accessible to the user unless they choose to share it. Users are incognito by default, which Mmotion refers to as “Vault Mode,” and can be switched at any time. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAdditionally, if users prefer that only certain individuals on the app know their location, Mmotion offers a feature called “Personas.” This feature allows users to create up to three separate groups, enabling them to share more private locations like their home address with a select group of people while maintaining a more public persona.\n“So Miles might have [his “Deuce” Persona], which is something where it’s a bit more curated, because he’s a public figure. So it’s for all the Knicks fans to see Miles go to places he’s okay with mainstream people knowing. And then he might have a [Persona], for when he goes to a different city, and he wants to be really low-key,” Einhorn explained.\nStandard safety and moderation tools like blocking and reporting are also implemented. \nImage Credits:Mmotion\nThe app will operate on a monthly subscription model for users. While the exact pricing details weren’t disclosed, Einhorn hinted that it will be affordable, stating, “It’s not going to be more than a cup of coffee per month. It’s not going to be anything crazy.” \nPremium options offering additional features may also be available. For example, the basic tier only lets users join 5 Circles per city at a time.\nAnother aspect of the app is its offering for local businesses. By featuring restaurants, bars, coffee shops, fitness studios, and more on the map, Mmotion aims to promote small businesses while also providing them with insights into their customer base. The app aggregates data from various sources, including Google, OpenStreetMap, and Apple Maps.\nMmotion’s long-term vision is to encourage businesses to sign up for a subscription service that provides access to anonymized analytics. This service would help businesses effectively target the right customers.\nIn addition to subscription fees, the app will generate revenue through ads. \nThe launch marks McBride’s first time as a startup founder, positioning him alongside other athletes who have transitioned to entrepreneurship. Einhorn, meanwhile, is known as the founder and CEO of Fancy, a social e-commerce platform that competed with Pinterest. He also launched a luxury goods startup last year called Long Story Short.\nMmotion plans for a wider launch in the near future when there’s enough feedback from testers. It’s currently available to download on iOS and Android devices.\n",

    "body": "\nAfter helping several enterprises document how work actually happens, Scribe has raised $75 million at a $1.3 billion post-money valuation to roll out Scribe Optimize, a platform that maps workflows across the enterprise to reveal where automation and AI will actually yield returns — instead of becoming another sunk cost.\nThe all-equity Series C round was led by StepStone, with participation from existing investors Amplify Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Tiger Global, Morado Ventures, and New York Life Ventures. The new funding comes over a year after Scribe raised its $25 million Series B, capital the five-year-old startup has largely not needed to draw down, co-founder and CEO Jennifer Smith (pictured above, left) said in an exclusive interview. With this round, Scribe plans to accelerate the rollout of Scribe Optimize and related products, as enterprises struggle to determine where AI and automation will have the greatest impact.\nMany companies are racing to adopt AI, but Smith told TechCrunch that most still cannot answer a fundamental question: What should we automate first? Enterprises often try to find the answer through interviews, workshops, or by bringing in consultants, she said, approaches that take months and still miss much of what people actually do on a day-to-day basis.\n“Without really knowing how work is done, it is really hard to know where to improve it, where to automate it, where agents can help,” she said. “Scribe Optimize is all about answering that question. Very simply, it mines across workflows for what people are doing when they’re at work, and then it abstracts those up into being able to show you in a single pane of glass, here are the actual workflows that are being done. Here’s how often, how long it takes, etc.”\nFounded in 2019 by Smith and Aaron Podolny (CTO) (pictured above, right), Scribe started before the GenAI boom, and its current flagship product, Scribe Capture, helps automatically document how work is done. When someone completes a process or workflow, Capture generates a step-by-step guide using its browser extension and desktop app, along with text and screenshots. Those guides can be shared with colleagues or embedded in internal tools to reduce repeated questions, minimize errors, and expedite onboarding.\nCustomers using Scribe Capture report saving 35 to 42 hours per person per month and making new hires 40% faster, the startup said.\nThe market of process documentation includes players including Tango, Iorad, UserGuiding, and Spekit. Nonetheless, Smith told TechCrunch that Scribe competes against the status quo of people manually recording workflows.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“People are still using stopwatches to sit behind somebody and understand what this process is,” she said. “Even now, when it comes to deploying AI agents, the irony is that the process of deploying agents is incredibly manual.”\nTo date, Scribe has documented more than 10 million workflows across 40,000 software applications. The startup said that it has more than 5 million users and is used by teams inside 94% of Fortune 500 companies. Further, 78,000 organizations are its paid customers. It counts teams at New York Life, T-Mobile, LinkedIn, Hubspot, and Northern Trust among its users.\n“Users come to Scribe not because their boss tells them to, but because they want to,” Smith told TechCrunch. “It starts with the end user, and then goes up to their team lead, department lead, and then some kind of central function who are all interested in it for the question of, how do we scale, what we know, how to do, and how do we get better?”\nThe San Francisco-based startup sees the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Europe among its biggest markets after the U.S.\nScribe said it has more than doubled its revenue over the past year, though it did not disclose figures, and also said its valuation has increased fivefold since its last round. The startup currently has a headcount of 120 employees, and it plans to double that number in the next 12 months, Smith said.\n",

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Blue Origin\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4:17 PM PST · November 9, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nJeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin scrubbed the second launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket planned for Sunday afternoon due to concerns with weather, a few minor problems with launch pad equipment, and at least one cruise ship that strayed too close to the flight path. \nThe company said late Sunday that it will take another go at launching New Glenn’s second mission on Wednesday, November 12. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced restrictions on space launches late last week due to the government shutdown, and Blue Origin said in a post on X Sunday that it worked with the FAA to make the second attempt happen. The launch windo opens at 2:50 p.m. ET and lasts until 4:17 p.m. ET.\nThis mission is an important one for Blue Origin for a number of reasons. \nFor one, the company is still proving out the full reusability of the rocket. New Glenn successfully reached orbit during its first launch in January, but the booster exploded before it could land on a drone ship in the ocean. Blue Origin hopes to land the booster for the first time during this second flight.\nThis is also the first commercial mission for New Glenn. The rocket will carry NASA’s ESCAPADE spacecraft into space, where it will embark on a mission to Mars. New Glenn is also carrying a tech demonstrator for Viasat, which is part of another NASA project. Proving New Glenn can safely deliver payloads to space — and do it cost effectively thanks in large part to the rockets reusability — is crucial if Blue Origin wants to compete against Elon Musk’s SpaceX.\nBlue Origin originally planned to attempt the second launch earlier this year, but delayed it several times. Sunday’s launch window in Cape Canaveral, Florida initially opened at 2:45 p.m. ET, and the company had a window of roughly 90 minutes. The weather worries and the launch pad equipment issues caused that launch time to slip a few times.\nWith the clock running again just minutes before a launch attempt, a cruise ship entered the flight path, according to the broadcast. While that ship was expected to clear before the 4:15 p.m. ET close of the launch window, the weather was still a concern, and caused the company to scrub the attempt.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

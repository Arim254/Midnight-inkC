Tesla has avoided requests from current and prospective customers to add CarPlay capability to its infotainment system. Apple CarPlay, as well as rival Android Auto, allows drivers to project their smartphone and many of its apps onto the car’s infotainment display. Tesla is focused on the standard CarPlay and not Apple’s next-generation and more capable version called CarPlay Ultra.\nIn lieu of CarPlay or Android Auto, Tesla has added native apps for streaming music services, including Apple Music, Spotify, and Tidal. Based on user reports, the quality of those apps has been uneven. Those apps also require customers to subscribe to Tesla’s premium connectivity package, which costs $9.99 monthly or $99 annually.\nThe addition of CarPlay could entice some drivers who had written off Tesla to reconsider their decisions. Half of drivers surveyed by McKinsey a couple years ago said that they wouldn’t buy any vehicle lacking CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Transportation\n",

    "body": "\nApple on Thursday introduced a new set of App Review Guidelines for developers, which now specifically state that apps must disclose and obtain users’ permission before sharing personal data with third-party AI.\nThe change comes ahead of the iPhone maker’s plan to introduce its own AI-upgraded version of Siri in 2026.\nThat update will see Apple’s digital assistant offer users the ability to take actions across apps using Siri commands, and will be powered, in part, by Google’s Gemini technology, according to a recent Bloomberg report.\nAt the same time, Apple is ensuring other apps aren’t leaking personal data to AI providers or other AI businesses. \nWhat’s interesting about this particular update is not the requirements being described but that Apple has specifically called out AI companies as needing to come into compliance. \nBefore the revised language, the guideline known as rule 5.1.2(i) included language around disclosure and obtaining user consent for data sharing, noting that apps could not “use, transmit or share” someone’s personal data without their permission. This rule served as part of Apple’s compliance with data privacy regulations like the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), California’s Consumer Privacy Act, and others, which ensure that users have more control over how their data is collected and shared. Apps that don’t follow the policy can be removed from the App Store.\nThe newly revised guideline adds the following sentence (emphasis ours): \n\nYou must clearly disclose where personal data will be shared with third parties, including with third-party AI, and obtain explicit permission before doing so.\n\nThis change could impact apps that intend to use AI systems to collect or process information about their users, perhaps to personalize their apps or provide certain functionality. It’s unclear how stringently Apple will enforce the rule, given that the term “AI” could include a variety of technologies — not just LLMs, but also things like machine learning.\nThe updated rule is one of several revisions to the App Review Guidelines out on Thursday. Other changes are focused on supporting Apple’s new Mini Apps Program, also announced today, as well as tweaks to rules involving creator apps, loan apps, and more.\nOne addition also added crypto exchanges to the list of apps that provide services in highly regulated fields.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTikTok announced on Thursday that it’s launching “bulletin board,” a new feature that lets brands and creators share public, one-to-many messages to their followers. Bulletin board is essentially TikTok’s own version of Instagram’s broadcast channels feature that launched in 2023.\nJust like with broadcast channels on Instagram, only the creator of a bulletin board can post messages, and followers are limited to leaving emoji reactions. Bulletin boards support text, image, and video posts.\nThe feature is rolling out to creators who are at least 18 years old and have 50,000 followers. \nThe idea behind the feature is to make it easy for creators and companies to build community by sharing news and updates with their followers, as well as posting exclusive content. For instance, rather than posting updates through a Story or regular post on TikTok, creators can share them on their bulletin board. The feature also lets accounts promote their content by directly sending it to followers.\nThe launch doesn’t come as a surprise, as TikTok was spotted testing the feature in June. \nImage Credits:TikTok\nDuring the beta phase, TikTok says artists and musicians used the bulletin board to share newly released music with followers and invite them to pre-save upcoming releases. Additionally, People magazine and Paris Saint-Germain used the feature to share news and updates.\n“Just like everything on TikTok, all content must adhere to our Community Guidelines, which we enforce using a combination of technology and human moderators,” TikTok explained in a blog post. “Our safety tools for muting, blocking, and reporting users and content are available within the bulletin board to help keep communities safe and positive.”\nCreators can start a bulletin board by going to their inbox and selecting the option. They can toggle the “Show on profile” setting on or off to change the visibility of their bulletin board. Plus, they can choose a name for their bulletin board.\nTo join a bulletin board, users can click on the bulletin board’s name under the creator’s bio on their profile. Once a follower chooses to join a creator’s bulletin board, they will receive notifications in their inbox whenever that creator posts. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nJeff Bezos’ Blue Origin has landed the booster of its New Glenn mega-rocket on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean on just its second attempt — making it the second company to perform such a feat, following Elon Musk’s SpaceX.\nIt’s an accomplishment that will help the new rocket system become an option to send larger payloads to space, the moon, and beyond.\nThursday’s launch wasn’t just about the landing attempt, though. Roughly 34 minutes after takeoff, the upper stage of New Glenn successfully deployed the rocket’s first commercial payload: twin spacecraft for NASA that will travel to Mars to study the red planet’s atmosphere.\nThe pair of achievements are remarkable for the second-ever launch of such a massive rocket system. And it could put Blue Origin in position to compete with SpaceX, which dominates the world’s launch market with its Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship rockets. \nThe accomplishment is noteworthy for the broader space industry, and one that SpaceX CEO Gwynne Shotwell acknowledged via a post on social media site X with a simple “Magnificent!” Musk even offered his own congratulations shortly after. \n\nNew Glenn’s first launch was in January, and Blue Origin experienced a number of delays in getting the second rocket to launch. The company had hoped to make a second attempt as early as the spring, but pushed it back multiple times. New Glenn finally made it to the launch pad on Sunday, but weather and solar storms delayed it further.\nThe rocket finally took off from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida on Thursday at around 3:55 p.m. ET. At about four minutes into the flight, the second stage separated and headed further into space, while the New Glenn booster began its journey back toward Earth. Roughly 10 minutes into the flight, the 189-foot-tall booster touched down on the platform.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBlue Origin had attempted to bring the New Glenn booster back on the rocket’s first flight in January. But the booster exploded before it had a chance to land on the drone ship. Blue Origin worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to identify and make a number of fixes to the rocket, and the company was confident it could stick the landing on attempt number two.\nThe ability to land a booster like this is an important step in making the rocket system reusable, which lowers the cost for customers — a capability that SpaceX has mastered. Blue Origin will now have to demonstrate the ability to refurbish the rocket booster and launch it again.\nThese are crucial capabilities for commercial customers and government missions. Blue Origin has had its eyes on the moon for years, and is currently developing a lunar lander. So is SpaceX, with Starship. But the government has asked them to speed up these programs, and acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy recently criticized SpaceX for moving too slowly.\nBlue Origin CEO Dave Limp recently said in response his company “will move heaven and Earth” to help NASA get back to the moon faster. But it can’t do that without successfully proving out all of New Glenn’s capabilities.\nThursday’s launch went a long way toward accomplishing that overarching goal.  \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Sean by emailing sean.okane@techcrunch.com or via encrypted message at okane.01 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nIf there’s one thing that VCs agree on when backing AI startups, it’s that AI requires a different investment approach than prior technological shifts.\n“It’s a funky time,” said Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures, onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025. The longtime VC noted that the rules of investing have significantly shifted now that some AI companies are leaping from “zero to $100 million in revenue in a single year.”\nHowever, Lee also noted that, based on her firm’s research, Series A investors aren’t just seeking rapid revenue growth. “It’s an algorithm with different variables and different coefficients.”\nSome of the factors investors now measure, according to Lee, include whether the startup is generating data, the strength of its competitive moat, the founders’ past accomplishments, and the technical depth of the product. “Depending on what your company is, the output of the algorithmic formula is going to be different,” she said.\nJon McNeill, co-founder and CEO of startup creation firm DVx Ventures, stated that even startups that grow rapidly from inception to $5 million in revenue often struggle to secure follow-on funding. “I think this game has changed, and it is changing dynamically,” he said.\nMcNeill noted that Series A investors are now applying the same rigorous standards to seed-stage startups that they previously reserved for more mature companies.\n“I think a lot of investors have figured out that the breakout companies, in most cases, don’t have the best tech,” McNeill said about why Series A VCs are looking so closely at startups’ ability to attract and retain customers. “They have the best go-to market.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSteve Jang, founder and managing partner of Kindred Ventures, disagreed that a strong go-to-market (GTM), an industry term for sales and marketing, holds greater weight for investors. “I don’t think it’s 100% true to say mediocre technology, great GTM wins and raises money and gets customers. I think that it’s a necessary requirement to have both.”\nWhile McNeill later clarified that having a solid product is important, he indicated that his initial comment was related to the founders’ need to develop an exceptionally strong sales and marketing strategy right out of the gate. “Investors are getting much more sophisticated on the go-to market than they have in the past,” he said.\n(The debate over marketing versus tech was brought to the forefront later during the conference when Roy Lee, founder of the viral startup Cluely, said onstage that launching a product that barely worked, even with massive social media fame, may not always be the best idea.)\nAileen Lee added that AI startups are now under pressure to deliver product updates and new features at an unprecedented pace, preempting existing companies that might try to introduce similar products.  “If you look at how much OpenAI and Anthropic are shipping, you’re going to have to figure out how to match how much you ship, how quickly and the quality of it,” she said.\nDespite the expectations for breakneck growth and fast product development, panelists agreed that the AI industry is still in its very early stages. As Jang put it, “There are no clear, outright winners, even in LLMs. There are competitors nipping at their heels.”\nThis means startups still have a path to unseating perceived leaders, whether they are decades-old companies or fast-moving newcomers.\n\n\n\t\tMarina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nUber has quietly begun piloting in-app video recording for its drivers in India, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed with the company. The tool is meant to deter misconduct in a market where most drivers do not use dashcams, according to Uber.\nHalf a dozen Uber drivers in the Delhi–NCR region told TechCrunch they sometimes face misconduct from riders and, in some cases, are threatened with false complaints about their behavior — allegations that can lead to penalties or even account suspensions.\n“Even female passengers traveling late at night insist that we follow the route they want instead of what’s shown on the map. If we refuse, they threaten to file false complaints,” said one driver, who requested anonymity out of fear of losing his account.\nDrivers said the in-app video recording feature could help protect them in such situations by providing evidence when disputes arise. Still, some questioned whether Uber would back them in cases involving riders, noting that passengers pay for the trip and can easily switch to competing platforms if dissatisfied.\nThe pilot, which began rolling out in phases in May, is now live in 10 cities across India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.\nRiders receive an in-trip notification when video recording is active.\nUber’s notification for in-app video recording.Image Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\n“All recordings are double-encrypted, stored on the device, and cannot be accessed by anyone — including Uber — unless a user chooses to share them as part of a safety report,” an Uber spokesperson said, adding that the recordings are automatically deleted after a week if they are not shared.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe video tool builds on Uber’s in-app audio recording feature, which launched in India in 2023. Video recording was first tested in the U.S. in 2022 and is already available in Canada and Brazil.\nAs the pilot expands, Uber will have to balance the feature’s potential to defuse disputes with broader questions about privacy and surveillance in one of its prominent markets. It is unclear when the video recording tool will be rolled out more widely, though the pilot’s performance in the coming months is likely to shape whether Uber extends it across India or to other regions.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:beehiiv\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:50 AM PST · November 13, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nNewsletter platform beehiiv announced a massive expansion to its platform on Thursday, including offering real-time analytics and AI website creation, among other things. \nIn a video announcing the release, Tyler Denk, the co-founder and CEO of beehiiv, said that what makes newsletter platforms powerful is ownership. \n“Owning your audience, distribution, brand, and even your revenue potential,” he said. “In the age of AI and algorithms. Ownership isn’t just nice to have, it’s essential.”\nThe hope is to further give creators (and journalists) more control — and opportunities — to expand and grow their businesses on the platform.  \nThe full product expansion includes: \n\n Allowing creators to sell digital products, such as e-books, without beehiiv receiving commissions. Next year, creators will soon be able to sell courses and merchandise. \n\n\nA feature that lets creators build websites using AI without the use of sophisticated code or developers. A version product was actually launched a few months ago and followed beehiiv’s acquisition of the AI website builder Typedream last year.   Thursday’s announcement revealed the product now lets users build full websites by simply chatting with AI — or, vibe code a website. However, users don’t need to simply talk in words to the AI; they can also drag and drop images, for example, upload images or screenshots of other people’s websites to the AI, and have it re-create them.\n\n\nThe ability to host and release podcasts on a creator’s respective beehiive platform. This lets creators put their podcasts, newsletters, and websites under one platform, rather than having three separate ones. \n\n\nReal-time analytics to track engagement and traffic, in addition to a breakdown of what channels drive the most users. \n\n\nOffering “link in bio,” so creators can link to other digital platforms, as well as their own beehiiv creations, without having to use a third-party link-in-bio company.  \nOffering professionally designed website templates, so that the website and newsletters look more high-quality. It’s also releasing newsletter templates so that websites and newsletters can have a cohesive brand look. \n\n\nThe ability to audience segment — meaning creators can create specific content for specific segments of their audience. Creators can now group followers by location, age, or even gender.   \n\n\nAutomated workflows — for example, when a user subscribes, creators can set it up so that a welcome email is automatically sent to them. beehiiv started releasing features of automated workflows a few weeks ago. \n\n\nEnhanced advertiser tools, including easier browsing of ad opportunities and seeing estimated payouts. Denk said that creators can upload assets, set a budget, and launch campaigns on the platform. In addition, beehiiv has a new ad dashboard, letting creators track the performance of their campaigns and build their own custom reports.  \n\n\nPaid subscriptions, without any fees taken by beehiiv (it says it is the only platform that doesn’t take a cut of paid subscription revenue). The feature comes with subscription tiers and analytics. \n\nBeehiiv now considers itself the first platform to encapsulate the entire content-creation workflow, as users on the platform can “create, publish, grow, analyze, and monetize,” without fees, plugins, code, or giving up equity.\nIn the video, Denk said that beehiiv is no longer just a newsletter platform, but rather the operating system for the creator economy. With this expansion, it hopes to compete with the likes of Lovable, WordPress, and Patreon. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe company was founded in 2021 and says that since then, it has sent more than 35 billion emails, with more than 55,000 creators on the platform, including Oliver Darcy with Status. Beehiiv last raised a $33 million Series B in April 2024 with Lightspeed Venture Partners and NEA as investors.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIn the debut episode of the Build Mode podcast, host Isabelle Johannessen sits down with Deon Nicholas, co-founder of Forethought AI, to unpack what it really takes to build a lasting company with and for your customers from day one.\nBuild Mode is TechCrunch’s new podcast that pulls back the curtain on how startups actually get built — the messy, tactical, real-talk version. Season 1: Product, Meet Market, goes beyond product-market fit to explore every aspect of getting your product into customers’ hands, from finding the right audience and earning their trust to turning early traction into lasting momentum.\n\n\n\nFrom the start, Nicholas and his team focused on solving real problems rather than chasing hype or inflated valuations. He is a firm believer that conviction should come from customers, not VCs, and that once Forethought delivered tangible value to real users, the hype and valuations naturally followed.\nHis “7-Failure Rule” urges founders to embrace iteration over perfection and to expect a few misses before finding what truly clicks. \nThe Forethought team stayed lean, obsessed over its ideal customer profile, and focused relentlessly on real pain points instead of shiny features. Nicholas notes that early users aren’t always direct about what isn’t working, so founders have to learn to look between the lines.\nThat mindset powered Forethought’s breakout moment at TechCrunch Disrupt 2018, where the company went on to win Startup Battlefield. Leading up to the competition, Nicholas described the process as a “friendly pressure cooker,” sprinting to secure as many paying customer logos as possible before hitting the stage. The focus paid off, fueling investor FOMO and a $9 million Series A and helping to define the early wave of the AI boom. \nWhile investor momentum built quickly, Nicholas maintains the company’s longevity stemmed from focus, not frenzy. To him, startup success isn’t about hype or rock-star energy — it’s about building something customers love enough to stick around for.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFor founders, the takeaway is simple: Build from day one with your customers, validate every step with feedback, and don’t get distracted by valuations or buzz. Product-market fit isn’t about perfection; it’s about proving consistent value to the people who matter most.\nEpisodes of Build Mode drop every Thursday. Subscribe now on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. And be sure to check out the video version on TechCrunch’s YouTube.\n\n\n\t\tIsabelle leads Startup Battlefield, TechCrunch’s iconic launchpad and competition for the world’s most promising early-stage startups.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Isabelle by emailing isabelle.johannessen@techcrunch.com.\r\n\r\nShe scouts top founders across 99+ countries and prepares them to pitch on the Disrupt stage in front of tier-one investors and global media.

    "body": "\nEarly-stage venture fund Betaworks announced the latest 10 companies launching from its prestigious Camp program, the 13-week biannual residence program launched in 2016 that has given way to names like Hugging Face and Graze Social. \nThe theme for this year’s Camp is Interfaces, as in companies that are designing products that impact how users experience AI. (Previous Camp themes focused on application layers and agents). Applications opened in June, and the camp began in August, with DemoDay being November 4. \nThese are the companies taking part in the 13th Betaworks Camp:\nNora — A browser extension, founded by Sid Banothu, that tracks shopping habits. \nPrimitive — A web app that lets people use voice to dump ideas that the platform then turns into a list of tasks and to-dos. The product, founded by Kasey Klimes, can also link with other productivity tools such as Notion and calendars. \nPatina — Founded by Sean Raspet and Laura Sisson, the company is working on olfactory technology to create “scent photographs,” through a combination of protein folding, scent receptors, and graph neural networks. \nMy Place, by Orange — A platform, founded by Helen Huang, that lets users play games that are realistic simulations of everyday human life. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nPutty (no website yet) — Though the company is still in stealth, Betaworks said it wanted to work with the founder, Kevin Chang, because he was “deeply engaged with concepts” the firm cared about, including “memory systems, ambient interfaces” and “technology fitted to the more sporadic rhythm of life.” \nTelepath — A computer built with AI and no apps, founded by Stephen Hood, Josh Whiting, and Rupert Manfredi. \nFeather — A digital assistant that helps create automated workflows for tedious tasks, like apartment hunting. It was founded by ShaoBo Zhang and Marco Yu. \nNubrain — Founded by Priyanka Jain and Ingo Marquardt, this company is creating EEG data (the test used to record the electrical activity of the brain) to help translate human thoughts into speech, text, and images. \nPresq — This platform, founded by Adam Saleh, Steve Burstyn, and Mikey Robins, lets influencers upload data to create prompt options that let them create manufacturable footwear. It plans to soon expand to other product areas, like eyewear and home goods.\nIntension — Founded by Conor Sanchez O’Shea and Gabriel Duemichen, this company helps people focus while working on a desktop by removing from sight anything that operates as a distraction. It tracks users’ attention and maps out the workflow habits of those working on desktops. \nThis story was updated to clarify what Presq does.\n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWhen the hosts of the popular All-In podcast launched their own tequila brand at a star-studded party last June, all 750 bottles of the $1,200 spirit quickly sold out. But getting those bottles into customers’ hands has proven harder than expected.\nThe long-awaited bottles of Besties All-In tequila began shipping last week to those who ordered them, ending a nearly five-month-long wait, Jason Calacanis, one of the podcast’s hosts, told TechCrunch. \nThe holdup was the unusual bottle, Calacanis said: “Handcrafted bottles took a bit longer to create than expected, but the bottles started shipping last week!” The bottle was designed as a collector item and looks like a stack of poker chips illuminated from the bottom. It gives homage to poker, another of the podcast hosts’ favorite pastimes besides drinking tequila.\nBuyers were told at that time that they could expect delivery by the end of summer. But summer came and went. The customers not only dished out the $1,200 but also paid taxes and other fees.  \nA TechCrunch reader told us that delivery was repeatedly delayed: pushed back to October, then November, and most recently, one person was told the delivery would be “after November,” according to a letter seen by TechCrunch from the distributor Flaviar, the spirits marketplace handling distribution.\nBoth the product’s official website and Flaviar’s communications reflected the shifting timeline — the website originally promised end-of-summer delivery but now says shipments will “begin in November.” The Flaviar letter indicated that deliveries were happening in batches.\nWhile it’s still not clear how long it will take the distributor to fulfill all orders, we at least know that shipments have begun and what the holdup was. With any luck, fans of the VCs, pod bros, and “besties” who host All-In will be sipping on the pricey, handcrafted liquor during the upcoming holiday season.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nFlaviar has not yet responded to our request for comment.  \n",

    "body": "\nAn international coalition of law enforcement agencies coordinated by Europol targeted and took down three cybercrime operations in its latest round of what authorities call “Operation Endgame.”\nIn a press release, Europol said that the police operation targeted the infostealing malware Rhadamanthys, a botnet called Elysium, and the remote access trojan VenomRAT. The authorities say all three “played a key role in international cybercrime.” Police seized more than 1,000 servers as part of the operation. \nEuropol said police arrested the unnamed “main suspect” behind VenomRAT in Greece on November 3.\n“The dismantled malware infrastructure consisted of hundreds of thousands of infected computers containing several million stolen credentials,” the press release read. “Many of the victims were not aware of the infection of their systems.”\nAccording to Europol, the main suspect behind Rhadamantys had access to over 100,000 crypto wallets, “potentially worth millions of euros.”\nAs an infostealer, Rhadamantys is designed to steal various kinds of information from infected devices, including passwords and cryptocurrency wallet keys. Rhadamantys spiked in popularity in October after authorities took down the popular infostealer Lumma earlier in the year, showing that after takedowns, criminals adapt by using different hacking tools that might be less known at the time.\nWhen Rhadamantys launched in 2022, it initially relied on spreading through malicious Google advertisements, and later grew thanks to word-of-mouth on underground forums, according to Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs, one of the cybersecurity industry partners in Operation Endgame. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe firm wrote in a blog post that Rhadamantys had a “dramatic uptick” and a “consistent rise in the number of victims” after the Lumma takedown, making it “the largest information-stealer malware by volume.” In October, the infostealer had compromised more than 12,000 victims, according to the firm.\nRyan English, a researcher at Black Lotus Labs, told TechCrunch that Rhadamantys “emerged as the ‘next’ go-to infostealer” after Lumma went down.\n“We know that others will take their place, so we just keep tracking to see who’s emerging from that,” said English, adding that law enforcement and the wider industry “can only do so much at any time.” \n“So in a very real sense, it’s whack-a-mole forever,” said English.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

The CBO pulled the affected Cisco router offline shortly before disclosing the hack.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nApple announced on Thursday the launch of a new developer program, the Mini Apps Partner Program, which will offer a reduced commission rate of 15% on in-app purchases for the mini applications.\nThe iPhone maker defines a mini app as a “self-contained” experience that’s built using web technologies like HTML5 and JavaScript, which are distributed within a larger, native app. The technology has been supported on the App Store for nearly a decade, but this is the first time it’s offered a reduced commission on mini app transactions.\nApple in 2017 added a rule to its App Review Guidelines, which lists the specific requirements for mini apps. In guideline 4.7, the company gives developers permission to run mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators that offer software not in the main app’s binary. It also describes how they’re to process sensitive data or filter objectionable material, similar to native apps.\nTo qualify for the new Mini App program, Apple says the main app must be available on iOS or iPadOS and hosted on the App Store, and will need to follow the Apple Developer Program License Agreement and the existing App Review Guidelines, including those for mini apps.\nHowever, the program also adds the new requirements for the apps to support specific Apple technologies, including the Advanced Commerce API and Declared Age Rating API, which ensures apps offer age-appropriate content. They must also use Apple’s in-app purchase system and send information about a user’s in-app purchase to Apple when refunds are requested.\nApple positions the program as a way for developers who host mini apps and games to grow their business on the App Store. It also incentivizes developers to leverage Apple’s technologies, including its trust and safety tools, by offering the benefit of a reduced commission. That additional savings could allow the developers to re-invest in their own mini apps program.\nIn addition, it ensures that Apple will retain its ability to extract a commission from mini applications, even as the market evolves to offer new experiences. \nToday, there are a variety of native iOS apps that offer mini apps, including messengers like LINE or WeChat, or those that offer mini games, like Discord, for example. More recently, AI providers have begun moving into the mini app space. Notably, ChatGPT recently launched apps that run inside its chatbot, allowing users to engage with apps like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva. Some have theorized that this platform could eventually evolve to threaten the App Store’s business model if app engagement and transactions moved inside ChatGPT.\nBloomberg recently reported Apple and Tencent agreed to a 15% commission on mini apps in WeChat, but not that the program would be open to other developers.\nDevelopers who want to join Apple’s Mini Apps Partner Program can make a request, and then provide information about their host app, eligibility, and mini app. They also have to agree to the program’s terms and conditions. When their app is ready, they then have to submit it for review. (Apple already asks app developers to include a manifest that allows Apple to review the software and metadata included in the app, plus the links that lead to the mini apps it offers.)\nIn-app purchases inside mini apps qualify for the reduced commission if they are for digital goods and services, including consumable, non-consumable, auto-renewable subscriptions, and non-renewing subscriptions, Apple says.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nMeta is overhauling Facebook Marketplace with new collaborative tools, social features, an improved checkout experience, and Meta AI integrations, the company announced Thursday.\nMarketplace is getting a new “collections” feature that lets users create groups of listings and invite friends to join. Users can get started by saving a listing, starting a new collection, and then choosing whether to make it public or private. They can then add friends to their collection and share updates through Feed, Messenger, WhatsApp, and more. \nMeta’s also testing collaborative buying, which means users can invite a friend to join their chat with a seller. The company says this makes it easier to coordinate pickup, negotiate prices, and get answers to questions.\nImage Credits:Meta\nThese new collaborative features could be useful in instances when a group of roommates is looking to furnish their new apartment or when someone wants to keep their partner in the loop when discussing potential purchases. \nWhile Meta says the changes announced on Thursday are designed to make Marketplace more useful, they also mark the company’s ongoing efforts to bring Meta AI into all of its services and products. Additionally, by blending social, commerce, and AI, the company is looking to boost time spent on Marketplace while also enhancing its competitiveness against other e-commerce platforms.\nIn terms of the Meta AI integrations, Meta is going to start using its AI tools to help buyers ask the right questions when making a purchase. Now, when users start a chat with a seller, they will see a “Suggested questions to ask” button. If they tap it, Meta AI will use the details from the listing and the conversation to suggest questions they might want to ask.\nAdditionally, Meta is bringing AI insights to vehicle listings on Marketplace, noting that vehicles are among the top five searches for young adults. Now, when users view a vehicle listing, they’ll see AI-generated insights that bring together key details like engine options, safety ratings, transmission type, seating and cargo capacity, reviews, and price information.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta also announced that users can react and comment directly on listings. The company says this will help others learn about item quality and discover new finds. It’ll be interesting to see how people react to this change, as Marketplace has had a simple design since its launch. Some might find the addition of reactions and comments as distracting, or even cluttering the service.\nMeta notes that if a user likes an item, Marketplace will learn what they’re interested in and display more items aligned with their preferences.\nAs part of its announcement, Meta said it began integrating eBay and Poshmark inventory into Marketplace earlier this year to give people more options when it comes to buying across categories like fashion and electronics.\n“Partner listings are marked with an icon on the listing image, and are integrated throughout your Marketplace feed so you’ll see them while you’re browsing,” Meta explained in a blog post. “You can also see the listing and seller’s information on the Marketplace product details page, and when you’re ready to buy, you’ll be taken to the partner’s site for checkout.”\nAs for the improved checkout experience, buyers will now see total costs, including shipping and tax, upfront. They’ll now also receive notifications as the status of their order changes. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

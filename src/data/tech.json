TechCrunch reached out to Google for comment.\nAmericans have long suspected that their devices inappropriately spy on them. Those suspicions have led, increasingly, to claims of legal wrongdoing. In 2021, Apple agreed to pay $95 million to settle claims its voice assistant, Siri, had recorded their conversations without a prompt from users.\nGoogle, like other tech giants, has faced other privacy-related litigation in recent years. Last year, the company agreed to pay $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle two lawsuits that claimed it had violated the state’s data privacy laws.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Privacy\n\n",

The company said Monday the round was led by Lightspeed.\nRicursive says the system will be able to create its own silicon substrate layer and speed up AI chip improvements. Rinse and repeat to get to AGI, the founders say.\nThe Series A comes just two months since the company formally launched with a seed investment led by Sequoia. It has raised $335 million total, reports The New York Times.\nRicursive was founded by former Google researchers CEO Anna Goldie and CTO Azalia Mirhoseini. Their work on a novel reinforcement learning method for designing chip layouts, called AlphaChip, has been used in four generations of Google’s TPU chip, the startup says.\nDST Global, Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Felicis Ventures, 49 Palms Ventures, and Radical AI are also investors.\nRicursive is not to be confused with the similarly named startup Recursive, reportedly founded by well-known natural language processing neural networks researcher Richard Socher. That Recursive is also in talks to raise a giant round at a $4 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last week. And it is also working on AI systems that improve themselves.\nAnd these two are not the only new startups working on the concept. As TechCrunch previously reported, Naveen Rao’s new AI hardware startup, named Unconventional AI, is also working on an intelligent substrate. In December it raised a $475 million seed round at a $4.5 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures, with participation from Lux Capital and DCVC. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Startups\n\n",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 Game Developers Conference is shaping up to be a little less international this year if commentary on social media platforms like LinkedIn is an indicator. \nMany members of the international games industry have announced they will skip the event, mainly over concerns about safety, tougher U.S. immigration rules, and a stronger immigration and Customs Enforcement presence. Developers, past GDC attendees, and other industry professionals have taken to platforms like LinkedIn to publicly voice their concerns.\nICE activity in numerous U.S. cities as well as the recent fatal shootings in Minneapolis involving ICE agents have compounded concerns. Renee Nicole Good was killed on January 7, and ICU nurse Alex Pretti lost his life on January 24. Many travelers also said they’re worried about unpredictable border checks and safety concerns.\nAs one person put it, “It’s not worth taking the risk of going.” Another chimed in: “The U.S. is just a very problematic location for an international event.”\nGDC, now rebranded as the “GDC Festival of Gaming,” is scheduled to take place in San Francisco from March 9 to 13.\nOthers cited general concerns over safety as well as cost as factors in their decision not to attend. Some indie developers and small studios have said the costs, which include hotel, food, travel, and the ticket price, are just too high.\nIn response to these concerns, GDC president Nina Brown told Mobilegamer.biz, that the “safety of our community is always our top priority.” In a statement, Brown said the GDC works closely with “local officials and legal experts to monitor U.S. policy changes” and to provide the most up-to-date guidance. Brown also advised international attendees to start their visa applications early and consult with their embassies regarding any special requirements.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n​Brown also outlined several safety measures, including that GDC offers a 24/7 safety hotline, safety training for event staff, and security escorts upon request. San Francisco’s Safety Community Ambassadors program will also be present, providing additional support to attendees throughout the event.\nTechCrunch has also reached out to GDC for comment and will update this article if the organization responds. \nOn the cost front, GDC has introduced a simpler, more affordable ticketing system to make the event more accessible to smaller developers and indie studios. The new Festival Pass replaces the previous All-Access pass and is 45% cheaper, with pricing starting at $649 and providing access to all main event programming.\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nMeta plans to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on it apps, the company told TechCrunch on Monday. The tech giant said the new subscriptions will unlock more productivity and creativity, along with expanded AI capabilities.\nIn the coming months, Meta said it will offer a premium experience on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp that gives users access to special features and more control over how they share and connect, while keeping the core experiences free. Meta doesn’t appear to be locked into one strategy, noting that it will test a variety of subscription features and bundles, and that each app subscription will have a distinct set of exclusive features. \nMeta also shared that it plans to scale Manus, an AI agent it recently acquired for a reported $2 billion, as part of its subscription plans. \nMeta is taking a two-fold approach to Manus. The company is going to integrate Manus into Meta products, while continuing to sell standalone subscriptions to businesses. Meta has already been spotted working on adding a shortcut to Manus AI on Instagram, according to a screenshot shared by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they’re still under development.\nAdditionally, Meta plans to test subscriptions for AI features, such as Vibes video generation. Vibes is Meta’s AI-powered short-form video experience built into the Meta AI app that lets people create and remix AI-generated videos. Although Vibes has been free since its launch last year, Meta now plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month. \nWhile it’s unknown what the paid features on WhatsApp and Facebook will look like, Paluzzi notes that the new subscription on Instagram will let users create unlimited audience lists, the ability to see a list of followers who don’t follow you back, and the option to view a Story without the poster seeing that you viewed it. \nIt’s worth noting that the new subscriptions will be separate from Meta Verified. The tech giant says it’s going to use what it learned from Meta Verified to evolve its subscription business to include more offerings it thinks everyday users, creators, and businesses will want.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nMeta Verified is aimed at content creators and businesses, as it comes with a verified badge, 24/7 direct support, impersonation protections, search optimization, exclusive stickers, and more. While these features aren’t aimed at everyday users or non-creators, the new subscriptions will be designed for a broader audience.\nThe launch of additional subscriptions will allow Meta to generate more revenue; however, many users may be deterred by subscription fatigue. With so many paid services competing for monthly spending, Meta will have to offer a compelling product to get users to sign up for yet another subscription.\nSnap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, as its Snapchat+ offering continues to be a revenue driver. Snapchat+, which starts at $3.99 per month for exclusive features, has topped 16 million subscribers, more than doubling since early 2024.\nMeta says it plans to listen to its community of users and gather feedback as it starts rolling out the subscriptions in the coming months.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nA group of YouTubers who are suing tech giants for scraping their videos without permission to train AI models has now added Snap to their list of defendants. The plaintiffs — internet content creators behind a trio of YouTube channels with roughly 6.2 million collective subscribers — allege that Snap has trained its AI systems on their video content for use in AI features like the app’s “Imagine Lens,” which allows users to edit images using text prompts.\nThe plaintiffs earlier filed similar lawsuits against Nvidia, Meta, and ByteDance over similar matters.\nIn the newly filed proposed class action suit, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the YouTubers specifically call out Snap for its use of a large-scale, video-language dataset known as HD-VILA-100M, and others that were designed for only academic and research purposes. To use these datasets for commercial purposes, the plaintiffs claim Snap circumvented YouTube’s technological restrictions, terms of service, and licensing limitations, which prohibit commercial use.\nThe suit is seeking statutory damages and a permanent injunction to stop the alleged copyright infringement going forward.\nThe case itself is being led by the creators behind the h3h3 YouTube channel, with 5.52 million subscribers, and the smaller golfing channels MrShortGame Golf and Golfholics.\nIt’s now one of many lawsuits pitting content creators against AI model providers, which have included copyright disputes from publishers, authors, newspapers, user-generated content sites, artists, and more. It’s also not the first case to hail from a YouTuber. According to the nonprofit organization Copyright Alliance, over 70 copyright infringement cases have been filed against AI companies.\nIn some cases, like one between Meta and a group of authors, a judge has ruled in favor of the tech giant. In others, like the case between Anthropic and a group of authors, the AI giant has settled with and paid out the plaintiffs to resolve their claims. Many cases are still in active litigation.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSnap was asked for comment.

    "body": "\nSkylight, a TikTok alternative built on open source technology, is benefiting from concerns that arose over TikTok U.S.’s change in ownership last week. The startup, a maker of a short-form, vertical video app similar to TikTok, says it has now topped over 380,000 users and is continuing to grow after a busy weekend.\nLaunched last year and backed by Mark Cuban and other investors, Skylight’s mobile app is built on the AT Protocol, the technology that also powers the decentralized X rival Bluesky, which now has north of 42 million users.\nSkylight, co-founded by CEO Tori White and CTO Reed Harmeyer, offers a built-in video editor; user profiles; support for likes, commenting, and sharing; and the ability for community curators to create custom feeds for others to follow.\nImage Credits:Skylight\nThe app now has over 150,000 videos uploaded directly to the platform. It can also stream videos from Bluesky because of its AT Protocol integration. \nHarmeyer said Saturday that 1.4 million videos were played on the app the day before, up 3x over the past 24 hours. The app had also seen sign-ups increase more than 150%. Other noteworthy stats include over a 50% increase in returning users, over 40% rise in video played on average, and over 100% increase in posts created.\nThis surge was likely triggered by concerns over TikTok’s change in ownership and its unfortunately timed technical glitches.\nTikTok had announced on January 22 the establishment of the TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, designed to comply with Trump’s executive order requiring the company’s U.S. operations be sold to a group of American investors. TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance will now own less than 20% of the new entity.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe deal was a result of increased tensions between the U.S. and China, which led to concerns that TikTok could be a threat to national security, both by collecting data on U.S. citizens and through algorithmic influence. Now, however, some of TikTok’s users are more worried about the new American investors and their allegiance to Trump.\nThose concerns grew to a head when TikTok pushed out an updated privacy policy, which includes permission to track users’ GPS coordinates, among other things. Users also pointed to language in the privacy policy that said the app would track immigration status. Although that language was not new, and its inclusion has to do with adherence to state privacy laws, some users began encouraging people to delete the app.\nWhile it’s unknown how many TikTok users actually followed through, what is clear is that some people sought out alternatives. Over the weekend, Skylight’s CEO, Tori White, said the app added around 20,000 new users and is continuing to grow. So far this January, the app has seen around 95,000 monthly active users.\nWhite credited the app’s more open and customizable nature as the force behind its growth. \nWhile Skylight has made notable gains, it’s still overshadowed by TikTok and its 200 million monthly active U.S. users. Still, Skylight’s founders believe their approach provides an opening for growth. \n“We’ve seen what happens when one person dictates what’s pushed into people’s feeds,” White told TechCrunch. “Not only does it harm a creator’s connection with their followers, but the entire health of the platform. That’s why we built Skylight Social on open standards. We wanted creator and user power to be guaranteed by the technology. Not an empty promise, but an irrevocable right.”\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nTo understand the stance of an unwavering Trump loyalist after a federal border patrol agent shocked the nation this weekend by shooting an American citizen in Minneapolis, look no further than Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois.\nRabois’ public support for Border Patrol’s actions in the killing of Alex Pretti, made via posts on X, was so vehement that Khosla Ventures partner Ethan Choi and firm founder Vinod Khosla both publicly disavowed it.\nRabois argued that Pretti was at fault, writing that the protester was committing a “felony.” One of Rabois’ posts said, “no law enforcement has shot an innocent person. illegals are committing violent crimes every day.” Another said: “he unequivocally attempted to draw his weapon. fuck you.” In another post that discussed citizens’ ability to exercise their First, Second, and Fourth Amendment rights, the VC weighed in: “yes but interfering w a law enforcement operation is not protected by any of those amendments.”\nAmong other comments, Rabois went on to say he doesn’t believe that the Minneapolis police could be credible sources in an investigation: “i don’t think you should ask any law enforcement in MN. But i am very open to reading views from any other urban jurisdiction.” He instead blamed the city’s police for the situation: “Because the MN police’s refusal to cooperate is exactly what is leading to these treacherous conditions (for everyone).”\nAnd so on.\nX reacted as you might expect. Other Trump supporters cheered Rabois on, while those who condemn ICE’s actions argued with and condemned the investor.\nThe situation spiraled so much that when one person suggested that founders remove Khosla Ventures from their cap tables altogether, Khosla partner Choi piped up to distance himself.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nChoi posted: “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at @khoslaventures, at least not mine. What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.”\nThen the founder of the firm, Khosla himself, stood by Choi. “I agree with @EthanChoi7. Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck [sic] empowered by a conscious-less administration,” he said in his post on X.\n\nI agree with @EthanChoi7 . Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration. The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society. ICE… https://t.co/ASvjZQB0Gg— Vinod Khosla (@vkhosla) January 26, 2026\n\nUnder normal circumstances, opposing political points of view can be a strength for a VC firm. Whatever anyone thinks of Rabois’ politics, he’s been a very successful investor backing such companies as DoorDash, Affirm, Faire, and Stripe, as well as co-founding Opendoor, among other startups.\nBut sometimes they are internally disruptive. \nSequoia was embroiled in a controversy over partner Shaun Maguire’s comments attacking New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Maguire (whose comments over the weekend on ICE align with Rabois’) remains as an investor at Sequoia. But its leader at the time of the Mamdani controversy, Roelof Botha, stepped down as senior steward in November. Botha was replaced by Alfred Lin and Pat Grady (neither of whom weighed in over the weekend).\nIn this case, the rift between Khosla partners spilled out publicly. But note that Khosla did not directly chastise Rabois. (The company did not respond to our request for comment.)\nWhen Khosla Ventures rehired Rabois in 2024, the firm knew it was bringing in an outspoken, self-proclaimed “contrarian” into its ranks, of the ilk that liked to blame the “woke” and praise President Trump. For Rabois’ part, he knew he would be working for a vocal Trump critic (Vinod Khosla has made his point of view on Trump very clear for years).\nWill there be continued fallout? Perhaps — but only if founders really do start dumping Khosla Ventures from their cap tables.\n",

    "body": "\nClaude users will now be able to call up interactive apps within the chatbot interface, thanks to a new feature announced by Anthropic on Monday.\nIn keeping with Anthropic’s enterprise focus, the launch apps are mostly workplace tools, including Slack, Canva, Figma, Box, and Clay, with a Salesforce implementation expected soon. In each case, the app will enable a logged-in instance of the service that’s accessible to Claude, enabling users to send Slack messages, generate charts, or access cloud files, depending on which apps have been enabled.\n“Analyzing data, designing content, and managing projects all work better with a dedicated visual interface,” Anthropic said in a blog post announcing the feature. “Combined with Claude’s intelligence, you can work and iterate faster than either could offer alone.”\nThe new feature is available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise subscribers, but not free users. Eligible users can activate the tools at claude.ai/directory.\nThe system is similar to OpenAI’s Apps system, which launched in October and enables interactive third-party tools. Both systems of app integrations are built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard introduced by Anthropic in 2024. MCP launched support for apps in November, drawing on work from both companies.\nThe new apps will be particularly powerful when integrated with Claude Cowork, an all-purpose agent tool launched by Anthropic last week. Built on top of Claude Code, Cowork lets users assign multistage tasks that draw on large and open-ended datasets — tasks that would have previously required terminal commands. Combined with the new apps feature, Cowork could be granted access to cloud files or ongoing work projects. For example, Cowork could update a marketing graphic in Figma or use new data from the company’s Box instance.\nApps are not available in Cowork at launch, but Anthropic said the integration would be “coming soon.”\nAgentic systems can be unpredictable, and Anthropic’s own safety documentation for Cowork encourages users to monitor the agent closely and not grant any unnecessary permissions.\n“Be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records,” the company recommends. “Consider creating a dedicated working folder for Claude rather than granting broad access.”\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "\nAs snowstorms pelted the U.S. on Sunday, TikTok users reported widespread issues with the app, like problems loading comments or unexpected behavior from the For You page algorithm. For some users, the problems continue to persist.\nThe timing of these outages lines up with the long-awaited creation of a separate U.S. TikTok entity last week, which the U.S. government mandated due to concerns about the Chinese government potentially accessing user data via the app’s former parent company, ByteDance. (Now, ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new TikTok USDS Joint Venture, while managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX own 15% each.)\nHowever, the TikTok USDS Joint Venture stated in a post on X that these issues were caused by a power outage at a U.S. data center.\n“Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate,” the company said. “We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.”\n\nSince yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate. We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.— TikTok USDS Joint Venture (@tiktokusdsjv) January 26, 2026\n\nAccording to user-reported data from Downdetector, the outage is impacting users across the country.\nTikTok’s reasoning for the glitches is logical, given that more than one million people in the U.S. have been impacted by power outages after the massive storm. But some users are suspicious given how soon the outages occurred after the U.S. joint venture was formally established.\nThe outage also overlaps with ongoing protests in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where thousands of ICE agents have been deployed since early January in what ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons called the “largest immigration operation ever.”\nOn Saturday, border patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, marking ICE’s second murder of a civilian in Minneapolis this month.\nIn the wake of the killing, some TikTok users said they had trouble searching on the app for information about the events in Minneapolis. The app malfunctions then led to panic about the possibility of government censorship. However, TikTok attributes these issues to its concurrent data center outage.\nPeople had also expressed concern over the weekend about TikTok’s updated privacy policy, which includes language that allows TikTok to collect data about users, including their “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.” However, as TechCrunch reported, some of these disclosures are not new and had appeared in TikTok’s privacy policy prior to the ownership deal’s close, primarily to comply with California’s Consumer Privacy Act.\nWhile the recent TikTok outages and privacy policy changes seem to be run-of-the-mill problems with bad timing, Americans do have reason to be cautious about social media surveillance — especially in times of political unrest.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nIn the wake of TikTok’s U.S. ownership change last week, some users are seeking out alternative platforms. One app gaining traction is UpScrolled, a social network that pledges to remain impartial to political agendas. The app currently ranks 12th overall in Apple’s App Store and second in the social networking category.\nUpScrolled blends familiar features from Instagram and X, letting users share photos, videos, and text posts, discover new content, and send direct messages.\nThe app was founded last year by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist, with the aim of giving users a place to “freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,” according to the app’s website. The team behind the app says they’re “building a platform that belongs to the people who use it — not to hidden algorithms or outside agendas.”\n“UpScrolled is the foundation for a digital ecosystem that puts power back into the hands of the people — not the corporations,” Hijazi said in a statement on UpScrolled’s website. “It’s more than just an alternative to Meta, X, or TikTok — it’s a reimagining of what social media should be: a space where creators, communities, and businesses thrive independently, with real control, transparency, and accountability.”\nThe app, available on both iOS and Android, is grappling with a surge of new users but says it’s scaling to keep up with the demand.\nAccording to data from the market intelligence provider Appfigures, UpScrolled saw approximately 41,000 downloads between Thursday, the day the TikTok deal was finalized, and Saturday, accounting for nearly one-third of its lifetime installs. UpScrolled has seen an average of about 14,000 daily downloads since Thursday, representing a 2,850% increase in daily downloads.\nIn total, the app has been downloaded 140,000 times to date, with 75,000 of those being U.S.-based installs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Well, this is new … You showed up so fast our servers tapped out,” the company wrote in a post on X. “Frustrating? Yes. Emotional? Also yes. We’re a tiny team building what Big Tech stopped being. Right now we’re scaling on caffeine to keep up with what YOU started. Bear with us. We’re on it.”\nThe surge comes as TikTok announced last Thursday that it signed a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to form a majority American-owned joint venture to keep the social app operating in the U.S. TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance owns less than 20% of the new entity, while the venture’s three managing investors — Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment company MGX — each hold a 15% stake. Some users worry that TikTok’s new U.S. investors may have political allegiances to Trump.\nFollowing the takeover, some users accused the app of potentially censoring certain political content. This criticism included a handful of high-profile users, including Senator Chris Murphy and singer Billie Eilish, who raised concerns that TikTok was suppressing or limiting posts criticizing ICE. Additionally, some said they were unable to search for information about ongoing protests in Minneapolis following the killing of Alex Pretti by border patrol agents.\nHowever, TikTok attributed these issues to an ongoing data center outage, which has been impacting its app’s functionality.\nConcerns also grew when TikTok released an updated privacy policy that allows the app to track users’ GPS coordinates, among other things. This led to some users encouraging people to delete the app in favor of alternatives, with UpScrolled being one of the popular choices, largely due to its promise to not shadowban anyone and give “every post a fair chance to be seen.”\nUpScrolled isn’t the only app that’s seeing a surge in users following the takeover. Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on open source technology, says it has now topped over 380,000 sign-ups and is continuing to grow.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nIf you want to solve climate change, there are few better places to start than cities. \n“The city is kind of like this beautiful vampire squid that sucks in all the resources,” Jacob Bro, co-founder and partner at 2150, told TechCrunch. “They basically aggregate all the prosperity in the world — 80% of GDP — but also 70% of emissions and all the other resources, all the waste, and all the downsides of the good life.”\nPlenty of investors have raised large funds to tackle climate change in recent years, with many measuring success by returns and carbon reductions. 2150 does the same, but to find fertile ground for investments, it starts by looking at problems and opportunities in cities, specifically.\n“If we look at all the stuff we consume, all the stuff we need to build, to make the urban platform of prosperity operate and thrive, you can identify technologies and the bottlenecks,” Bro said. \nThe climate angle helps give the fund an edge, he said. “Sustainability, if done well, is just better business, right? It’s cheaper, faster, and more independent from geopolitics.”\nThat dual focus has helped 2150 raise a new €210 million second fund from a range of institutional investors and family funds, including Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, Church Pension Group, the Danish sovereign fund EIFO, Fund of Funds Carbon Equity, Novo Holdings, Islandbridge Capital, Security Trading Oy, and Viessmann Generations Group. The new fund brings the European firm’s assets under management to €500 million.\nIn total, the new fund has 34 limited partners, said Christian Hernandez, co-founder and partner at 2150. “Pretty meaty checks,” he added.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nSo far, 2150 has invested in seven companies from the new fund, including AtmosZero, which makes industrial heat pumps; GetMobil, an e-waste recycling startup; Metycle, a scrap and recyclable metals marketplace; and MissionZero, a direct air capture startup. Three others have yet to be announced.\nIn total, 2150 is looking to invest in 20 companies in the second fund. Most startups it writes checks to will be raising Series A rounds, and the checks will total around €5 million to €6 million, Hernandez said. Half of the fund will be reserved for follow-on investments.\nThe partners said they’ll be looking for a range of startups, similar to before. Specifically, though, they’re excited by opportunities in data centers and automation, both of which have been spurred by the recent surge in AI. But for them, AI is more than just an opportunity to invest in energy-related companies. \n“The impact there is more societal than it is climate-related,” Hernandez said. “Europe is expected to lose 100 million people between now and 2040 — just people getting older. The Netherlands already has 50% of their population over the age of 50. So what role does industrial automation help with helping those people be productive, but also generating GDP and funding those people’s pensions?” he said.\nBro said the focus on industrial applications was perhaps obvious in hindsight. “Cities are all supplied by large or small industries at the end of the day,” he said.\nThe focus appears to be paying off. 2150’s portfolio companies mitigated one megaton of carbon emissions last year, Hernandez said. “The fact that a small venture capital fund can already get to the megaton-level scale in only four years, that level of impact, along with the commercial traction, makes me feel like we’re doing the right thing.”\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor. \r\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism. He received his PhD in environmental science, policy, and management from the University of California, Berkeley, and his BA degree in environmental studies, English, and biology from St. Olaf College.\r\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Tim by emailing tim.dechant@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nObvious Ventures, the firm co-founded by Twitter’s Evan Williams, has raised a fifth fund, and this one, just like its predecessors, comes with a “fun” number: $360,360,360.\n“We invest in the frontiers of math and science and physics, and we like to celebrate math in our fund numbers as well,” James Joaquin (pictured far right), the firm’s co-founder and managing director, told TechCrunch.\nThe firm’s first fund was $123,456,789, and the second was $191,919,191 (a palindromic number that reads the same forward and backwards). The third was $271,828,182 (which mathematicians and engineers instantly recognize as e, or Euler’s number), while the fourth fund, announced in mid-2022, continued the tradition as another palindrome at $355,111,553.\nIf you haven’t guessed it by now, the meaning of Obvious Ventures’ newest fund size is a little less about geeky math and more about the firm’s investing philosophy. Twelve years into its journey, Obvious says the figure represents a full-circle perspective on its three broad focus areas: planetary health, human health, and economic health.\n“We love the metaphor of taking a 360-degree view in each of those areas,” Joaquin said. “You have to be a student of the past to understand what’s worked and what hasn’t worked.”\nWhat’s working for the firm, according to Joaquin, is keeping its fund sizes small enough so that a single investment, if it becomes a durable public company, has the opportunity to return the entire fund. Joaquin likely placed an emphasis on durability in part because one of Obvious Ventures’ initial winners, Beyond Meat, reached a market capitalization of over $14 billion shortly after its 2019 IPO, but had fallen to below a billion by late 2022.   \nStill, Joaquin says the firm has seen meaningful cash distributions to limited partners from all of its core funds, and it boasts several companies with successful public-market exits. In 2015, Obvious Ventures invested in the satellite imagery company Planet Labs, which went public via a SPAC in 2021 and is currently valued at approximately $8.5 billion. Meanwhile, its Series A investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals maintains a market capitalization of over $2 billion.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nObvious is also an early investor in the HR and payroll platform Gusto, which was most recently valued at more than $9 billion in the private market and is widely considered to be on an IPO trajectory.\nIn a venture capital environment where only 17% of firms successfully raise more than three funds, per research from Sapphire Partners, Obvious Ventures’ latest fundraise solidifies the firm as an established VC player.\n“We made it to fund five, which is actually a big deal in the venture landscape,” Joaquin said.\nObvious Ventures may take a playful approach to fund sizes, but its focus on investing in startups that make a positive impact on the world is serious. Joaquin pointed to several investments in each of the firm’s three pillars.\nWithin the planetary health sector, the firm invested in Zanskar, a startup using proprietary data and AI to identify and harness geothermal energy, one of the most cost-effective power sources available. Just last week, Zanskar announced a $115 million Series C. Obvious Ventures, which led the company’s previous round, is particularly excited about the investment. Joaquin noted that the geothermal power harnessed by Zanskar can help fuel energy-hungry AI data centers.\nIn its human health strategy, Obvious Ventures touted its investment in Inceptive, an AI platform for molecule development. Inceptive was founded by Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the primary authors of the seminal “Attention Is All You Need” paper, which introduced the transformer architecture, the breakthrough behind generative AI.\nIn the area of economic health, Joaquin pointed to Dexterity Robotics. The company, which was valued at $1.65 billion last year, builds humanoids to handle “dull, dirty, and dangerous” tasks currently performed by humans in warehouses and factories.\nIn addition to Joaquin, Obvious Ventures has four active investors, including co-founder Vishal Vasishth. (Ev Williams remains a co-founder and an adviser.) The firm intends to make approximately 10 investments annually, with check sizes ranging from $5 million to $12 million for seed and Series A startups.\n",

    "body": "\nThe delayed first test of SpaceX’s upgraded Starship rocket is now slated for mid-March, according to a post from CEO Elon Musk on his social media site X.\nThis third version of Starship, or V3, is larger and more powerful. Crucially, the company plans to use Starship V3 to launch its next-generation Starlink satellites, which will be capable of faster data speeds but weigh more and are larger. It’s also the first version of the rocket that is meant to dock with other Starships in Earth orbit, a capability the company needs in order to reach the moon or Mars.\nThis all comes as SpaceX is racing toward an IPO later this year, and under pressure from the Trump administration to return U.S. astronauts to the surface of the moon before the end of his second term. Starship, the most powerful rocket ever developed, is currently a key part of NASA’s mission to fulfill that goal.\nSpaceX was making progress toward a launch of Starship V3 in late 2025. But in November, the booster stage suffered an explosion during testing that blew out an entire side of the steel rocket. The company said it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened, but has yet to offer a more detailed breakdown of what went wrong.\nThe company has been hoping to move on from the second version of Starship, which was a mixed bag. It was able to successfully reach orbit with Starship V2, deploy dummy versions of the next-generation Starlink satellites, and catch multiple booster stages after they returned to the launchpad. \nBut Starship V2 also suffered a number of explosions and setbacks of its own. Some of those came as a result of SpaceX’s developmental approach, which involves pushing the test vehicles to — or past — their limit and then iterating based on what the company learns. Others were more unexpected, like when one of the Starship vehicles that sits atop the booster stage erupted in a massive fireball during ground testing last June.\nSpaceX has come to dominate the global launch market over the last decade, and it is relying on Starship to maintain that dominance. But competition is creeping in at the edges. Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin launched its first mega-rocket, known as New Glenn, for the first time in January 2025 and again in November. The company launched its inaugural commercial payload for NASA on that second flight and also completed the first landing of its booster stage.\nBlue Origin is planning a third launch of New Glenn in late February and hopes to send its own lunar lander to the moon sometime after that. While New Glenn is smaller than Starship, Blue Origin revealed late last year that it is developing a larger version of the vehicle that more directly competes with SpaceX’s super-heavy rocket. \n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nElectric bike company Rad Power Bikes has reached a deal to sell itself to a company called Life Electric Vehicles Holdings (or Life EV) for around $13.2 million, a little more than a month after entering the bankruptcy process.\nFlorida-based Life EV bills itself as a “developer, manufacturer, and distributor in the light electric vehicle industry.” It offers a number of electric bikes for sale on its website, although most of them were labeled as “sold out” at the time this article was published.\nA filing to the bankruptcy docket over the weekend shows that five entities participated in an auction on the Rad Power assets on January 22. The first bid came in at $8 million, and parties traded bids until Life Electric Vehicles came away as the winner. When accounting for Rad Power’s liabilities, the total value of the bid is $14.9 million.\nAnother e-bike company called Retrospec had the second-highest bid of $13 million and is being labeled as the “backup bidder” in case the deal with Life EV falls through. The bids were a steep discount to Rad Power’s peak $1.65 billion valuation, which was reached in October 2021, per PitchBook. The company has raised a total of $329.2 million, according to PitchBook data.\nThe acquisition still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy judge.\nRad Power is not the only company in the micromobility world to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years. Peers like VanMoof and Cake went through restructurings and found new owners. Scooter company Bird also went through the bankruptcy process. \nIt’s not clear what Life EV plans to do with Rad Power; Life EV CEO Robert Provost directed questions to Rad Power. “There is still a process underway and there is an exciting future being planned for Rad Power,” he wrote in a message.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTechCrunch was unable to reach Rad Power for comment; this article will be updated if the company responds.\nLike many of those peers, Rad Power saw a huge increase in sales during the pandemic but struggled as that momentum dried up.\nThe company went through multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years, juggled CEOs, and more recently had trouble with some of its older batteries catching fire. The Consumer Product Safety Commission found 31 reported fires tied to the batteries.\nRad Power told TechCrunch at the time that it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the e-bike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.”\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nNvidia said on Monday it has invested $2 billion in CoreWeave to hasten the data center company’s efforts to add more than 5 gigawatts of AI computing capacity by 2030.\nThe chipmaker, already an investor in CoreWeave, said it had bought the company’s Class A shares at $87.20 per share. As part of the deal, CoreWeave and Nvidia plan to together build “AI factories” (data centers) that would use the chipmaker’s products. \nCoreWeave will also integrate Nvidia’s products across its platform, including the new Rubin chip architecture (set to replace the current Blackwell architecture), Bluefield storage systems, as well as the chipmaker’s new CPU line, Vera. \nThe deal is a strong show of support for CoreWeave, which has come under scrutiny over the past few months for raising billions in debt to continue building out its data center operations. The company had $18.81 billion in debt obligations as of September 2025, according to PitchBook data, and it reported revenue of $1.36 billion in the third quarter.\nThe company’s CEO Michael Intrator has defended its business model (funding operations by raising debt with its GPUs as collateral), and has addressed concerns of circular deals in the AI industry by saying companies have to “work together” to address a “violent change in supply and demand.”\nThe company has managed to successfully ride the AI wave since its transition from a crypto mining company to a provider of data center services for AI training and inference. And since its IPO in March last year, it has been busy fleshing out its technology stack with a slew of acquisitions. It acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, and then soon after bought reinforcement learning startup OpenPipe. In October, it agreed to acquire Marimo (an open source Jupyter notebook competitor) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently expanded its cloud partnership with OpenAI.\nThe company currently counts several hyperscalers as customers, including OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs part of the deal, Nvidia will also help CoreWeave buy land and power for data centers, and work with the smaller company to include its AI software and architecture within Nvidia’s reference architecture to sell to cloud businesses and enterprises. \nCoreWeave’s shares were up more than 15% following news of the deal.\nFor Nvidia, arguably the biggest benefactor and driver of the AI boom, the deal is the latest of several dozen investments in the past year as the company does its best to continue fueling the precipitous pace of investment in, and development of, the nascent technology. \n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

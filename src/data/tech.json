The company is pulling in roughly $13 billion in annual revenue, with 70% coming from everyday people paying $20 a month to chat with an AI, according to the Financial Times. That’s pretty wild when you consider ChatGPT has 800 million regular users,  but only 5% are actually paying subscribers.\nRaking in billions though it may be, OpenAI has also committed to spending over $1 trillion over the next decade (yes, trillion). The company has recently locked in deals for more than 26 gigawatts of computing capacity from Oracle, Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom — infrastructure that’ll cost vastly more than what’s coming in.\nTo bridge this gap, OpenAI is getting creative, reports the FT. A five-year-plan includes exploring government contracts, shopping tools, video services, consumer hardware, and even becoming a computing supplier itself through its Stargate data center project.\nA growing number of businesses need to math to work out. Some of America’s most valuable companies are now leaning on OpenAI to fulfill major contracts, notes the FT; if OpenAI falters (no pressure!), it could potentially destabilize the broader U.S. market.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in AI\n",

Facebook also says it will provide tailored recommendations for relevant opportunities based on users’ job browsing history. After submitting their applications, they can chat with companies via Messenger to arrange interviews.\nImage Credits:Facebook\nThe job listings feature initially launched in 2017 in the U.S. and Canada, and then expanded to over 40 countries a year later. However, in 2022, Facebook limited its support to only the U.S. and Canada, ultimately discontinuing the feature in 2023, likely due to the increasing use of LinkedIn.\nMeta didn’t explain why it chose to bring back job listings now. However, it seems like it’s trying to go back to its roots and expand its purpose beyond just social networking. Back in January, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned wanting to see a “return to OG Facebook” as one of his big goals this year during the Q4 earnings call. This could also be a way for Facebook to appeal to younger people who are just starting out in their careers and to draw in more Gen Z users. \nPlus, by prioritizing entry-level, trade, and service industry positions, Facebook aims to differentiate itself from LinkedIn, which tends to cater to medium- and high-skilled job roles. Facebook has more than 3 billion monthly active users, while LinkedIn is catching up with over 1 billion users.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Apps\n",

The company on Tuesday announced that it’s bringing AI answer engine Perplexity to Firefox, letting customers decide whether they want to use AI to search the web and find new information.\nMozilla had previously announced it was testing the integration, but the option was only available in select markets, including the U.S., U.K., and Germany. It was not yet determined if Perplexity would become a permanent addition to Firefox’s list of web search providers, alongside others like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo.\nImage Credits:Mozilla\nNow, the company says that positive user feedback has pushed it to make Perplexity available to its global users on the desktop. It will arrive on mobile devices in the months ahead.\nOnce enabled, Perplexity offers a conversational search experience where answers appear with citations, as opposed to a list of web links, as with Google’s traditional search. The option will appear in the unified search button in the address bar, which lets you quickly switch to search with Perplexity as needed. Users can also configure their default search provider in Firefox’s settings. \nMozilla had earlier said that if the Perplexity pilot was successful, it would look to add more AI answer engines or search options to its browser in the future. (It likely started with Perplexity because the company says it won’t share or sell users’ personal data.)\nAlongside news of the AI search option, Mozilla also noted it’s making its browser profiles broadly available to all users after months of tests and a gradual rollout. This feature lets you switch between different browser setups, like those for work, school, or personal use.\nImage Credits:Mozilla\nPlus, the company continues to test visual search with Google Lens among those who set Google as their default search provider on the desktop.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The company said it uses “intelligent area detection” to blend the background in after an object is removed without affecting the resolution or color.\nUnlike most AI-powered removal tools that leave artifacts at times, VSCO claims its tool is more precise and preserves details, and is therefore better suited for professional photographers.\nVSCO’s new AI-powered image removal tool Image Credits: VSCO\nThe company said that it will soon launch another AI-powered feature called Upscale, which claims to increase the resolution of images and sharpen details without compromising on details or composition.\nVSCO is using Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.1 Kontext model to power these features.\nThe AI Labs features are available on VSCO’s Pro tier, which costs $12.99 a month, or $60 a year, on the VSCO Studio app on iOS. The company is not setting a limit on the number of times users can use AI Labs features.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nYou can use Brush, tap, or Lasso select tools to pick objects to remove from an image Image Credits: VSCO\n“Since our inception, VSCO has supported authentic creative expression and has provided photographers with many ways to achieve their desired success . We see how much AI is impacting photography, and are focused on bringing AI tools to our community that are designed specifically to support photographers in achieving creative excellence while respecting the art of their photography,” Eric Wittman, VSCO’s CEO, said in a statement.\nThe company has been bolstering its toolset to better compete with editing tools. In May, it launched an AI-powered whiteboard to let photographers and their potential clients collaborate on projects, and last year, launched a marketplace to match photographers with clients.

The new capability will help Google Meet compete with other video-conferencing apps that already have virtual makeup features, including Microsoft Teams and Zoom.\nGoogle Meet offers 12 different makeup options to choose from, which can be found in the “Appearance” section under “Portrait touch-up,” which is a feature that has been available since 2023 to provide users with options like complexion smoothing, under-eye lightening, and eye whitening.\nImage Credits:Google Meet\nNotably, Google says that the virtual makeup will stay in place no matter how the user moves on-screen, making it seem more authentic. So, if a user takes a sip of coffee, the filter will stay on their face instead of shifting to the mug.\nAdditionally, the feature will be disabled by default and can be activated by the user either before or during a video call.

    "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:53 AM PDT · October 14, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nImpulse Space laid out an ambitious plan Tuesday to use its tech to haul tons of cargo to the moon as early as 2028, aiming to fill what it sees as a gap in today’s market for mid-sized surface deliveries.\nThe company says it will pair a new lunar lander with its “Helios” high-energy kick stage to move tons to the surface without needing to refuel on orbit. The aim is to deliver up to 6 tons of payload to the moon across two missions “at a cost-effective price point.”\nThe startup, founded by former SpaceX propulsion chief Tom Mueller, argues this capacity would fill a “critical gap” in lunar payload logistics for cargo too big to fit on landers part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program and too small for the forthcoming human-rated landers that are being developed by SpaceX and Blue Origin.\nImpulse says payloads that hit this mark are roughly 0.5 to 13 tons, a range that could include rovers, habitat modules, power generators, comms systems, or even a lunar terrain vehicle.\nUnder the proposed architecture, the lander and kick stage would launch on a standard rocket where they would be deployed in low Earth orbit. Helios would transport the lander to low lunar orbit within seven days, after which the two vehicles would separate, and the lander would descend to the surface.\nImpulse is bringing to the table deep expertise in spacecraft engine development; it is already at work on the lunar lander engine, which uses the same fuel combination as the Saiph thrusters used on the company’s small spacecraft Mira.\nMeanwhile, Helios is “already well into development,” with the first flight scheduled for late 2026. The company estimates it will be flying Helios multiple times per year by 2028.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nExecution risks remain. As the company points out, a lunar lander engine needs to be throttleable, able to restart, and with a high specific impulse to provide ultra-control in the vacuum of space. Impulse seemed to be hedging its bets in a press release, saying, “we stand ready to execute as dictated by industry demand and interest.” But if the company can deliver, it would open up an entirely new lunar delivery schedule.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\n\t\n\t\tImage Credits:Waymo\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2:00 AM PDT · October 15, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\nWaymo said on Wednesday it will offer a commercial robotaxi service in London in 2026, marking the Alphabet-owned company’s second international expansion following Tokyo.\nThe announcement follows weeks of speculation fueled by a couple of London-based job postings. Waymo already has ties to the U.K: In 2019, the company acquired Latent Logic, a U.K. startup spun out of Oxford University’s computer science department that uses a form of machine learning called imitation learning to make self-driving car simulation more realistic. Waymo launched an engineering hub in Oxford as part of the acquisition.\nIn a blog post, Waymo said its all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles — equipped with self-driving technology — will begin driving on London’s public roads in the coming weeks. Waymo will start with human safety drivers behind the wheel before it launches driverless testing and eventually invites the public to hail its robotaxis, a strategy that it has used in other commercial markets such as Phoenix and San Francisco.\nWaymo wouldn’t provide further details on when it would remove the human safety driver, or the size of the testing fleet. Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher did confirm the company intends to operate a self-driving car service for public riders next year.\nWhen that robotaxi service launches in 2026 will depend on the U.K. government finalizing its approval process for those operations. \nWaymo has increasingly tapped partners to share the load of operating a robotaxi service, and similarly plans to use Moove, which already manages its autonomous vehicles (AVs) in Phoenix, to handle fleet operations in London. \nIn Austin and Atlanta, its partner Uber splits the responsibilities of owning and operating a fleet of driverless vehicles, handling the charging, maintenance and cleaning of the AVs, and manages access to the robotaxis via its app. Meanwhile, Waymo monitors the tech and the autonomous operations, including roadside assistance and certain aspects of rider support.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nWaymo has ramped up its testing and commercial operations over the past two years, spreading beyond its initial market of Phoenix to several other U.S. cities, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The company also has plans to offer a commercial robotaxi service in Miami, Nashville and Washington DC.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

    "body": "\nCoinbase has increased its investment in India’s CoinDCX, valuing the exchange at $2.45 billion post-money, as the U.S. crypto giant bets on the country’s digital-asset potential even as regulation remains unclear.\nThe investment is an extension of CoinDCX’s previous funding round and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the companies said on Wednesday. They did not disclose the amount invested or the size of Coinbase’s stake, but noted that the new round increased the Indian exchange’s valuation from $2.15 billion in its last raise in April 2022.\nCoinDCX confirmed to TechCrunch that the latest funding is an investment of new capital by Coinbase. The U.S. exchange has been an investor in CoinDCX since 2020 and last backed the Indian exchange in its Series D round in 2022 through its venture capital arm, Coinbase Ventures.\nNotably, the funding comes just months after CoinDCX suffered a security breach in July that led to the theft of around $44 million worth of assets. It comes amid reports earlier this year suggesting that Coinbase was acquiring CoinDCX — claims that the Indian exchange’s CEO denied at the time.\n“This investment adds to our growing presence in the region, where we also maintain local operations and other important local partners,” said Coinbase’s chief business officer, Shan Aggarwal, in a blog post. “Taken together, these steps reflect a clear commitment: we believe India and its neighbors will help shape the future of the global onchain economy.”\nMore than a year after ceasing operations in India, Coinbase re-entered the market earlier this year by registering with the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit. The U.S. exchange is also an investor in CoinSwitch, another leading Indian crypto platform.\nIndia, the world’s most populous country and home to more than a billion internet subscribers, is a key market for U.S. tech giants. However, the South Asian nation remains a relatively small market for crypto, partly due to regulatory uncertainty and the government’s flat 30% tax on digital asset gains, along with a 1% levy on each transaction. New Delhi also restricts offshore crypto exchanges unless they register with its financial watchdog. Recently, 25 global platforms — including BingX, LBank, and CoinW — came under government scrutiny for failing to register and comply with anti–money laundering rules.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCoinbase’s move to double down on CoinDCX to expand its presence in India makes strategic sense, as the Indian exchange has a strong local footprint with more than 20.4 million users. In July, CoinDCX reported customer assets exceeding ₹100 billion (about $1.12 billion), annualized group revenue of ₹11.79 billion (around $133 million), and annualized transaction volumes across products totaling ₹13.7 trillion (roughly $154.6 billion).\nIn addition to India, CoinDCX expanded into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) last year by acquiring BitOasis. Coinbase could leverage that footprint to strengthen its presence in the region, one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally.\nThe new capital will be used to enhance products, drive user growth, expand into new geographies, and deepen educational initiatives, CoinDCX said in a statement.\n“We see strong synergies with Coinbase in building a compliant and regulatory-friendly crypto ecosystem in India, MENA, and beyond,” Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, said.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nStellantis, the international automaker that owns Chrysler, Jeep, and Ram, said it will invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years as part of a broader revival plan directed by its new CEO.\nFive new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The investment will also support the production of a new four-cylinder engine and reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which will allow the automaker to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. In all, more than 5,000 jobs will be created.\nUnlike previous multibillion-dollar investment pledges, however, this one doesn’t focus on electrification.\nOne of the five new vehicles will be a range-extended EV — a vehicle that combines a battery with a gas generator for additional range — produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan beginning in 2028. The automaker also plans to produce a large, new, gas-powered SUV at the Warren plant.\nThe remaining products include a next-generation Dodge Durango that will be produced at the Detroit Assembly Complex in 2029, a new midsize truck that will be assembled at its Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio, and an all-new four-cylinder engine called the GMET4 EVO that will go into production beginning in 2026 at its Kokomo, Indiana, factory.\nImage Credits:Stellantis\nStellantis CEO and North America COO Antonio Filosa said the investment will drive the automaker’s growth, strengthen its manufacturing footprint, and “bring more American jobs to the states we call home.”\n“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” Filosa said in a statement.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nStellantis has scaled back its electrification plans for the U.S. market in the past year. The automaker said in September it would no longer include an electrified Gladiator in its Jeep lineup as it reassessed its product strategy. Earlier that month, the automaker said it canceled plans to produce a battery-electric full-size pickup. However, Stellantis said it still planned to produce an extended-range Ram 1500 REV, formerly called the Ramcharger. \n\n\n\t\tKirsten Korosec is a reporter and editor who has covered the future of transportation from EVs and autonomous vehicles to urban air mobility and in-car tech for more than a decade.

According to YouTube, these videos come from reputable sources and are tailored to the developmental stage of teenagers. The company collaborated with organizations that specialize in mental health and well-being information for young people, such as the Child Mind Institute.\nImage Credits:YouTube\nThis launch signifies a move toward making YouTube a trustworthy resource for younger users facing mental health challenges. A 2023 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that 39.7% of students felt ongoing sadness and hopelessness, while 28.5% reported poor mental health.\nThis is a notable addition for the platform as it’s important to reach teens where they already seek information, such as YouTube, with nine out of 10 teens reporting they use the platform, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOver the years, YouTube has invested in various initiatives to assist teenagers. These include implementing specific safeguards when recommending certain topics to teens, using age-estimation technology to recognize teenage users for a more suitable experience, and providing parental controls that allow parents to link their accounts to their teens’ accounts.\nThe new mental health and well-being offering is rolling out to users in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Mexico, France, and Australia in the coming weeks. \n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced in a post on X Tuesday the company will soon relax some of ChatGPT’s safety restrictions, allowing users to make the chatbot’s responses friendlier or more “human-like,” and for “verified adults” to engage in erotic conversations.\n“We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,” said Altman. “In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.”\n\nWe made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.Now that we have…— Sam Altman (@sama) October 14, 2025\n\nThe announcement is a notable pivot from OpenAI’s months-long effort to address the concerning relationships that some mentally unstable users have developed with ChatGPT. Altman seems to declare an early victory over these problems, claiming OpenAI has “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues” around ChatGPT. However, the company has provided little to no evidence for this, and is now plowing ahead with plans for ChatGPT to engage in sexual chats with users.\nSeveral concerning stories emerged this summer around ChatGPT, specifically its GPT-4o model, suggesting the AI chatbot could lead vulnerable users down delusional rabbit holes. In one case, ChatGPT seemed to convince a man he was a math genius who needed to save the world. In another, the parents of a teenager sued OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT encouraged their son’s suicidal ideations in the weeks leading up to his death.\nIn response, OpenAI released a series of safety features to address AI sycophancy: the tendency for an AI chatbot to hook users by agreeing with whatever they say, even negative behaviors. \nOpenAI launched GPT-5 in August, a new AI model that exhibits lower rates of sycophancy and features a router that can identify concerning user behavior. A month later, OpenAI launched safety features for minors, including an age prediction system and a way for parents to control their teen’s ChatGPT account. OpenAI announced Tuesday the formation of an expert council of mental health professionals to advise the company on well-being and AI.\nJust a few months after these concerning stories emerged, OpenAI seems to think ChatGPT’s problems around vulnerable users are under control. It’s unclear whether users are still falling down delusional rabbit holes with GPT-5. And while GPT-4o is no longer the default in ChatGPT, the AI model is still available today and being used by thousands of people.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe introduction of erotica in ChatGPT is unchartered territory for OpenAI and raises broader concerns around how vulnerable users will interact with the new features. While Altman insists OpenAI isn’t “usage-maxxing” or optimizing for engagement, making ChatGPT more erotic could certainly draw users in.\nAllowing chatbots to engage in romantic or erotic role play has been an effective engagement strategy for other AI chatbot providers, such as Character.AI. The company has gained tens of millions of users, many of whom use its chatbots at a high rate. Character.AI said in 2023 that users spent an average of two hours a day talking to its chatbots. The company is also facing a lawsuit around how it handles vulnerable users.\nOpenAI is under pressure to grow its user base. While ChatGPT is already used by 800 million weekly active users, OpenAI is racing against Google and Meta to build mass-adopted AI-powered consumer products. The company has also raised billions of dollars for a historic infrastructure buildout, an investment OpenAI eventually needs to pay back.\nWhile adults are surely having romantic relationships with AI chatbots, it’s also quite popular for minors. A new report from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that 19% of high school students have either had a romantic relationship with an AI chatbot, or know a friend who has.\nAltman says OpenAI will soon allow erotica for “verified adults.” An OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch the company will rely on the age-prediction system it’s building to ensure that ChatGPT’s erotic features are only available to adult users.\nAs Altman previously wrote in a blog post, if OpenAI’s age-prediction system incorrectly marks an adult as a minor, ChatGPT users may have to upload a picture of their government-issued ID into ChatGPT to correct it. Altman writes that, though this is a privacy compromise, the company believes it’s a “worthy tradeoff.”\nIt is unclear whether OpenAI will extend erotica to its AI voice, image, and video generation tools.\nAltman claims that OpenAI is also making ChatGPT friendlier and erotic because of the company’s “treat adult users like adults” principle. Over the last year, OpenAI has shifted towards a more lenient content moderation strategy for ChatGPT, allowing the chatbot to be more permissive and offer less refusals. In February, OpenAI pledged to represent more political viewpoints in ChatGPT, and in March, the company updated ChatGPT to allow AI-generated images of hate symbols.\nThese policies seem to be an attempt to make ChatGPT’s response more popular with a wide variety of users. However, vulnerable ChatGPT users may benefit from safeguards that limit what a chatbot can engage with. As OpenAI races towards a billion weekly active users, the tension between growth and protecting vulnerable users may only grow.\nUpdate 10/14/25 at 4:40pm PT: This story has been updated to include comment from OpenAI.\n\n\n\t\tMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body": "\nA decade ago, two college students built a fire extinguisher that snuffed out a fire using nothing more than a booming 10-inch subwoofer. The internet lapped it up, and Jimmy Fallon even booked a demonstration for “The Tonight Show.”\nBut since that brief viral moment, there hasn’t been much more than a whisper about the technology.\nIt’s not for lack of trying. The college kids weren’t the first to prove the concept. DARPA was on the case in 2012; and a search of the scientific literature reveals dozens of researchers investigating the idea.\nOne startup now claims to have cracked the problem. Sonic Fire Tech has built an acoustic fire suppression system that doesn’t just extinguish flames, it might also protect homes and other buildings from wildfires. The startup has raised a $3.5 million seed round from investors, including Khosla Ventures and Third Sphere, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\nWildfires cost the U.S. as much as $424 billion annually. The problem has become so acute in places like California that insurers are refusing to renew policies after repeated blazes have reduced large swathes of the state to ashes.\nSonic Fire Tech has been developing its technology over the last several years. Michael Thomas, who is chairman of the startup’s board, had been tinkering with the idea of using sound to fight fires, and when he hit a wall, he reached out to Geoff Bruder over LinkedIn. Bruder had worked for NASA, where he focused on heat and acoustics. \n“This is kind of a new-age founding story,” Bruder, the startup’s CEO and CTO, told TechCrunch.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nBruder was intrigued with Thomas’ idea and set about building a prototype. “I got a subwoofer and some parts from Home Depot and AutoZone and said, ‘Hey, let’s see if we can do any better than other people had,’” Bruder recalled. “We knocked a fire out from seven feet in my driveway.”\n\n\n\nThe startup soon ditched the subwoofer and moved to lower frequencies. The problem with audible frequencies is that any system powerful enough to suppress a fire would be damaging to people’s hearing, Bruder said. “You’ve basically got to throw a speaker design in the trash and start from scratch,” he said.\nThere are competing theories as to how exactly acoustic energy can disrupt combustion, but the soundless demonstrations certainly suggest that Sonic Fire Tech is onto something.\nThe new system uses a reciprocating piston much like those inside a car’s engine, but it is significantly larger. An electric motor turns a crankshaft, which pulses the two-foot piston to produce infrasound, the technical term for sound that’s below people’s hearing range, or about 20 Hz. \n“Since we designed everything ourselves, we dropped the frequency to where we’re below audible range, which helps us transmit further, and it makes it safe,” Bruder said.\nSonic Fire Tech’s current record is 25 feet. A bigger system could work as far away as 330 feet, Bruder said. The company plans to sell and install its system for about 2% of a home’s value, and it’s talking with insurance companies to qualify the technology. \nTo protect a house, Sonic Fire Tech routes infrasound from a single generator through rigid ducts that sit on the roof’s ridge and under the eaves. On the ridge, they fire down the pitch to catch any fires that might start in debris in the gutters. Under the eaves, they are aimed toward the ground to suppress any flames that pop up near the walls. The system turns on when sensors detect a flame.\nA home-based system draws around 500 watts of electricity, and in case of a power outage, Sonic Fire Tech is drawing up plans to use lead-acid batteries for backup. Unlike sprinkler systems, it doesn’t require a source of water, which can be in short supply in wildfire country.\nThe startup is working with PG&E and Southern California Edison to demonstrate the technology on homes, and it has signed a letter of intent with a chemical storage facility. \n“The natural progression is, if we get certified as a sprinkler replacement, then you can just run a pipe into your house and protect your kitchen and everywhere you would need to protect,” Bruder said.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nWalmart announced on Tuesday a new partnership with OpenAI that will allow consumers to shop Walmart’s products via the AI chatbot, including things like groceries (not fresh food), household essentials, and more, and then instantly check out.\nThe agentic shopping feature will also allow Sam’s Club members to plan meals and restock essentials while also discovering new items when chatting with the AI, the company says.\nTo use the feature, customers will press a “buy” button in ChatGPT’s app when they shop, after linking their Walmart accounts to ChatGPT. Products from third-party sellers will also be supported when the feature rolls out later this fall. \nWalmart explains that the new agreement with OpenAI will allow the retailer to better learn and predict customers’ needs, making online shopping more personalized and proactive, instead of only reactive. \nThe partnership follows OpenAI’s recent announcement of its plan to enter the world of e-commerce with an agentic shopping system, which includes product discovery, recommendation, and payments. Initially, OpenAI is teaming up with Etsy and Shopify sellers, the company said. \nThe ChatGPT-focused shopping feature won’t be the only way consumers can shop with AI. Alongside other AI investments, Walmart recently introduced its own generative AI shopping assistant, Sparky, designed to help customers discover and compare products and make purchases. The feature will expand to include reordering, service booking, and understanding multimodal inputs from text, images, audio, and video.\nThe retailer has an existing relationship with OpenAI in other areas of its business, as well, having adopted OpenAI Certifications and ChatGPT Enterprise for its internal teams. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club broadly use AI to do other things, like speeding up fashion production by up to 18 weeks and improving customer care time frames by up to 40%.\n“For many years now, e-commerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses. That is about to change,” noted Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon in a prepared statement. “There is a native AI experience coming that is multimedia, personalized, and contextual. We are running towards that more enjoyable and convenient future with Sparky and through partnerships, including this important step with OpenAI,” he added.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nSpotify is bringing its video podcasts to Netflix starting next year, the company announced on Tuesday. Amid the company’s push to further expand its video content selection and boost its ads business, Spotify has announced a partnership with Netflix that will showcase select video podcasts on the popular streaming service.\nAt launch, the Netflix-Spotify partnership will bring a curated selection of sports, culture, lifestyle, and true crime podcasts from Spotify Studios and The Ringer to Netflix. Over time, the deal will see Spotify adding even more podcasts from other studios and genres, Spotify said.\nThe move follows Spotify’s increased focus on video podcasts, beginning with the launch of tools that made it possible for anyone to publish their shows as videos. Over the past year, the company has added incentives that paid podcaster hosts for their popular videos and launched a Partner Program so hosts could monetize their video content, in a challenge to YouTube.\nSpotify has also recently rolled out a number of social tools that let hosts engage their audiences, including polls, Q&As, comments, and more.\nSpotify’s interest in streaming video comes after a major shift in its podcast strategy back in 2023, which included layoffs, including that of chief content and business officer Dawn Ostroff, who had led its podcast initiatives. During Ostroff’s time at the service, Spotify had invested billions in podcasts, buying studios like Parcast, The Ringer, and Gimlet Media, and signing exclusive podcast deals with big names like Joe Rogan and Alex Cooper, which have since expired.\nHowever, Spotify’s investments failed to turn into substantial profits, necessitating a new strategy. Video, which is heavily consumed by Gen Z users in particular, offers more opportunities for ad products and monetization, the company now believes. As of Q2 2025, the company said it now has more than 430,000 video podcasts on its service, and video consumption is growing 20x faster than audio-only consumption since 2024. More than 350 million Spotify users have also streamed a video on its platform, up 65% year-over-year.\nReached for comment, Spotify declined to share the details of its deal with Netflix, in terms of ad-sharing or monetization. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 27-29, 2025\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nInitially, Spotify’s video podcasts will be made available to users in the U.S. starting in early 2026. Other global markets will follow. \n“This partnership marks a new chapter for podcasting,” said Spotify VP and Head of Podcasts Roman Wasenmüller, in an announcement. “Together with Netflix, we’re expanding discovery, helping creators reach new audiences and giving fans around the world the chance to experience the stories they love and uncover favorites they never expected. This offers more choice to creators and unlocks a completely new distribution opportunity,” he added.\nSpotify’s stock declined after its last earnings release in July as the company’s ad-supported revenues dropped despite a growing user and subscriber base. The company told investors at the time that it still believed in its overall strategy and its ability to turn around its programmatic ad business.\nThe following Spotify shows are included in the distribution partnership:\n\nThe Bill Simmons Podcast\nThe Zach Lowe Show\nThe McShay Show\nFairway Rollin’\nThe Mismatch\nThe Ringer F1 Show\nThe Ringer Fantasy Football Show\nThe Ringer NFL Show\nThe Ringer NBA Show\nThe Rewatchables\nThe Big Picture\nThe Dave Chang Show\nThe Recipe Club\nDissect\nConspiracy Theories\nSerial Killers\n\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

Should investor interest be high, it could wind up pricing higher. That means a bigger valuation and more money raised.\nThe company, which offers software to sell life insurance, is backed by Sequoia, Accel, Alphabet’s venture capital arm GV, SoftBank, General Catalyst, and Heroic Ventures. Sequoia and Accel are not selling shares in the IPO, the company disclosed.\nEthos was a rising startup star in the pre-AI era, raising one big round after another through 2021. In its early rounds, it was backed by a who’s who of family offices, including those of Will Smith, Robert Downey Jr., Kevin Durant, and Jay-Z, the company told TechCrunch in 2018. \nIt hit a $2.7 billion valuation in 2021 having raised $400 million by then, most of it that year. It completed only very small fundraises after that, PitchBook estimates.  \nEthos is profitable and has been for years, its IPO documents disclose. In the nine months ending September 30, Ethos generated almost $278 million in revenue and just under $46.6 million in net income. \n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in Venture\n\n",

A number of teen suicides have been linked to the chatbot, and, like other AI vendors, OpenAI has also been criticized for allowing ChatGPT to discuss sexual topics with young users. Last April, the company was forced to address a bug that allowed its chatbot to generate erotica for users who were under the age of 18.\nThe company has already been working on its underage user problem for some time, and its new “age prediction” feature merely adds to protections already in place. The new feature leverages an AI algorithm that assesses user accounts for particular “behavioral and account-level signals,” in an effort to identify young users, OpenAI said in a blog post Tuesday.\nThose “signals” include things like the user’s stated age, the length of time an account has existed, and the times of day that the account is usually active, the company said. The company already has content filters designed to weed out discussions of sex, violence, and other potentially problematic topics for users who are under age 18. If the age prediction mechanism identifies an account as under 18, those filters are automatically applied.\nIf a user is mistakenly designated as underage, there is a way for them to reestablish their “adult” account. They can submit a selfie to OpenAI’s ID verification partner Persona, OpenAI says.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\n",

    "body": "\nInvestors and companies alike are trying to leverage developmental gains in AI to make leaps in technologies like robotics and autonomous vehicles — what’s being referred to now as “physical AI.” That means some of the billions of dollars flowing to AI startups is starting to spill toward suppliers doing behind-the-scenes work to make these technologies real.\nThe latest case is Ethernovia, which on Tuesday announced a $90 million Series B. The company, located in San Jose, makes Ethernet-based processors that help collect data from sensors scattered around a system — like in an autonomous vehicle — and quickly move it to a central computer.\nThe company was already backed by Porsche SE and Qualcomm Ventures, but this round was led by Maverick Silicon — an AI-focused fund created in 2024 by hedge fund Maverick Capital. It was the first sector-specific fund that Maverick Capital launched in its 30-year history. It’s that kind of attention and funding that we’ll likely see more of this year as investors look to boost more under-the-radar companies like Ethernovia.\n",

    "body": "\nAs YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram continue to dominate mobile viewing, Netflix is rethinking how its app fits into a social-first video landscape. During its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the company announced plans to revamp its mobile app and expand its short-form video feature, which it mentions could help promote the new slate of original video podcasts it unveiled last week.\nSet to launch later in 2026, Netflix’s redesigned mobile app is intended to “better serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come,” according to co-CEO Greg Peters. The update will act as a foundation for ongoing experimentation, allowing the company to “iterate, test, evolve, and improve” its offering over time.\nAt the center of the redesign is deeper integration of vertical video feeds, which the streaming giant has been experimenting with since May. The feed displays short clips from Netflix shows and movies in a format familiar to TikTok and Instagram Reels users. \n“You can imagine us bringing more clips based on new content types, like video podcasts,” Peters remarked during the earnings call, further signaling that Netflix sees swipeable short-form clips as a powerful tool for capturing attention and increasing time spent in the app.\nNetflix is also making a significant push into video podcasts — a sector where YouTube has long been the leader. This week, Netflix debuted its first original video podcasts, including shows hosted by high-profile personalities such as Pete Davidson and Michael Irvin. The company has also partnered with major podcast players to bring established video podcast libraries to the platform, including tie-ups with Spotify and iHeartMedia.\nBoth of these moves signal a broader effort to make content discovery and daily engagement on Netflix feel more like a social platform experience. At the same time, Netflix has been careful to position its strategy as experimentation rather than imitation. Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference, CTO Elizabeth Stone emphasized that the company isn’t trying to become TikTok, but rather to strengthen its entertainment discovery capabilities through mobile-first features.\nDuring the earnings call, co-CEO Ted Sarandos reflected on the wider shift in the streaming industry: services are no longer competing only with one another, but with the entire entertainment industry. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“There’s never been more competition for creators, for consumer attention, for advertising and subscription dollars, the competitive lines around TV consumption are already blurring,” Sarandos said. “TV is not what we grew up on. TV is now just about everything. The Oscars and the NFL are on YouTube…Apple’s competing for Emmys and Oscars, and Instagram is coming next.”\nSarandos also commented on Netflix’s evolving film strategy, referencing the company’s recent shift in its theatrical release strategy as it prepares to acquire Warner Bros. This signals an openness to hybrid distribution models, as the line between cinema, streaming, and social content continues to blur.\nIn 2025, Netflix delivered $45.2 billion in revenue, with ad revenue rising to over $1.5 billion. Additionally, Netflix crossed the 325 million paid subscriptions milestone in the fourth quarter. \n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nCorina Marshall spent 11 years working in retail digital marketing and realized the industry was behind the times. \nSpecifically, the technology that helped retail brands sell unsold or excess products (off-channel inventory) wasn’t as sophisticated as it could have been. Brands sell their excess inventory at discount retailers like Nordstrom Rack, but often lose money because managing unsold inventory is difficult. Products are spread across warehouses, and teams are left guessing the value of an item and when the best time to sell it is. \n“Too much time passes between each step of the off-channel inventory funnel, making it difficult to move products to the destinations that are most favorable for the brands and retailers,” Marshall told TechCrunch. \nShe decided to give the off-channel market a tech boost. In 2024, she launched her company Another, a software system that helps companies manage unsold or excess products. The secondary markets where these items are usually sold operate under tight timelines and can feature highly dynamic pricing due to fluctuating demand. For a retailer to succeed in a place like Nordstrom Rack, it needs to have fast access to real-time data and coordination so that clothes can efficiently move from the retailer to the warehouse to the store, she said.\nAnother connects to a business’s existing software systems, such as those that manage customer returns, to better centralize an organization’s data and workflows. This way, teams across the company can access data from the same place, making decision-making more effective. \nThe company announced Tuesday a $2.5 million seed round led by Anthemis FIL and Westbound. \nMarshall said she met her lead investors through an industry event last year and said the fresh capital will be used to speed product development and hire. She considers her competitors’ marketplaces like Ghost, another company that also helps brands sell unsold inventory.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHowever, she said, Another hopes to help companies address excess inventory before brands opt to sell items to bulk resellers. She says items sold through such resellers may be deeply discounted, an outcome brands might not want.\n“Another’s technology provides real-time data and insights that give teams confidence in when, where, and how to move inventory, enabling smarter decisions that maximize value rather than defaulting to liquidation,” she said. Overall, she hopes her product helps move the industry toward solutions that better balance profitability and sustainability, as excess inventory is often destroyed if it is not moved quickly enough. \n“Consumers gain access to better prices, more optionality, while brands and retailers improve profitability and reduce waste, making it a win for everyone involved.” \n\n\n\t\tDominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

Russell had argued he was unwilling to turn over his phone until he received assurances from Luminar that his personal information would be protected; the Tuesday filing shows the two sides agreed to hash out exact steps on how that information will be handled.\nLuminar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December after losing major contracts with customers like Volvo and Mercedes-Benz, as well as rising competition from lidar companies in China.\nLuminar reached a deal last week with a company called Quantum Computing Inc. (QCI) to sell its lidar assets for $22 million. (Luminar is also trying to sell its semiconductor division to QCI for $110 million.) Luminar has scheduled an auction for the end of this month in an attempt to solicit bids that might beat QCI’s offer.\nRussell tried to buy Luminar in October, months after his abrupt resignation as CEO due to an ethics inquiry, but before the company filed for bankruptcy. Representatives for his new venture, Russell AI Labs, have told TechCrunch that he remains interested in submitting a bid for Luminar’s lidar assets, but a formal offer has not yet been submitted.\nLuminar has been seeking information from Russell since his resignation as it decides whether to take legal action against him. The founder has already turned over multiple computers but held on to his phone because of privacy concerns. (Luminar originally claimed it was seeking two phones from Russell, one provided by the company and one personal. Russell has since said in court filings that he only ever had one phone during his time at Luminar.)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "body": "\nElon Musk said over the long weekend that Tesla aims to restart work on Dojo3, the electric vehicle company’s previously abandoned third-generation AI chip. Only this time, Dojo3 won’t be aimed at training self-driving models on Earth. Instead, Musk says it will be dedicated to “space-based AI compute.”\nThe move comes five months after Tesla effectively shut down its Dojo effort. The company disbanded the team behind its Dojo supercomputer following the departure of Dojo lead Peter Bannon. Around 20 Dojo workers also left to join DensityAI, a new AI infrastructure startup founded by former Dojo head Ganesh Venkataramanan and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.\nAt the time of Dojo’s shutdown, Bloomberg reported Tesla planned to increase its reliance on Nvidia and other partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing, rather than continue developing its own custom silicon. Musk’s latest comments suggest the strategy has shifted again.\nThe billionaire executive and Republican megadonor said in a post on X the decision to revive Dojo was based on the state of its in-house chip roadmap, noting that Tesla’s AI5 chip design was “in good shape.”\nTesla’s AI5 chip, made by TSMC, was designed to power the automaker’s automated driving features and Optimus humanoid robots. Last summer, Tesla signed a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to build its AI6 chips that promise to power Tesla vehicles and Optimus, as well as enable high-performance AI training in data centers. \n“AI7/Dojo3 will be for space-based AI compute,” Musk said on Sunday, positioning the resurrected project as more of a moonshot. \nTo achieve that, Tesla is now gearing up to rebuild the team it dismantled months ago. Musk used the same post to recruit engineers directly, writing: “If you’re interested in working on what will be the highest volume chips in the world, send a note to AI_Chips@Tesla.com with 3 bullet points on the toughest technical problems you’ve solved.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe timing of the announcement is notable. At CES 2026, Nvidia unveiled Alpamayo, an open source AI model for autonomous driving that directly challenges Tesla’s FSD software. Musk commented on X that solving the long tail of rare edge cases in driving is “super hard,” adding: “I honestly hope they succeed.” \nMusk and several other AI executives have argued the future of data centers may lie off-planet, since Earth’s power grids are already strained to the max. Axios recently reported Musk rival and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also excited by the prospect of putting data centers into orbit. Musk has an edge over his peers because he already controls the launch vehicles.\nPer Axios, Musk plans to use SpaceX’s upcoming IPO to help finance his vision of using Starship to launch a constellation of compute satellites that can operate in constant sunlight, harvesting solar power 24/7. \nStill, there are many roadblocks to making AI data centers in space a possibility, not least the challenge of cooling high-power compute in a vacuum. Musk’s comments of Tesla building “space-based AI compute” fit a familiar pattern: float an idea that sounds far-fetched, then try to brute-force it into reality. \n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nServe Robotics, the sidewalk delivery robot company backed by Nvidia and Uber, is expanding into a new category with its latest acquisition: healthcare. \nLos Angeles-based Serve Robotics announced Tuesday it was acquiring Diligent Robotics, a startup that builds robots named Moxi designed to assist in hospitals by delivering lab samples, supplies, and other tasks. The deal values Diligent’s common stock at $29 million.\nDiligent Robotics was founded in 2017 by Andrea Thomaz and Vivian Chu and has raised more than $75 million in venture capital — most recently raising a $25 million funding round in 2023.\nThe acquisition marks Serve’s first foray beyond its food-delivery roots. The sidewalk delivery robots company was incubated inside food delivery company Postmates in 2017. The project continued after Uber bought Postmates, before spinning off in 2021. Serve went public in April 2024 via a reverse merger.\nServe co-founder and CEO Ali Kashani doesn’t view the acquisition as a big deviation from the company’s initial target.\nWhile the company hasn’t focused specifically on healthcare thus far, how Diligent’s robot Moxi operates does fit squarely into the company’s thesis around last-mile delivery and robots that can navigate alongside humans, Kashani told TechCrunch in a recent interview. \n“This is a kind of a classic example of a prepared mind meets opportunity,” Kashani said. “Robots that are moving among people is the broader opportunity for us. Once you solve the problem, which is how to get robots to seamlessly move among people as autonomous machines, then you can bring it to a lot of other environments. We knew that we wanted to do this someday.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nHealthcare wasn’t a specific goal for expansion either, Kashani said, but rather the companies were introduced at the perfect time. Diligent was looking to scale and Serve was opportunistically looking into new areas.\n“We love the team; they have very similar DNA to us, which is, rather than building in a lab, they build in real life,” Kashani said. “It just seems like it’s really aligned with our mission.”\nDiligent will continue to operate relatively independently within Serve, Kashani said. Diligent will tap into Serve’s software and tools to help them work toward scale and the companies will share tech and collaborate, he added.\nKashani said this isn’t a pivot for the company, nor does it mean that Serve is looking to acquire more startups, he added. Kashani, who emphasized that Serve is still very focused on its sidewalk-delivery robots, said they would “keep our eyes open” for interesting companies as potential partners, not necessarily acquisition targets.\nServe was able to grow its fleet of robots in 2025 from 100 to more than 2,000, he said. The company also signed a partnership with DoorDash to facilitate some of their deliveries in Los Angeles in October.\n“Our sidewalk business is what’s fueling everything,” Kashani said. “It’s creating the technology. It’s one of the largest autonomous fleets in the world right now and developing that helps us create everything that we need in other applications.”\n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nGrubhub parent company, Wonder, announced that it has acquired Claim, a restaurant rewards app.\nFounded in 2021, Claim offers cash-back rewards for local restaurants that users can redeem for dine-in or pickup orders. Restaurants partner with Claim to create promotions, boost foot traffic, and track performance insights through the Claim dashboard.\nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed; however, Claim raised a total of $20 million, it said, when it raised its $12 million Series A in October, 2024. PitchBook estimated its valuation at $62 million.\nGrubhub says the acquisition will give restaurants on its platform access to Claim’s customer acquisition and retention tools, while Grubhub diners will receive additional savings and rewards for dining out.\n“By combining a delightful rewards experience and powerful machine learning models, we match restaurants with their next regulars. Claim is a game-changer for these businesses, and joining Grubhub marks an exciting new chapter as we scale to reach millions more diners and thousands of restaurants,” Claim CEO and co-founder Sam Obletz in a statement.\nGrubhub told TechCrunch that all members of the Claim team were extended offers to join Grubhub. \nUnder Grubhub, Claim will enable more restaurants to connect with consumers through personalized rewards. Grubhub says this will reduce customer-acquisition costs and drive repeat visits, all without adding operational complexity.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“Claim’s innovative rewards technology introduces a powerful new way for our restaurant partners to engage in-person diners and builds on Grubhub’s robust existing suite of marketing tools,” said Grubhub CEO Howard Migdal in a statement. “With Grubhub and Claim together under one roof, we can scale Claim’s data-driven tools to our more than 415,000 merchants and help our nearly 20 million diners save more money at the restaurants they love.”\nClaim is now available to Grubhub merchants and diners in New York City, with a nationwide rollout planned for later this year.\nGrubhub told TechCrunch that Claim will continue to be available to its current merchants and consumers through the Claim app and website “for the time being.” In the coming months, the company plans to create a “streamlined experience” across the Grubhub and Claim apps for both restaurant partners and diners, but didn’t share specifics on what this could look like. \nFor current Claim users, Grubhub says there may be some changes to the product and how rewards are paid out, but that users can continue to expect personalized promotions and rewards for going to local restaurants. \nInvestors in Claim included VMG Technology, Sequoia Capital, Susa Ventures, Lightbank, and Metalab Ventures.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nOne of the more prominent alternative app stores that emerged in the EU as a result of the region’s Digital Markets Act is shutting down. The store, Setapp Mobile, from the Ukrainian-based developer MacPaw, first launched in September 2024, offering dozens of apps across categories like productivity, finance, video, photo, creativity, and more.\nIts model offered consumers access to all of Setapp’s mobile apps through a $9.99 monthly subscription, provided the user’s Apple ID was associated with an EU member state.\nNow the company says all applications will be removed from Setapp Mobile by the end of the sunset date, February 16, 2026. Applications that are available on Setapp Desktop will not be affected, the company told TechCrunch.\nThe news of the shutdown, announced on Setapp’s support site, was first spotted by MacRumors.\nMacPaw stated that “still-evolving and complex business terms that don’t fit Setapp’s current business model” are the reason for its decision.\nThe “complex business terms” being referenced here are Apple’s complicated set of fees for apps operating under its new business terms in the EU, which include a controversial Core Technology Fee that charges developers €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months.\nThe tech giant revised its fee structure last year to avoid further penalties for noncompliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), but instead of simplifying the fees, it made them more complex.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nOne result of these constant changes is that developers can’t properly plan how to grow and monetize their business. It also suggests the fees, as they stand, don’t make running an alternative app store in the EU a viable option.\nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch, Setapp said it found its business model was not “viable,” as the commercial conditions continued to change. The statement reads:\n\nSetapp Mobile was a bold, breakthrough project that aimed to provide EU iOS users with access to alternative app marketplaces — creating a new app ecosystem where both developers and users could thrive. We are proud of what we have accomplished with it over the past two years and still believe passionately in this vision. As a result of still-evolving commercial conditions, we have determined that it is not viable to continue development or support for Setapp Mobile within Setapp’s current business model. While we are disappointed to discontinue Setapp Mobile and let down our user base and developer community in the EU, we are looking forward to pursuing the development of other innovations.\n\nThere are still other alternative app stores operating in the EU, including, most notably, the Epic Games Store from the maker of Fortnite and the open source AltStore.\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The organization would not say whether it plans to inform users about the security incident. \nLast week, a person who asked not to be named alerted TechCrunch to the security flaw on UStrive’s mentoring platform. By examining the network traffic while signed in and navigating the site — such as viewing user profiles — anyone could see streams of users’ personal information in their browser tools.\nThe person said that UStrive was relying on a vulnerable Amazon-hosted GraphQL endpoint — a type of query database interface — that allowed access to reams of user data stored on UStrive’s servers. Some user records contained more data than others, including information provided by the student, such as their gender and date of birth. The person said that there were at least 238,000 user records at the time of discovery. UStrive meanwhile states on its home page that more than “1.1 million students have opted in for a UStrive mentor.”\nTechCrunch confirmed the data exposure after creating a new user account on UStrive, and notified the company’s executives by email on Thursday.\nJohn D. McIntyre, an attorney with Virginia law firm McIntyre Stein, which is representing UStrive, said in a letter provided to TechCrunch later on Thursday that UStrive is “currently in litigation with one of its former software engineers,” and as such the company is “somewhat limited in its ability to respond.” \nTechCrunch told McIntyre that the company at that time still had a security lapse exposing the private and personal information of children, and asked McIntyre to notify TechCrunch if UStrive planned to fix the data exposure, and if so, by when.\nMcIntyre did not respond to our inquiry. \nIn response to TechCrunch’s initial outreach, UStrive chief technology officer Dwamian Mcleish told TechCrunch by email late on Thursday that the exposure had been “remediated.” \nTechCrunch sent Mcleish follow-up emails with more questions about the incident, including: whether the company plans to notify its users about the security lapse, whether the company has the ability to check if there was any improper or malicious access to users’ data, and whether the company’s platform had undergone a security audit and, if so, by whom.\nUStrive founder Michael J.

    "body": "\nIndustry reports and the growth of voice model companies in the Indian market suggest that there is a growing demand for voice AI solutions in the country. Voice is a popular medium for communication among people and businesses in India. That’s why enterprises and startups are eager to use voice AI to be more efficient at customer support, sales, customer acquisition, hiring, and training.\nBut recognizing market demand is one thing — proving businesses will pay is another. Y Combinator rejected the application from Bolna, a voice orchestration startup built by Maitreya Wagh and Prateek Sachan, five times before finally accepting it into the fall 2025 batch, skeptical that the founders could turn interest into revenue.\n“When we were applying for Y Combinator, the feedback we got was, ‘great to see that you have a product that can create realistic voice agents, but Indian enterprises are not going to pay, and you are not going to make money out of this,’” Wagh told TechCrunch.\nThe startup applied with the same idea for the fall batch but was able to show it had revenue of more than $25,000 coming in every month for the last few months. At that time, the company was running $100 pilots to help users build voice agents. Now the startup is pricing those pilots at $500.\nThe momentum has continued. The startup said on Tuesday that it has raised a $6.3 million seed round led by General Catalyst, with participation from Y Combinator, Blume Ventures, Orange Collective, Pioneer Fund, Transpose Capital, and Eight Capital. The round also includes individual investors, including Aarthi Ramamurthy, Arpan Sheth, Sriwatsan Krishnan, Ravi Iyer, and Taro Fukuyama.\nThe product and customers\nBolna is building an orchestration layer — essentially a platform that connects and manages different AI voice technologies — akin to startups like Vapi, LiveKit, and VoiceRun, to suit the idiosyncrasies of interactions in India, including noise cancellation, getting verification on the caller ID platform Truecaller, and handling mixed languages.\nFeature-wise, the company has built specific nuances for Indian users, such as speaking numbers in English regardless of the core language, or allowing for keypad input for longer inputs.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nImage Credits:Bolna\nWagh noted that the key differentiation of Bolna is that it makes it easy for users to build voice agents by just describing them, even if they don’t know much about the underlying technology, and start using them for calls. The company said that 75% of its revenue is coming from self-serve customers.\nHe also said that because Bolna is an orchestration layer, it doesn’t depend on a single model, so enterprises can easily switch when there is a better model available.\n“Our platform allows customers to switch models easily or even use different models for different locales to get the best out of them. An orchestration layer is necessary for enterprises to ensure they are getting the best models because one model can be better today and another one can be better tomorrow,” Wagh said.\nThe company has a range of clients, including car reselling platform Spinny, on-demand house-help startup Snabbit, beverage companies, and dating apps. Most of these are small to midsize businesses that use Bolna’s self-serve platform.\nSeparately, Bolna is pursuing large enterprise deals. For these large enterprises and custom implementations, Bolna has a team of forward-deployed engineers — specialists who work directly with clients on-site or closely with their teams. The startup has signed two large enterprises as paying customers and has four more in the pilot stage. Currently, Bolna employs nine forward-deployed engineers and is adding two to three people to that team every month to support this enterprise push.\nBolna has seen steady growth in both call volumes and revenue. It say it’s now handling over 200,000 calls per day and on the verge of crossing $700,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company noted that while 60% to 70% of call volume is in English or Hindi, other regional languages are steadily rising.\nAkarsh Shrivastava, who is part of the investment team at General Catalyst, said that the firm found Bolna impressive because its orchestration layer is flexible for various kinds of customers.\n“Bolna allows you the freedom to choose any model and has a stack behind it to mold it according to your requirement. It’s a good option for people who want to own some part of the stack, want flexibility in model picking, and want to be able to maintain those products themselves,” Shrivastava told TechCrunch over a call.\n",

    "body": "\nLast week, after reversing an earlier ban, the U.S. administration officially approved the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips, along with a chip line by AMD, to approved Chinese customers. Maybe they aren’t these chipmakers’ shiniest, most advanced chips, but they’re high-performance processors used for AI, making the export controversial. And at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei unloaded on both the administration and the chip companies over the decision.\nThe criticism was particularly notable because one of those chipmakers, Nvidia, is a major partner and investor in Anthropic.\n“The CEOs of these companies say, ‘It’s the embargo on chips that’s holding us back,’” Amodei  said, incredulous, in response to a question about the new rules. The decision is going to come back to bite the U.S., he warned.\n“We are many years ahead of China in terms of our ability to make chips,” he told Bloomberg’s editor-in-chief, who was interviewing him. “So I think it would be a big mistake to ship these chips.” Amodei then painted an alarming picture of what’s at stake. He talked about the “incredible national security implications” of AI models that represent “essentially cognition, that are essentially intelligence.” He likened future AI to a “country of geniuses in a data center,” saying to imagine “100 million people smarter than any Nobel Prize winner,” all under the control of one country or another.\nThe image underscored why he thinks chip exports matter so much. But then came the biggest blow. “I think this is crazy,” Amodei said of the administration’s latest move. “It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and [bragging that] Boeing made the casings.”\nThat sound you hear? The team at Nvidia, screaming into their phones.\nNvidia isn’t just another chip company. While Anthropic runs on the servers of Microsoft and Amazon and Google, Nvidia alone supplies the GPUs that power Anthropic’s AI models (every cloud provider needs Nvidia’s GPUs). Not only does Nvidia sit at the center of everything, but it also recently announced it was investing in Anthropic to the tune of up to $10 billion.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nJust two months ago, the companies announced that financial relationship, along with a “deep technology partnership” with cheery promises to optimize each other’s technology. Fast-forward to Davos, and Amodei is comparing his partner to an arms dealer.\nMaybe it was just an unguarded moment — it’s possible he got swept up in his own rhetoric and blurted out the analogy. But given Anthropic’s strong position in the AI market, it seems more likely he felt comfortable speaking with confidence. The company has raised billions, is valued in the hundreds of billions, and its Claude coding assistant has developed a reputation as a highly beloved and top-tier AI coding tool, particularly among developers working on complex, real-world projects.\nIt’s also entirely possible that Anthropic genuinely fears Chinese AI labs and wants Washington to act. If you want to get someone’s attention, nuclear proliferation comparisons are probably a pretty effective way to do it.\nBut what’s perhaps most remarkable is that Amodei could sit onstage at Davos, drop a bomb like that, and walk away to some other gathering without fear that he just adversely impacted his business. News cycles move on, sure. Anthropic is also on solid footing right now. But it does feel that the AI race has grown so existential in the minds of its leaders that the usual constraints — investor relations, strategic partnerships, diplomatic niceties — don’t apply anymore. Amodei isn’t concerned about what he can and can’t say. More than anything else he said on that stage, that fearlessness is worth paying attention to.\n\n\n\t\tLoizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "body": "\nHumans&, a startup with a philosophy that AI should empower people rather than replace them, has raised $480 million in seed funding at a $4.48 billion valuation, reports The New York Times. Investors in the round include chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and VC firms SV Angel, GV, and Laurene Powell Jobs’ firm Emerson Collective. \nThe megadeal for the three-month-old company follows a trend of investors throwing money at startups founded by breakaways of major AI labs. Humans&’s founders include Andi Peng, a former Anthropic researcher who worked on reinforcement learning and post-training of Claude 3.5 through 4.5; Georges Harik, Google’s seventh employee, who helped build its first advertising systems; Eric Zelikman and Yuchen He, two former xAI researchers who helped develop the Grok chatbot; and Noah Goodman, a Stanford professor of psychology and computer science. \nThe company’s 20-odd employees also come from OpenAI, Meta, Reflection, AI2, and MIT, according to the company. The startup aims to use software to help people collaborate with each other — think an AI version of an instant messaging app. One of their goals is to use existing AI techniques to train AI in new ways, like programming chatbots to request information from the user and store it for later use. \nIn order to build AI that serves “as a deeper connective tissue that strengthens organizations and communities,” Humans& hopes to rethink “how we train models at scale and how people interact with AI,” per the company’s web page. The startup cited a need for innovations in “long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding,” as well as a tightly integrated focus on both science and product development.\nTechCrunch has reached out for comment. \nThe Humans& seed round, while enormous, is far from an outlier in the current AI funding environment. The largest seed round in history, for now, belongs to Thinking Machines Lab, which raised $2 billion last July at a $12 billion valuation, led by Andreessen Horowitz. Founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati alongside top researchers from Meta and Google, the company initially attracted enormous enthusiasm, though the departure of half of the company’s founding team across recent months suggests that massive capital and pedigree don’t guarantee immediate success.\nOther notable mega-seed rounds include Unconventional AI’s $475 million raise in December at a $4.5 billion valuation — the company, founded by former Databricks AI head Naveen Rao, is developing energy-efficient neuromorphic computing systems — and Lila Sciences’ $200 million seed round last March for its autonomous AI-powered laboratory platform.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nLMArena, the AI model benchmarking platform that spun out of UC Berkeley, similarly bolted out of the gate as a commercial venture, raising $100 million at a $600 million valuation last May. Earlier this month, the three-year-old outfit announced a $150 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $1.7 billion.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

The company’s efforts in AI and smart glasses have been more successful, though investors still worry that its investment plans are too steep. \nMeta’s shares rose, however, following this report.\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Social\n",

    "body": "\nAI research lab Anthropic’s not slowing down in its efforts to snap up enterprise clients. The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a $200 million multi-year AI deal that will bring Anthropic’s large language models to Snowflake’s platform, and consequently, to its sizable customer base.\n“Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake’s co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in a blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.” \nThis deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers.  \nClaude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company’s enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis. Customers will also be able to use the models to build their own custom agents.  \n“Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,” Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It’s a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.” \nAnthropic has struck a slew of large enterprise deals in recent months as it seeks to prioritize selling to businesses instead of individual users — a strategy in contrast to its arch-rival OpenAI, which has taken a more popular route to growth.\nAnthropic in October signed a deal with Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the consulting giant’s employee base of more than 500,000 staff. That same week, Anthropic struck a partnership with IBM to bring some of its LLMs into the latter’s software products.  \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAnthropic’s enterprise success isn’t surprising as the company’s models have garnered strong and growing traction among enterprises. A Menlo Ventures survey in July found that enterprises preferred Anthropic’s AI products over models by other AI companies.  \n\n\n\t\tBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

    "body": "\nMeta’s decision to serve only its AI chatbot, Meta AI, to WhatsApp users isn’t sitting well with the competition regulators in Europe. The European Commission on Thursday said it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta’s move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app.\nWhatsApp in October changed its business API policy to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app.\nNotably, this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API.\nIn its statement, the EU’s executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).”\n“As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta’s own AI service ‘Meta AI’ would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote.\n“AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. \n“This is why we are investigating if Meta’s new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” Ribera said.\nIf Meta is found guilty of breaching EU’s antitrust rules, it may be fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue, and the Commission may impose additional measures on the company.\nWhatsApp, for its part, called the EU’s claims “baseless,” and said people have many other options to use rival AI companies’ chatbots. \n“The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API puts a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” a spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. “Even still, the AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations, and operating systems.”\n\n\n\t\tRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor. He covered North American and European M&A, equity, regulatory news and debt markets at Reuters and Acuris Global, and has also written about travel, tourism, entertainment and books.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Ram by emailing ram.iyer@techcrunch.com.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nEvery year, Google releases a report highlighting the top trending searches, offering a snapshot of what captured our collective curiosity, spanning pop culture, entertainment, internet trends, and news events. This year, people around the world were most curious about everything from hot honey and AI chatbots to the Toronto Blue Jays.\nBefore we get into the specifics, it’s worth noting that Google’s report doesn’t reflect the overall most popular searches. If it did, the list would be filled with general terms like “weather” rather than trending topics. Instead, Google’s “Year in Search” highlights queries that saw a sustained spike in traffic in 2025 compared with 2024.\nThat being said, the top trending search of the year was “Gemini,” which is Google’s AI chatbot, followed by “India vs England” and “Charlie Kirk.” Gemini wasn’t the only AI chatbot to make the list, as DeepSeek ranked seventh among the year’s trending searches.\nIn 2025, Google says Charlie Kirk was the top trending news topic, with the query “Charlie Kirk assassination” leading the list. The second and third trending news queries were “Iran” and “US Government Shutdown,” respectively.\nAs for recipes and food, the top spot went to the sweet-and-spicy condiment hot honey, while Marry Me Chicken and chimichurri rounded out the top three.\nFor movies, the top trending search was “Anora” followed by “Superman” and the “Minecraft Movie.” The top trending search for actors went to “Anora” star Mikey Madison. Lewis Pullman, who starred in Marvel’s “Thunderbolts,” took the second spot, followed by Isabela Merced, who was featured in “Superman.”\nIn terms of sports, “FIFA Club World Cup” was the top trending search, followed by “Asia Cup” and “ICC Champions Trophy.” The top searched sports team was Paris Saint-Germain F.C., while the second and third were S.L. Benfica and the Toronto Blue Jays, respectively. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs for podcasts, the top trending search was “The Charlie Kirk Show,” followed by Jason and Travis Kelce’s “New Heights” and “This is Gavin Newsom.”\nFor books, the top trending search was for Colleen Hoover’s “Regretting You.” Rebecca Yarros’ “Onyx Storm” and Naveesa Allen’s “Lights Out” rounded out the top three. \nYou can check out the full report here. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nSpotify says yesterday’s launch of its annual year-in-review feature, Spotify Wrapped, was its biggest ever. The streaming service reports that Wrapped 2025 saw over 200 million engaged users within the first 24 hours,  19% more than last year’s AI-centered flop. Last year, it took Wrapped 62 hours to reach 200 million users, the company noted.\nEngaged users are counted as those who have viewed at least one of the stories within the Wrapped experience.\nIn addition, Spotify said Wrapped was shared more than 500 million times this year, 41% more than last year. This includes native shares from within the app, as well as screenshots and downloads.\nIn particular, markets like the U.S., India, Indonesia, Japan, Colombia and Thailand drove the metrics this year.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nWrapped, the popular annual review of Spotify’s users’ listening history and stats, had a rough reception last year, as people criticized the lack of detailed stats, and the focus on the inclusion of an AI podcast over other clever and creative data stories.\nSpotify took that feedback into account for this year’s Wrapped, adding nearly a dozen new features and deeper data drives. While it did use AI behind the scenes, the new Wrapped didn’t include a consumer-facing AI experience. \nInstead, Spotify focused on letting users connect with each other by allowing them to compare their “listening age,” their Wrapped group (a category of listeners), and with its first live, multiplayer feature, Wrapped Party, that offered real-time data and stat comparisons.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "\nWhile many venture firms seem to only have eyes for AI these days, Nexus Venture Partners is deliberately splitting its focus for its new $700 million fund. \nThe firm will back AI startups and seek out India-focused startups in consumer, fintech, and digital infrastructure.\nAI has soaked up most of the venture capital raised globally and the 20-year-old VC firm also sees AI as a defining technological shift. But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse.\nFor Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins. The Delaware-headquartered firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Mumbai and Bengaluru, has operated as a single fund and an integrated U.S.–India team since its founding in 2006. \nIt backs early-stage software and India-focused startups from the same pool of capital. Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure.\nMeanwhile its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market\n“AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years. The firm has recorded more than 30 exits to date, including several IPOs, underscoring the depth of its early-stage, long-horizon approach.\nAbhishek Sharma, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch the firm’s sweet spot remains inception to seed and Series A, often beginning with checks as small as a few hundred thousand dollars or around $1 million.\nNexus, which operates with an eight-member investment team, began with a $100 million fund and has kept its fund size at $700 million since launching Fund VII in 2023. It typically raises every 2.5 to 3 years. Bhattacharjee said the reason for keeping the eighth fund the same size was the firm believes $700 million is the right amount for its early-stage strategy.\n“We don’t want to raise money for the sake of raising,” he noted.\nEven though India’s AI journey is not as advanced as the U.S.’s in many areas, Nexus believes India could leapfrog in several parts of the AI ecosystem. \nBhattacharjee underlined the country’s large talent pool, rising digital infrastructure, and demand for localized models that support India’s many languages and service needs. These dynamics, he said, are pushing Indian startups to build AI applications and agents faster, often atop open-source tools and emerging domestic AI infrastructure companies.\nThe partners pointed to companies backed by Nexus, such as Zepto and Neysa, to illustrate how AI is taking shape in India. They said Zepto, the quick-commerce platform, uses AI extensively across its operations — from customer support to routing and fulfillment — demonstrating how consumer businesses are becoming deeply AI-native. Besides, infrastructure players like Neysa are emerging to address India-specific needs, including sovereign AI workloads, localized data handling and support for the country’s many languages.\nNexus did not share fund metrics. The partners said its funds have been realizing significant enough returns over the years to largely fill this fund from returning limited partners. The firm’s LP base spans the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Japan.\n\n\n\t\tJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nTikTok is introducing a new “Nearby” feed to allow users to explore what’s happening around them. The company says the new feed is designed to help users do things like discover a new restaurant close to home or find a new place to explore during a trip. The nearby feed is rolling out to the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany. \nTikTok was first spotted testing a Nearby feed back in 2022, when it had rolled it out to select users in Southeast Asia.\n“Posts in the Nearby Feed are shown to people based on location, the topic of the content, and when the content was posted,” TikTok explained in a blog post. “For example, people can see local content related to travel, events, food & drink, and other services based on their interests and engagement. For creators, this means their public posts may be available to people located in the city/region where they posted or tagged a location or service.”\nTikTok says sharing your location is optional and that the option is only available to users who are 18 or older. When your location setting is enabled, TikTok may use your device’s GPS-based location when the app is in use to provide more accurate, location-based recommendations. For iOS users, they will see a visible indicator when their location is being accessed.\nThe company notes that it “continues to collect and use location information in line with local laws.”\nImage Credits:TikTok\nTikTok content won’t appear in the Nearby Feed if someone is under 18 years old, has a private account, or sets their post privacy to Friends or Only You.\nIf people want to see “Nearby” content from a different place, they can change their location by selecting the location name and then following the steps to update it. The company says this can be useful when you’re traveling or want to do some research for your next trip. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“The Nearby Feed also supports local economies by increasing visibility for small businesses, cultural institutions, and local creators,” TikTok wrote in the blog post. “The Nearby Feed helps drive discovery, foot traffic, and real-world engagement. In fact, 46% of TikTok users in the UK have visited a local shop, restaurant, or attraction they saw on the platform.”\nWhile TikTok is already known for its recommendation algorithm, which is able to target users with highly personalized content, the addition of a Nearby feed gives it the ability to display even more relevant content to its users.\nYou can access the Nearby feed directly from the TikTok home screen. The name of the tab won’t say “Nearby,” but will instead reflect the location you’re near.\nIt’s unknown when or if TikTok plans to launch the new feed in additional regions. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nEarlier this year, home goods maker Kohler launched a smart camera called the Dekoda that attaches to your toilet bowl, takes pictures of it, and analyzes the images to advise you on your gut health. \nAnticipating privacy fears, Kohler said on its website that the Dekoda’s sensors only see down into the toilet, and claimed that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption.”\nThe company’s use of the expression “end-to-end encryption” is, however, wrong, as security researcher Simon Fondrie-Teitler pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday. \nBy reading Kohler’s privacy policy, it’s clear that the company is referring to the type of encryption that secures data as it travels over the internet, known as TLS encryption — the same that powers HTTPS websites. \nUsing the right terms matters, especially in the context of users’ privacy concerns. Using the expression end-to-end encryption — widely adopted by messaging apps such as iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp — to describe TLS encryption is wrong, and can potentially confuse users who see that expression and think Kohler actually cannot see the pictures that the camera takes. \nA Kohler spokesperson did not respond to questions from TechCrunch, but a company “privacy contact” told Fondrie-Teitler that user data is “encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user’s mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.” The company also said that, “data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.”\nThe security researcher also pointed out that given Kohler can access customers’ data on its servers, it’s possible Kohler is using customers’ bowl pictures to train AI. Citing another response from the company representative, the researcher was told that Kohler’s “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThe Dekoda costs $599 plus a mandatory subscription of at least $6.99 per month.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

The platform hosts various interest-based and affinity communities, including military roleplaying games and LGBTQ solidarity groups. But Russia has laws designating public LGBTQ advocacy as “extremist activity.“\nAccording to a translation of an article in TASS, a state-owned Russian news agency, Russia’s communications agency cited the presence of LGBTQ content on the platform as one of the reasons behind the ban.\nRoblox did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the ban this afternoon.\nThe ban comes as Roblox faces broader safety and moderation challenges. Recent reports have highlighted how the platform exposed some of its underage users to child predators. In the U.S., Roblox has faced legal probes from the attorneys general in Texas and Louisiana. Roblox has since introduced age checks and content moderation tools aimed at keeping children safe — beginning in January, the company plans to implement mandatory facial verification to access Roblox’s chat features. (However, facial verification technology comes with safety concerns of its own.)\nRoblox has also asked developers to flag experiences that “are primarily themed on a sensitive social, political, or religious issue” so that the parents of users under 13 years old can decide if their children can access that content. This sparked backlash from advocacy groups like Out Making Games, Women in Games, and BAME in Games, which represent minority groups in the gaming industry. In an open letter, the groups wrote that Roblox considered topics like “pay equity in sports” to be “sensitive.”\n“While parental controls serve an important purpose, they shouldn’t come at the expense of fundamental human dignity,” the letter said. “We are calling on Roblox to reconsider these guidelines and find ways to protect young users without legitimizing discrimination or silencing important voices.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAccording to Appfigures, an app intelligence firm, Roblox was installed an estimated 70 million times in Russia on mobile, with about 8 million downloads so far this year.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nBrevo, a customer relationship management company headquartered in Paris, is now a unicorn — a startup valued at more than $1 billion. The startup raised €500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as Hubspot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S.\nFormerly known as Sendinblue, Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a new name reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&M.\nThe U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo’s revenue — one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That’s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth. \n“That’s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,” the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch.\nRevenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upwards. \nAfter joining the centaur club in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass €200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time, and aims to reach €1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch.\nThat’s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting $41.55 billion in revenue for 2026. The French company hopes being a unicorn will help boost its notoriety, thanks to the status itself, and also to the equity funding, which comes in addition to debt that Brevo had previously secured. (Brevo claims “double-digit EBITDA margin.”)\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThese coffers have already supported Brevo’s plans to invest €50 million in AI over five years, and to use acquisitions (11 to date) as one of its growth levers. The 1,000-employee company now intends to use its new funding to support these two endeavors, alongside its push in the U.S., on which it plans to spend over €100 million, according to a press release.\nBrevo didn’t disclose the exact valuation resulting from its latest round. It did give more details on its updated cap table. \nRumors had described the deal as Brevo getting acquired, but Thiberge said Brevo’s management and employees still hold the largest share (26%) while new entrants General Atlantic and Oakley Capital each bought 25%; existing investors Bpifrance and Bridgepoint collectively retained 24%, while Series A lead Partech completed its exit. \nThis makes for a global cap table that mirrors Brevo’s stated ambition to “build a global European CRM leader capable of competing with U.S. players through product excellence.” In other words, not through playing the European sovereignty card.\nFor Thiberge, “whoever has the best product wins, and it’s a race to see who can make the product that is both the most complete and the easiest to use.” There’s an inherent tension to doing this, and to catering both to mid-market companies and very small businesses. “I’m not saying it’s easy every day […] but for us, this combination has been incredibly successful.”\nTo serve this diverse audience, Brevo has significantly expanded beyond its email marketing roots. While it still competes with Mailchimp in that space, the company now offers an all-in-one platform with marketing automation, CRM, customer data management, and communication across email, SMS, WhatsApp, live chat, push notifications, and even integrated sales calls.\nThese functionalities are also increasingly boosted by AI, either through integrations or in-house. Expanding this feature set is one driver of Brevo’s M&A strategy, but inorganic growth from buying competitors in key markets is the other. With acquisitions expected to contribute 45% of its €1 billion revenue target for 2030, the company’s shopping list should be extensive.\nThis story was updated to correct cap table details.\n\n\n\t\tAnna Heim is a writer and editorial consultant. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Anna by emailing annatechcrunch [at] gmail.com.\nAs a freelance reporter at TechCrunch since 2021, she has covered a large range of startup-related topics including AI, fintech & insurtech, SaaS & pricing, and global venture capital trends.\nAs of May 2025, her reporting for TechCrunch focuses on Europe’s most interesting startup stories.\nAnna has moderated panels and conducted onstage interviews at industry events of all sizes, including major tech conferences such as TechCrunch Disrupt, 4YFN, South Summit, TNW Conference, VivaTech, and many more.\nA former LATAM & Media Editor at The Next Web, startup founder and Sciences Po Paris alum, she’s fluent in multiple languages, including French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

    "body": "\nIs it time for MrBeast to hit the New York Stock Exchange? Three years ago, the idea of a YouTuber with a $1.5 billion valuation left some onlookers incredulous — but Beast Industries ended up raising at a $5 billion valuation last year. Now we’re asking a bigger question: Would you buy stock in a 27-year-old named Jimmy?\nIt’s getting to the point where even if you don’t have a child under the age of 15, you should know who MrBeast is. The North Carolinian Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast channel has over 450 million YouTube subscribers — more than any other YouTube channel — making him arguably the most successful social media star ever. \nSo it made sense when at the DealBook Summit, reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin asked MrBeast and Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, about going public.\n“You want to have an IPO at some point, I imagine,” said Sorkin.\n“At some point, we want to be able to give the 1.4 billion unique people around the world who has watched Jimmy’s content the last 90 days a chance to be owners of the company,” Housebold replied. Sounds pretty much like a yes, as we can’t imagine another practical way to give ownership stakes to over a billion people.\nLike other major creators, the MrBeast business expands far beyond YouTube ad revenue and into a company called Beast Industries. Its biggest moneymaker is Feastables chocolate, which is more profitable than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg.\nHousenbold also mentioned that Beast Industries plans to build a two-sided marketplace for creators and marketers to work together (this idea has been explored by many creator economy startups already). Plus, the company is planning to launch a phone company, a financial services platform, and a theme park in Saudi Arabia. Sure, why not!\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nDonaldson’s business has had its share of stumbles, though. Beast Industries is in an ongoing lawsuit with the ghost kitchen Virtual Dining Concepts for damaging his brand by selling “inedible” food from MrBeast Burger. Virtual Dining Concepts countersued him for allegedly breaching his contract.\nThen, after filming the first season of “Beast Games,” five contestants sued Donaldson and Amazon for alleged mistreatment and sexual harassment on set. The heavily redacted lawsuit states that the show filmed in an environment that “systematically fostered a culture of misogyny and sexism.”\nIn conversation at DealBook, Donaldson said, “The big thing is, obviously, I learned why people don’t have 2,000 people compete in a show, because you’re creating a scenario where 1,999 aren’t happy, because they didn’t win … I don’t know how openly I’m allowed to speak, but obviously, yes, some people sue you. I’m sure people in here have been sued before because they just want to try to make money.”\nHousenbold cut in, “Listen, we’re always learning and getting better.” He was interrupted by laughter from the crowd. “Mistakes are part of success, so Season 2 is a lot better.”\nNot that Beast Industries’ missteps would prevent it from going public eventually, especially if it moves past them and can build the management discipline needed to bear the scrutiny of being public. \nDonaldson wouldn’t be the first creator-run business to go public — but he could pull off the first creator IPO that actually works. The esports team FaZe Clan went public in a $725 million SPAC but got acquired a year later in 2023 for just $17 million. In November, Pinkfong — the company that made the most-watched YouTube video, “Baby Shark” — went public in Korea.\n“From day one, we’re a global media company, and now we’re working on monetizing that viewership, that fandom, and that trust we built,” Housenbold said.\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nCan any company, big or small, really topple Nvidia’s AI chip dominance? Maybe not. But there are hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for those who can even peel off a chunk of it for themselves, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week.\nAs expected, the company revealed at the AWS re:Invent conference the next generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip, Trainium3, which is 4x faster yet uses less power than the current Trainium2. Jassy revealed a few tidbits about the current Trainium in a post on X that shows why the company is so bullish on the chip.\nHe said the Trainium2 business “has substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.”\nBedrock is Amazon’s AI app development tool that allows companies to pick and choose among many AI models.\nJassy said Amazon’s AI chip is winning among the company’s enormous roster of cloud customers because it “has price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.” In other words, he believes it works better and costs less than those “other GPUs” out there on the market.\nThat is, of course, Amazon’s classic MO, offering its own homegrown tech at lower prices.\nAdditionally, AWS CEO Matt Garman offered even more insight in an interview with CRN, about one customer responsible for a big chunk of those billions in revenue: No shock here, it’s Anthropic.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“We’ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we’ve announced Project Rainier, where there’s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude,” Garman said.\nProject Rainier is Amazon’s most ambitious AI cluster of servers, spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built to serve Anthropic’s skyrocketing needs. It came online in October. Amazon is, of course, a major investor in Anthropic. In exchange, Anthropic made AWS its primary model training partner, even though Anthropic is now also offered on Microsoft’s cloud via Nvidia’s chips. \nOpenAI is now also using AWS in addition to Microsoft’s cloud. But the OpenAI partnership couldn’t have contributed much to Trainium’s revenue because AWS is running it on Nvidia chips and systems, the cloud giant said.\nIndeed, only a few U.S. companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have all the engineering pieces — silicon chip design expertise, homegrown high-speed interconnect. and networking technology — to even attempt true competition with Nvidia. (Remember, Nvidia cornered the market on one major high-performance networking tech in 2019 when CEO Jensen Huang outbid Intel and Microsoft to buy InfiniBand hardware maker Mellanox.)\nOn top of that, AI models and software built to be served up by Nvidia’s chips also rely on Nvidia’s proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software. CUDA allows the apps to use the GPUs for parallel processing compute, among other tasks. Just like the Intel versus SPARC chip war of yesterday, it’s no small thing to rewrite an AI app for a non-CUDA chip.\nStill, Amazon may have a plan for that. As we previously reported, the next generation of its AI chip, Trainium4, will be built to interoperate with Nvidia’s GPUs in the same system. Whether that helps peel more business away from Nvidia or simply reinforces its dominance, but on AWS’s cloud, remains to be seen. \nIt may not matter to Amazon. If it is already on track to make multibillion dollars from the Trainium2 chip, and the next generation will be that much better, it may be winner enough.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.\n",

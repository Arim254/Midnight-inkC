He promised this is the “first of many” such Nvidia AI factories that will be deployed across Microsoft Azure’s global data centers to run OpenAI workloads.</p>\n<p>Each system is a cluster of more than 4,600 Nvidia GB300 rack computers sporting the much-in-demand Blackwell Ultra GPU chip and connected via Nvidia’s super-fast networking tech called InfiniBand. (Besides AI chips, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also had the foresight to corner the market on InfiniBand when his company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/nvidia-to-buy-supercomputer-chipmaker-mellanox-for-6-9b-beating-intel-in-a-bidding-war/\">acquired Mellanox</a> for $6.9 billion in 2019.)</p>\n<p>Microsoft promises that it will be deploying “hundreds of thousands of Blackwell Ultra GPUs” as it rolls out these systems globally. While the size of these systems is eye-popping (and the company shared plenty <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/blog/behind-the-cloud-understanding-datacenters-and-communities/\" target=\"_blank\">more technical details</a> for hardware enthusiasts to peruse), the timing of this announcement is also noteworthy.</p>\n<p>It comes just after OpenAI, its partner and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/the-cracks-in-the-openai-microsoft-relationship-are-reportedly-widening/\">well-documented frenemy</a>, inked two high-profile data center deals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/07/wall-street-analysts-explain-how-amds-own-stock-will-pay-for-openais-billions-in-chip-purchases/\">with Nvidia and AMD</a>. In 2025, OpenAI has racked up, by some estimates, $1 trillion in commitments to build its own data centers. And CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/08/even-after-stargate-oracle-nvidia-and-amd-openai-has-more-big-deals-coming-soon-sam-altman-says/\">Sam Altman said this week that more were coming</a>.</p>\n<p>Microsoft clearly wants the world to know that it already has the data centers — <a href=\"https://local.microsoft.com/blog/behind-the-cloud-understanding-datacenters-and-communities/\" target=\"_blank\">more than 300</a> in 34 countries — and that they are “uniquely positioned” to “meet the demands of frontier AI today,” the company said. These monster AI systems are also capable of running the next generation of models with “hundreds of trillions of parameters,” it said.</p>\n<p>We expect to hear more about how Microsoft is ramping up to serve AI workloads later this month. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott will be speaking at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>, which will be held October 27 to October 29 in San Francisco. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>",

Reports about Netflix’s efforts to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/30/netflix-plans-to-bring-games-to-tv-and-let-players-use-their-iphones-as-video-game-controllers/\">bring its mobile games to televisions</a> began in early 2023. Later that year, the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/netflix-launches-a-game-controller-app-for-playing-games-on-your-tv/\">launched a game controller app</a> for iOS devices. </p>\n<p>However, there hadn’t been much word about gaming on the big screen until now, but it looks like the wait is finally over.</p>\n<p>To use the new feature, go to the Games tab on the Netflix TV app, then pick a game and use your phone as the controller.</p>\n<p>Since launching mobile games four years ago, Netflix’s strategy has been somewhat varied. However, the recent move indicates a more serious commitment to expanding its gaming offerings, helping it compete more directly with major video game companies, beyond just mobile gaming rivals.</p>\n<p>Alongside the announcement, Netflix <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/level-up-your-holidays-with-party-games-coming-to-netflix-on-tv\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> the new slate of games it’s launching, all of which are party titles meant to be played in groups. </p>\n<p>These include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Boggle Party</strong>: Up to eight players are timed to find words in a scrambled letter grid.</li>\n<li><strong>LEGO Party!</strong>: Four players compete in minigames and challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>Party Crashers: Fool Your Friends</strong>: One person at this party secretly has no idea what everyone else is talking about. Figure out whose clues are fishy to unmask the crasher. </li>\n<li><strong>Pictionary: Game Night</strong>: Based on the classic group game, friends must guess what you’re drawing before time runs out. </li>\n<li><strong>Tetris Time Warp:</strong> Compete against friends for the best score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Launching group-focused games is a smart move for Netflix because it encourages more customers to participate. It also means users will stay engaged with the streaming service, even when they’re not watching a TV series or movie. </p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>The addition of the five titles follows Netflix’s recent <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview\" target=\"_blank\">insight</a> into its current gaming strategy, which will now focus on four types of games, including party titles.</p>\n<p>The games are currently available on select TV screens in specific countries, and Netflix plans to expand their availability over time.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>You can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com\">laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com</a> or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.</p>\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/lauren-forristal/\">View Bio <svg></svg></a>\n\t</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stokespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stoke Space</a> announced a massive capital raise on Wednesday that might seem, at first glance, like just another bet on the commercial launch market. The details tell a different story.</p>\n<p>Led by billionaire Thomas Tull’s U.S. Innovative Technology (USIT), a fund that explicitly invests in technologies tied to national security, the $510 million Series D round underscores a larger shift in the launch industry. The old assumption was the winners of launch would be the companies that capture the lion’s share of commercial payloads.</p>\n<p>While there is still demand on the commercial side from private constellation developers and for emerging use cases like in-space manufacturing or lunar payloads, the center of gravity has shifted decisively toward defense.</p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, space startups were selling investors on visions of a rapidly expanding commercial market for weather monitoring, broadband, and remote-sensing satellites. Astra, for example, told investors in its 2021 SPAC deck that it would eventually launch hundreds of rockets per year to serve a growing small satellite market. Relativity Space pitched investors on a 3D printing revolution that would make rockets cheap enough to unlock large commercial demand.</p>\n<p>But there are only so many commercial payloads to fly, and only one company — SpaceX — has managed to consistently launch them cheaply and reliably.</p>\n<p>Defense, meanwhile, is on an opposite trajectory. </p>\n<p>Geopolitical shifts, like Russia’s war against Ukraine and growing competition in space from China, have created new tailwinds. The Pentagon’s new “Golden Dome” initiative, a multibillion-dollar project aimed at creating a layered missile defense shield over the continental United States, has flooded the aerospace ecosystem with lucrative new opportunities.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Meanwhile, programs like the Space Force’s National Security Space Launch (NSSL) and the Space Development Agency’s missile-defense satellite constellation are promising years of predicable, high-value contracts. </p>\n<p>Launch startups have noticed. Their language, investors, and business models have realigned toward a single buyer: the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>In a press release, Stoke Space nods toward this reality, saying the new funding would strengthen “capability across the U.S. space industrial base.” Support from other new investors, like Washington Harbour Partners LP and General Innovation Capital Partners, further underscores “Stoke’s importance to national security and the U.S. industrial base,” the company said.</p>\n<p>Stoke’s recent wins highlight this reality. In March, it was one of a handful of launch providers selected for the NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 program, which lets the company compete for up to $5.6 billion in launch contracts over the next decade. </p>\n<p>Other recent deals tell a similar story. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/firefly-leans-into-its-defense-ambitions-with-855m-scitec-acquisition/\">Firefly’s recent $855 million acquisition of SciTec</a> was framed by CEO Jason Kim as a move that enhanced the company’s “ability to support a growing number of defense missions.” Relativity’s new owner, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, just recently warned lawmakers that if China achieves superintelligence first, “it changes the balance of power globally in ways that we have no way of understanding, predicting or dealing with.”</p>\n<p>While his remarks weren’t about launch specifically, they sum up the broader sentiment across the space industry: America cannot lose in strategic domains like space and AI.</p>\n<p>In that context, USIT makes an obvious lead for the new round. Thomas Tull launched the fund in 2023 to fund technologies “relevant to the national interest.” </p>\n<p>Past investments are wide-ranging but related to national resilience, including defense startup Shield AI and Gecko Robotics. Stoke’s inclusion in that portfolio cements the new reality that space investment is squarely at the intersection of venture capital and defense budgets.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

Its estimates show that Sora saw 627,000 iOS downloads in its first seven days of availability, compared with ChatGPT’s 606,000 iOS downloads during its first week.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the publication of this article, OpenAI’s head of Sora, Bill Peebles, <a href=\"https://x.com/billpeeb/status/1976099194407616641\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that Sora reached a million downloads in under five days. He said that it was faster than ChatGPT, despite Sora being in invite-only mode.

Still, Appfigures data indicated that Canada contributed about 45,000 installs, so the Sora launch was about 96% of ChatGPT’s launch on iOS alone, if the data had been based on the U.S. numbers only.</p>\n<p>This level of consumer adoption is worth noting because Sora requires an invite to get in, while ChatGPT was publicly available at launch. That makes Sora’s performance more impressive.</p>\n<p>During its first day, Sora saw 56,000 iOS app installs in short order, bumping the app to become the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store, Appfigures said. By Friday, October 3, it reached No. 1. That surge had already put Sora’s debut ahead of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic’s Claude and Microsoft’s Copilot, and put it on par with xAI’s Grok launch.</p>\n<p>A quick scan of social media provides plenty of anecdotes that support Appfigures’ data. Sora videos, which uses the new Sora 2 video model and gives users the ability to generate realistic deepfakes, seem to be everywhere.

On Thursday, the company announced a $15 million Series A round, led by Mark Goldberg at Chemistry with participation from employees at DeepMind, Vercel, Anthropic, and OpenAI. The Series A comes after a $2.7 million seed round, which drew investment from former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan.</p>\n<p>Datacurve uses a “bounty hunter” system to attract skilled software engineers to complete the hardest-to-source datasets. The company pays for those contributions, distributing over $1 million in bounties so far.</p>\n<p>But co-founder Serena Ge (pictured above with co-founder Charley Lee) says the biggest motivation isn’t financial. For high-value services like software development, the pay will always be far lower for data work than conventional employment — so the company’s most important edge is a positive user experience.</p>\n<p>“We treat this as a consumer product, not a data labeling operation,” Ge said. “We spend a lot of time thinking about: How can we optimize it so that the people we want are interested and get onto our platform?”</p>\n<p>That’s particularly important as the needs of post-training data grow more complex. While earlier models were trained on simple datasets, today’s AI products rely on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/silicon-valley-bets-big-on-environments-to-train-ai-agents/\">complex RL environments</a>, which need to be constructed through specific and strategic data collection. As the environments grow more sophisticated, the data requirements become both more intense for both quantity and quality — a factor that could give high-quality data collection companies like Datacurve an edge.</p>\n<p>As an early-stage company, Datacurve is focused on software engineering, but Ge says the model could apply just as easily to fields like finance, marketing, or even medicine.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>“What we’re doing right now is we’re creating an infrastructure for post-training data collection that attracts and retains highly competent people in their own domains,” Ge says.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Getting design and engineering teams on the same page about what digital product to create and how to build it continues to be a challenge. </p>\n<p>A lot of companies find themselves dealing with scattered information, often depending on shared spreadsheets to keep track of design specs and guidelines. Design teams might use tools like Figma, while engineers manage their source code with systems like Git. </p>\n<p>This issue becomes even trickier for large organizations juggling multiple brands and various websites. Miscommunication can pile up quickly, resulting in wasted time and inefficiency.</p>\n<p>That’s where <a href=\"https://www.knapsack.cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Knapsack</a> comes in. It’s a collaboration platform specifically designed for enterprises that need to resolve misunderstandings between UI designers, product managers, and engineers. Knapsack creates a unified workspace that connects with tools like Figma and Git, ensuring that all design changes and code are collected, showcased, and compared in one place. </p>\n<p>This approach makes sure that everything remains up to date, so branding stays consistent across all digital products. For example, if the button is supposed to be 60 pixels, this will be documented in the system, and no sizing mistakes are made.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the company announced a $10 million Series A round, bringing the total raised to date to $20.8 million.</p>\n<p>Alongside the funding, Knapsack is introducing AI capabilities. This includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, which is Anthropic’s open source standard that is<strong> </strong>designed to enhance AI models’ ability to generate more relevant responses to specific inquiries by having access to a company’s design and brand standards. The new addition, currently in limited beta, enables teams to use AI agents using models like ChatGPT and Gemini while ensuring these assistants are consistent with their brand and guidelines.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>Additionally, an upcoming “ingestion engine” aims to streamline the process of creating a system of record, which is essentially a comprehensive collection of data or information for a company. Traditionally, setting up such systems can take months. Knapsack believes the new engine will reduce that time to just a few days, making it easier for new teams or projects to get up and running more quickly.</p>\n<p>“We work with a very large pharmaceutical company that creates a bunch of sites associated with each of their drug brands. It used to take them about 15 months to launch a new drug property. Now using Knapsack, it takes between two and three months,” CEO Chris Strahl told TechCrunch. He noted that adding the new engine is poised to make this process even faster.</p>\n<p>Another feature, launching later this year, helps teams quickly explore user interfaces (UIs) and generate real webpages using real code. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg 792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=430,332 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=720,556 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=668,516 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=485,375 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=687,531 687w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Knapsack.jpg?resize=50,39 50w\" /><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Knapsack</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Launched in 2022, Knapsack says it serves dozens of Fortune 1000 companies but did not disclose their names. Strahl declined to share subscription pricing details, saying only, “it’s an enterprise product with enterprise pricing.”</p>\n<p>The company currently has nearly 30 full-time employees on the team, and just hired 14 more with the new funding.</p>\n<p>The round was led by Builders VC with participation from Crosslink Capital, Epic Ventures, Mana Ventures, and Lorimer Ventures. Past investors include Alumni, Ascend, Gradient Ventures, Parade Ventures, Founder Collective, Salesforce, and Slack Fund.</p>\n<p>Strahl said he hoped Knapsack would serve as a platform for all kinds of digital experiences in the future, particularly as the power of agentic AI becomes more prevalent.</p>\n<p>“You can envision a future where you’re buying a shoe, and you say to a personal AI agent, ‘Hey, I’d really like some new shoes. I want to be able to go running more frequently,’” Strahl told TechCrunch. “And the agent would go out and understand your preferences based on your history, and take you a pair of shoes, and it would return that into whatever app is running your agent.”</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, that experience should come from Knapsack,” he continued, “and there is this entire world that has yet to be unveiled of how organizations think about expressing their brand through agentic apps and systems that I want to be at the forefront.”</p>\n<p><em>This story was updated after publication.</em></p>\n</div>",

Days earlier, Oracle’s chief security officer, Rob Duhart, claimed in the same post — since scrubbed — that the extortion campaign was linked to previously identified vulnerabilities that Oracle patched in July, suggesting the hacks were over.</p>\n<p>But in a <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html\" target=\"_blank\">security advisory</a> published over the weekend, Oracle said the zero-day bug — named because Oracle had no time to fix the bug, as it was already being exploited by hackers — can be “exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.” </p>\n<p>The Russia-linked Clop ransomware and extortion gang has made a name for itself in recent years for mass-hacking campaigns, often involving the abuse of vulnerabilities unknown to the software vendor at the time they were exploited, to steal large amounts of corporate and customer data. This includes managed file transfer tools, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/16/clop-ransomware-gang-names-dozens-of-victims-hit-by-cleo-mass-hack-but-several-firms-dispute-breaches/\">Cleo</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/moveit-mass-hack-by-the-numbers/\">MOVEit</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/intellihartx-data-breach-fortra-ransomware/\">GoAnywhere</a>, which companies use as a way to send sensitive corporate data over the internet.</p>\n<p>Google’s blog post includes email addresses and other technical details that network defenders can use to look for extortion emails and other indications that their Oracle systems may have been compromised.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<p>Topics</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Zack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

Following the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/\">launch</a> of OpenAI’s invite-only, video-generating mobile app last week, Apple’s App Store was flooded with fakes that also proclaimed themselves to be “Sora” or “Sora 2” — the latter a reference to the underlying new AI video model that was released alongside the mobile app.</p>\n<p>These apps somehow made it past Apple’s App Review process. They actually had public listings on the App Store, despite using a brand name that’s trademarked by OpenAI and fairly well known in the tech industry even before the app’s debut. </p>\n<p>According to research provided to TechCrunch upon our request by app intelligence platform <a href=\"http://appfigures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appfigures</a>, there were over a dozen “Sora”-branded apps that went live on the App Store after the official app’s launch. Over half of them used “Sora 2” in their names specifically. (One of <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@gruber/post/DPZLd-IAF5j\" target=\"_blank\">those was spotted by</a> Apple blogger and pundit, John Gruber, who called it the “App Store scam of the week.”)</p>\n<p>Many of the apps were not newcomers, either. Some had been live on the App Store — sometimes using other names — since earlier in the year or even last year. The impostors, which include those live on Google Play as well, had seen around 300,000 collective installs to date, with north of 80,000 installs coming in after Sora’s official app launch. (OpenAI has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/sora-hit-1m-downloads-faster-than-chatgpt/\">since announced</a> that Sora’s official mobile app has been downloaded 1 million times, for comparison.)</p>\n<p>Nearly all of the impostors had been updated just after OpenAI’s Sora app launch to capitalize on consumer demand and searches, often by changing their name. </p>\n<p>It’s unclear how these apps were able to slip past Apple’s reviewers; Apple did end up pulling many of them from its App Store, Appfigures said.</p>\n<p>Of the imposter apps, the largest one was named “Sora 2 – AI Video Generator” — an obvious attempt to game App Store searches for the keyword “sora.” It saw more than 50,000 installs after the launch of the official app.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>As of the time of writing, a few Sora-branded apps are still live, despite the potential for consumer confusion. One, “PetReels — Sora for Pets,” has seen only a few hundred installs, however. Another one, “Viral AI Photo Maker: Vi-sora” is trying to squeeze the word Sora in there but hasn’t gained traction, either.</p>\n<p>Doing slightly better is the app using the branding “Sora 2” in its name (Sora 2 – Video Generator Ai). It’s pulled in north of 6,000 downloads and counting.</p>\n<p>Collectively, the apps earned more than $160,000 — decent money considering their short lives.</p>\n<p>Apple was asked for comment on how Sora-branded apps were able to go live and if these remaining Sora-branded apps would be removed. It did not respond prior to publication. </p>\n</div><div>\n<div><p>\n\t\tSarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>Venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has pushed back on local media reports suggesting it plans to open an office in India, with a general partner calling the coverage “entirely fake news.”</p>\n<p>Earlier on Thursday, Indian media outlets <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/companies/a16z-andreessen-horowitz-india-expansion-bengaluru-ai-saas-startups-11759839746933.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that a16z was preparing to establish a physical presence in the country by setting up an office in Bengaluru. The reports, which cited unnamed sources, also said the firm was in the process of hiring a local partner.</p>\n<p>However, Anish Acharya, a Bay Area-based general partner at a16z who has spent the last six years with the firm, dismissed the reports. “As much as I adore India and the many impressive founders+investors in the region, this is entirely fake news!” he <a href=\"https://x.com/illscience/status/1976363023133725168\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> on X.</p>\n<p>When contacted, an a16z spokesperson confirmed Acharya’s statement and referred to his post.</p>\n<p>The denial comes as a16z appears to be scaling back some of its international ambitions. Earlier this year, the firm decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/documents-show-uk-wooed-a16z-for-five-years/\" target=\"_blank\">shut down its London office</a> — which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/london-lures-a16zs-first-international-office-with-predictable-crypto-regs/\" target=\"_blank\">opened in 2023</a> after the U.K. government reportedly spent <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/andreessen-horowitz-london-office\" target=\"_blank\">five years</a> trying to woo the powerhouse firm, according to the outlet Sifted. The closure came just 18 months after a16z set up shop, with the firm citing a shift in strategy and more favorable regulatory developments back home. The firm said, however, that it would continue to invest internationally through remote teams and local networks. Reports later indicated that several of its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/a16z-has-venture-scouts-scattered-across-europe/\">scouts were active across Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>So far, India has not been a major focus for a16z — unlike other U.S. venture firms such as Accel, General Catalyst, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which have made deep inroads into the market. The firm’s only notable bet in India has been crypto exchange CoinSwitch, which it backed as part of the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/\" target=\"_blank\">$260 million funding round</a> in 2021.</p>\n<p>In the months that followed, a16z was reportedly seeking to invest <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/02/andreessen-horowitz-india/\" target=\"_blank\">about $500 million in Indian startups</a>, though it has not made any major investments in the country since.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>As TechCrunch has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/02/andreessen-horowitz-india/\">previously noted</a>, a16z co-founder and general partner Marc Andreessen delivered a talk at Stanford Graduate School of Business many years ago, saying while it is “extremely tempting” to back startups in emerging markets, it is also challenging for a venture fund to expand to more countries. Venture capital is a “very hands-on process of understanding the people you’re working with for both evaluating the company and work[ing] with the company,” he said at the time.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body": "<div>\n<p>YouTube <a href=\"http://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/second-chances-on-youtube/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> on Thursday that creators whose channels were previously terminated will be able to request new accounts.</p>\n<p>“We know many terminated creators deserve a second chance – YouTube has evolved and changed over the past 20 years, and we’ve had our share of second chances to get things right with our community too,” YouTube wrote in the blog post.</p>\n<p>This change in policy, which YouTube is calling a “pilot,” didn’t come out of nowhere. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) had <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-03-06-jdj-to-pichai-alphabet-re-subpoena.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">subpoenaed</a> YouTube’s parent company, Alphabet, to investigate if the Biden-Harris administration had “coerced or colluded” platforms into censoring speech. Last month, Alphabet’s legal counsel, Daniel F. Donovan, wrote in a <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-09-23-letter-to-hjc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to Rep. Jordan that the company would allow some terminated creators to come back.</p>\n<p>While YouTube does not explicitly reference its COVID-19 or election integrity policies in its blog post, Alphabet’s letter makes it clear that these policies are top of mind. </p>\n<p>“Reflecting the Company’s commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,” Alphabet’s letter says. “YouTube values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse.”</p>\n<p>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter took action to prevent the spread of medical misinformation about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/youtube-has-removed-1-million-videos-for-dangerous-covid-19-misinformation/\">virus</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/youtube-will-now-ban-content-with-vaccine-misinformation/\">vaccines</a>. </p>\n<p>At the time, YouTube disallowed content stating that vaccines can cause cancer, a false claim that is <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-myths/art-20485720\" target=\"_blank\">not supported</a> by <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-people-with-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">scientific research</a>. The following year, these platforms also took action against accounts that they believed to incite violence after the January 6 riots, including the account of President Donald Trump.</p>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p>These policies have since been discontinued, but creators who were terminated under those rules have remained unable to upload YouTube videos.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch asked YouTube if this pilot would specifically focus on creators who were terminated on the grounds of the COVID-19 and election integrity policies. We did not receive a response prior to publication.</p>\n<p>“We’ll consider several factors when evaluating requests for new channels, like whether the creator committed particularly severe or persistent violations of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, or whether the creator’s on- or off-platform activity harmed or may continue to harm the YouTube community, like channels that endanger kids’ safety,” the company wrote in its blog. </p>\n<p>YouTube also stated that creators who were terminated for copyright infringement will not be allowed to request a new channel.</p>\n<p>Creators must wait one year after their channel was terminated before they are eligible to apply for a new channel; however, they can still appeal their termination during that year’s lag if they think that YouTube’s decision was unjust.</p>\n<p>If a creator is reinstated, they will start from scratch, rather than regain access to their old account. However, they can still apply to the YouTube Partner Program once they are eligible to do so, which allows them to share ad revenue with YouTube.</p>\n</div><div>\n<div>\n\t\t<p>Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The company previously raised a $33 million Series A, which it announced in April 2024.\nThe new round was led by Energy Impact Partners and Galvanize with participation from Alumni Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Incite Ventures, and Lowercarbon Capital. Veery Maxwell at Galvanize will be joining the board, as will former Nest CFO Tom vonReichbauer. (The latter should come as no surprise given that many Quilters used to work at Nest.)\nThe new funding will go toward expanding the company’s footprint. Quilt has installed nearly 1,000 units in 16 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces, co-founder and CEO Paul Lambert said in a note posted on the company’s website.\nQuilt has been a rare startup challenging entrenched incumbents in the heat pump market. To unseat them, the company has taken a software- and design-first approach. One example is an over-the-air update the company pushed to heat pumps that were already installed; the new software and firmware improved the performance of existing units by more than 20%.\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\t\tAlumni Ventures, Climate, energy impact partners, Fundraising, Galvanize, Gradient Ventures, heat pumps, In Brief, Incite Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, quilt\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Climate\n",

As for his feelings about the deal, he said, “Netflix is a great company. They’ve done a phenomenal job. Ted is a fantastic man. I have a lot of respect for him. But it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.”\nBloomberg also reports that Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav was reluctant to sell the company and was surprised when Paramount began to explore an acquisition — if nothing else, he’d expected Ellison to wait until the studio completed a planned split of its movie and streaming businesses from its cable networks.\nUltimately, Warner Bros. said it would consider other bids, leading to a competitive process that Netflix won — although Paramount could still keep its hat in the ring with a hostile bid.\nThis post has been updated with Trump’s comments.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Media & Entertainment\n",

The company expects the deal to add to EBITDA and free cash flow in the two years after the deal is closed.\nThis is the latest in a string of deals IBM has struck in recent months as it seeks to capitalize on the AI boom, though at $11 billion, Confluent would be the tech giant’s largest buy in years, following its acquisition of HashiCorp in 2024. \nIBM in October signed a deal with AI lab Anthropic to deploy the Claude large language model into some of its products; it has partnered with AMD to develop a new computing architecture that combines quantum systems with AI-specialized chips; and it acquired data analysis startup Seek AI in June.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\tTopics\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSubscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news\n\t\n\nLatest in Enterprise\n",

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?”\nTo address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. \nThe feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games.\nImage Credits:Hinge\nConvo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. \nThis new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives.\nHowever, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do. \nHinge’s parent company, Match Group, is dedicating around $20 million to $30 million toward AI efforts. \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tLauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lauren by emailing laurenf.techcrunch@gmail.com or via encrypted message at laurenforris22.25 on Signal.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n\n\t\t",

    "body": "\nTiger Global, the investor that spurred the VC bull market of 2020-2021, is reportedly raising a fresh $2.2 billion fund.\nThe firm sent a letter to potential limited partners, according to a copy obtained by CNBC, seeking to raise the cash for a vehicle called Private Investment Partners 17 (PIP 17). The letter also promises a more humble approach than during the 2021 bull-market madness.\nDuring that time, Tiger Global was moving fast and investing abundantly, a method the venture industry calls “spray and pray.”\nPIP 15, raised in 2021, was a whopping $12.7 billion fund that pumped cash into startups at a blinding pace largely at peak valuations, TechCrunch reported. \nIn 2021 alone, the hedge fund backed 315 startups, according to PitchBook data, and spurred bidding wars among VCs to get stakes in even unproven startups that ratched up valuations.\nWhen interest rates rose, the party was over, and startups spent years trying to live up to their 2021 valuations, many shuttering along the way. \nAfter the venture market crash in 2022-23, prolific Tiger Global investor John Curtius left to start his own fund, and Scott Shleifer, the firm’s chief of private equity investments, transitioned to an advisory role, while Tiger’s famed founder, Chase Coleman, took on a more direct role.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nTiger Global went on to raise a much smaller PIP 16 fund of $2.2 billion in 2024, Bloomberg reported at the time, which is, admittedly, still an enormous fund.\nNow, on the strength of PIP 16’s blockbuster AI investments, Tiger Global is raising Fund 17. PIP 16 holds stakes in OpenAI, Waymo and Databricks, all of which have had skyrocketing valuations and driven this fund’s paper gains by 33% so far, the letter said as reported by CNBC.\nStill, in a nod to the need for more caution than in previous years, the letter promised a more targeted approach. It acknowledged that leaning into AI investments could be risky and require “humility” because “valuations are elevated and, in our view, sometimes unsupported by company fundamentals,” according to CNBC. (Tiger Global could not be immediately reached for comment.)\nIn other words, even as Tiger Global raises a fresh fund to go after more big AI opportunities, it’s implying that the AI market is in a bubble, and it doesn’t want to drive valuations to even higher, perhaps unrealistic, heights.\n",

    "body": "\nAn increasing number of browsers are experimenting with agentic features that will take actions on your behalf, such as booking tickets or shopping for different items. However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. \nGoogle detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months.\nThe company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content.\nImage Credits:Google\nWhat’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page.\n“This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. \nGoogle is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model. This can prevent navigation to harmful model-generated URLs, the company said.\nImage Credits:google\nThe search giant said that it is also handing over the reins to users for sensitive tasks. For instance, when an agent tries to navigate to a sensitive site with information like banking or your medical data, it first asks the user. For sites that require sign-in, it’ll ask the user for permission to let Chrome use the password manager. Google said that the agent’s model doesn’t have exposure to password data. The company added that it will ask users before taking actions like making a purchase or sending a message.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nGoogle said that, in addition to this, it also has a prompt-injection classifier to prevent unwanted actions and is also testing agentic capabilities against attacks created by researchers. \nAI browser makers are also paying attention to security. Earlier this month, Perplexity released a new open source content detection model to prevent prompt injection attacks against agents.\n\n\n\t\tIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAs energy demand for data centers soars, environmental groups are calling for a moratorium on the approval and construction of new facilities.\nMore than 230 organizations including Food and Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace signed a public letter urging members of Congress to support a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers, citing rising electricity and water consumption. \n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter reads. \nSeveral studies have linked higher energy prices to the arrival of new data centers in a region. Consumers have been arriving at similar conclusions: A recent survey, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that eight in 10 consumers were worried about data centers negatively affecting their utility bills.\nElectricity prices have already shot up 13% this year, bigger than any annual increase in the past decade.\nThe effects are expected to be felt most in a handful of states, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey, which are slated for the largest increase in data center capacity.\nEnergy demand for data centers is expected to nearly triple in the coming decade, up from 40 gigawatts today to 106 gigawatts in 2035. Much of that will take place in rural areas.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n“All this compounds the significant and concerning impacts AI is having on society, including lost jobs, social instability and economic concentration,” the environmental groups said.\nProposed data centers have become a flash point in recent days. \nLast week, protestors marched outside the headquarters of utility DTE in Detroit. The company is requesting approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission to supply OpenAI and Oracle with electricity for a 1.4 gigawatt data center. Protestors said they were concerned about the data center driving up electricity bills, using too much fresh water, and snarling traffic.\nAlso last week, three people were arrested in Wisconsin during a common council meeting about a 902 megawatt data center that’s slated to be part of OpenAI and Oracle’s Stargate project.\n\n\n\t\tTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nAnthropic is launching Claude Code in Slack, allowing developers to delegate coding tasks directly from chat threads. The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic’s existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow. \nPreviously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests.\nThe move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work.\nCursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI’s Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots.\nFor Slack, positioning itself as an “agentic hub” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work.\nBy letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows.\nWhile Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic. The AI coding market is getting more competitive, and differentiation is starting to depend more on integration depth and distribution than model capability alone.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nThat said, the integration raises questions about code security and IP protection, as it adds another platform through which sensitive repository access must be managed and audited — while also introducing new dependencies where outages or rate limits in either Slack or Claude’s API could disrupt development workflows that teams previously controlled locally.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and Slack for more information.\n\n\n\t\tRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "body": "\nLast week, pet products and services giant Petco confirmed that it experienced a data breach involving customers’ personal information, without specifying what type of data was affected.\nOn Friday, in a legally required filing with Texas’ attorney general’s office, Petco reported that the affected data included names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, financial information such as account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, and dates of birth. \nPetco filed similar legally required notices in California, Massachusetts, and Montana. In the latter two states, Petco reported one and three affected residents, respectively. \nThe company did not disclose the exact number of victims in California, where companies are required to disclose breaches involving at least 500 state residents, which suggests there are more victims than that number in the state. \nPetco spokesperson Ventura Olvera did not respond to a series of questions sent on Monday, which included how many customers in total were affected by this incident; whether Petco has any technical means, including logs, to determine whether any cybercriminals had access and stole the customers’ exposed data; what and when was the specific issue identified; and what was the application involved in the incident. \nFor context, in 2022, Petco said it served more than 24 million customers.\nOn Friday, Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera said in a statement to TechCrunch that the company had “provided further information to individuals whose information was involved.” \n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nCalifornia’s attorney general published a sample letter that Petco is sending to its customers. The message said Petco discovered an issue with “a setting within one of our software applications that inadvertently allowed certain files to be accessible online,” that the company “immediately took steps to correct the issue and to remove the files from further online access,” and that it “corrected” the setting and implemented unspecified “additional security measures.” \nThe company is offering free credit and identity theft monitoring services to victims in California, Massachusetts, and Montana. Under California law, for example, companies must provide these services if a data breach victim’s driver’s license number or Social Security number are compromised. It’s unclear if Petco is also offering these services to victims in Texas.\n\n\n\t\tLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy. \nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com, via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\t\n\t\n\t\tView Bio \n\t\n",

Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT. In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with Target, Intuit, and others.\nLeading up to this year’s holiday shopping season, both OpenAI and Perplexity announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season.\nDespite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and it may not for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “small fee” when it helps merchants make a sale. But it would take a whole lot of ChatGPT-based shopping for these fees to make a dent in OpenAI’s debt.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "body": "\nAdobe is partnering with YouTube to launch a dedicated content creation space in Premiere for iOS for YouTube Shorts creators, the company announced on Monday. The new space gives creators access to exclusive templates, transitions, and effects, along with the ability to instantly publish Shorts to their YouTube channels directly from their phones.\nThe company says the space is designed to give creators everything they need to produce viral videos, grow their audience, and tap into trends, whether it’s creating day-in-the-life vlogs, travel videos, or behind-the-scenes clips. \nBy partnering with Adobe, YouTube is giving creators on its platform an exclusive space to create content, encouraging them to use its partners’ space instead of competitors’ tools, like Meta’s Edits or CapCut, which is owned by TikTok parent ByteDance.\n“Although content edited in Premiere mobile can be shared to other social platforms, what’s unique about this partnership is that creators getting inspiration from their YouTube Shorts feed, can launch a template that caught their eye, directly into Premiere mobile and start customizing it for their own channel,” said Meagan Keane, director, Product Marketing, Digital Video and Audio at Adobe, in an email to TechCrunch. “This content creation space within the Premiere mobile app is designed and optimized for YouTube Shorts.”\nImage Credits:Adobe\nThe Create for YouTube Shorts content creation space in Premiere mobile features Shorts templates from top creators with built-in text, effects, and transition presets. Creators can add their own media and customize the templates to their style. They also have the option to create and submit their own original templates.\nTo get started, creators need a free Premiere mobile login to access the space and a YouTube profile to publish directly to their Shorts feed. Creators can download Adobe Premiere from the App Store and tap the “Create for YouTube” option to access the creation space. \nFrom there, they can upload clips from their iPhone camera roll, cloud storage, or Adobe Creative Cloud. They can then cut and trim clips, layer in video and audio tracks, adjust color and brightness, and add text overlays and captions.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAfter following export prompts, creators can upload the finished product to YouTube. \n“New tools and capabilities in the app, like templates, effects, transitions, and this new content creation space for YouTube Short creation, will be powerful for all creators, from longtime creators to those just getting started,” Keane said. “It brings creators polished video editing with studio-quality audio, AI sound effects, precision multi-track editing, Firefly AI content generation, and more to make producing and sharing their content easier and faster. This ultimately helps us further our goal of empowering creativity for all. Every day, we’re focused on doing our part to make this the best time ever to be a creator.”\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

The company also teased the upcoming launch of “Shared Feeds,” which will let users watch TikTok content together through a shared interest-based feed.\nTikTok rolled out individual Collections earlier this year to let users save content in custom folders. With Shared Collections, users can now do things like create a space to share cookie-swap plans and holiday-dinner ideas with their family. Or, they can create Shared Collections to organize decor inspo or Secret Santa ideas.\n“Whether it’s content from their favorite creators, inspiration for a home design project, or a new skill they’re learning together, Shared Collection makes it easy for people to stay organized as they discover and save on TikTok,” the company explained in the blog post.\nImage Credits:TikTok\nYou can only create a Shared Collection with someone if you’re both following each other. Collections can stay just between friends and family, or they can be made public. \nShared Collections are available globally to accounts of those over age 16.\nAs for Shared Feeds, which are launching in the coming months, TikTok sees them as a way for users to discover content together. Users can generate Shared Feeds in one-on-one direct messages. \nShared Feeds will surface new content tailored to both users’ tastes, such as sports or winter activities, and their favorite creators. The feeds are generated based on users’ TikTok activity, such as what they like, watch, and comment on.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nIt’s worth noting that the feeds aren’t continuous, as users will find a selection of 15 videos in their Shared Feed each day. \nImage Credits:TikTok\nThe feature is similar to Instagram Reels’ Blend feature that lets you create a custom, personalized reels feed for you and your friends.\nUsers will be able to create a Shared Feed by sending an invite to another user. Once the invitation is accepted, they can create a feed and chat about it in DMs. After both people have watched all the videos, they can view metrics, including which videos they both liked, in their “Shared Likes” history. \nTikTok also announced that it’s launching greeting cards that users can send each other. Users will be able to select a greeting card inside their chats, write a message, and send it. The receiver will get a festive animation alongside the message. \n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

Discovery (WBD), days after Warner agreed to be acquired by Netflix for $82.7 billion. \nParamount is going straight to WBD’s shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share, and it noted that its offer provides shareholders $18 billion more cash than the Netflix deal, which offered $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix shares for a total of $27.75 per share.\nParamount is bidding for all of WBD, while Netflix’s deal with the company only includes its Hollywood studios and streaming business. \nCNBC reported on Monday that these were the very terms from Paramount that WBD’s board rejected a week ago.\n“We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement. \nParamount’s offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private-equity firm RedBird Capital, in addition to $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi, and Apollo.\nNetflix came out on top on Friday after winning a bidding war against Paramount and Comcast, but Paramount’s hostile bid is sure to drag on the battle for one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, a fight which has already stretched out for months.\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nNetflix’s proposed deal has already raised antitrust questions, as it would combine two of the most popular streaming platforms into one. Additionally, President Donald Trump has said the deal “could be a problem” because of the size of the combined companies’ market share.\nA deal between WBD and Paramount would also likely raise similar concerns.\nNetflix agreed to pay WBD $5.8 billion if the deal doesn’t go through. WBD would have to pay Netflix $2.8 billion if it decides to call off the deal.\nNetflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\t\tAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body": "\nX’s Head of Product Nikita Bier fired back at the European Commission this weekend after the EC fined the social media company €120 million (around $140 million).\nIn its first fine under the European Union’s Digital Services Act, the commission called X’s blue checkmark system “deceptive” and said the paid verification system makes users vulnerable to impersonation and scams. The commission also said X’s advertising repository failed to meet the DSA’s requirements for transparency and accessibility.\nThe commission said that X must respond within 60 days to its concerns about blue checkmarks, and within 90 days to the ad transparency violations, or it could face additional penalties.\nAfter the fine was announced, X owner Elon Musk described it as “bullshit” and also posted, “How long before the EU is gone? AbolishTheEU”.\nNow it seems X has penalized the commission’s account on the platform — not, the company says, because of the fine, but rather the commission’s use of X’s advertising system.\nQuoting the commission’s post announcing the fine, X’s Bier accused the EC of logging into a “dormant ad account to take advantage of an exploit in our Ad Composer — to post a link that deceives users into thinking it’s a video and to artificially increase its reach.”\n“As you may be aware, X believes everyone should have an equal voice on our platform,” Bier wrote. “However, it seems you believe that the rules should not apply to your account.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nAs a result, he said the commission’s ad account had been “terminated.” Bier subsequently said the exploit “has never been abused like this” and has since been patched.\nA European Commission spokesperson told TechCrunch that the commission “always uses all social media platforms in good faith.”\n⁠”The Commission is simply using the tools that platforms themselves are making available to our corporate accounts — this was the case with the ‘Post Composer’ tool in X,” the spokesperson said. “⁠We expect these tools to be fully in line with the platforms’ own terms and conditions, as well as with our legislative framework.”\nThe spokesperson added that the commission suspended paid advertising on X in October 2023, and that suspension remains in effect.\nThis post has been updated with comments from a European Commission spokesperson.\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

(One of the users who’d complained initially about the ads responded skeptically, writing, “Bruhhh… Don’t insult your paying users.”)\n\nI'm in ChatGPT (paid Plus subscription), asking about Windows BitLockerand it's F-ing showing me ADS TO SHOP AT TARGET.Yeah, screw this. Lose all your users. pic.twitter.com/2Z5AG8pnlJ— Benjamin De Kraker (@BenjaminDEKR) December 3, 2025\n\nSimilarly, ChatGPT head Nick Turley posted Friday that he was “seeing lots of confusion about ads rumors in ChatGPT.”\n“There are no live tests for ads – any screenshots you’ve seen are either not real or not ads,” Turley wrote. “If we do pursue ads, we’ll take a thoughtful approach. People trust ChatGPT and anything we do will be designed to respect that.”\nEarlier that same day, however, Chen responded in a more apologetic tone, acknowledging that the controversy isn’t just a matter of user confusion.\n“I agree that anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care, and we fell short,” he wrote. “We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision. We’re also looking at better controls so you can dial this down or off if you don’t find it helpful.”\n\n\t\tTechcrunch event\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSan Francisco\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOctober 13-15, 2026\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\nEarlier this year, former Instacart and Facebook executive Fidji Sumo joined OpenAI as CEO of Applications and was widely expected to build up the company’s advertising business. However, The Wall Street Journal reported this week that a recent memo from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red,” prioritizing work to improve the quality of ChatGPT and pushing back other products, including advertising.\n\n\t\t\t\n\tTopics\n\n\n\n\t\tAnthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

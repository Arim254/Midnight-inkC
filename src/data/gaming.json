    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on January 8, 2026 at 9:36AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                South Park is coming to Fortnite on Friday, but this is not the sort of Fortnite collab that only adds skins to the item shop--though we're certainly getting a pile of skins. No, South Park is also taking over Fortnite's Battle Royale mode by introducing several major new gameplay overhauls (and we mean major) and taking over one of the major named locations on the map. Also, there's a completely free event pass that'll allow players to earn free South Park cosmetics by completing quests--yes, you'll actually have to play the game to earn these things.And, of course, there will be five skins in the item shop, all of which are the boys from South Park in mech suits--there's Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, and Butters. More importantly, there will also be a Towelie sidekick in the shop for all the sweaty gamers out there.New quad size: QuintsThe single biggest change being introduced with this crossover event is the addition of Quints, a five-player variety of the main Battle Royale mode, playable in both Build and Zero Build. It's the first time Epic has added a new squad size to BR since it added Trios about five years ago, so this is kind of a big deal. We don't know for sure if Quints will stick around beyond this event, though. Epic previously added a six-player version of Blitz Royale earlier this year, but removed it after a few weeks. Kenny TokenThe Kenny token, which you can find as random loot, is an entirely new gameplay concept for Battle Royale. If you have one of these tokens when you die, you'll automatically reboot. That'll be quite a game-changer, depending on how common these end up being.Cheesy PoofsWhile this may seem like just another consumable healing item, Cheesy Poofs are also a weapon--throwing a box at an enemy will damage them. The days of feeling like an idiot because you accidentally threw a shield pot at the other guy when you tried to switch to a different gun are finally over. At least temporarily.The Stick of TruthOnly one Stick of Truth will appear each round, and the person who claims it will become the round's final boss. But not because it turns you into a kaiju or gives you sick abilities--having the Stick of Truth in your inventory will make the storm circle center on you for the remainder of the match. Wonkeeland is now CartmanlandThe Wonkeeland POI in the northwest part of the island has received a South Park-themed makeover and is now Cartmanland, based on the theme park Cartman took over on the show. It's still more or less the same place, just with Cartman's face all over it.Born in Chaos event passFor the first time in almost two years, Fortnite is doing a new event mini-pass. This one is completely free to everyone, and includes 13 tiers of items that you can unlock by completing quests in Battle Royale--meaning this is not the sort of pass that you can passively get through by gaining XP. We don't know what all the pass will include, but among them are Terrance and Phillip dolls as a pickaxe, and a CRED backpack.Final pass reward: Imaginationland GliderThe very last reward on the pass, which requires completing every available South Park pass quest, is the Imaginationland Airship glider, which comes from an epic three-episode story in Season 10 that was originally planned to be a theatrical movie.     \n  \n                      "

For a limited time, players can earn Fallout operator skins and other themed rewards by unlocking them in free and paid event passes. Here's a look at all Fallout rewards in Call of Duty and how you unlock them during the event.Call of Duty's Fallout event runs from now until January 29. This adds operator skins and cosmetics themed around Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show. While there are plenty of free rewards to earn, you'll need to purchase the paid \"premium\" pass for 1,100 CoD Points ($10) if you want to unlock all items for the event.There are 20 rewards in total for the Fallout event. There are 10 rewards in the free pass, and 10 more optional rewards can be unlocked with the paid pass. The highlights of the free pass include two vault dweller operator skins and the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun. The paid pass is required to unlock Maximus and The Ghoul characters from the show.It's also worth noting that the character, Lucy MacLean, will arrive as a shop bundle at a later date. Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.All Fallout event rewards can be seen below. This is an XP-based event, so you'll simply need to grind XP across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. For multiplayer, objective modes like Kill Confirmed and Domination work best, while Plunder and Casual battle royale modes will yield more XP for Warzone. This is also a good time to use double XP tokens if you have them.It's worth noting that this crossover features Fallout-themed game modes and events across multiplayer, Zombies, Endgame, and Warzone.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Nintendo has revealed its first set of new Joy-Con controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 and I'll be honest, I'm a bit disappointed.To be clear, I'm not disappointed (or surprised) by the $100 price tag, as the original Switch Joy-Cons are still $90, the standard Switch 2 Joy-Cons are $100, and all gaming hardware is pretty expensive right now. No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist.Similar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as \"Light Green.\" Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors. It took a long time for me to care for any of the original Switch's Joy-Con colorways enough to purchase them, as the vast majority are extremely saturated and don't feature color combinations that I feel pair well together. I was so starved for options, in fact, that I purchased the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch largely because I thought it featured the best Joy-Con colors available. In that sense, these new Joy-Cons definitely feel like an improvement.The new Switch 2 Joy-Cons.However, the problem with these new Joy-Cons is that, for the most part, you won't actually see these colors. When using your Switch 2 in handheld mode or with the Joy-Con grip, the strips of color on the inner portion of the controllers are entirely hidden. So while these colors might be pretty, it's a bit disappointing that they are essentially relegated to two small rings around the thumbsticks.So sure, if you are just looking to pick up a second pair of Joy-Cons simply to have a second pair of Joy-Cons you might as well grab these; there's at least a small difference between them and the standard red and blue controllers that come with the console. That said, it's just a bummer that they lack the same level of whimsy, creativity, and variation as the original Switch's Joy-Cons.The good news is you can (kinda) remedy this issue so long as you're willing to spend an extra $20. Shortly after the Joy-Cons were revealed, gaming accessories company Dbrand announced it had already created a Joy-Con skin that perfectly matches the new colorway. It's not an official fix, sure, but to quote the brand, it \"does what Nintendon't.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

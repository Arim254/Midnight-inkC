The Cold Snap update brings multiple seasonal events, a new Snowfall map condition, and plenty more for fans to sink their teeth into. Among the fresh additions is the Goalie Raider Deck--the game's second battle pass--which contains a smorgasbord of cosmetics, gear, items, and even Raider Tokens that can be used toward premium purchases in the shop.The Goalie Deck is free for all players, so you won't need to purchase access to these rewards with premium currency. Instead, you'll simply need to work toward completing daily Feats that provide you with Creds, then use those to unlock your preferred items from the deck. This should prove fairly easy to do for most players, as you can complete up to three Feats per match, and you'll even get additional bonus Creds for the first five Feats you finish in a day.Perhaps the best news about the Goalie Deck, however, is that it's a permanent reward track. Unlike battle passes in other games, this deck will stick around forever, meaning you can unlock what you want from it whenever you'd like. With this in mind, you can skip any rewards that just don't matter much to you right now--though it's worth pointing out you will still need to purchase a certain number of items from the deck to unlock subsequent pages.If you're excited to dive into the Goalie Deck and start reaping its rewards--including the new hockey-themed outfit, which is pretty rad--we've got you covered ahead of time. Keep scrolling below for every reward from the Goalie Deck in Arc Raiders.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                When it comes to Roblox games, Blox Fruits might just be the biggest, and that doubles for both popularity and scope. With a level cap of a whopping 2800, working your way up from the beginning is one hell of a journey. Luckily, we’re here to help you with Blox Fruits leveling and offer some small tips that’ll help you as you battle enemies and try to get more powerful in this thrilling Roblox experience.Blox Fruits Leveling ExplainedThere are plenty of ways to level up in Blox Fruits, and even more reasons for doing so. Naturally, like any other RPG, you will get stronger with every level, and this is the key to taking on more powerful enemies on different islands.For clarity, leveling up will give you access to several new things, including:New islands to explore3 stat points to spend as you likeLevel-gated NPC questsOther gameplay elements like Raids, Awakening Fruits, and Elite PiratesOne of the most important parts of leveling up is the stat points, which you can spend in any of the following categories:MeleeDefenseSwordGunBlox FruitHow you spend your stats will depend on your playstyle, but it is important to remember that Melee increases your energy, while Defense increases your health. Then, later, when you unlock different Blox Fruits, the Blox Fruit stat will increase each Fruit’s damage.Best Blox Fruits For LevelingEarly in the game, the best Blox Fruit for leveling up is the Buddha. If you can get your hands on it, this Legendary-tier Fruit transforms the user into a golden, glowing, giant.This transformation crucially negates a huge chunk of incoming damage, meaning you can tank some big hits. But it also extends your hit box, making it easier for you to mow enemies down. Alongside this, it also has several AoE-focused special attacks, making it easy for you to hit multiple foes at once and spread out your damage. This is fantastic for farming smaller enemies when you want to grind XP, and also helps you to take on some of the tougher early bosses in the game. If you do pick up the Buddha early, it is also wise to power up your Melee stat to boost its power, and the defensive capabilities of the Buddha mean you can worry less about the Defense stat.However, at a whopping $1,200,000, or 1,650 Robux, you may not be able to pick up the Buddha for a little while. In the meantime, some other picks like Flame or Light can offer a huge help at the start of your Blox Fruit journey. Both Flame and Light have great damage stats, but Light also has some fantastic mobility to help you find those first few islands.Best Blox Fruits Fighting Style For Leveling UpAt the beginning of Blox Fruits, it's best to focus on either the Melee or Sword fighting style to just help you quickly grind through the early enemy NPCs you‘ll find scattered around the seas. While there are many better fighting styles later on, Sword and Melee are really effective for just spamming enemies and growing those early levels.Best Tips For Leveling Up In Blox FruitsHow you choose to grind through Blox Fruits is entirely up to you, and the way you level up will ultimately be defined by your preferred playstyle. However, there are some basic tips that should help people, no matter how they like to play.First of all, be mindful of the accessory you use. While most of the time you should just choose one that you like, or love the design for, when grinding, you should be focusing on boosting your stats to save time. Early items like the Black Cape are great here, which you have a chance of earning by defeating Elite Pirates.One slightly cheesy method folks love to implement has been dubbed the ‘Fountain Method’ as it is particularly useful on the First Sea’s Fountain Island. Upon engaging with certain mobs, if there is a wall nearby, you can simply hop behind the wall and attack from a distance. While enemies have a much lower range behind walls, yours is slightly longer, so you can use this to spam even very tough enemies. Just be careful of your distance!Next, while it can be good to find the toughest enemies you can currently handle when you're grinding, you generally save time grinding islands with more mobs, even if they aren’t quite as strong. This is also very important when using double XP codes, which, while very effective, work better against large amounts of enemies instead of a single high-level mob or boss.Finally, if you are grinding bosses and are getting sick of waiting for them to respawn, many players find it helpful to jump between servers to find one where the boss is available again. This can be fantastic for grinding XP and items from those tough bosses.Best Blox Fruits Locations For Early Leveling UpThere are plenty of great places to grind levels in Blox Fruits, but if you’re just starting out, or bumping up against some difficult enemies, here are some of the best places to grind in the first sea and those essential early levels.1-55 - Grind the bandits on the opening island, then use the Fountain Method on Fountain Island55-90 - Attack the Chef on Pirate Island, and use server hopping to get quicker respawns90-105 - Grind by attacking the Snow Bandit in the Frozen Village105-130 - Attack the Yeti Boss in the Frozen Village, and remember to use server hopping130-220 - Use server hopping to grind the Vice Admiral boss in Marine Fortress220-350 - Grind the bosses in the Prison using server hopping350-435 - Attack the Magma Admiral in the Magma Village and use server hopping to ensure respawns425-500 Attack the Fishman Lord in Underwater City\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nDonkey Kong Bananza makes Nintendo’s platforming formula louder and more chaotic.By \n    Aron Garst\n   on December 28, 2025 at 6:00AM PST\n              \n                Drop into the lagoon in Donkey Kong Bananza. Sure, you need to chase Void Kong to the Earth's center to save the day, but maybe you just want to soak in some water-adjacent locales as you explore this new world beneath the surface. There are plenty of secrets tucked away in each level's hidden crevices. When you first hop in there is really only one thing to do: pick a direction and start smashing.Donkey Kong Bananza takes Nintendo's hallmark sandbox exploration and pushes it somewhere the studio rarely goes--pure chaos. Bananza is not interested in the kind of precision platforming that defines Mario's visits to Peach's Castle, Delfino Plaza, or outer space. It captures that same cheerful vibe, but lets players rip through it.There is a long-running design idea at Nintendo that movement should feel good on its own. Shigeru Miyamoto once said he wanted players to enjoy moving Mario around an empty room. The reason Mario is so fun to control in Super Mario 64 is that Miyamoto and the small team behind the N64 classic spent months making sure he felt great to play, even if the only action possible was running around an empty space.Delfino Plaza from Super Mario SunshineCombine that movement philosophy with tightly designed playgrounds and you get moments players never forget. There is nothing quite like triple hopping across the center square of Delfino Plaza, bouncing off an umbrella, and sliding into a chimney chute to grab a blue coin. It was fun just to jump around, which naturally encouraged exploration, which created a quick dopamine hit when a secret Shine Sprite appeared and the day literally got brighter.Donkey Kong Bananza taps into that same feeling, but in an entirely different way. I am not guiding Donkey Kong across rooftops with three perfect hops. I am plowing through debris, carving my own path, and uncovering collectible-packed caverns. It becomes easy to wander off the main objective and start exploring every crack and crevice of the planet's inner layers.Platforming has always been a pillar of Nintendo design. Mario, Kirby, and Donkey Kong, along with other Nintendo icons, all focus on exploration through running, jumping, and a bit of flair. Donkey Kong Bananza keeps the flair, but adds a hefty serving of smash. It feels authentic because chaos is exactly what you expect from a rambunctious gorilla.Donkey Kong is naturally destructive, according to NintendoNintendo has said before that playing as Donkey Kong should feel like an adventure through untamed spaces. Bananza producer Kenta Motokura echoed that idea in an interview, saying that with the goal of defining what 3D Donkey Kong should be and highlighting his strengths and new actions, the team felt the concept of destruction was the right fit.In the end, Bananza succeeds because it embraces exactly what makes Donkey Kong special. It is loud, messy, and endlessly fun. The thrill is not just in reaching the core. It is in everything you smash, discover, and carve through along the way.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

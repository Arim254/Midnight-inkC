    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    S.E. Doster\n   on December 4, 2025 at 1:48PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Haven's Hollow is CoD: Warzone's new map added with Black Ops 7's integration in Season 1. This map is set in the same town as Black Ops 6's Zombies mode, but this version of Liberty Falls depicts the locale in its pre-outbreak state, so the map looks like a quaint West Virginia town nestled in Appalachia. In this guide, we highlight the full Haven's Hollow map and main points of interest.In terms of size, Haven's Hollow is bigger than Warzone's Rebirth Island but is slightly smaller than Fortune's Keep. There are nine main points of interest, offering a decent variety of locations to explore.Despite this being pre-outbreak, Black Ops 6 Zombies fans will still recognize several areas. Haven's Hollow includes the church, mansion, motel, bowling alley, and other major locations from Liberty Falls, but the playable space also extends beyond the areas within the Zombies maps. This expansion adds brand-new areas to explore, such as the Lumbermill, Riverboat, and Train Station.The full Haven's Hollow map can be viewed below, including closer looks at main POIs and surrounding areas.Season 1 of Black Ops 7 and Warzone includes a brand-new battle pass, more maps, and new DLC weapons to unlock.Full Haven's Hollow map layoutAll Haven's Hollow main POIs:MansionPondTrain StationBarnResearch CenterMain StreetRiver BoatCoal DepotLumbermillMansionMansion is located in the northern part of the map. This area will be instantly familiar if you played the Shattered Veil Zombies map in Black Ops 6. This lets you loot inside Richtofen's mansion, visit the giant T-Rex fossil, and explore both floors of the building. There is also an ascender to let you reach the rooftop for a better view and vertically.PondPond is a beautiful open area in the northwest portion of the town. The water is shallow, so you can still run through the area, and you'll probably want to keep moving, as this part of the map doesn't provide a lot of cover.Train StationVisit the town's Train Station on the west side of Haven's Hollow, which offers a flat area of land with clean lines of sight. There is a center station to explore and a few small building interiors for close-quarters fights as well. Following the train tracks will take you toward Main Street or to the cliffside that leads to the map's outer edge.BarnBarn serves as a center hub of the map, and this point of interest includes two major areas. There's the town's chapel and a massive barn. Both areas should give you plenty of loot and high, rooftop vantage points. These areas should be great for sniping and getting a lay of the land.Research CenterFound in the northeast corner of the map, Research Center offers you access to Haven's Lab and a smaller data center building. The lab gives you a large three-level structure with an atrium in the middle, which offers plenty of real estate for looting. The area outside is mostly parking lot space and pathways that provide long, open sightlines.Main StreetMain Street is another part of Haven's Hollow that will be familiar if you played BO6 Zombies. This includes the Liberty Falls shops, including the video rental store, ice cream shop, bowling alley, and other locations. This is where a lot of close-quarters action can happen, and there are plenty of loot opportunities as well.RiverboatHaven's Hollow expands Liberty Falls all the way down south to the river, and you can explore the Haven's Gamble luxury paddleboat right on the water, which is south of Main Street. Riverboat has three decks to explore and loot, and if things get dicey, you can always jump in the water and swim around the coast.Coal DepotCoal Depot is on the east side of the map, and you'll find it just below the Research Center. This area has a large main building connected by other small buildings and brick walls. There is plenty of cover for both interior and exterior engagements.LumbermillJust like Coal Depot, Lumbermill offers large building space to loot and fight. There are two large buildings here, plus smaller structures to explore. It also has a large silo outside, which makes a great vantage point for snipers.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In 2020, Just Cause creator and Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg started a new company, Liquid Swords, alongside other industry veterans. Now, the team at Liquid Swords has shared the first trailer for its debut action title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story. It may remind some fans of Grand Theft Auto, but there are differences that make it a lot harder to earn money in this game.          Tyndalston is the name of the city, and players will step into the role of Samson McCray, an aging criminal who is facing a crushing debt. Players can steal the money they need, but this isn't like other open-world crime games where you can keep going non-stop. Samson has physical limits as to what he can pull off in a day, which are measured by action points. Use too many on a single job and you won't be able to do much else.As time passes in this world, your debt increases. For every crime you commit, the city remembers and your reputation grows. According to Liquid Swords, \"There are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse.\" This is a story about debt, consequences, and survival. Samson will have to deal with all three on a daily basis.\"We built Samson to strike fast and leave a mark,\" said Sundberg in a statement. \"It's a raw, physical story with systems that push back at every turn. This is the start of what Liquid Swords stands for, and the team has delivered something with real teeth. We've come through a heavy cycle of change and sharpened every part of how we work. The entire industry is navigating pressure right now. Samson is our answer to that reality, a focused project built with intent, not excess. This is how we move forward.\"Samson: A Tyndalston Story will be released on PC in early 2026 on Steam and the Epic Games Store.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                After some very public missteps and an unprecedented return to beta, Splitgate is hoping to make a comeback under a new name. At the PC Games Show, 1047 Games announced that Splitgate 2 will return as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, with massive gameplay and progression changes that aim to bring the shooter closer to its roots.According to 1047 Games design director Josh Watson, the studio has been rebuilding the game \"from the ground up,\" incorporating and refining the best elements from both Splitgate games while \"removing what didn't work.\" In a video announcement, Watson specifically cited Unreal Tournament, Quake, and Halo as the main inspirations for Splitgate.To that end, the rebooted Splitgate will lack the Factions and Abilities introduced in Splitgate 2 for a more \"classic arena combat\" experience. Arena Reloaded also contains retooled progression and ranked systems, along with reduced in-game store prices; Splitgate 2's microtransactions were a major pain point with players when the game first launched.          Additionally, Splitgate: Arena Unloaded adds five new maps, six \"fully reworked\" maps, three new Primary Weapons, and a Railgun power weapon. 1047 Games emphasizes that all the new additions are based on community feedback through public playtesting.1047 Games announced last month that the Splitgate 2 beta ends on December 4, with the game going offline afterward before its relaunch. As with Splitgate 2, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will be free-to-play on PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.Splitgate 2 first launched in open beta form in May before a full release in June. After a public controversy in which 1047 Games wore a \"Make FPS Great Again\" hat at Summer Game Fest, along with microtransaction complaints and developer layoffs, the game reverted back to beta in July.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Blair Marnell\n   on November 19, 2025 at 10:14AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Earlier this week, The Game Awards shared its list of the nominees for the 2025 ceremony. And while there are some clear favorites, the outcome will ultimately come down to a vote by the fans.The voting period has begun and can be found on The Game Awards' official site. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had the most nominations of any game with 12 total, including three nominations in Best Performance.One of the lone stragglers from late 2024 was Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. While that title wasn't forgotten, it only received two nominations, including one for Troy Baker's performance as Indy.While the Indy game only got two, indie games performed particularly well this year, with titles like Hollow Knight: Silksong and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 holding their own with five and two nominations, respectively. But over 60 games received only a single nomination for this year's awards.It's too soon to say if any of this year's titles will run away with the awards, but Game of the Year is down to six fan-favorite titles: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hades 2, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.To help you keep track of this year's Game Awards, GameSpot has listed each multi-nominated game alongside their respective categories. The results will be announced live when The Game Awards is streamed on December 11.Clair Obscur: Expedition 33Nominations: 12Categories:Game of the YearBest Game DirectionBest NarrativeBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Audio DesignBest Independent GameBest Debut Indie GameBest RPGBest Performance x 3Ben Starr, Charlie Cox, and Jennifer English are all nominated for their performances in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Death Stranding 2: On the BeachNominations: 7Categories:Game of the YearBest Game DirectionBest NarrativeBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Audio DesignBest Action Adventure GameGhost of YoteiNominations: 7Best Game DirectionBest NarrativeBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Audio DesignBest Action Adventure GameBest PerformanceHades 2Nominations: 6Categories:Game of the YearBest Game DirectionBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Independent GameBest Action GameHollow Knight: SilksongNominations: 5Categories:Game of the YearBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Independent GameBest Action Adventure GameSplit FictionNominations: 4Best Game DirectionBest Action/AdventureBest Family GameBest MultiplayerSilent Hill fNominations: 3Categories:Best NarrativeBest Audio DesignBest PerformanceKingdom Come: Deliverance IINominations: 3Game of the YearBest NarrativeBest RPGBattlefield 6Nominations: 3Categories:Best Audio DesignBest Action GameBest MultiplayerDonkey Kong BananzaNominations: 2Categories:Game of the YearBest FamilyMario Kart WorldNominations: 2Categories:Best FamilyBest Sports/RacingIndiana Jones and the Great CircleNominations: 2Categories:Best PerformanceBest Action/AdventureDoom: The Dark AgesNominations: 2Categories:Innovation in AccessibilityBest Action GameFinal Fantasy 14Nominations: 2Categories:Best OngoingBest Community SupportFortniteNominations: 2Categories:Best OngoingBest Community SupportHelldivers 2Nominations: 2Categories:Best OngoingBest Community SupportNo Man's SkyNominations: 2Categories:Best OngoingBest Community SupportEA Sports FC 26Nominations: 2Categories:Innovation in AccessibilityBest Sports/RacingBlue PrinceNominations: 2Categories:Best Independent GameBest Debut Indie GameSingle-Nominee GamesThe following games received a single nomination from The Game Awards.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In August, reports emerged that Microsoft had paused development on Contraband, a co-op smuggler game from Just Cause developer Avalanche. At the time, some sources noted that Microsoft put a \"hold\" on production rather than a full cancellation. But now, Contraband's fate appears to be sealed as mass layoffs at Avalanche have resulted in the closure of its Liverpool studio.Avalanche announced the news on its official site, and disclosed that it means 31 developers are losing their jobs. Per United Kingdom labor laws, Avalanche initiated \"a collective consultation process\" in September before moving ahead with the layoffs and closing the studio. However, the rest of the company remains intact.\"The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project,\" reads the message from Avalanche. \"We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios Group. Our focus remains on supporting the [staff] through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.\"Contraband was initially announced during an Xbox E3 presentation in 2021. At the time, it was touted as a AAA game set in the 1970s in the fictional country of Bayan. It wasn't the only long-term game that was shuttered by Microsoft this year. Rare's Everwild, the Perfect Dark reboot, and a new MMO from ZeniMax Online Studios were all casualties of a purge of 9,000 people, including Xbox employees.A recent report suggested that Microsoft's struggles to find its footing may be due to sky-high profit goals that have resulted in multiple waves of layoffs at the company.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The first major Arc Raiders update arrived last week, with the introduction of the Stella Montis map as one of the main highlights. Now, days later, developer Embark Studios has revealed on X some statistics about how players have fared in the abandoned facility. To start, the Shredder enemy is living up to its namesake, knocking out more than 2.2 million players.The Shredder is just one of the new additions with the North Line update for Arc Raiders. The Matriarch is another fresh ARC foe terrorizing players, and it's much larger than the Shredder. However, Embark notes 26,923 Matriachs have been dismantled so far, so players have found success against them. Overall, there have been 25 million visits to Stella Montis. Of those, somehow 117 players discovered a way to down themselves with volcanic rock, which seemingly baffles even Embark.Congrats to every Raider who staked their claim on Stella Montis last week! 🏔️The tunnels that awaited at the end of the Breaking New Ground project were cold and unforgiving, here's how the action played out: pic.twitter.com/NzH9orgtI6  — ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) November 19, 2025              Arc Raiders players had to donate resources to initially unlock access to Stella Montis, which they did faster than anticipated. In fact, Embark highlighted that one particular person offered up over 26,000 resources during the community event. Over the past week, Arc Raiders hit a peak of over 480,000 concurrent players on Steam alone--the extraction shooter is also available on the Epic Games Store as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.For more, check out GameSpot's Arc Raiders review.

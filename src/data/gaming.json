    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fortnite OG is holding its latest live event this weekend, with a recreation of the Chapter 1 Butterfly Event slated to go down on Saturday, November 8. Fortnite OG has been hot and heavy with these sorts of live events, in which some wild thing happens on the map during regular matches, and this certainly won't be the last one we see as the permanent OG mode starts moving through the last few seasons of Chapter 1.It's Fortnite's second big live event in a week, as one held last Saturday introduced the Simpsons' invasion of the main Battle Royale mode. Here's how you can take part in the Fortnite OG Butterfly Event.When and where is The Fortnite OG Butterfly Event going to take place?The Butterfly Event will go down during matches of Fortnite OG on Saturday, November 8 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET. You'll want to get in a few minutes early, and head to the big cube next to Loot Lake in the center of the island. Epic has been adding safe zones for live events recently, so you may not have to worry about players griefing you during it--but be on your guard in case you do have to defend yourself.What to expect from the Fortnite OG Butterfly EventThe original version of this event was a bit more involved than Fortnite's previous live events, as up to this point they'd just been things that didn't directly involve players. The Butterfly Event, on the other hand, will allow players to have a close encounter with the cosmic butterfly the event is named for. We won't describe it any further for the sake of those who'd rather not have a detailed rundown in advance, but those who want to know exactly what to expect, or who'd like to refresh their memories, can watch the old version of the event below.          The new version of the event probably won't be exactly the same as the old version. Each time Epic has recreated an old live event in Fortnite OG, it's added some new wrinkles, and that'll probably also be true for this one. It may be a small difference, like the butterfly being red instead of purple, or something much bigger. If you're wondering whether the Simpsons takeover of Fortnite might extend to Fortnite OG--it's not impossible, but it's pretty unlikely.Fortnite OG Season 6 has reached its midpoint, as it's scheduled to wrap up on December 11, and OG Season 7 is expected to start the next day.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders presents you with plenty of quests that require you to find materials or unique items, but only a few require you to use your materials to complete them. Eyes on the Prize, however, is one such quest that expects you to bring along a little something to help you get the job done. Let's jump in and see what's what.You'll need 3 Wires to repair the solar panel and complete Eyes on the Prize. Wires are a common resource found in Electrical-based POIs, and within a few hours of gameplay, you should've already amassed quite a collection--unless you've been selling them. Whether you're tossing them into your inventory before you head out or finding them while in the raid, just make sure you have 3 of them before you head to the secluded roof terrace for Eyes on the Prize. And make sure you toss them in a safe pocket if possible, as you never know when things could go wrong, and you don't want to lose them.When you're ready to repair a solar panel, here's how to complete Eyes on the Prize.Where to find the secluded roof terrace west of the Southern StationThe first objective in Eyes on the Prize is to find a secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station extraction point. The quest mentions to keep an eye out for a blue tarp, but it can still be hard to spot if you're not at the right angle. With that in mind, refer to the photo below for the exact location on the map.Gallery                                       You'll need to be on the roof to reach the secluded roof terrace (as per the name). You'll eventually spot a blue tarp with some chairs, boxes, and an electric box. That's your destination.How to rewire the solar panelAs mentioned earlier, you'll need to have brought or scavenged 3 Wires to repair the solar panel at the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace. If you didn't bring any in with you, you'll either have to recycle an electrical item like a Battery or visit an Electrical-based POI on the map to round a few up.As long as you have the 3 Wires in your inventory, you can approach the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace and interact with it to finish your repairs like a proper electrician. With that out of the way, the Eyes on the Prize quest will conclude.Repair the solar panel using 3 Wires.Since you don't need to extract to complete the quest, you're now free to finish looting or shooting until you're ready to leave. The nearby Southern Station should prove to be a solid spot to extract when you're finished up, though. Just keep in mind that it tends to be an active region of the map, so don't let your guard down.If you need to tackle more quests, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fortnite Battle Royale will return to a more typical experience once the current Simpsons mini-season ends at the end of November, according to a blog posted on the Fortnite Status Twitter account, with the game slated to return to 100-player rounds and a much roomier island.The launch of Fortnite's Simpsons-themed mini-season at the beginning of November introduced some dramatic changes to the rhythm of Battle Royale matches, thanks largely to the size of the map. The new Springfield island covers about half the land area that the Chapter 6 island did, with the mode temporarily supporting 80 players instead of 100. That's made the island extraordinarily dense with players, and it's been tough to land in any named location at the start of a match without bumping into an opponent trying to grab the same chest you're going for.The blog said that fundamental shift in the flow of matches was an experiment.\"Here's something different: this season’s BR is 80 players instead of 100 on the more compact map. The vibe so far? Faster rotations, more meaningful fights, and less time running across empty fields. This is an experiment--we plan to return to 100 players next season--but we wanted to see what happens when we concentrate the action.\"That wasn't the only big piece of news we got from this blog. For this Saturday and Sunday only, Epic is adding two Simpsons-themed weapons--the Deodorant Applicator, and Bart's Slingshot--to the Battle Royale loot pool. This is another unusual thing Epic is trying during this mini-season, as the company debuted those weapons last weekend in Delulu mode.Fortnite's Simpsons season is live until November 29, when Chapter 7 will begin.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

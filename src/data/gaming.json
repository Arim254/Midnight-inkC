These events feature new Halloween-themed costumes, five of which are available now, and more will be available in the shop later.The two Halloween events are Voyage to Astonish and Marvel Zombies. Voyage to Astonish is an event board, where you can move a piece around a circular board. Each space on the board features a reward, with some restricted to the premium version. The premium version, which costs 690 Lattice ($7), includes a Legendary Peni Parker Floral Flights costume, a Dia De Los Muertos-inspired skin, and a recolor for it called Skeleton.The board also includes a free skin for Blade, called Blade Knight, which has him dressed up like Moon Knight. To move around the board, you need to obtain Lanterns from completing event challenges. You need 21 Lanterns to collect all rewards. If you purchase the premium version, it will not expire, allowing you to earn rewards beyond the event.The second event is Marvel Zombies, which is a four-player PvE mode where you have to fight through zombie hordes to take down the queen of the undead. This mode is where you will complete most of the event challenges to earn Lanterns for the Voyage to Astonish event.In the store, and available for 27 days from October 24, are two legendary Halloween skins. You can get the Jeff the Land Shark Jeff O'Lantern skin and the Namor Phantom Tide skin. Each skin is available in an individual bundle with an MVP highlight, emote, nameplate, and spray, each costing 2,200 Units ($22, also earnable in-game). There is also a combo bundle, which gets you everything for 3,200 Units ($32).

The best deal is on Pokemon Labyrinth, which is up for grabs for only $17 (was $30). The Super Mario version of the fast-paced and highly replayable classic has also received a price cut to $24 (was $30).Check out both games below. We also rounded up deals on several other officially licensed board games themed around Pokemon and Super Mario. Pokemon has surprisingly few board games, but you can get Pokemon Monopoly and Pokemon TCG Battle Academy for great prices. Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom pals have starred in numerous classics as well as a bunch of original tabletop experiences that Amazon recently restocked.

Playing pieces are based on the original four starter Pokemon: Pikachu, Charmander, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle. Every round of Labyrinth is different due to the board's shifting design, and games only take around 20-30 minutes.A glow-in-the-dark version of Pokemon Labyrinth released last year, but it's selling for full price ($30).Pokemon fans can also save on the latest version of Pokemon Monopoly. Normally $25, Monopoly Pokemon Edition is only $19 at Amazon. The playing pieces are adorable miniature figures of Pikachu, Quaxly, Fuecoco, and Sprigatito. And if you want to learn how to play the Pokemon Trading Card Game, the Pokemon TCG Battle Academy board game is only $13.69 (was $25) at Amazon.

The Mushroom Kingdom sets up well for a game like Labyrinth, because the 34 maze cards use the familiar brick blocks from the video games.Each player picks one of the wooden pawn playing pieces and sets out to find many different characters from the Mushroom Kingdom, including Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, Bowser, Wario, Toad, and Toadette. Mario and his friends even invited Donkey Kong to play.Like the Pokemon-themed version, Super Mario Labyrinth is recommended for players ages 7 and up.Mario fans can also get the Super Mario Jenga for $16.66 (was $22) thanks to a coupon deal at Amazon.There are plenty of other Super Mario-themed board games, including The The Super Mario Bros. Movie Monopoly, a Super Mario Checkers & Tic-Tac-Toe combo pack, and a wide selection of original titles from Epoch Games such as the newly released Super Mario Mushroom Mania Balancing Game ($13) and Super Mario Cap Tower Balancing Game ($20).Check out this Super Mario board games Amazon store page for more options.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Marvel Rivals is celebrating Halloween in style, with tons of events, and the opportunity to grab yourself a free Blade skin. The Blade skin is an epic skin called Blade Knight, which sees the Daywalker dress up as Moon Knight for his Halloween costume.To get the Blade skin, you will need to earn it from the Voyage to Astonish event, which is an event rewards board directly tied to the other event, Marvel Zombies. The way the Voyage to Astonish works is you earn Lanterns by completing missions, primarily in Marvel Zombies. With a Lantern, you can roll your piece on the board, moving based on the number you roll. You will always land on a new reward, so it takes 21 total Lanterns to claim all rewards. While you can get Blade Knight for free, premium rewards are included in the premium event pass, which costs 690 Lattice ($7).Blade Knight is located towards the end of the board, requiring several Lanterns before you could potentially reach the skin.Both events run through November 14.Marvel Rivals Marvel Zombies EventMarvel Zombies is a limited-time PvE mode, where up to four players must complete a mission where they fight through hordes of zombies. The mission contains multiple waves, with two boss fights--one against Namor in the middle, and one against Scarlet Witch to finish the mission.There is a series of 10 missions for you to complete in Marvel Zombies, or in regular matches, under the Voyage to Astonish tab in missions. A new one unlocks every day until all of them are available, but you have to finish one before the next unlocks. Separately, there is a Marvel Zombies mission tab, which contains additional missions based on clearing each difficulty, which award Lanterns, along with minor cosmetics like sprays and titles.Leveling up in Marvel Zombies earns you skill points to power up your characters for your next run.There are five characters to choose from in Marvel Zombies:The PunisherMagikThorBladeJeff the Land SharkDue to the small hero pool, you are allowed to have duplicate heroes. Notably, while Jeff can have healing abilities in Marvel Zombies, his kit has been modified to primarily focus on dealing damage. Each character can have variants of their usual abilities, and there are skill trees to level up, letting you focus on your preferred play style. You can reset the skill trees at any time. In addition to skill points, you also unlock variants of your abilities at level 10*, level 15, and level 25.*The first ability is listed as unlocking at level 10, but it was unlocked at level 5 for us.You level up by running missions and earning XP from defeating zombies and completing objectives. All characters level simultaneously, so if you play a match as Jeff and earn four levels, all other characters will also earn four levels.Playing Marvel ZombiesProtecting Khonshu's Spirit is one of the objectives you will have to complete in Marvel Zombies.Marvel Zombies can be played on seven difficulties:NormalHardExtremeNightmare INightmare IINightmare IIINightmare IVYou will need to complete a run on the previous difficulty to unlock the next one. The flow of a mission is basically the same every run. You will work through small zones, dealing with the zombie hordes until you reach the next area. You earn points during combat, which can be used between rounds to purchase upgrades.These upgrades only last for the current mission, and are doled out like roguelike upgrades. You are presented with three cards to purchase, the option to reroll for a single point, and a mystery spin for 15 points. The mystery spins, which can also be earned by completing special objectives throughout a mission, can award you multiple cards simultaneously, duplicate some of your cards, and other powerful bonuses.Defeating squid turrets deals damage to Namor, but isn't as effective as headshots.While there are a couple of other objectives you'll see during each mission, the two biggest hurdles are the boss fights. For the Namor fight, he will temporarily be invincible at specific points, but you can always damage him by taking out one of the dozens of squid turrets he throws down.Defeating the Queen of the Dead will require you to deal a massive amount of damage before she can get her ultimate off.For Scarlet Witch, the only major hurdle during her boss fight is the final section. After you get her health low enough (each boss will have a ton of health bars, indicated by the \"X\" with a number next to it to the right of the bar). During Scarlet Witch's final phase, she will begin to perform her ultimate Reality Erasure.During this, there will be a small progress bar getting smaller beneath her health bar. You need to take her out before that finishes. While she is charging, small red crystals will occasionally appear that slightly extend your time if you take them out. Critical hits work on boss enemies and are essential to dealing enough damage to succeed.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

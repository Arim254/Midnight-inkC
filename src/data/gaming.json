    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                At The Game Awards, Disney and Lucasfilm announced a new Star Wars game, Star Wars: Galactic Racer. It is one of many upcoming Star Wars games in the works, but this one is all about speeding past Star Wars environments at several hundred kilometers per hour.Galactic Racer certainly seems to pay homage to Episode 1: Racer, but that game was all about podracers, while Galactic Racer's trailer focused more on more types of vehicles, like speeders and speederbikes. The brief trailer showed lots of new models of vehicles we haven't seen before, but with a distinct Star Wars style.The trailer also made use of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, showing a racetrack on Jakku in the shadow of the AT-AT graveyard, from Episode IX. It left off with a tease for Sebulba, the infamous racer who was rivals Anakin Skywalker in Episode 1. That's so wizard.          The solo campaign will focus on a new character named Shade, a racer seeking glory and revenge through the elite racing circuit. You'll upgrade your racer, compete with rivals, and race across a variety of planets.In an interview on the official Star Wars site, Fuse Games co-founder Matt Webster and vice president and general manager of Lucasfilm Games Douglas Reilly cited their team's previous experience on the Need for Speed and Burnout franchises. The pair also teased that Sebulba's appearance is a hint at a larger story about what happened to him after the events of Episode 1, though they were tight-lipped about details. The interview also shed more light on the variety of vehicles, like skim speeders that reward maintaining your momentum, versus speederbikes that have high acceleration and brake heavily into corners.The Game Awards also debuted another new Star Wars game, a return to The Old Republic era with Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic.

It's called Mega Man Dual Override, and it's retaining the side-scrolling action of the original games with updated visuals that pop off the screen.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Upcoming gacha-RPG game Arknights: Endfield will release on January 22, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile, as revealed in a music-video trailer at The Game Awards 2025. The Arknights spin-off features action-RPG gameplay in a semi-open world, mixed with elements of factory simulation like Satisfactory--and, of course, plenty of anime girls for its gacha system.The release date was dropped at the end of a trailer, which also doubled as a music video, revealing Endfield's title track Give Me Something for the very first time. The track is performed by American band OneRepublic, who also appeared in the trailer alongside Endfield's cast of launch characters.          Endfield is a spin-off from tower defense game Arknights, moving away from the franchise's origins with more traditional action-RPG mechanics. Setting it apart from the many other anime-style gacha RPGs that spawned from Genshin Impact's success, Endfield also includes elements of strategic management, with factory-simulation mechanics similar to Factorio or Satisfactory.The game has had a few open-beta periods since its first global test in January 2024, and its most recent open beta in November saw Endfield getting far closer to its full release state. Endfield already has a solid fanbase made up of fans of the original Arknight and those who have played the various playtests, and they don't have long to wait until the full game releases on January 22.The musical trailer for Arknights: Endfield was aired as a part of The Game Awards 2025.

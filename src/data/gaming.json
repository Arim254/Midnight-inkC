Now, the dev behind Scrappy has come forward to explain how he was put in the game and why he became such an important part of it.Johan, a 3D artist who has works on Arc Raiders, shared the origin story of Scrappy in a post on the game's official page.The real Scrappy is a rooster named Hakan who once crashed Johan's Zoom meeting while he was staying at his parents' house. Johan describes the rooster as, \"Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye. He had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.\"Scrappy the Rooster rocking a hat in Arc Raiders.Johan went on to explain that he photoscanned Haskan into the game \"as a silly little Easter egg.\" He didn't plan for Haskan to become a resource provider in the game, but it was suggested by one of his teammates.\"That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon,\" recalled Johan. \"Scrappy went from hidden Easter egg, to 'temporary mesh we’ll definitely replace later,' to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the Arc Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!\"Earlier this month, Arc Raiders hit 480,000 active players on Steam, which was nearly four times as many players as Black Ops 7 had during its launch weekend. A new patch for the game was released last week.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim five games starting December 2: Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White. If you haven't claimed November's PlayStation Plus free games yet, make sure to do so before next Tuesday, December 2. PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers can also get Skate Story as a day-one download through the Game Catalog, starting December 8.Lego Horizon Adventures is the headliner of this batch, as the Horizon spin-off game launched not too long ago. A lighthearted retelling of the events of Horizon Zero Dawn--but with a Lego spin--the game follows Aly on her quest to uncover the lost history of the world, following a cataclysm that saw machines rise to the top of the food chain.Killing Floor 3 is another recent release, and this multiplayer shooter sees teams of up to six players gear up to take down Zeds in stomach-churning combat.

Standing in your way are hostile creatures known as Enders, but you stand a fighting chance against them thanks to your mechanized Cradlecoffin.Finally, Neon White plays like a visual novel fused with lightning-fast FPS gameplay. A game about exterminating demons in heaven while you compete against fellow recently deceased assassins, Neon White is a speedrunner's dream with its emphasis on blasting through levels and setting the fastest time possible.Available December 2 - January 5, 2026PS Plus free games for December 2025Lego Horizon Adventures | PS5Killing Floor 3 | PS5The Outlast Trials | PS5, PS4Synduality Echo of Ada | PS5Neon White | PS5, PS4\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

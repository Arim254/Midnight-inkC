    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Near the end of October, Rockstar Games fired more than 30 employees across offices in the United Kingdom and Canada. At the time, Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said that the employees had been terminated over \"gross misconduct.\" But now People Make Games has reported that these employees' dismissal didn't have anything to do with spilling secrets from Grand Theft Auto 6 or any other Rockstar projects.According to People Make Games, the issue at hand arose over internal company messages that were shared on a Discord server used by staff members and representatives of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain. However, the messages shared were about changes to Rockstar's Slack policy, which eliminated channels where workers could chat about topics outside of the office.The report notes that Rockstar has such tight security that employees can't even check their email unless they're physically in the office. One of the employees apparently posted the Slack changes to the Discord server at a time when most of the other devs hadn't received any correspondence about it yet.People Make Games' source suggests that someone on the Discord server brought that message to the attention of Rockstar management. That allegedly sparked the internal investigation which led to the employees being dismissed from Rockstar.Subsequently, IWGB accused Rockstar of union busting and filed a legal claim on behalf of the staff members who lost their jobs. Over 200 Rockstar employees signed a letter demanding that fired workers be reinstated. For now, there doesn't appear to be any resolution in sight and the case may go to court in the United Kingdom to sort out the fate of Rockstar's ex-developers.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

You can find out for yourself just how good vinyl can sound in the modern era with this Black Friday deal on the Sony PS-LX310BT turntable, which is just $200 (normally $450) at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Sony store. This belt-driven turntable was introduced several years ago, and it blends classic audio technology with a few high-tech features, like Bluetooth connectivity. It's a great, user-friendly turntable choice, especially while it's nearly 60% off right now.                                 Sony PS-LX310BT Turntable                                                                $200 (was $450)                                                                                                                                                                                    Designed to be a plug-and-play turntable, the PS-LX310BT is a user-friendly option for anyone looking to purchase their first device in this category. It has a fully automatic design and setting up the drive belt can easily be done in a few minutes.While the body is mostly plastic, the Sony turntable does have an aluminum die-cast platter and pipe tonearm. The included RCA cables let you plug it directly into a stereo system, but for wireless listening, you can connect Bluetooth-enabled devices like speakers and headphones.Other features include two speeds--33 1/3 rpm and 45 rpm--a built-in switchable phono/line-out phono preamp, three gain settings, a vibration-dampening slip mat, and a removable dust cover.                                                       Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones                                                                $248 (was $400)                                                                                                                                                                                    Since you can connect a wireless headset to the turntable, we'd recommend grabbing one of Sony's popular noise-canceling headphones to go with this. Normally $400, the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are on sale for $248, and they come in four distinct colors. The big draw is the noise-canceling features, which use what Sony calls \"Auto NC Optimizer\" to automatically adjust the function based on your environment.The headphones also feature a lightweight design with soft leather, a battery life of up to 30 hours, and a selection of touch-control settings for media playback and communication.BlackMidnight BlueSilverSmoky Pink                      We've also included several Bluetooth speakers below from Bose, Sony, and JBL that are on sale for Black Friday. While a stereo system is preferred for turntables, you can still get a high-quality audio experience from these devices, and their wireless nature helps reduce cable management. The other benefit is that this also makes it easier to transport your turntable to a function or a party, and there is a wide variety of speakers to choose from. JBL has pocket-friendly devices like the JBL Go, while Sony's range includes multi-function speakers with a similar design aesthetic to the turntable.

The sci-fi horror adventure launched just a few weeks ago back in September, but thanks to Amazon's Black Friday sale, you can grab Cronos: The New Dawn for up to 30% off. The discount varies between platforms--the PS5 version is just $40 (was $60), while the Switch 2 edition is discounted to $45 (was $60). This is the biggest price cut we've seen for the physical edition, but it will only be available for a limited time.                                                                                                      Cronos: The New Dawn (PS5)                                                                $40 (was $60)                                                                                                                                                                                    Set in a futuristic rendition of Eastern Europe that has been radically altered due to a mysterious event, players step into the boots of the Traveler. Using time travel, the Traveler journeys back to 1980s Poland on behalf of a group known as The Collective to rescue key people before they die in the coming cataclysm. The Traveler has an arsenal of weapons to keep mutants at bay, but failing to dispose of their remains properly will result in surviving enemies fusing with the corpses to create a tougher and more dangerous creature.                                                                                                                            Cronos: The New Dawn (Switch 2)                                                                $45 (was $60)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Switch 2 version of Cronos: The New Dawn runs at a mostly stable 30fps. Some graphical concessions have been made, but the overall tone and atmosphere have been retained. This is a Game Key card version of the game, and it requires 25GB of storage space on the Switch 2.                         \"While it doesn't achieve the incredible heights of the Silent Hill 2 remake, Cronos earns its own name in the genre with an intense sci-fi horror story that will do well to satisfy anyone's horror fix, provided they can stomach its sometimes brutal enemy encounters,\" Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's review, scoring the game 8/10.If you're looking for more early Black Friday video game deals, check out the links below to see all the discounts for PS5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X games available now.

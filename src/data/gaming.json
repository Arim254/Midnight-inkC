    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The newest Nielsen ratings have arrived, showing a gigantic drop-off for Fallout Season 2 compared to Fallout Season 1. However, there is an obvious explanation for the dip.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Fallout viewership reached 794 million minutes on Prime Video for the week of December 15-21, which covers when Season 2 debuted on December 16. Season 1 racked up 2.9 billion minutes of streaming time during its own opening week in April 2024. That's a 72% decrease, but the massive downturn was no doubt attributable to how the two seasons were released.          Season 1, many may recall, was released in a binge format with all episodes arriving at the same time. Season 2, meanwhile, is adopting a weekly release schedule. What's more, just one episode of Fallout Season 2 was released on December 16, compared to two or three that Prime Video does for some of its other shows.Given all this, it only makes sense that Fallout Season 1 would have significantly higher viewership statistics compared to Season 2.According to the Nielsen data--which combines multiple seasons in its ranking reports-- 54% of Fallout streaming minutes on Prime Video for the December 15-21 week were from Season 2, making up about 429 million minutes. The rest came from viewership of Season 1.Fallout Season 2 just recently aired its fifth episode, with three more to come each Wednesday until Season 2 wraps on February 4. A third season will follow sometime later and could start filming sooner than expected.For more, check out GameSpot's breakdown of Fallout Season 2, Episode 5.Beyond the TV series, Bethesda is rumored to be at work on remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, along with the brand-new game Fallout 5.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The studio has indicated that there are multiple new maps on the horizon, as well as an upcoming content roadmap.\"There are going to be multiple maps coming this year,\" said Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins during an interview with GamesRadar. \"And I think it's going to be across a spectrum of size to try to facilitate different types of gameplay. So you might see some that are smaller, and you might see some that are even grander than what we've got now.\"Watkins didn't share specific details about what will be featured in the new maps, but he added that \"the ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot available there.\"As for the Arc Raiders content roadmap, Watkins suggested that it will be released \"sometime soon.\" In the meantime, he confirmed that Embark is working on new weapons, objectives, and enemies in addition to the maps.Embark has also shared details and stats about its recently concluded Cold Snap event in Arc Raiders. According to Embark's numbers, 91 million players were knocked out by snowballs, but just under 11,000 enemies were taken out the same way.To date, Arc Raiders has passed 12.4 million in sales, it has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Earlier this week, the latest Arc Raiders update nerfed some weapons and introduced new cosmetics.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                This Sunday's NFL playoffs divisional round matchup between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans will feature a World of Warcraft-themed attraction for tailgaters, and it's because Blizzard's data shows that its players love sports.The World of Warcraft: Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern, as it's called, is a marketing activation that's meant to promote WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. Inside the tavern, people can get a drink and watch World of Warcraft livestreams. They can also meet cosplayers and influencers; the Orc cosplayers will be inside the stadium for the game itself.The Midnight expansion adds player housing, which is something fans have been requesting for years. Blizzard is also partnering with real estate company Zillow on this branded partnership, according to Sports Business Journal.People can find the Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern outside Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mass. Blizzard Entertainment CMO Monica Austin said the team has been building the tavern at Blizzard's headquarters in Anaheim, California for months, and only just recently decided to host the event in Foxboro as opposed to Denver, where another Divisional round game will take place.But why have this kind of marketing campaign in the first place? Austin said  Blizzard's research has shown that lapsed and active WoW players also enjoy watching sports.\"We've done a tremendous amount of deep dives to understand who are our players, lapsed and active. One of the things we see consistently is that our players are over-indexed in watching sports. And for the NFL, it's top-three over-indexing sport,\" Austin said. \"We know our players are there. We know they're watching. This is a strategic way that we want to use to reach them.\"Midnight launches on March 2, and will revamp the game's nearly two-decade-old Blood Elf zones as well as introduce new areas, dungeons, and raids.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Marvel Rivals is rapidly approaching its one year anniversary in early December, but the in-game event has already kicked off. The Anniversary event is putting up tons of free and paid rewards for you to grab, including a free Legendary Jeff the Land Shark skin. There are also tons of free Units up for grabs, with a catch.How to get the Jeff the Land Shark Business Shark skinThe free Business Shark skin for Jeff comes in a limited-time reward event called Jeff's Break Time. As you earn match XP, you'll get coins to redeem items inside a virtual vending machine. There are free coins and paid coins, each unlocking items from different parts of the vending machine. Jeff's skin is in the free section, as are a new element to Rivals skins: customizable parts. Earning match XP will earn you coins, which can redeem items in the vending machine.Jeff's Break Time is a 20-day event, but like all event passes, if you purchase the premium version it becomes permanently available to you, allowing you to earn the rewards at your own pace. The premium version costs 990 Lattice ($10), and includes the Dad-tastic Reed Mister Fantastic and Disappearing Dessert Invisible Woman skins, as well.Free Units, with a catchUnits, the free in-game currency that can be used to buy skins in the store, are also being given away for the anniversary event... sort of. During the event, there are seven days' worth of log-in rewards, for a total of 1,500 Units. These Units are \"Time-Limited\" and expire at the end of the event, around December 18. If you don't use them before that point, they will expire and be removed from your account.You can earn 1,500 temporary units, which expire at the end of the event.This is the first time Marvel Rivals has introduced a time-limited version of one of its main currencies. It's an odd choice, but between the Van Dyne shop opening on December 3 with the Darling Daifuku Psylocke skin and more anniversary shop skins coming, you probably won't have a hard time spending those Units. The Black Friday sale in the Marvel Rivals shops also runs through December 3, offering discounts on older skins. While you can't get all the log-in rewards by then, you could spend some of those temporary Units on the sale.There's an additional 600 normal Units up for grabs via the Rivals Assemble part of the event, where you can add friends to your team with a special code, allowing both of you to complete missions and earn points for the other person. These rewards are only unlockable if you use the code to add friends. There are also some Units and an exclusive title that can be grabbed by participating in the December 6 Midnight countdown event. You can use the in-game countdown to determine when exactly that is occurring in your timezone. Marvel Rivals' anniversary event is running for the next three weeks, with more cosmetics being added over time. Marvel Rivals Season 5 recently kicked off, adding Gambit to the roster.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

If you've been looking to get one for yourself, these are on sale for Black Friday, and currently, you can grab the eye-catching Blueberry Burst Pro and Black Tribal models at a low price. Switch owners can also rock out with a Linkin Park-themed take on the CRKD Neo S, a five-button fret attachment for Fortnite's Guitar Hero-inspired game mode that comes equipped with pro-style features. Amazon is selling both the Xbox and multi-platform versions of CRKD's guitar controllers, which might sound confusing. The multiplatform guitars are compatible specifically with PC, Nintendo Switch, and Switch 2, and Android in both wired and wireless modes, while the Xbox-licensed version of this guitar controller supports Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Android. To make things easier, we've outlined all the discounted CRKD controllers below and have listed which platforms they support.

The strum bar uses a Hall Effect sensor, the frets have rubber membranes, and you'll find traditional inputs like integrated analog sticks, a D-pad on the headstock, and an eight-button navigation hub. This controller also has a modular design, allowing you to swap out the neck for one with mechanical frets installed or up to five additional solo frets.Black Tribal (multiplatform) -- $97.49 ($115)Black Tribal (Xbox) -- $115 ($125)                                                                                                                            CRKD Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controller - Pro Edition                                                                $106.19 (was $125)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Pro model of the Gibson Les Paul guitar costs a bit more, but it offers much more than the standard model. You'll get all of the core features listed above, as well as a Hall Effect strum bar with built-in haptic feedback. customizable sensitivity, and multiple actuation points. The fret buttons on the Pro models also utilize mechanical switches to provide faster movements and input recognition, and there's RGB lighting on the neck. The emphasis on mechanical buttons is to provide better controller feedback, greater precision when playing, and a longer shelf-life for regular rhythm game fans.Blueberry Burst Pro (multiplatform) -- $106.19 ($125)Blueberry Burst Pro (Xbox) -- $125 ($135)                         CRKD Neo S Wireless Controller - Linkin Park Edition$45 (was $60)CRKD Neo S Controller: Linkin Park EditionThe Linkin Park-themed Neo S Wireless Controller from CRKD is a solid option for anyone looking for a compact way to play rhythm games.

During the event, there are tons of skins that are going to be available for purchase, along with a couple of free skins, like one for Jeff the Land Shark. There are a handful of skins available at the start of the event, with more teased for the coming weeks.Available right now, you can grab Gummy Surprise Venom and Restful Recovery Blade from the shop. The Venom bundle is 2,200 Units and the Blade bundle is 1,600 Units, or you can get them together in a mega bundle for 2,800 Units. Each bundle includes the skin, MVP highlight, emote, spray, and nameplate. Both skins are temporary additions to the shop, leaving shortly after the event ends in late December.As part of the Jeff's Break Time event pass, you can get the legendary Business Shark skin for Jeff for free by completing matches. This skin has customizable parts, like ties, glasses, and even his suit design. If you get the premium version of the pass, it also includes the Dad-tastic Reed Mister Fantastic skin and Disappearing Dessert Invisible Woman skin. There's also a new look for Galacta, which can be seen in the battle pass menu. Jeff's Break Time ends at the same time as the anniversary event, although purchasing the premium version will allow you to unlock rewards past the event's scheduled end.While there are certainly a few surprises coming, we do know that there are two more Legendary skins coming. On December 5, Van Dyne's shop opens, containing the legendary Daring Daifuku Psylocke skin. On the same day, a legendary Luna Snow skin will also be released, although it's unclear if that will be in the typical shop or tied to a specific event. Below you can see every skin released for Marvel Rivals anniversary event so far.Business Shark - Jeff the Land SharkDad-tastic Reed - Mister FantasticDisappearing Desserts - Invisible WomanGummy Surprise - VenomRestful Recovery - Blade    \n  \n                      "

Microsoft has announced that a handful of games--headlined by Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler 2--will leave the subscription service on November 30.Octopather Traveler originally launched as a Switch exclusive in 2018 before arriving on PC and other consoles over the years. The HD-2D RPG takes inspiration from Square Enix's 1990s games, like Final Fantasy VI. It's also spawned its own series, as Octopather Traveler 2 will also leave Game Pass. They might be making way for Octopath Traveler 0, since the turn-based RPG comes out December 4. However, it's not coming to Game Pass (at least currently) but will be available to purchase on Xbox Series X|S.Another heavy hitter heading out is Lords of the Fallen. The souls-like game released in 2023, selling 1 million copies within the first 10 days. There is also a sequel on the way in 2026. At Gamescom, it was revealed that Lords of the Fallen 2 will take place 100 years after Lords of the Fallen.The other two titles leaving Game Pass are Barbie Project Friendship and SteamWorld Build. Don't forget that subscribers can purchase these games for 20% off before they're removed from the Game Pass library. For more, GameSpot has compiled the best Game Pass titles in 2025 and upcoming additions to look forward to.Barbie Friendship ProjectBarbie Friendship Project is leaving Xbox Game Pass for console, cloud, and PC on November 30.Lords of the FallenLords of the Fallen is leaving Xbox Game Pass for console, cloud, and PC on November 30.Octopath TravelerOctopath Traveler is leaving Xbox Game Pass for console, cloud, and PC on November 30.Octopath Traveler 2Octopath Traveler 2 is leaving Xbox Game Pass for console, cloud, and PC on November 30.SteamWorld BuildSteamWorld Build is leaving Xbox Game Pass for console, cloud, and PC on November 30.    \n  \n                      "

These games will be releases between November 19 and December 1, and while there aren't as many day-one releases, there are still some interesting titles to look forward to.The second wave starts with Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault in Game Preview. Like the first game, you'll be exploring dungeons and selling your loot in town as you look to establish a career as both a fearless adventurer and a business-savvy trader. Revenge of the Savage Planet will be added to Game Pass Premium on the same day, and this is a colorful poke at corporate greed and stupidity.Later in the month, you can take part in a car festival via The Crew Motorfest, overreact to spiders in Kill It With Fire 2, and bust some phantoms in Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden. On December 1, it's time to assemble Earth's mightiest mortals to turn back the deadly Annihilation Wave in Marvel Cosmic Invasion, another day-one release.Fortnite Crew is also available starting today for all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and this will unlock the current Battle Pass, OG Pass, Lego Pass, and Music Pass in Fortnite. You'll also get 1,000 V-Bucks every month, the premium currency that can be spent on gear like the new Simpsons Fortnite cosmetics or the upcoming Tyler the Creator skin.As for Game Pass removals, five games will be leaving the service soon, including two beloved HD-2D JRPGs. Microsoft also announced a big price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate recently, increasing the monthly cost from $20 to $30. Most major retailers have not adopted the price hike yet.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Despite its massive popularity among young gamers, Roblox has come under increased scrutiny for allegedly not doing enough to protect children from potential predators on the platform. Now, Roblox is preparing to introduce a number of changes that are designed to keep children from speaking to adults they don't know.As reported by The Guardian, Roblox will begin enforcing restrictions with facial age estimation that will only allow children to speak with strangers if they're in the same age range. The new age groups are under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 and over. As a given example, children who are estimated to be 12 won't be allowed to speak with anyone over 15.These changes are coming to Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands in December, with the rest of the world following suit in January 2026.\"We see it as a way for our users to have more trust in who the other people they are talking with are in these games,\" said Roblox's chief safety officer Matt Kaufman in a statement. \"And so we see it as a real opportunity to build confidence in the platform and build confidence amongst our users.\"The Guardian's report includes word about multiple lawsuits filed against Roblox in the US from families who accuse the company of turning a blind eye to the predators that sexually exploited their children on the platform.In 2024, Roblox was banned in Turkey over similar concerns. Roblox began requesting video selfies to determine users' ages last summer. Those measures didn't stop California, Louisiana, and Florida lawmakers from either calling out the company or opening investigations into its conduct.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on January 8, 2026 at 9:36AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                South Park is coming to Fortnite on Friday, but this is not the sort of Fortnite collab that only adds skins to the item shop--though we're certainly getting a pile of skins. No, South Park is also taking over Fortnite's Battle Royale mode by introducing several major new gameplay overhauls (and we mean major) and taking over one of the major named locations on the map. Also, there's a completely free event pass that'll allow players to earn free South Park cosmetics by completing quests--yes, you'll actually have to play the game to earn these things.And, of course, there will be five skins in the item shop, all of which are the boys from South Park in mech suits--there's Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, and Butters. More importantly, there will also be a Towelie sidekick in the shop for all the sweaty gamers out there.New quad size: QuintsThe single biggest change being introduced with this crossover event is the addition of Quints, a five-player variety of the main Battle Royale mode, playable in both Build and Zero Build. It's the first time Epic has added a new squad size to BR since it added Trios about five years ago, so this is kind of a big deal. We don't know for sure if Quints will stick around beyond this event, though. Epic previously added a six-player version of Blitz Royale earlier this year, but removed it after a few weeks. Kenny TokenThe Kenny token, which you can find as random loot, is an entirely new gameplay concept for Battle Royale. If you have one of these tokens when you die, you'll automatically reboot. That'll be quite a game-changer, depending on how common these end up being.Cheesy PoofsWhile this may seem like just another consumable healing item, Cheesy Poofs are also a weapon--throwing a box at an enemy will damage them. The days of feeling like an idiot because you accidentally threw a shield pot at the other guy when you tried to switch to a different gun are finally over. At least temporarily.The Stick of TruthOnly one Stick of Truth will appear each round, and the person who claims it will become the round's final boss. But not because it turns you into a kaiju or gives you sick abilities--having the Stick of Truth in your inventory will make the storm circle center on you for the remainder of the match. Wonkeeland is now CartmanlandThe Wonkeeland POI in the northwest part of the island has received a South Park-themed makeover and is now Cartmanland, based on the theme park Cartman took over on the show. It's still more or less the same place, just with Cartman's face all over it.Born in Chaos event passFor the first time in almost two years, Fortnite is doing a new event mini-pass. This one is completely free to everyone, and includes 13 tiers of items that you can unlock by completing quests in Battle Royale--meaning this is not the sort of pass that you can passively get through by gaining XP. We don't know what all the pass will include, but among them are Terrance and Phillip dolls as a pickaxe, and a CRED backpack.Final pass reward: Imaginationland GliderThe very last reward on the pass, which requires completing every available South Park pass quest, is the Imaginationland Airship glider, which comes from an epic three-episode story in Season 10 that was originally planned to be a theatrical movie.     \n  \n                      "

For a limited time, players can earn Fallout operator skins and other themed rewards by unlocking them in free and paid event passes. Here's a look at all Fallout rewards in Call of Duty and how you unlock them during the event.Call of Duty's Fallout event runs from now until January 29. This adds operator skins and cosmetics themed around Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show. While there are plenty of free rewards to earn, you'll need to purchase the paid \"premium\" pass for 1,100 CoD Points ($10) if you want to unlock all items for the event.There are 20 rewards in total for the Fallout event. There are 10 rewards in the free pass, and 10 more optional rewards can be unlocked with the paid pass. The highlights of the free pass include two vault dweller operator skins and the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun. The paid pass is required to unlock Maximus and The Ghoul characters from the show.It's also worth noting that the character, Lucy MacLean, will arrive as a shop bundle at a later date. Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.All Fallout event rewards can be seen below. This is an XP-based event, so you'll simply need to grind XP across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. For multiplayer, objective modes like Kill Confirmed and Domination work best, while Plunder and Casual battle royale modes will yield more XP for Warzone. This is also a good time to use double XP tokens if you have them.It's worth noting that this crossover features Fallout-themed game modes and events across multiplayer, Zombies, Endgame, and Warzone. Make sure to check out all the details about Season 1 Reloaded's new content, and the full patch notes can be found here.Dweller - Operator skinThis is an operator skin for David Mason, putting him in Fallout's iconic blue vault suit. This is a free instant reward you'll get automatically at the start of the event.Power Armor Maximus - Maximus operator unlockThis is the Power Armor skin for Maximus with his helmet on.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Nintendo launched its My Mario product lineup in Japan last year, and it's officially coming stateside in 2026. Items will be sold at the Nintendo New York and San Francisco stores starting February 19, with a focus on kid-friendly games and building sets. You'll also find a new app, Hello, Mario!, on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, Google Play Store, and App Store.While February 19 marks the first release of My Mario gear in the United States, Nintendo plans to keep rolling out new content for the foreseeable future. Products will span everything from games and apparel to apps, and it'll include partnerships with big names like Fisher-Price and TOMY.My Mario ProductsGallery                                                                                                                   The first wave of products includes two wooden block sets, a collection of infant and toddler apparel, an interactive board book, and a variety of plushies. Many of these items can already be viewed on the official My Mario website, including an adorable roster of children's clothing--such as Princess Peach coveralls, a stylish Mario & Luigi cardigan, and Fleece overalls adorned with a Question Block and mushroom.Beyond physical products, fans will also find the Hello, Mario! app and a stop-motion animated series (which is actually available right now). The latter consists of five episodes, with each episode running about a minute, while the former lets you make silly faces or play peekaboo with Mario.At this time, it's unclear if any of these products will be sold online through the Nintendo Store. They'll first arrive at the brick-and-mortar shops in New York and San Francisco, though select retailers will receive inventory later this year. The exact launch timing for products might vary--Nintendo says it'll reveal more details on its official website in the coming weeks and months. We're expecting to see some cool Yoshi products, as several were just released in Japan last November.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this week, Activision debuted a new trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 that sent Peter Stormare's The Replacer to outer space, where he promptly doomed influencer/boxer Jake Paul out of negligence by launching him into the void. Now, Activision is keeping the joke alive by giving Paul his own star.On the official Call of Duty social media accounts, Activision designated star JP-7 for Paul. However, the image used implies a Jake Paul constellation.The original ad is a parody of the Blue Origin celebrity space misadventure, which led to wide-spread mockery for Katy Perry, Gayle King, and Jeff Bezos' wife, Lauren Sanchez, after their low-orbit flight. Call of Duty's \"celebrity\" crew included Paul and Love Island's Huda Mustafa. It also introduced Terry Crews and Nikki Glaser as the new Replacers.          Ahead of the game's release next month, Treyarch's latest Dev Talk video debuted seven new multiplayer maps, three Zombies maps, new weapons, seasonal events, and more for Season 1 of Black Ops 7.Former Call of Duty boss Glen Schofield recently shared his concerns about the future of the franchise, and he contends that the games have gotten worse since his departure. Meanwhile, Activision has claimed that the most recent Black Ops 7 beta was almost completely free of cheaters.Black Ops 7 will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on November 14. It will also be available at launch on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arguably the Microsoft crown jewel franchise, Halo, is coming to PlayStation for the first time. It's true that the sci-fi series has seen better days and may no longer be Microsoft's top-performing franchise, but Halo is basically synonymous with Xbox, and now it's making the jump to PlayStation in a development that would have shocked anyone reading this years ago.Halo will come to PS5 via Halo: Campaign Evolved, the just-announced remake of the 2001 original. It's slated for release in 2026 on PS5, as well as Xbox and PC, featuring brand-new prequel missions, split-screen co-op, new weapons, visual and audio updates, and more. You can read more about Halo: Campaign Evolved in GameSpot's news post.          Halo is not the first Microsoft series to make the jump to a rival platform, as Gears of War--another iconic Xbox franchise--landed on PlayStation via Gears of War: Reloaded in August. Forza Horizon 5 also came to PlayStation this year, while Microsoft Flight Simulator 24 is headed to PS5 this December.Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a new business strategy to launch its own franchises on competitor consoles as opposed to keeping them locked to Xbox as was the tradition for years. The move, it seems, is part Microsoft's reported mandate that Xbox needs to improve profits.Microsoft's releases for PlayStation consoles have been successful thus far, with Xbox games regularly populating the PlayStation sales charts. Xbox president Sarah Bond recently made headlines when she said the idea of exclusive games in 2025 is \"antiquated\" because these days, she said, people expect big games to be available on all devices.Microsoft may be backing away from full exclusivity for its own games, but the company still does give Xbox users preferential treatment for launch timing in some situations. For example, Forza Horizon 6 will launch as a timed-exclusive for Xbox consoles in 2026 before landing on PlayStation sometime later. The announcement of Halo for PS5 is no big surprise, as it's been one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming and had been the subject of leaks and reports for many months.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Warner Bros. has launched a \"For Your Consideration\" website for Minecraft, listing off all the categories that the film studio believes Minecraft should be considered for.This includes numerous categories, including Best Picture, Best Director for Jared Hess, and Best Actor for Jack Black. WB also put forward Jason Momoa and Sebastian Hansen for Best Supporting Actor and Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, and Jennifer Coolidge for Best Supporting Actress.WB also is campaigning voters to pick Minecraft for things like Best Casting, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Production Designer, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Original Score, Best Original Songs, and Best Adapted Screenplay.Beyond Minecraft, WB is urging voters to consider films like Weapons, Superman, Sinners, and Mickey 17 for the next Academy Awards, which take place in March 2025. The nominees will be announced in January 2026.Film studios like WB are known to spend money on Academy Award campaigns under the For Your Consideration heading. A Minecraft Movie may not immediately come to mind as an Oscar contender, but WB may think otherwise. Spending money on For Your Consideration ads also helps A Minecraft Movie find repeat viewers or a new audience now that it's available on streaming and home video.A Minecraft Movie more than $950 million worldwide. It's the No. 2 highest-grossing video game movie of all time, and the No. 69 highest-grossing movie of all time for all films ever released.A sequel is now in the works for 2027, with director Jared Hess coming back. The sequel could focus on the character Alex, who was teased at the end of the film. Alex would be joined by Jack Black's character, Steve, in a potential sequel, Hess said.For more, check out GameSpot's A Minecraft Movie review.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

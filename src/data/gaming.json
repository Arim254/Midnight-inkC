    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In side-by-side comparisons, PlayStation 5 games have tended to have an edge over their Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S counterparts. The Outer Worlds 2, however, flips that script by having a better performance on Xbox than either PS5 or PS5 Pro, according to Digital Foundry.          0n the surface, The Outer Worlds 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X look very similar, but a closer examination reveals that the former suffers from image breakup, lower resolution, frame rate drops, and screen tearing even in performance mode. Digital Foundry also noted small lighting downgrades in PS5.As for the PS5 Pro, the report states that it uses Sony's proprietary upscaler, PSSR, which doesn't interact well with The Outer Worlds 2's lumen lighting or RT lighting effects. The report concludes that PS5 Pro's \"frame rate dips and more intense encounters are common, and the general run of play is noticeably worse than Series X in the finished game.\" It goes on to speculate that The Outer Worlds 2 may have utilized some proprietary hardware features in Xbox Series X|S that neither the PS5 nor PS5 Pro have.Obsidian Entertainment recently introduced players to Outer Worlds 2's six companion characters who can't be romanced, before revealing that they can turn on the player if given a compelling reason to do so. The studio also unveiled a Moon Man plushie called a \"Couch-Panion,\" which is the prize for winning a contest running through November 16. Players don't have to rely on a contest to get a pair of limited-edition, customizable Outer Worlds 2 Xbox Wireless Controllers, though. However, both controllers are more expensive than the game's $70 price.GameSpot's review gave The Outer Worlds 2 an 8/10 score and said that it \"feels like the series [is] coming into its own, carried by flexible combat options and great role-playing progression.\"Per the game's launch times, early-access players will get to play The Outer Worlds 2 on October 24. Everyone else will have to wait until October 29 to play it on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. This title will also be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                During today's DreadXP livestream, a spooky new look at the Paranormal Activity video game was revealed. The gameplay teaser for Paranormal Activity: Threshold showed off a taste of what players can expect, as they find themselves stuck inside a haunted house full of hostile entities and puzzles.The trailer teased an approach similar to the film franchise, as it was full of found-footage shots and a foreboding sense of dread that the film franchise is known for.          DarkStone Digital--the team behind 2022's The Mortuary Assistant--is working on the game, and it'll feature a Haunt System designed to dynamically alter the types and intensity of scares that players will encounter during their sessions.Publisher DreadXP stated that game director Brian Clarke aims to replicate his signature approach to fear and immersion in the Paranormal Activity game, while also expanding on the franchise's infamous found-footage style horror in \"new and nightmarish\" ways.While it doesn't have a release date yet, DreadXP says it will reveal more about Paranormal Activity: Threshold's platforms and launch timing in the months to come. Fans of the film franchise looking for some effective shock treatment can grab a new Blu-ray set of the original movies.The $50 Blu-ray box set includes all eight movies, starting from the original low-budget thriller up through Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The booklets are also included with the standard Blu-ray editions, but you won't find them in the standalone DVD releases. As mentioned, though, a bunch of Studio Ghibli movies on DVD are very cheap at the moment. Check out the list of DVDs below before reading about the Steelbook Editions.

Studio Ghibli Steelbook Editions of movies written and directed by Hayao MiyazakiThose eight Miyazaki-directed movies and most of the other Steelbook Editions in Shout Factory's Ghibli catalog follow the same design aesthetic: a vibrant, solid background color with character art in the middle (as shown above). The Boy and the Heron and Grave of the Fireflies are the exceptions to this rule. The Boy and the Heron, the first and only Studio Ghibli movie on 4K Blu-ray, depicts a full scene on its steelbook cover. The Boy and the Heron's 4K Steelbook Edition is discounted to $28 (was $45). Shout Factory took the same approach with Grave of the Fireflies when the 1989 film returned to Blu-ray this summer after being out of print for years. Grave of the Fireflies Steelbook Edition is discounted to an all-time low price of $17.89 (was $27).The cheapest Studio Ghibli Steelbook Edition at the moment is Earwig and the Witch for $10. If you haven't watched it, just know the 2020 film ditches Studio Ghibli's distinct visual style in favor of rather generic 3D animation. It's widely considered the worst Ghibli movie. We also included The Castle of Cagliostro's upcoming Steelbook Edition on the list above. While it's not a Ghibli movie--it released before Studio Ghibli existed--the 1979 animated film was Hayao Miyazaki's directorial debut. The Castle of Cagliostro Steelbook Edition is exclusive to Crunchyroll and releases December 14.Studio Ghibli Blu-ray Box Sets (Walmart Exclusive)Studio Ghibli Movie Box Sets at WalmartStudio Ghibli 4-Film Set (Blu-ray + DVD) -- $36.96  Castle in the Sky / Kiki's Delivery Service / Ponyo / My Neighbor TotoroStudio Ghibli 2-Film Sets (Blu-ray + DVD)  My Neighbor Totoro / Ponyo -- $19.96 ($25)Princess Mononoke / Nausicaa -- $19.96 ($25)Spirited Away / Howl's Moving Castle -- $22.96 ($25)Walmart has exclusive Studio Ghibli Blu-ray box sets featuring movies written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.

Below, you'll find Studio Ghibli's complete filmography in standard edition Blu-ray and DVD combo packs. You'll also find two 4K movies on the list below: The Boy and the Heron's standard 4K Blu-ray and Lupin the 3rd: The Castle of Cagliostro.

Exclusive to AmazonSome of the newer standard editions come with cardboard sleeves, and most are made by Shout Factory, but there are still some Blu-rays lingering around from the days when Disney distributed Studio Ghibli movies on Blu-ray and DVD.Hayao Miyazaki's Manga &  Studio Ghibli Film ComicsNausicaa of the Valley of the Wind by Hayao MiyazakiMiyazaki fans should also check out the Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind Manga Box Set. It's the only manga series authored by Miyazaki. Naturally, the seven-volume series has plenty of material that didn't make it into the film adaptation. The box set collects the entire run into two hardcover books totaling 1,104 pages. This beautiful collection had been unavailable to purchase for awhile, but Amazon is taking orders it again as of August 7. You can also get Shuna's Journey, a manga written and illustrated in watercolor by Miyazaki, for over 50% off. First published in 1983, the moving tale finally received an English translation in 2022.                                                                                                                                               A handful of Studio Ghibli hits have been adapted into comics over the years. Up until last year, many individual volumes of the Film Comics were difficult because they were out of print. Viz Media's new All-in-One Editions have brought the Film Comics back to life as budget-friendly hardcover books. Film Comic adaptations of Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Ponyo are available now. Each book is comprised of still images from the movies alongside text that tells the full story in a different medium.Spirited Away's omnibus is the largest of the bunch at 856 pages, so it costs five bucks more than the other three available now--but it's on sale for only $29.17 at Amazon. The All-in-One Edition of Ponyo's Film Comic was published in July and is already on sale for only $21.76. You can also preorder Princess Mononoke Film Comic: All-in-One Edition for $32.55 (was $35) ahead of its January 2026 release. Like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke's Film Comic omnibus is 856 pages.

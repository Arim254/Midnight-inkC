    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Yet another video game is getting a movie deal, as a report today states that Netflix has bought a movie idea for a film based on the upcoming game Kingmakers. For anyone unaware, Kingmakers is an action-strategy game set in medieval times that allows players to use AK-47s, grenade launchers, and attack helicopters in battle.The game is developed by Redemption Road Games and published by tinyBuild. It was due to launch in October this year before being delayed indefinitely due to its \"incredibly ambitious\" setup. Kingmakers is among the top five most-wishlisted games on Steam. So far, it's only been announced for PC.          Deadline reported that Netflix bought a movie pitch for the game, with writer Christopher MacBride (Flashback, The Conspiracy) attached to write the script. The report added that Stranger Things director Shawn Levy's production company, 21 Laps, is producing the Kingsmakers movie, while Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg, and Timothy L. Stevenson are also producing. Story Kitchen is also behind the Sonic movie series, along with the upcoming Tomb Raider and Life is Strange TV shows, among other gaming projects.Netflix recently announced a deal to buy many of the Warner Bros. Discovery entertainment assets for more than $80 billion. It's not necessarily a done deal yet, though, as Paramount has launched a hostile bid for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery at a higher price.There are dozens of video game movies in the works currently, but a film being in development does not mean it will get made. You can see the 50+ video game movies in development now in the gallery below.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                You would think stabbing a foe with a sword was enough. But a new update for Assassin's Creed Shadows will let you twist the weapon, elbow the enemy in the face, and then stab them again in the head. It's pretty gnarly, and it's part of title update 1.1.7, which is planned to start arriving December 16.On the Ubisoft website, the patch notes highlight the bloody new finishers, saying they \"bring more flair to your encounters.\" The official Assassin's Creed account on YouTube shared a video--seen below--showcasing the gruesome maneuvers for Naoe and Yasuke.          The new update also brings quite a few improvements to the recently released Switch 2 edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows. Ubisoft says that frame rate issues have been addressed, along with \"various visual issues.\" However, this title update will come a day later, December 17, on Switch 2.Earlier this month, Ubisoft confirmed that Assassin's Creed Shadows won't get a second DLC expansion. The Claws of Awaji expansion came out for the stealth-action game in September. In November, the Assassin's Creed franchise overall exceeded Ubisoft's expectations for the company's last financial quarter.Looking ahead, Assassin's Creed Shadows could pave the way for more games in the franchise to feature multiple protagonists. A decade ago, Assassin's Creed Syndicate debuted dual protagonists for the series with twins Jacob and Evie.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Epic Games loves collaborating with anime series for Fortnite, and it's no mystery why to anybody who's been constantly battling Gokus, Narutos, Gojos and All Mights in Battle Royale for years. Anime skins are clearly popular, so it makes sense that more are coming. Next up is Bleach, the beloved show that began in the 2004, and which is currently running a revival series to finish telling the manga's story, called Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War.This first collaboration with Bleach will, according to posters that have been spotted in the wild, include four skins: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Uryu Ishida. And presumably at least one gigantic sword.We have no further details about the collab, which has only been teased by Epic rather than fully revealed. But since this collab will be released during the holidays and Fortnite's Winterfest event, there's a decent chance there will be some kind of Bleach component added to Battle Royale, Blitz Royale, or Reload, since Fortnite has included tons of mythic weapons and powers based on anime series in the past--particularly at the end of the year.With Winterfest, which begins Thursday, annually offering two or more free skins to all players, it's possible one of the Bleach skins will be free. There haven't been any real rumors about what the free Winterfest skins will be, but with collabs with Harry Potter, Home Alone, and South Park also expected soon, plus leaks about new winter-themed versions of Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter, there are too many possibilities to make an educated guess.Bleach will be Fortnite's fourth new anime collab for 2025, after Kaiju No. 9 in January, Cowboy Bebop in February, and One-Punch Man in August. We also got a wave of Jujutsu Kaisen villains in February.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

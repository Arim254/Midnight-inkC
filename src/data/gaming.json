The story also notes that Lin used his inexperience as a gamer as a way to pitch Sony on a take that will \"find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology.\"Lin has been credited with reviving the Fast & Furious films with The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. While that movie was a success, he led the franchise to even bigger hits with Fast & Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6, and F9: The Fast Saga. Lin's lone sci-fi film was 2016's Star Trek Beyond. Lin is also signed to adapt the One-Punch Man manga and anime as a movie.The first Helldivers game debuted in 2015, but its sequel, Helldivers 2, has proven to be even more successful across consoles and PC. The game casts players Helldivers, an elite group of soldiers who strive to protect Super Earth from enemy factions including Bugs, Cyborgs, and Illuminate. It's proven to be a hit on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.Sony's PlayStation Productions banner has had success on the big screen with Uncharted, the film adaptation of Naughty Dog's action-adventure series. The company is also producing The Legend of Zelda movie in conjunction with Nintendo. On television, Sony's The Last of Us and Twisted Metal have both been renewed by HBO and Peacock, respectively.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Now that adventure has taken Grivel back to Ubisoft as he reclaims his old job as the director of the Splinter Cell Remake.Grivel announced his return to the Splinter Cell Remake team on LinkedIn (via GamesRadar).\"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!\" wrote Grivel. \"A very special team and project to me.\"There hasn't been much word about the status of the Splinter Cell remake since Grivel's departure. In 2022, Ubisoft was hiring for a game writer who could update \"the story for a modern-day audience\" and \"keep the spirit and themes of the original game while exploring our characters and the world to make them more authentic and believable.\"Since that time, a Splinter Cell audio series debuted on BBC Radio, while the animated series Splinter Cell: Deathwatch premiered on Netflix. The latter was subsequently renewed for Season 2 by Netflix.Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow made its Steam debut in October of this year, and it was subsequently included as part of a sale package of Splinter Cell's classic games on that platform.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

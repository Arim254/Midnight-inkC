The Cold Snap update brings multiple seasonal events, a new Snowfall map condition, and plenty more for fans to sink their teeth into. Among the fresh additions is the Goalie Raider Deck--the game's second battle pass--which contains a smorgasbord of cosmetics, gear, items, and even Raider Tokens that can be used toward premium purchases in the shop.The Goalie Deck is free for all players, so you won't need to purchase access to these rewards with premium currency. Instead, you'll simply need to work toward completing daily Feats that provide you with Creds, then use those to unlock your preferred items from the deck. This should prove fairly easy to do for most players, as you can complete up to three Feats per match, and you'll even get additional bonus Creds for the first five Feats you finish in a day.Perhaps the best news about the Goalie Deck, however, is that it's a permanent reward track. Unlike battle passes in other games, this deck will stick around forever, meaning you can unlock what you want from it whenever you'd like. With this in mind, you can skip any rewards that just don't matter much to you right now--though it's worth pointing out you will still need to purchase a certain number of items from the deck to unlock subsequent pages.If you're excited to dive into the Goalie Deck and start reaping its rewards--including the new hockey-themed outfit, which is pretty rad--we've got you covered ahead of time. Keep scrolling below for every reward from the Goalie Deck in Arc Raiders.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Everybody needs a friend, and that's especially the case in Satisfactory, where it's just you against all of nature and capitalism. Thankfully, the Lizard Doggo is there to keep you company. And even if you prefer your alone time, there's a good reason to keep a pen of Lizard Doggos around.Lizard Doggos are short, friend-sized lizards with dog-like features. They have a physique similar to that of a Beagle, but are scaled and have armor on their back. Untamed, Lizard Doggos are entirely harmless, and will quickly run when approached if done so carelessly.To tame a Lizard Doggo, you'll need a few Paleberries--the raspberry-like fruit found all over the map. If you already have Blade Runners by this point, unequip them before you try to tame one of these little guys, and toggle your movement speed to slow (Shift key). Find a Doggo and wait until it turns and starts staring at you. At this point, open your inventory and drop a Paleberry on the ground in front of you and wait. The Doggo will slowly approach you to eat the Paleberry. Make sure not to move during this process. Once the Doggo has completely eaten the Paleberry, slowly approach it. You should have a prompt to pet it (E). If you're able to pet it, you're golden--you have a new buddy.Make sure to name every single one of your Lizard Doggos.Lizard Doggos are slow, though, and they aren't very smart, either. You won't want to take these guys exploring, because they can't keep up with anything faster than a walking pace. They can be killed by poisonous gas or hostile creatures, too, though they're immune to radiation. They also have a tendency to take a walk off the nearest cliff.To protect them, you'll want to take them right home and build a pen for them. Make sure the pen has a foundation underneath, otherwise they can de-spawn. If you get creative with the builder, you can still give them grassy space to play in with a hidden foundation underneath to keep them from disappearing. They can't jump, and their maximum step height is one meter, so they can't climb very high, meaning that your pen walls can be pretty low.Now that you have a Doggo and a Doggo Park, you'll want to check back every so often. Each Doggo has a one-slot inventory, and will at random intervals generate one of a list of 46 potential items, ranging from Hog Remains to Power Slugs to Nuclear Waste. With a pen full of Doggos, you can generate quite a few items in short order, and some of them can be pretty rare. At the current time there's no way to farm those items automatically, or to breed Lizard Doggos, so this will still be a manual process, but a Purple Power Slug or a Nuke Nobelisk is nothing to sneeze at.Here's the full list at the time of this writing, with the resource linked above:OreS.A.M.Flora and FaunaHog RemainsSpitter RemainsBlue Power SlugYellow Power SlugPurple Power SlugHealing ItemsBeryl NutComponentsIron PlateIron RodWireCableConcreteScrewReinforced Iron PlateRotorCopper SheetModular FrameSteel BeamSteel PipeEncased Industrial BeamStatorMotorPlasticRubberCircuit BoardHeavy Modular FrameComputerQuickwireAlclad Aluminum SheetAluminum CasingCrystal OscillatorSilicaQuartz CrystalElectromagnetic Control RodHeat SinkCooling SystemFused Modular FrameHigh-Speed ConnectorTurbo MotorFuelSolid BiofuelBiomass (Generic)AmmoNuke NobeliskPulse NobeliskNobeliskRifle AmmoIron Rebar\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nThe Outer Worlds 2 makes the actually important RPG choices more impactful by not having respecing.By \n    James Carr\n   on December 26, 2025 at 6:00AM PST\n              \n                Earth Directorate Commander Ash was sent to settle a labor strike issue on behalf of Auntie's Choice, in an effort to gain favor with the corporate conglomerate. A bit of an outlaw, and someone who excels in shooting, lockpicking, and smooth-talking, I felt like my character was primed to work out a result that was favorable for the workers without too much of an issue.I was able to enter the closed-off facility and even nab some blackmail on the manager in charge before confronting her directly about the labor strike. I conveyed the workers' demands, and expected to be able to convince her to see things my way--after all, I invested a decent amount of points in speech.It quickly became clear that no amount of talking was going to solve this dispute. As far as the manager was concerned, any concessions she might make would prevent the factory from hitting its quota. Someone with engineering or hacking skills may have been able to solve this issue by messing with the equipment in the factory, but my character wasn't built for that. My character was good at three things, and I'd already exhausted the lockpicking and talking options.So Commander Ash solved the problem the only other way she knew how: shooting the manager in the face and telling the striking workers to take it from there. What could easily feel like a failure of the game--not offering me a more diplomatic solution using whatever skills I had invested in--instead felt right, given the story I had built for myself.The limited number of skill points in The Outer Worlds 2 means you can only build up a handful of skills.In prior games in a similar style to The Outer Worlds 2, including the modern Fallout games, Cyberpunk 2077, and the original The Outer Worlds, I always had trouble resonating with the story. I would neglect the role-playing part of the RPG, not out of some refusal to engage with the story on its own terms, but because of the particular way I like to play games. I have a tendency to want to do everything and see everything, without the need to play through multiple times.I would often end up with a hodgepodge of skills, some points to improve combat skills, a few to increase carry weight to deal with my need to pick up everything I find, and a few skills to get me into locked areas. This would always result in me having a character that was good at a bunch of things, but worthless for high-end skill checks. If I had the option to respec, I would cheat my way through, and if it didn't, I would grind for some extra skill points. Sure, I got to see everything in the game, but that often lessened the chances of something different or odd happening.The Outer Worlds 2 doesn't have the option to respec, outside of one opportunity just after the opening sequence. On top of that, leveling isn't particularly fast, and you are only given two skill points to place into a massive list of skills. My particular playstyle would wreck my adventure here, making me lack the skills for interesting interactions and leaving me to suffer the consequences.So, I made a game plan during character creation. I gave my commander an outlaw background, and focused on guns, speech, and lockpicking. I built her like a smooth-talking space cowboy, someone who could get into places via speech or lockpicking and when the time came, shoot her way out. I even managed to spare two points of medicine, although even that small deviation meant I wasn't high enough level for a lockpick in a main quest area I was definitely overleveled for.Not every door can be lockpicked open.For as often as my speech skills could get me out of a jam, they also couldn't. After all, some people just can't be reasoned with. While I got through plenty of doors without issues, I would regularly run into a door that required hacking or another skill I didn't have. But I could always accomplish my goals in one way or another, I just had to make use of the skills I had chosen to invest in.This resulted in an experience with The Outer Worlds 2 where I felt invested in role-playing. Without the option to run away from or fix my decisions in the level-up screen, I had to work with it. I had satisfying experiences convincing low-level lackeys that their bosses didn't care about them, causing them to run rather than fight me. When a villain started lecturing me about the state of the galaxy, it felt right to choose the attack now option. I'd heard enough and was confident in a duel.It feels a bit silly to point out the benefits of role-playing in a genre with role-playing in the name, but respecing has become a crutch for some similar games. Playing Avowed earlier this year, while I felt like I knew who my character was from a personality standpoint, I regularly rebuilt my combat abilities and other skills, sometimes to use a new weapon or to deal with a situation differently.In The Outer Worlds 2, I often had to deal with an outcome that wasn't what I was angling for, because I had to play with skills I chose. The flaws system adds to this too, with my penchant for reloading constantly being something I could lean further into by getting a damage buff, so long as I didn't empty out my magazine.These thoughtful decisions also resonated with my companions, with Niles turning from a once-dedicated and hopeful Earth Directorate agent into an outlaw of his own. I taught him that large organizations will never have your back, and sometimes the only solution to a problem is a bullet, something that he now believes too.So while shooting that factory manager in the face might feel like a simple or unsatisfying solution in an RPG like The Outer Worlds 2, it was exactly what my character would have done in that moment anyway. Instead of trying to wiggle my way out of the consequences of my choices, undermining my own story in the process, I was forced to do exactly what my character was built to do, making something simple feel impactful.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

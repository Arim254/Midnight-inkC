    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nBy \n    Eddie Makuch\n   on January 13, 2026 at 10:44AM PST\n              \n          \n                Sophie Turner will play Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider TV series on Prime Video, and now the Game of Thrones star has further discussed the series, including how she's preparing.Appearing on SiriusXM, Turner started off by confirming she's never met Angelina Jolie, who played Croft in a pair of Tomb Raider movies in the early 2000s. \"No. Never. I would love to meet her,\" she said.As for her preparation for the series, Turner said she's playing the video games and reading the comics, but she is purposefully avoiding the Jolie movies. \"I don't want to imitate. I've got to create my own thing. So as much as I love those movies, I can't watch them right now,\" she said.          Turner also discussed how she's preparing, physically, for the role. She revealed that she's been training eight hours a day, five days a week, since February 2025. \"So it's been a lot,\" she said.Turner didn't detail her specific workout regimen, but that's certainly a lot of time in the gym. In that time, Turner said one unfortunate thing is that she's learned she has a \"perpetual back problem.\"Turner also said she has come to realize it's easier to build muscle if you have a history of exercising. She said she didn't, \"so it's taken me months and months and months to get into good shape.\"In Game of Thrones, in which Turner played Sansa Stark, Turner was getting beaten up a lot and was \"not the one doing the beating,\" she said. Conversely, for Tomb Raider, Turner will be the one doling out the punishments to her enemies. \"It's quite nice to learn how to throw a punch and not just take it,\" she said.          The Tomb Raider TV show is set to begin filming this month. However, there is no word yet on when the show will debut, or what it will be about, apart from telling the story of a woman who raids tombs. As announced previously, Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the creator, writer, executive producer, and co-showrunner alongside Chad Hodge for the series.In addition to Turner as Croft, the TV show will feature Harry Potter's Jason Isaacs as Lara's uncle Atlas, Sigourney Weaver as Evelyn Wallis, and Bill Baterson as Winston. For more, you can see a rundown of who's who in the Tomb Raider TV show.In other Tomb Raider news, the 2018 movie starring Alicia Vikander is putting up massive numbers on Netflix.As for the game series, The Game Awards in December 2025 brought news of two new Tomb Raider games, including a remake of the 1996 game called Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis coming in 2026 and a new game called Tomb Raider: Catalyst in 2027. These games will feature Alix Wilton Regan in the role of Lara Croft, taking over for Camilla Luddington.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                A backpack of C4 and new silenced weaponry are just some of the additions in the Helldivers 2 latest premium Warbond, Redacted Regiment, set to arrive January 20. For those who love operating behind enemy lines and striking unnoticed, this looks to be the Warbond for you.New weapons are always a primary selling point for a new Warbond, and Redacted Regiment is no different, with three additional weapons to unlock. For those who enjoy keeping enemies at a distance, the R-72 Censor is a mid-range, sniper-esque rifle with an integrated suppressor. When one-shot, one-kill doesn't do the job, there's also the AR-59 Suppressor, a fully automatic assault-rifle equipped with a non-removable suppressor.Of all the weapons, it's the P-35 Re-Educator secondary pistol that might be the most interesting of the bunch. The pistol fires darts laced with a chemical that causes \"delirium\" in organic targets and \"delirium-like malfunction\" in non-organic foes.A new Warbond isn't complete without a new stratagem, and Redacted Regiment will add a C4 backpack that allows for either single or simultaneous detonation of multiple explosives from a distance--perfect for taking out enemy bases or dealing with heavily armored units. To keep enemies off your tail, the Warbond additionally introduces a new throwable Lure Mine that will attract enemies with lights and sounds before detonating once hostiles are detected in close proximity.Other additions coming in the Warbond are two new armor sets that grant the Reduced Signature passive, reducing the amount of noise you make and reducing the range enemies will detect you--another perfect choice for those looking to play stealthily. A new booster, Concealed Insertion, drops a smokescreen when deploying via Hellpod, masking drops into enemy territory.You can check out everything coming in the Redacted Regiment Warbond, including new cosmetic capes, below. Like all standard premium Warbonds, Redacted Regiment will cost 1,000 Super Credits, Helldivers 2's premium currency that can be earned in small amounts in-game or purchased with real money."

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                God of War composer Bear McCreary has said he would consider returning to the series, following his previous comments about how his work on the Sony series was \"complete.\"IGN asked McCreary if he might be interested in returning, and he replied, \"If there were an opportunity to expand upon it, I would be open to that.\"          There is a new God of War TV show in the works for Prime Video, while the God of War game series is expected to continue, so there could indeed be an opportunity for McCreary to work more in the franchise, if he was asked back.Whatever the case, the composer said he's proud of the music he's written for the God of War games, adding that the games are \"so expansive\" and enjoyed by fans.Beyond the God of War series, McCreary said he is \"always looking for interesting projects\" and \"interesting people\" to collaborate with. He specifically said he's \"very interested\" in working on an independent or AA game. \"I think there's a lot of experimentation that happens there. And I love the medium. I'm putting it out there,\" he said.The composer, 46, has been nominated for three Grammy awards and is also known for his work on the TV shows Outlander, The Walking Dead, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, among others. In the world of film, he's composed music for Happy Death Day, 10 Cloverfield Lane, and Godzilla: King of the Monsters.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

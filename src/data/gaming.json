    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this month, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players called out the apparent use of AI in the game, especially the \"Ghibli-style\" Calling Cards. Activision subsequently acknowledged that some AI was used in the creation of Black Ops 7, but it insisted that the creative process is still in the hands of humans. Regardless, a US Congressman has weighed in on the Black Ops 7 debate and called for extensive AI regulations.California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna--who has previously accused Roblox of not doing enough to protect children who use it--reposted a message about the Ghibli-like Calling Cards and wrote, \"We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed.\"We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits.Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed.They should share in the profits. And there should be a tax on mass displacement. https://t.co/uU2tmt8pDJ  — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) November 14, 2025              In a subsequent post, Khanna shared some proposals from Nobel Laureate Acemoglu, including \"tax reforms to discourage excessive automation\" and allowing workers and unions to benefit from AI gains rather than being replaced by artificial intelligence. Khanna also stressed that he isn't calling for a complete ban on AI.\"Innovation and technological advance is patriotic and good for humanity provided it serves people,\" added Khanna. \"So we need to think about how it is adopted and how people can still have meaningful work and independence.\"That doesn't appear to be the primary sentiment behind AI implementation in the video game industry. PUBG publisher Krafton recently encouraged \"voluntary resignations\" from employees after declaring itself to be an \"AI-first company.\" Unknown Worlds Entertainment--a studio owned by Krafton--subsequently claimed it won't use AI in its upcoming sequel, Subnautica 2.Square Enix has announced its plans to use AI to replace 70% of its QA testers by 2027, while EA has reportedly told its employees to consider AI as a \"thought partner.\" Outside of the gaming realm, Pope Leo XIV has proclaimed that AI must honor the sanctity of human life.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this month, Sony and Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda live-action movie began filming in New Zealand. It was only matter of time before clips from the film were leaked, and now it appears that the first footage may reveal that an actress from Severance is playing Impa.The brief footage posted on Instagram shows actress Bo Bragason in character as Princess Zelda as she meets with a performer who seems to be portraying Impa. The other actress in question has been identified by fans as Dichen Lachman, who is known for her role as Ms. Casey in Severance. Lachman has extensive experience in genre film and TV shows, including appearances in Altered Carbon, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Supergirl, The 100, and Jurassic World Dominion. This is just rumor for now, though, as no official casting announcement has been made for the Zelda movie beyond the two main leads.Impa has been a supporting character since the very first Legend of Zelda game, although her role has greatly differed. She has been portrayed as a protector or even a bodyguard for Princess Zelda. A much younger version of Impa is featured in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.This leaked footage has led some fans to speculate that the film will adapt The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It's also possible that the movie will draw from several different eras of Zelda for a streamlined adaptation. But for now, we can only speculate.Benjamin Evan Ainsworth will portray Link in the movie, and his role was revealed in July of this year alongside Bragason's casting as Zelda. For now, they are the only two cast members officially confirmed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures, which is producing the film, alongside Nintendo and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes helmer Wes Ball is directing the film from a script by Pokemon: Detective Pikachu writer Derek Connolly. In June, Nintendo pushed back the release of the Legend of Zelda movie. The current release date is May 7, 2027.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

Rockstar Games distributed a new budget-friendly $30 edition in September, and now you can grab a copy of Red Dead Redemption for $25 during Amazon's early Black Friday video game sale. Red Dead Redemption's physical edition for Switch includes the full game and Undead Nightmare expansion on the cartridge. The Switch 2 update will be available December 2, and it's free for owners of the Switch edition. The digital version still retails for $50, so you can save 50% by picking up the physical edition instead. Amazon's early Black Friday sale also includes the Switch port of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition for $20 (was $30).                                                                                                      Red Dead Redemption for Nintendo Switch                                                                $25 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    Red Dead Redemption's Switch 2 update will offer 60fps as well as enhanced visuals with HDR and DLSS. Switch 2 players will also be able to play Red Dead Redemption with Joy-Con 2 mouse controls.If you're buying RDR to play on the original Switch, you should know it's still a pretty impressive port from a technical perspective. It runs at a stable 30fps in handheld and docked modes with 720p and 1080p resolution, respectively.Red Dead Redemption is a spaghetti western that nails the mythic appeal of being a cowboy. The game doesn't stray far from the open-world template that Rockstar perfected with its previous GTA releases. You have the freedom to explore, cause trouble, and complete quests provided by the large cast of memorable characters.John Marston's journey across the sprawling expanses of the American Wild West and Mexico to bury his blood-stained past and protect his family is a memorable one.Along with the base game, this edition of RDR comes with Undead Nightmare, a horror-themed adventure in which the world around you has been transformed into an apocalyptic landscape overrun with zombies. Undead Nightmare was originally released as a standalone expansion, but these days it's bundled with the base game on modern platforms.                                                                                                                            Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy for Nintendo Switch                                                                $20 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    If you also want to explore the city streets of the modern age, check out Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition for only $20 (was $30). This collection still retails for $60 on the eShop, but Rockstar rereleased the physical version a few months back with a budget-friendly MSRP.Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy collects three PS2-era classics: GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas. The Definitive Edition launched in rough shape, but all three games are much better these days thanks to multiple patches and a significant overhaul last fall.When you pop in the game card for the first time, you will be prompted to download roughly GTA: Vice City from the eShop (roughly 9GB). San Andreas and GTA III are stored on the card. The digital version of the trilogy from the eShop, for reference, is 25.4GB.

These gear pieces have powerful effects and quirks. When combined with other equipment, you can have numerous boons active at any given time.Where to find all unique armors in The Outer Worlds 2There are plenty of unique helmets in the game. For those that we've listed here, we've opted to focus on when each region/location is visited during the campaign. As an aside, we did not include chestpieces and outfits. You can find those in our unique armor guide.Premium Edition item: Premium Moon Man HelmetLocation: You receive this unique helmet in The Outer Worlds 2 if you own the Premium Edition. After the prologue, it should appear in your inventory.Stats: +5% base health.Mods: It's Premium - Gain a bonus to your damage resistance that scales based on the number of bits/currency held.Eden: Paradise Island - Unique helmet locationsThe map shown above has the locations of various unique helmets in The Outer Worlds 2. We've numbered these spots accordingly, starting at the town of Fairfield, then moving outward to more distant locations.Paradise Island unique helmet location #1: Limited Edition Gentleperson's OxonianLocation: Initially, this item was obtainable by looting Milverstreet's cache in Fairfield. However, that method seems to have been patched. Instead, you have to side with Milverstreet instead of Kaur while undertaking various quests in the settlement/region.Stats: +5% critical chance and +40% critical damage.Mods: Marketing Manager - Companion abilities charge +10% faster. This scales up to +30% faster based on your Speech skill.Paradise Island unique helmet location #2: Monocular Target-FinderLocation: Make your way to Sovereign's Sweet Spire Grove just southwest of Fairfield. That's where you can complete a quest called \"A Final Death for Gravity,\" which actually nets you the double jump ability. Also, note that there are two options when you interact with the terminal at the top of the structure:  (A) Use the Drive Overloader or (B) regulate the Drive Overloader via Engineering 4 or the Brilliant trait.In our playthrough, we chose the second option since we had the prerequisite skill level and trait. We're unable to confirm if you do receive the item if you use the Drive Overloader only.Stats: +10% weakspot damage.Mods: Range Scanner - Grants additional weakspot damage relative to how far away the target is. Further distances grant a larger bonus, but damage falloff still applies. The bonus maxes out at +30% at 100 meters.Paradise Island unique helmet location #3: MalpracticeLocation: Found on a table in the Mysterious Cave, which is at the southwestern part of Paradise Island.Stats: +40% toxicity drain rate.Mods: Misconduct - While crashing, gain +20% damage. This bonus scales up to +40% based on your Medical skill.Paradise Island unique helmet location #4: The DoseLocation: This unique helmet in The Outer Worlds 2 is a reward for completing the \"Vanquishing the Vexing Vapors\" quest. Here's the gist:  Go to Euphoria Coast Automech Repair Center in the eastern part of Paradise Island.Do the tasks assigned to you by Delphina Bryant to receive the Gas Energy Deflection Apparatus gadget.Talk to Marshal Donelson in the control room. He'll tell you to venture deeper into the facility. Watch out for enemies, and be sure to activate your gadget whenever you have to enter areas that are filled with Zyranium.Stats: +40% toxicity drain rate.Mods: The Poison - Gain +20% crit chance while standing in a Zyranium cloud. The Zyranium poisoning build-up is 50% slower.That does it for our guide on where to find all unique helmets in The Outer Worlds 2.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 28, 2025 at 12:56PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Are you concerned about the various flaws in The Outer Worlds 2? These effects pop up from time to time as you go through the campaign. They tend to be helpful, though they always come with a caveat in the form of a penalty, too. It's up to you to choose the ones that you really need, but be forewarned that they can no longer be removed once selected.Which flaws should you choose in The Outer Worlds 2There are over a dozen flaws that can appear as you're playing the game. Upon meeting the conditions for their hidden triggers, a pop-up will appear on your screen, prompting you to choose or reject the flaw.We've formatted our guide to focus primarily on those with manageable effects, and we've even included tips in case you want to select these flaws. A bit later in our article, we list the options that have more drastic effects, such as randomized occurrences that can be a hassle for your first playthrough.ConsumerismUnlock: Purchase the Premium Edition of the game.Positive effect: -15% vendor prices when buying.Negative effect: -10% selling prices.Keep or discard? Keep - Vendors items tend to have exorbitant prices, which makes this flaw in The Outer Worlds 2 quite viable. While you won't earn as much when selling junk, you can still earn a lot of cash from quests and loot.Easily DistractedUnlock: Allocate your points into different kinds of skills--i.e. at least four or five different specialties.Positive effect: +1 skill point gained per level.Negative effect: While leveling, you can only add skill points to your lowest non-zero skill or any skill you have no points in already.Keep or discard? Discard - Having no choice but to spend points on options that you don't necessarily need at that given time can be a huge problem, especially if you're trying to raise certain skills just to unlock new perks.OverpreparedUnlock: Reload your guns regularly, even if they still have ammo.Positive effect: +50% magazine size.Negative effect: -40% damage for eight seconds after a weapon's magazine is empty.Keep or discard? Keep - This flaw in The Outer Worlds 2 might seem like a bad choice at first. That said, if you're mindful of your weapon's current ammo count, then you won't have too many issues with the debuff.DependentUnlock: Have companions with you often when you get in combat.Positive effect: +25% damage to enemies recently damaged by companions.Negative effect: -10% damage.Keep or discard? It depends - There are some caveats if you select this flaw. It's pretty much dependent on the recruitable companions that you currently have in your squad. Ideally, you should have characters that can deal area-of-effect damage or damage-over-time, just so you can retain the +25% boost more consistently. This is further bolstered by unlocking each companion's mod kit to improve their capabilities in combat.TreacherousUnlock: Repeatedly do sneak attacks to take out enemies.Positive effect: +50% enemy awareness depletion rate; +100% sneak attack damage.Negative effect: -25% base health.Keep or discard? It depends - It's really up to you if you want to keep this flaw, as it's primarily for players who've invested a lot into the Sneak skill and related perks. The main downside is that you still won't be able to instantly kill enemies with sneak attacks if they're at a significantly higher level.TeetotalerUnlock: Regularly avoid toxicity by not using inhalers that often, or by staying away from Zyranium gas.Positive effect: +25% health restored by medical inhalers.Negative effect: +25% toxicity from medical inhalers.Keep or discard? It depends - Get this if you have access to unique armor or unique helmets that grant toxicity reduction. Alternatively, if you often bring support characters like Valerie or Inez, then you can rely more on their healing abilities instead of your inhalers.LudditeUnlock: We're still uncertain as to how we unlocked the Luddite flaw in The Outer Worlds 2. We surmise that it might be due to avoiding the use of gadgets for a prolonged period while playing.Positive effect: +10% damage resistance as long as your gadget energy meter is full.Negative effect: -25% gadget meter max; -25% energy recharge rate.Keep or discard? Discard - You probably want to have your gadget usage at the ready, instead of having to wait for it to fill up.FlawedUnlock: Select at least two flaws.Positive effect: Gain an extra perk point every 5 levels. This bonus is retroactive.Negative effect: Flaws must be accepted.Keep or discard? Discard - The pop-up even warns you that selecting this option is a bad idea for your first playthrough. Once you've beaten the game and you want to do another run where you accept every flaw that comes your way, then you definitely need to pick this.KleptomaniaUnlock: Keep stealing valuable items in houses and settlements without getting spotted.Positive effect: +100% vendor buying price for stolen items.Negative effect: You'll occasionally steal things automatically.Keep or discard? Discard - This, too, has a warning telling you that it should be avoided for your first playthrough. We're a bit wary due to the effects on faction reputation and bounties, especially if our character suddenly grabs goodies in front of NPCs.Foot-in-Mouth SyndromeUnlock: Regularly skip through dialogue--i.e. press the spacebar whenever an NPC is talking to you.Positive effect: +15% experience gained.Negative effect: Choices in conversations are randomly picked for you after enough time passes.Keep or discard? Keep - We've opted to include this entry here given that the randomization can have drastic effects on your playthrough. Still, Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome is one of the best flaws in The Outer Worlds 2. Naturally, the bonus XP gain helps you level up faster. The penalty can be ignored since you have around 10 seconds to pick a reply. As long as you don't accidentally leave the game idle while talking to a companion--where you might accidentally dismiss them for good--then you shouldn't worry too much.That does it for our guide on how to unlock flaws in The Outer Worlds 2. We'll let you know once we've discovered others, so stay tuned.    \n  \n                      "

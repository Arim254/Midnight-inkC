    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this year, Ubisoft accidentally leaked the first word that a Far Cry TV series was in development with It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Rob Mac and Alien: Earth creator Noah Hawley. Now, it's official. Far Cry is going forward as television show on FX and Hulu.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Far Cry will be an anthology similar to Fargo, the series that Hawley brought to FX over a decade ago. FX notes that each season of Far Cry will have a new setting and a new cast of characters. Mac--who was formerly known as Rob McElhenney--will executive produce and star in the first season of the series. Ubisoft's official account for Far Cry quickly shared the news as well.So uh… remember when we said FARCRY stories always escalate? Yeah. FX took that personally.A brand-new FARCRY anthology series is coming to Hulu with a whole new setting, new cast, and the exact level of chaos your therapist told you to avoid.Good luck out there. pic.twitter.com/1QINzLTvca  — Far Cry (@FarCrygame) November 24, 2025              \"What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology,\" said Hawley in a statement. \"Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme. To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens, is a dream come true. I'm excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.\"\"Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized,\" added Mac. \"Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.\"FX and Hulu haven't announced a premiere window for Far Cry, but Hawley recently signed a new overall deal with FX and Disney Entertainment Television that includes Alien: Earth Season 2. In September, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that the future of the Far Cry games will place an emphasis on multiplayer. A new Far Cry title has yet to be officially unveiled by Ubisoft.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Near the end of October, Rockstar Games fired more than 30 employees across offices in the United Kingdom and Canada. At the time, Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said that the employees had been terminated over \"gross misconduct.\" But now People Make Games has reported that these employees' dismissal didn't have anything to do with spilling secrets from Grand Theft Auto 6 or any other Rockstar projects.According to People Make Games, the issue at hand arose over internal company messages that were shared on a Discord server used by staff members and representatives of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain. However, the messages shared were about changes to Rockstar's Slack policy, which eliminated channels where workers could chat about topics outside of the office.The report notes that Rockstar has such tight security that employees can't even check their email unless they're physically in the office. One of the employees apparently posted the Slack changes to the Discord server at a time when most of the other devs hadn't received any correspondence about it yet.People Make Games' source suggests that someone on the Discord server brought that message to the attention of Rockstar management. That allegedly sparked the internal investigation which led to the employees being dismissed from Rockstar.Subsequently, IWGB accused Rockstar of union busting and filed a legal claim on behalf of the staff members who lost their jobs. Over 200 Rockstar employees signed a letter demanding that fired workers be reinstated. For now, there doesn't appear to be any resolution in sight and the case may go to court in the United Kingdom to sort out the fate of Rockstar's ex-developers.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Season 1 adds Black Ops 7's integration into Warzone, a new battle pass, DLC weapons to unlock, and more maps across all modes. Seasonal holiday events are also included, and the campaign's Endgame mode gets new world events with massive bosses to fight.Call of Duty Season 1 start timesCall of Duty Season 1 arrives to Black Ops 7 and Warzone on December 4, and the update will go live at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM BST across all platforms.New seasonal eventsSeason 1 kicks off with the Rally Point event, which is a community-based event that will unlock several cosmetic rewards for everyone who participates. This event is available across all game modes, including the campaign Endgame.Later in the season, a Naughty and Nice holiday event will allow players to earn festive rewards.Seasonal battle passBlack Ops 7 gets its first battle pass, and it includes both free and premium tiers of content. In total, the Season 1 battle pass offers up more than 100 pieces of new content to unlock. Alden Dorne serves as the main battle pass operator players can unlock in the paid pass, and a variant skin is unlocked for Dorne if the full battle pass is completed.The premium $30 BlackCell pass also returns. The BlackCell pass includes the \"Scorn\" operator unlock and several additional cosmetics to unlock.More weapons to unlockSeven weapons are coming in Season 1. Two are available in the free tiers of the battle pass, while others will arrive later in the season as rewards for various in-game challenges.The battle pass weapons are the Kogot-7 submachine gun, which looks like a re-named MP7, and the fan-favorite Maddox assault rifle from Black Ops 4 returns as the Maddox RFB.Later in the season, players can unlock the ballistic knife, Sokol 545 light machine gun, the NX Ravager crossbow, HX sniper rifle, and the Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun.Multiplayer mapsSeason 1 adds seven more maps for multiplayer, and this will be a mix of new and remastered maps. Some maps will arrive at launch, while others are saved for the midseason update.Fate is a brand-new map inspired by the game's campaign mission called Time and Fate, and the setting features a trippy setting of fractured and floating building pieces from a city in Nicaragua. Odysseus is another new map based on a campaign mission, and Utopia is a futuristic Guild facility based in Australia. Yakei is a small-size map for 6v6 and 2v2 modes. This map setting takes place on the rooftops of a neon-lit Japanese city.Additionally, Meltdown and Standoff arrive as remastered maps from Black Ops 2, and Fringe returns from Black Ops 3. Players can also expect a holiday-themed makeover for Hijacked.New MP game modesFor game modes, several of Call of Duty's popular party modes return. Prop Hunt, One in the Chamber, and Sharpshooter are included with the launch of Season 1, while Sticks and Stones and Gun Game will appear post-launch.Treyarch is also introducing a brand-new mode called Takeover for the midseason update. This sounds like a mashup of Domination and Hardpoint, as two teams of six fight over three neutral territories, earning a point for each zone they control. When all three of the zones are captured, there's a brief cooldown before all three territories move to a new set of locations within the map. The team with the highest score at the end wins the game.Holiday-themed limited-time mode will arrive later in the season, including a snowball fight game mode that arms players with snowballs instead of guns.New MP loadout equipmentSeason 1's midseason update will add plenty of items from Black Ops 6. This includes the Shock Charge tactical equipment, Impact and Thermal lethal equipment, and the Tactical Insertion field upgrade.Several Black Ops 6 scorestreaks are also included with the update:Archangel LauncherCombat BowDeath MachineDreadnoughtGrim ReaperSAM TurretStrategic BomberWar MachineZombiesSeason 1 adds a brand-new Zombies map called Astra Malorum, which takes the Zombies crew to a skull-shaped rock in space to fight zombies. The map introduces a new robot enemy called O.S.C.A.R. and a new LGM-1 Wonder Weapon, which shoots UFO-shaped projectiles.In addition to Astra Malorum, Season 1 includes the smaller survival maps for Exit 115 and Zarya Cosmodrome. Directed mode also arrives for Ashes of the Damned, which will allow players to have assistance with completing the story quest for this map.The popular Mule Kick perk returns in Black Ops 7 Zombies. The Shatter Blast, Tesla Storm, Mr Peeks, and Frost Blast field upgrades return from Black Ops 6.EndgameSeason content is also included for the game's Endgame campaign mode. There are new world events coming to Avalon with the big update, including the Zombie T-Rex boss from Black Ops 6 Zombies, the iconic Origins robot from Black Ops 2 Zombies, and one that requires players to take down a powerful VTOL warship.WarzoneSeason 1 adds the Haven's Hollow resurgence map for warzone. Haven's Hollow is set in the same town as Black Ops 6's Zombies mode, but this version of Liberty Falls is designed pre-outbreak.Verdansk remains as Warzone's big map for battle royale. The Season 1 update will add two POIs: Factory and Signal Station. Factory is a large factory-style building next to Superstore, and it's a very forgettable location. Signal Station is a little more interesting as it offers objectives you can complete in order to get rewarded with extra intel.Players can expect Black Ops 7's weapon and attachment pool to arrive, and Warzone perk changes will be included in the big update.    \n  \n                      "

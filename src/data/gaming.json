    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nDonkey Kong Bananza makes Nintendo’s platforming formula louder and more chaotic.By \n    Aron Garst\n   on December 28, 2025 at 6:00AM PST\n              \n                Drop into the lagoon in Donkey Kong Bananza. Sure, you need to chase Void Kong to the Earth's center to save the day, but maybe you just want to soak in some water-adjacent locales as you explore this new world beneath the surface. There are plenty of secrets tucked away in each level's hidden crevices. When you first hop in there is really only one thing to do: pick a direction and start smashing.Donkey Kong Bananza takes Nintendo's hallmark sandbox exploration and pushes it somewhere the studio rarely goes--pure chaos. Bananza is not interested in the kind of precision platforming that defines Mario's visits to Peach's Castle, Delfino Plaza, or outer space. It captures that same cheerful vibe, but lets players rip through it.There is a long-running design idea at Nintendo that movement should feel good on its own. Shigeru Miyamoto once said he wanted players to enjoy moving Mario around an empty room. The reason Mario is so fun to control in Super Mario 64 is that Miyamoto and the small team behind the N64 classic spent months making sure he felt great to play, even if the only action possible was running around an empty space.Delfino Plaza from Super Mario SunshineCombine that movement philosophy with tightly designed playgrounds and you get moments players never forget. There is nothing quite like triple hopping across the center square of Delfino Plaza, bouncing off an umbrella, and sliding into a chimney chute to grab a blue coin. It was fun just to jump around, which naturally encouraged exploration, which created a quick dopamine hit when a secret Shine Sprite appeared and the day literally got brighter.Donkey Kong Bananza taps into that same feeling, but in an entirely different way. I am not guiding Donkey Kong across rooftops with three perfect hops. I am plowing through debris, carving my own path, and uncovering collectible-packed caverns. It becomes easy to wander off the main objective and start exploring every crack and crevice of the planet's inner layers.Platforming has always been a pillar of Nintendo design. Mario, Kirby, and Donkey Kong, along with other Nintendo icons, all focus on exploration through running, jumping, and a bit of flair. Donkey Kong Bananza keeps the flair, but adds a hefty serving of smash. It feels authentic because chaos is exactly what you expect from a rambunctious gorilla.Donkey Kong is naturally destructive, according to NintendoNintendo has said before that playing as Donkey Kong should feel like an adventure through untamed spaces. Bananza producer Kenta Motokura echoed that idea in an interview, saying that with the goal of defining what 3D Donkey Kong should be and highlighting his strengths and new actions, the team felt the concept of destruction was the right fit.In the end, Bananza succeeds because it embraces exactly what makes Donkey Kong special. It is loud, messy, and endlessly fun. The thrill is not just in reaching the core. It is in everything you smash, discover, and carve through along the way.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Billy Givens\n   on December 26, 2025 at 10:21AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Arc Raiders has already seen quite a few updates since its launch at the end of October, but developer Embark Studios is closing the year out big. The Cold Snap update brings multiple seasonal events, a new Snowfall map condition, and plenty more for fans to sink their teeth into. Among the fresh additions is the Goalie Raider Deck--the game's second battle pass--which contains a smorgasbord of cosmetics, gear, items, and even Raider Tokens that can be used toward premium purchases in the shop.The Goalie Deck is free for all players, so you won't need to purchase access to these rewards with premium currency. Instead, you'll simply need to work toward completing daily Feats that provide you with Creds, then use those to unlock your preferred items from the deck. This should prove fairly easy to do for most players, as you can complete up to three Feats per match, and you'll even get additional bonus Creds for the first five Feats you finish in a day.Perhaps the best news about the Goalie Deck, however, is that it's a permanent reward track. Unlike battle passes in other games, this deck will stick around forever, meaning you can unlock what you want from it whenever you'd like. With this in mind, you can skip any rewards that just don't matter much to you right now--though it's worth pointing out you will still need to purchase a certain number of items from the deck to unlock subsequent pages.If you're excited to dive into the Goalie Deck and start reaping its rewards--including the new hockey-themed outfit, which is pretty rad--we've got you covered ahead of time. Keep scrolling below for every reward from the Goalie Deck in Arc Raiders.    \n  \n                      "

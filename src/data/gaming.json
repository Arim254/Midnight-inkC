    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                At The Game Awards, developer S-Game has released a new trailer for its upcoming action game, Phantom Blade Zero, confirming a release date of September 9, 2026 on PC and PlayStation 5.The trailer was pretty epic, starting with some CGI of a martial artist crossing swords with some thugs while carrying a baby in some Death Stranding kind of way. We then cut to some actual gameplay of our protagonist, the elite assassin Soul, as he travels around various environments, enters various cutscenes, and engages in various battles. It's not quite a souls-like, but based on combat encounters and enemy designs, you'd think it was one. Actually, it looks like a cool mix between Where Winds Meet, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.          First announced back in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero is one of several high-profile games inspired by '80s and '90s Chinese Wuxia action movies. Phantom Blade Zero features a seamless map with interconnected regions for players to explore. This aspect of the game was inspired by classic Dark Souls, while combat revolves around fast-paced offense and even quicker blocks against your usual cannon-fodder enemies and tougher bosses.One such antagonist glimpsed in a previous trailer was the Seven Judgments--a puppetmaster who can command a mob of enemies to strike at you with lethal choreographed precision--and previous previews of the game have shown off a diverse range of bosses who'll put your skills to the test.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Mega Man is one of the few icons of the NES era that's still beloved four decades after his peak, but Capcom's hero is finally making his comeback. At The Game Awards, the first look at Mega Man's next game was revealed. It's called Mega Man Dual Override, and its retains the side-scrolling action of the original games with updated visuals that pop off the screen.          Mega Man Dual Override will arrive in 2027, which dovetails with the 40th anniversary of the original Mega Man that debuted in 1987. The title character is a heroic robot who is able to steal certain powers and abilities from bosses he defeats, allowing him to use them against the other bosses. The games even let players strategize which bosses to go after first to determine the enemies who were vulnerable to his newfound weapons.Six Mega Man games were released on the NES before the series went to the SNES with Mega Man 7 in 1995. The spin-off series, Mega Man X, also debuted on the SNES, and the franchise continued in various forms through 2018 and the debut of Mega Man 11.Earlier this week, Capcom disclosed that it's planning future Mega Man games, as well as new installments of Ace Attorney and Devil May Cry. A compilation for the Mega Man Star Force Legacy titles will be released in 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

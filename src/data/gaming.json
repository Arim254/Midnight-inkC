    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In January 2026, it will be seven and a half years since the announcement teaser for The Elder Scrolls 6. In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6.\"It's progressing really well,\" Howard told Game Informer. \"The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right.\"Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after Starfield was released in 2023. Fans are so desperate for any kind of update that they're reading things in the Skyrim Switch 2 announcement trailer as if they're hidden hints about an Elder Scrolls 6 release window.As recently as last month, Howard said that The Elder Scrolls 6 is \"still a long way off\" and he expressed regret for announcing the sequel when he did. Earlier this year, Bethesda teamed up with Make-A-Wish for a charity auction to design a creature in Elder Scrolls 6.Howard also held open the possibility of an Elder Scrolls TV series, much like the hit Fallout show on Prime Video. However, Howard indicated that he's \"willing to say 'no' for a decade\" rather than rush into that.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Activision has made a couple of announcements that seem to suggest the company is trying extra hard to encourage people to buy and play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.For starters, Activision has launched a new week-long free trial for Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode. In the free trial, which runs December 16-22, players can access 20+ maps and try the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. In terms of modes, players can try out mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed, as well as the Holiday Havoc mode and Prop Hunt.Alongside this, Activision has discounted Black Ops 7 by up to 30%. This brings the price down to from $70 to $49 for the standard edition, or from $100 to $80 for the Vault Edition.If you're playing on Xbox or PC, you can access Black Ops 7 with Xbox Game Pass or PC Game Pass. Microsoft recently brought back the $1 trial, which means new subscribers can get Game Pass Ultimate for $1 for the first month.Black Ops 7 launched in November and reportedly had a weak comparison to 2024's Black Ops 6 in terms of sales. This could help explain why Activision is offering a discount on the game about a month after launch, though there could be other reasons as well.In other news, Activision has said it will no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years. While Black Ops 7's initial sales may have been lower, the Call of Duty franchise remains the biggest franchise for Xbox Game Pass.Battlefield 6 is 2025's No. 1 best-selling game in the US so far. On December 17, we will find out from Circana how Black Ops 7 sold in the US, though the game's availability on Game Pass will put an asterisk on its sales performance.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Cold Snap update has added plenty of snow and freezing conditions to Arc Raiders, but there's also a bit of holiday cheer to be found topside. That is, if you're engaging with the Flickering Flames project and collecting the necessary Candleberries to complete it. These hard-to-find berries are necessary for filling out the project alongside a handful of other fairly common items. Even better, each time you fulfill a requirement in the project, you'll earn rewards like Raider Tokens or Merits--the latter of which goes toward the Gathering Candleberries event. Here's how to find candleberries in Arc Raiders, as well as everything you'll need to complete the Flickering Flames event.Table of Contents [hide]Arc Raiders Candleberries locationsFlickering Flames project item listStage 1Stage 2Stage 3Stage 4Stage 5Arc Raiders Candleberries locationsCandleberries can only be found during the new Cold Snap map condition. This map condition can occur on any map except Stella Montis, so it will be available fairly often for you to explore.To find Candleberries, you'll want to visit areas that commonly contain other fruits, such as those you need for Scrappy upgrades. These areas are typically Nature regions, which are clearly defined on every map by the leaf icon. Candleberry bushes will be bright red and stick out against the snow.Candleberries are found on bright red bushes that are easily spotted against the white snow. Unfortunately, in our experience, each bush drops only a single Candleberry, which can make gathering them this way quite a task.Luckily, you can also get a huge influx of Candleberries by simply working on the Gathering Candleberries event. You'll receive a total of 180 Candleberries throughout your completion of the reward track. And since all you need to do to level up the reward track is gain XP (which converts to Merits), these should come naturally over time.You'll gain quite a few Candleberries from the Gathering Candleberries reward track.It's the other items you need for the Flickering Flames project that may take a bit more effort to round up. Let's take a look at what you'll need.Flickering Flames project item listThe Flickering Flames project requires a fairly hefty investment of items--but they're mostly relatively common items that can be found in drawers, cabinets, cars, or other lootable containers across any map. Here's every item you'll need to complete the Flickering Flames project.Stage 1Empty Wine Bottle x1Plastic Parts x25Durable Cloth x5Candleberries x20Stage 2Candle Holder x3Light Bulb x3Industrial Battery x1Candleberries x50Stage 3We're still working on this.Stage 4We're still working on this.Stage 5We're still working on this.For more on Arc Raiders, check out our comprehensive guides hub.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

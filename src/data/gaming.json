    "body": "\n          \n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n    \n              \n          \n                                                                                                                                                               Amazon's Black Friday deals are officially here, and right now you'll find the Minecraft Physical Edition on PS5 for its lowest price ever. It's discounted to just $25 (was $30), so if you haven't yet played the iconic game, this is a great chance to dive in (or snag it as an affordable gift for a friend or family member). The discount doesn't seem like much, but it comes bundled with 3,500 Tokens, which typically cost $20. This version of Minecraft doesn't see many discounts. It briefly dropped its price by a few bucks during the summer, but this Black Friday deal is the best we've seen. If you're looking for a holiday gift for a younger gamer in your life, this is likely a good choice--just keep in mind this discount only applies to the physical PS5 version.                                 Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5)                                                                $25 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    While you'll find Minecraft for $20 at most digital storefronts, this physical edition deal is actually the better offer. Not only do you get a few in-game goodies, but you're getting an additional value of $20 from the 3,500 Tokens. That's a total value of $40 for just $25--and if you know you'll be buying stuff from the in-game store, this is certainly the edition to get. It gets you a physical copy of Minecraft, 3,500 Tokens, and two in-game items: the Popcorn Bucket Hat and Butter Shirt.                      Minecraft has seen massive success over the years, so it should come as no surprise that it's built up an impressive list of accompanying merchandise. And ahead of Black Friday, several Lego Minecraft sets are on sale. These include the 555-piece Ghast Balloon village Attack set, which is down to $56 (was $70), while the Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring is discounted to $41.49 (was $50), and the Trial Chamber is on sale for $32 (was $40).

To mark the occasion, Blizzard is giving out rewards in several of its games. The only thing players have to do to unlock rewards in multiple games is to earn the \"Welcome Home\" Achievement. To do that, all you need to do is move into a home and fill out a form. That will grant you a new set of cosmetics in Overwatch 2, Heathstone, and StarCraft 2. Here's a breakdown of what you'll get in each game.Overwatch 2Xal’atath Symmetra Legendary SkinXal’atath Symmetra SprayXal'atath Symmetra Name CardDark Heart Player IconThe Overwatch 2, Heartthstone and StarCraft 2 rewards from World of Warcraft.HearthstoneEarning the \"Welcome Home\" achievement in WoW unlocks the Hearth & Home Card BackStarCraft 2Earning new Horde and Alliance StarCraft II console skins after you earn the \"Welcome Home\" achievement in WoW.Heathstone is also running a new, limited-time in-game event, \"Welcome to the Neighborhood!,\" featuring an earnable Epic event card.The Midnight expansion is also changing transmog in the game, and some people are upset about it. Subsequently, Bilzzard has already made some adjustments to the changes in response to feedback. Blizzard is also introducing a new in-game currency that can only be spent on housing items. The company has argued that making that change is better for players, but not all of them would agree with that.World of Warcraft's Midnight expansion will launch on March 2, 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

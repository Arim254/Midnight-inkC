    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nThis week’s episode moved forward while looking back.By \n    Reyna Cervantes\n   on December 24, 2025 at 12:00AM PST\n              \n                Spoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead.Another week, another episode of Fallout. This week saw lots of use of Lucy’s (Ella Purnell) “Golden Rule” and a look into the politics of the Brotherhood of Steel. In many ways this episode felt like a significant step forward for the series, but it also took its time to honor Fallout’s past. From iconic locations to lore deep cuts , there was no shortage of callbacks. Let's take a look at what “The Golden Rule” had to offer.A Familiar and Friendly PlaceThis week’s episode showed us a flashback of Shady Sands in its prime. While we saw the bombed city in the first season, this season gave us a look at what life was like in the New California Republic settlement before it was destroyed. Longtime fans will recognize Shady Sands as one of the first locations you can visit from the original 1997 Fallout game. Since the series is canon to the video games, its destruction is the city’s eventual fate.Monotony Builds CharacterTypical NCR Combat PatrolShady Sands meets its fate when a mind controlled stranger enters the city with an armed atom bomb. When confronted by Maximus’ father, the stranger keeps muttering a single phrase over and over: “Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.” Fans of Fallout: New Vegas will recognize this line as one used by New California Republic NPCs that didn’t have meaningful dialogue. It’s in-game use is also used to represent their mundane duties and boring patrols, which has led to the phrase being meme’d into oblivion online.Area 51I want to believeMaximus (Aaron Moten) and his Brotherhood of Steel chapter gained a new base of operations this week in the form of Area 51. Though this base hides numerous old world artifacts for the Brotherhood to use , chief among them is an icebox housing an alien corpse. The alien is specifically a Zetan, whose most notable appearance is in the Fallout 3 DLC “Mothership Zeta.” Did you know that you can also encounter them in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas, too? If you have the Wild Wasteland trait selected, there’s a possibility that a spacecraft with two Zetan’s aboard will spawn. , If not, you’re left wanting to believe.Reclamation DayVault 76's Reclamation Day partyWhen Norm (Moisés Arias) wakes up all of the Vault-Tec Junior Executives in Vault 31, he convinces them that it's Reclamation Day to get all of them to follow him. Reclamation Day, in Fallout lore ,is the designated day when the Vaults open up, permitting all their inhabitants to return to the surface to reestablish society. This is most notable in the game Fallout 76, where players create a resident from Vault 76, the first vault to open up after The Great War and whose inhabitants explored and settled in Appalachia.Power Leads to MadnessLiberty Prime in Magic: The GatheringThroughout the episode, various chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel conspire to stand together against the chapter from The Commonwealth, despite it potentially causing a civil war. Fallout 4 fans will recognize The Commonwealth as the Boston-inspired setting of that entry. The Brotherhood of Steel chapter of that game was led by Elder Arthur Maxson, who was driven mad with power and sought to bring conflict and destruction to The Commonwealth by using the Brotherhood’s freedom enforcing robot, Liberty Prime.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                When it comes to Roblox games, Blox Fruits might just be the biggest, and that doubles for both popularity and scope. With a level cap of a whopping 2800, working your way up from the beginning is one hell of a journey. Luckily, we’re here to help you with Blox Fruits leveling and offer some small tips that’ll help you as you battle enemies and try to get more powerful in this thrilling Roblox experience.Blox Fruits Leveling ExplainedThere are plenty of ways to level up in Blox Fruits, and even more reasons for doing so. Naturally, like any other RPG, you will get stronger with every level, and this is the key to taking on more powerful enemies on different islands.For clarity, leveling up will give you access to several new things, including:New islands to explore3 stat points to spend as you likeLevel-gated NPC questsOther gameplay elements like Raids, Awakening Fruits, and Elite PiratesOne of the most important parts of leveling up is the stat points, which you can spend in any of the following categories:MeleeDefenseSwordGunBlox FruitHow you spend your stats will depend on your playstyle, but it is important to remember that Melee increases your energy, while Defense increases your health. Then, later, when you unlock different Blox Fruits, the Blox Fruit stat will increase each Fruit’s damage.Best Blox Fruits For LevelingEarly in the game, the best Blox Fruit for leveling up is the Buddha. If you can get your hands on it, this Legendary-tier Fruit transforms the user into a golden, glowing, giant.This transformation crucially negates a huge chunk of incoming damage, meaning you can tank some big hits. But it also extends your hit box, making it easier for you to mow enemies down. Alongside this, it also has several AoE-focused special attacks, making it easy for you to hit multiple foes at once and spread out your damage. This is fantastic for farming smaller enemies when you want to grind XP, and also helps you to take on some of the tougher early bosses in the game. If you do pick up the Buddha early, it is also wise to power up your Melee stat to boost its power, and the defensive capabilities of the Buddha mean you can worry less about the Defense stat.However, at a whopping $1,200,000, or 1,650 Robux, you may not be able to pick up the Buddha for a little while. In the meantime, some other picks like Flame or Light can offer a huge help at the start of your Blox Fruit journey. Both Flame and Light have great damage stats, but Light also has some fantastic mobility to help you find those first few islands.Best Blox Fruits Fighting Style For Leveling UpAt the beginning of Blox Fruits, it's best to focus on either the Melee or Sword fighting style to just help you quickly grind through the early enemy NPCs you‘ll find scattered around the seas. While there are many better fighting styles later on, Sword and Melee are really effective for just spamming enemies and growing those early levels.Best Tips For Leveling Up In Blox FruitsHow you choose to grind through Blox Fruits is entirely up to you, and the way you level up will ultimately be defined by your preferred playstyle. However, there are some basic tips that should help people, no matter how they like to play.First of all, be mindful of the accessory you use. While most of the time you should just choose one that you like, or love the design for, when grinding, you should be focusing on boosting your stats to save time. Early items like the Black Cape are great here, which you have a chance of earning by defeating Elite Pirates.One slightly cheesy method folks love to implement has been dubbed the ‘Fountain Method’ as it is particularly useful on the First Sea’s Fountain Island. Upon engaging with certain mobs, if there is a wall nearby, you can simply hop behind the wall and attack from a distance. While enemies have a much lower range behind walls, yours is slightly longer, so you can use this to spam even very tough enemies. Just be careful of your distance!Next, while it can be good to find the toughest enemies you can currently handle when you're grinding, you generally save time grinding islands with more mobs, even if they aren’t quite as strong. This is also very important when using double XP codes, which, while very effective, work better against large amounts of enemies instead of a single high-level mob or boss.Finally, if you are grinding bosses and are getting sick of waiting for them to respawn, many players find it helpful to jump between servers to find one where the boss is available again. This can be fantastic for grinding XP and items from those tough bosses.Best Blox Fruits Locations For Early Leveling UpThere are plenty of great places to grind levels in Blox Fruits, but if you’re just starting out, or bumping up against some difficult enemies, here are some of the best places to grind in the first sea and those essential early levels.1-55 - Grind the bandits on the opening island, then use the Fountain Method on Fountain Island55-90 - Attack the Chef on Pirate Island, and use server hopping to get quicker respawns90-105 - Grind by attacking the Snow Bandit in the Frozen Village105-130 - Attack the Yeti Boss in the Frozen Village, and remember to use server hopping130-220 - Use server hopping to grind the Vice Admiral boss in Marine Fortress220-350 - Grind the bosses in the Prison using server hopping350-435 - Attack the Magma Admiral in the Magma Village and use server hopping to ensure respawns425-500 Attack the Fishman Lord in Underwater City\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nThe Outer Worlds 2 makes the actually important RPG choices more impactful by not having respecing.By \n    James Carr\n   on December 26, 2025 at 6:00AM PST\n              \n                Earth Directorate Commander Ash was sent to settle a labor strike issue on behalf of Auntie's Choice, in an effort to gain favor with the corporate conglomerate. A bit of an outlaw, and someone who excels in shooting, lockpicking, and smooth-talking, I felt like my character was primed to work out a result that was favorable for the workers without too much of an issue.I was able to enter the closed-off facility and even nab some blackmail on the manager in charge before confronting her directly about the labor strike. I conveyed the workers' demands, and expected to be able to convince her to see things my way--after all, I invested a decent amount of points in speech.It quickly became clear that no amount of talking was going to solve this dispute. As far as the manager was concerned, any concessions she might make would prevent the factory from hitting its quota. Someone with engineering or hacking skills may have been able to solve this issue by messing with the equipment in the factory, but my character wasn't built for that. My character was good at three things, and I'd already exhausted the lockpicking and talking options.So Commander Ash solved the problem the only other way she knew how: shooting the manager in the face and telling the striking workers to take it from there. What could easily feel like a failure of the game--not offering me a more diplomatic solution using whatever skills I had invested in--instead felt right, given the story I had built for myself.The limited number of skill points in The Outer Worlds 2 means you can only build up a handful of skills.In prior games in a similar style to The Outer Worlds 2, including the modern Fallout games, Cyberpunk 2077, and the original The Outer Worlds, I always had trouble resonating with the story. I would neglect the role-playing part of the RPG, not out of some refusal to engage with the story on its own terms, but because of the particular way I like to play games. I have a tendency to want to do everything and see everything, without the need to play through multiple times.I would often end up with a hodgepodge of skills, some points to improve combat skills, a few to increase carry weight to deal with my need to pick up everything I find, and a few skills to get me into locked areas. This would always result in me having a character that was good at a bunch of things, but worthless for high-end skill checks. If I had the option to respec, I would cheat my way through, and if it didn't, I would grind for some extra skill points. Sure, I got to see everything in the game, but that often lessened the chances of something different or odd happening.The Outer Worlds 2 doesn't have the option to respec, outside of one opportunity just after the opening sequence. On top of that, leveling isn't particularly fast, and you are only given two skill points to place into a massive list of skills. My particular playstyle would wreck my adventure here, making me lack the skills for interesting interactions and leaving me to suffer the consequences.So, I made a game plan during character creation. I gave my commander an outlaw background, and focused on guns, speech, and lockpicking. I built her like a smooth-talking space cowboy, someone who could get into places via speech or lockpicking and when the time came, shoot her way out. I even managed to spare two points of medicine, although even that small deviation meant I wasn't high enough level for a lockpick in a main quest area I was definitely overleveled for.Not every door can be lockpicked open.For as often as my speech skills could get me out of a jam, they also couldn't. After all, some people just can't be reasoned with. While I got through plenty of doors without issues, I would regularly run into a door that required hacking or another skill I didn't have. But I could always accomplish my goals in one way or another, I just had to make use of the skills I had chosen to invest in.This resulted in an experience with The Outer Worlds 2 where I felt invested in role-playing. Without the option to run away from or fix my decisions in the level-up screen, I had to work with it. I had satisfying experiences convincing low-level lackeys that their bosses didn't care about them, causing them to run rather than fight me. When a villain started lecturing me about the state of the galaxy, it felt right to choose the attack now option. I'd heard enough and was confident in a duel.It feels a bit silly to point out the benefits of role-playing in a genre with role-playing in the name, but respecing has become a crutch for some similar games. Playing Avowed earlier this year, while I felt like I knew who my character was from a personality standpoint, I regularly rebuilt my combat abilities and other skills, sometimes to use a new weapon or to deal with a situation differently.In The Outer Worlds 2, I often had to deal with an outcome that wasn't what I was angling for, because I had to play with skills I chose. The flaws system adds to this too, with my penchant for reloading constantly being something I could lean further into by getting a damage buff, so long as I didn't empty out my magazine.These thoughtful decisions also resonated with my companions, with Niles turning from a once-dedicated and hopeful Earth Directorate agent into an outlaw of his own. I taught him that large organizations will never have your back, and sometimes the only solution to a problem is a bullet, something that he now believes too.So while shooting that factory manager in the face might feel like a simple or unsatisfying solution in an RPG like The Outer Worlds 2, it was exactly what my character would have done in that moment anyway. Instead of trying to wiggle my way out of the consequences of my choices, undermining my own story in the process, I was forced to do exactly what my character was built to do, making something simple feel impactful.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Darryn Bonthuys\n   on December 10, 2025 at 9:35AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                With the festive season in full swing and many people planning to take a well-deserved break, grabbing a few downloads from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog sounds like a grand idea. For December, the subscription service is adding 10 more games to its library, including the day-one release of Skate Story, Assassin's Creed action with an old-school flavor, and a colorful RPG adventure in the skies.Aside from Skate Story, these will all be available starting December 16. See the full list below. In case you missed it, the December free games for PS Plus subscribers--Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White--are also available to claim, so make certain to do so before January 5, 2026.If you're curious to see just how much time you spent playing games this year, you can also check out the 2025 PlayStation Wrap-Up for a breakdown on which games you were focused on.Assassin's Creed Mirage (PS5, PS4)First released in 2023, Assassin's Creed Mirage was billed as a return to the stealth-focused roots of the series. Set in ancient Baghdad, the game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq after he is recruited into the Hidden Ones and joins the fight against the Order of the Ancients.Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (PS5, PS4)Developed by Team Ninja--the studio behind the Nioh games and co-developer of Ninja Gaiden 4--Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty is a fast-paced action game with parry-based combat that'll appeal to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice fans. Set during China's Three Kingdoms period of history, the game puts a dark fantasy and souls-like spin on this era of Chinese history. Skate Story (PS5)A day-one release, Skate Story puts you in control of a demon who makes a deal with the devil to swallow the moon. As if that didn't sound challenging enough, your demonic avatar also happens to be constructed from glass and pain, so any fumble is going to hurt really badly. Not only do you have to master your skateboard, but you also have to use it to overcome other demons, save tormented souls with your sick tricks, and discover the secrets of hell without taking a tumble. Granblue Fantasy: Relink (PS5, PS4)As the captain of a skyfaring crew, you've got free rein to explore the floating archipelago of the Sky Realm in Granblue Fantasy: Relink and find the legendary island of Estalucia. That's easier said than done, as between enemy gangs and a growing plot in the background that threatens the entire Sky Realm, you'll have your work cut out for you in this fantasy game.Planet Coaster 2 (PS5)Looking to become a theme park master? Then you'll want to grab a download of Planet Coaster 2 and start building some attention-grabbing rides. Building on the foundation set by its predecessor, Planet Coaster 2 offers more tools and resources to not only construct exciting water rides and coasters, but also the facilities to keep your park guests happy when they've got their feet firmly planted on the ground. Cat Quest 3 (PS5, PS4)The Cat Quest games are delightful adventures full of terrific puns, and Cat Quest 3 doesn't disappoint. An open-world action-RPG set in a fantastical pirate-themed world known as the Purribean, the threequel sees players search for a long-lost mythical treasure and battle Pi-rats on the high seas. The game is also playable in solo or co-op modes.Lego Horizon Adventures (PS5)We've seen Aloy's debut adventure on PS4 and remastered for PS5, but the Lego version puts a lighthearted spin on a familiar tale. Set in a world where humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain following a robot uprising, Lego Horizon Adventures follows Aloy as she sets out to prove herself and discover the lost secrets of the planet. You can hunt machines as Aloy, or you can play as her allies Varl, Teersa, and Erend in this colorful Lego game. Paw Patrol: Grand Prix (PS5, PS4)For the younger members of the family, you can boot up not one but two Paw Patrol games for them. The first one is a kart-racer featuring the gang, as they compete to win the Pup Cup. Paw Patrol World (PS5, PS4)The second Paw Patrol game is an action-adventure where you can play as the pups. Just like the animated series, you can drive their signature vehicles, engage in rescue missions, and explore Adventure Bay to help out citizens in need. Soulcalibur 3 (PS5, PS4)PlayStation Plus Premium subscription requiredThe timeless tale of swords and souls is back, as Soulcalibur 3 joins the classics library this month. Originally released in 2005 for PS2, Soulcalibur 3 on PS5 and PS4 has been upgraded with enhanced visuals, quick-save and rewind functionality, and custom video filters.     \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Come gather around The Ghoul Log, a festive video that the Fallout TV show has created in the lead-up to Season 2. Starting with The Ghoul (Walton Goggins), this holiday special features Dogmeat and shows a human arm--\"specifically, a fat man's\"--burning in a fireplace for roughly an hour and a half.On YouTube, Prime Video released the officially titled Fallout: The Ghoul Log, which can be seen below. The Ghoul makes a couple of revelations about the wasteland early on. First up, he says, \"Well, this ain't no Whoville,\" implying The Grinch is part of that universe. Funnily enough, Goggins portrays The Grinch in a Walmart ad campaign this holiday season. And sadly, The Ghoul notes that Santa Claus doesn't exist in the wasteland.          Regardless, the video can help fill in the time until Fallout Season 2 premieres next week on December 18. Prime Video will drop episodes weekly through February--a major shift for Fallout. The first season saw all episodes arrive at once on the streaming platform. Speaking of that, you can watch Season 1 for free on Samsung TV PlusLooking ahead, Lucy (Ella Purnell) will continue to have her poop finger in Fallout Season 2. In addition, the creative team behind the TV series are planning to start shooting Fallout Season 3 in Summer 2026. The hope is to get the show back on the air as quickly as possible.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Three-time Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro has revealed some of his favorite video games, including BioShock, Death Stranding, Red Dead Redemption, and God of War, among others.Appearing on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, del Toro said Sony's God of War series had some of the \"best cinematic experiences\" he's ever witnessed.\"When [Kratos] fights Odin [in God of War Ragnarok] and Odin keeps coming back and he looks like a Peaky Blinders brawler. He beats the crap out of Kratos. What a great video game. And the way they use the budget of data on the console to create atmospheric dispersion and light. That is lit like a film,\" he said.The filmmaker went on to say BioShock is the \"most immersive\" game he's played, while he singled out Death Stranding (a game he is featured in) as another one of his faves. The game with the best universe is Metal Gear Solid, he added.Some of his other favorite games include Left 4 Dead and \"big sandbox games\" like Red Dead Redemption. He also called out Shadow of the Colossus and labeled it a \"masterpiece\" that is \"poetic and tragic.\"Del Toro himself was for a period of time working on a game called Insane that he was making alongside Saints Row studio Volition until THQ canceled the project. He aimed for it to become a trilogy, and after it was canceled, the director said he was not giving up on it and looking to find another way to bring it to market. That never happened, however.At The Game Awards in 2021, del Toro seemingly hinted at a Silent Hill project, but he later clarified that he was only trying to \"tickle the ribs of Konami\" after the publisher shut down his Silent Hills project. AKA P.T.Following the cancellations of Insane and Silent Hills, del Toro said he gave up on trying to make a video game. \"I have proven to be the albatross of video games,\" he said.\"I have decided, in order not to destroy anyone else's life, I will never again get involved in video games. Otherwise, I'll join someone and his house will explode, or something,\" the filmmaker explained.Del Toro is known for making scary and unsettling films, including Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, and Nightmare Alley. He won two Oscars for The Shape of Water and one of Pinocchio. His newest movie, Frankenstein: The Anatomy Lesson, stars Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, and Mia Goth, and is streaming now on Netflix and playing in select theaters.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

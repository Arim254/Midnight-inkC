    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Unlike many other multiplayer first-person shooters on the market, the Battlefield franchise hasn't always been keen to allow players to check their stats through the game's menus. However, that has changed with Battlefield 6, as EA has given players an extremely quick and easy to view the most pertinent stats on their account. Below, you can see exactly how to check your stats in Battlefield 6 right from the main menu of the game. How to view player stats in Battlefield 6During the multiplayer beta in Battlefield 6, the only way you could check your stats was by going to a website, typing in your EA account name, and then seeing the stats that were tracked. Fortunately, EA has completely removed this and instead streamlined the process of checking stats. When you load into Battlefield 6, all you have to do to view your stats is follow the steps below: Scroll over to the \"Profile\" tab on the bar at the top of the screen in the main lobby screenFrom here, you can see your stats near the top-left of the screenYour stats include the number of kills you have recorded, your total career score, your kill/death ratio, and how many revives you've pulled offIf you look at the bottom-right of the Profile page, you'll also see your most played game modes and your career best stats, which include your most number of kills in a match and other match-specific records Currently, those are the only stats you can see in Battlefield 6, and there's no additional menu to click on to bring up more detailed statsThe Profile page in Battlefield 6While the stats page is certainly bare right now in Battlefield 6, at least we can see the most important stats on our accounts. Also on the Profile page in Battlefield 6, you can see your Top Badges, which are awarded to you by ranking up weapons, classes, and vehicles. Below your Top Badges, you can see your Playercard. This is viewable by enemies and teammates while in a match, and you unlock more customization options to equip on your Playercard as you play Battlefield 6 and complete challenges. You can edit your Playercard by clicking on the \"Edit\" button at the bottom of the page. The Playercard section of Battlefield 6And that does it for all the stats you can check in Battlefield 6. Perhaps EA will expand the stats section of the game in the future, but that's all that is available at the launch of the game. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Pokemon Go is celebrating the arrival of fall with the Harvest Festival event from October 10-16. Fall-themed Pokemon like Miltank, Smoliv, and Combee will be appearing more frequently over the next few days, but most exciting is the arrival of two new Pokemon: Dipplin and its evolved form, Hydrapple.Dipplin is another alternate evolution of Applin, originally introduced as part of the Teal Mask DLC for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Like Applin's other evolved forms, however, you'll need to collect a new type of item--Syrupy Apples--before you can get one, and they're a little difficult to get your hands on. Here are some tips to help you get Dipplin and Hydrapple in Pokemon Go.How To Get DipplinThe easiest way to obtain Dipplin is to evolve one from Applin, but you'll need to collect quite a few items first. Specifically, you need 200 Applin Candy and 20 Syrupy Apples to trigger the evolution.Syrupy Apples are a new type of item introduced as part of the Harvest Festival event, and they can be found at PokeStops. Once you've collected the requisite items, you can evolve Applin into Dipplin right from the Pokemon's detail page.How To Get Syrupy ApplesLike Sweet Apples and Tart Apples (which are required to evolve Applin into Appletun or Flapple, respectively), the primary way to obtain Syrupy Apples is at PokeStops. Set a Mossy Lure Module at one of these waypoints, and apples will periodically appear on the map while the module is active.Once you see an apple, simply tap on the item to collect it. However, not every apple can be picked up; sometimes tapping on one will trigger an encounter with a wild Pokemon, so you'll need patience and persistence while trying to collect them.How To Evolve Dipplin Into HydrappleYou won't need any more Syrupy Apples to get a Hydrapple, but you will need to have a lot of candy saved up. It costs 400 Applin candy to evolve Dipplin into Hydrapple. On top of that, you must catch seven dragon-type Pokemon while Dipplin is set as your buddy before you can trigger the evolution, adding a further complication to the process.It typically takes quite a long time to collect 400 candy, but there are a few ways to expedite the process. Since Applin is appearing more frequently during the Harvest Festival event, make sure to use a Pinap Berry before catching the Pokemon to increase the amount of candy you get as a reward. You can also convert any Rare Candy you have stocked up into Applin candy, which will help you reach the 400 requirement faster.Can Dipplin And Hydrapple Be Shiny?Since shiny Applin has not yet been added to Pokemon Go, you can't yet get a shiny Dipplin or Hydrapple in the mobile game. There's no indication when shiny Applin will make its Pokemon Go debut, but new shiny Pokemon are typically introduced during special events, so it'll likely arrive as part of some future event.The Harvest Festival is underway until October 16, but there are plenty of other events still in store for this month, including a Pokemon Legends: Z-A crossover and the annual Halloween celebration. You can read more about everything happening over the next few weeks in our Pokemon Go October events guide.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

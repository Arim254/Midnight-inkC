Players can purchase the battle pass to unlock Homer and Stupid Sexy Flanders skins (among other cosmetics and items), but you don't have to spend anything extra to unlock a free glider based on Springfield's most famous aliens if you meet a few requirements.As part of the collaboration, Epic and Disney are offering up the Kang and Kodos glider for people who link their MyDisney and Epic accounts by the end of February 2026. If you have Disney+, that will be the same MyDisney account for most cases. Here's how it works:How to link MyDisney and Epic Games accounts:Go to your Epic Games accountClick \"Linked Accounts\"Click the link under \"MyDisney\"Follow the prompts to link your MyDisney and Epic Games accountsThe Kang and Kodos glider. In a FAQ, Epic explained that account-linking is not supported in all regions, so it simply might not be possible where you live, unfortunately. Another thing to note is that only one MyDisney account can be linked to an Epic Games account.Epic Games also clarified that, although the only way to get the Kang and Kodos glider right now is by linking accounts, the developer may offer it for real-money purchase starting in March 2026 at the earliest.The Simpsons are taking over Fortnite for a month, and right now you can dive into a new map with various Springfield landmarks, including Moe's Tavern and the nuclear power plant where Homer works.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

In weeks prior, Street stated NetEase had pulled funding from the studio but had allowed it time to seek out a new publisher or raise funding for their fledgling MMORPG, project Ghost.Those efforts have not panned out. Street said \"there is still a chance\" the studio could secure needed funding and live on, but that it will also depend on how much of the current team will choose to remain should that happen.\"While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there,\" Street said.Fantastic Pixel Castle had recently hosted a number of content creators to stream a first public look at project Ghost gameplay. The game was still in its early stages, with Fantastic Pixel Castle having been fairly transparent about its development process.          The studio believed recent MMOs have put too much of a focus on solo adventuring and sought to emphasize playing with friends and building an online community, according to the studio's website. As for how Ghost would have played, it was a class-based MMORPG that was divided into two different experiences called Red and Blue Shards. Blue Shard areas would have played more like a survival game, where friends could party up to gather resources, build bases, and adventure together. Red Shards featured more classic MMORPG experiences, where large groups of players could team together to fight world bosses or impact the game's world in permanent ways.Before forming Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street served at Blizzard as a lead systems designer on WoW for nearly six years, later joining Riot Games. There he held a number of different roles, the last of which was overseeing Riot's first MMO. He left Riot in 2023, and about a year later Riot announced it was hitting reset on its League of Legends MMO, going back to the drawing board after several years of development.Fantastic Pixel Castle's closure is just the latest in a long line of layoffs and studio shutterings in 2025, including major layoffs at Xbox. Early this year, NetEase made headlines when it laid off Marvel Rivals US-based development team despite the game's huge success. A report at the time indicated the Chinese-gaming giant was looking to scale back its overseas game business due to \"geopolitical risks\" and a \"recalibration of its global strategy.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                One of the recurring themes from a vocal segment of Battlefield 6 fans before and after launch was a desire to see the game free of Call of Duty-style ridiculous skins. The dev team responded by telling fans that Battlefield 6 would be \"a gritty, realistic shooter.\" But after releasing the recent \"Wicked Grin\" skin, Battlefield Studios has quietly removed the light blue outfit from the lineup.Much like an apparent orange skin and an earlier leaked skin, the response to the \"Wicked Grin\" outfit was largely swift and negative.\"[What do you mean?] That is classic naval camouflage, because of all that water. Just find a fountain and you are golden,\" wrote one Reddit user. \"LMAO this is not grounded and horrible looking,\" added another fan. \"Doesn't even look cool. What a mess.\"After the response from players, Battlefield Studios re-released this outfit in more conventional military uniform colors and left the light blue shades behind. Battlefield 6 recently received a number of new cosmetics in the Season 1 battle pass.EA recently announced a new mode, Casual Breakthrough, which will let Battlefield 6 players earn Career XP, Weapon XP and Battle Pass XP, while also accruing points towards challenges. This mode will only feature 16 real players in each lobby, with 32 bots to fill out the matches. A new DLC map, Blackwell Fields, has drawn scorn from players for being a \"sniper fest.\"One aspect that seems to be well-received so far is the game's free-to-play battle royale mode, Battlefield Redsec. For new and veteran players, GameSpot has put together seven Redsec tips that you need to know before diving into the game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

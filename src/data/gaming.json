    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Bungie's long in development extraction shooter, Marathon, will launch on March 5, a new gameplay trailer has revealed ahead of preorders opening. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC and cost $40.The trailer introduces players again to Tau Ceti IV, a colony that you, playing as runners, will infiltrate to dispatch armed forces and extract with valuable gear. You'll make use of a variety of Runner Shells that give you different abilities and perks, defining your role in a party or giving you a choice over how to build if you're planning to play solo. The art style remains as striking as ever, with Bungie's signature gunplay being showcased in the action below.          Marathon was initially scheduled to launch on September 23, 2025 before being indefinitely delayed following a series of public tests that drew criticisms over the game's mechanics. Bungie noted key areas that it planned to improve with more development time, namely the game's survival elements, its lore and world building, and better social experiences for solo and duos players.Sony, who will publish Marathon, assured fans that the game would release before the end of March 2026, with Bungie also confirming that a public beta will take place later in February ahead of launch. Development of Marathon has been rife with controversy, with Bungie eventually settling matters with an artist that accused it of stealing assets for the shooter without permission.Since its delay, Arc Raiders has taken the extraction shooter genre by storm, amassing hundreds of thousands of concurrent players and sustaining that in the months since release.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

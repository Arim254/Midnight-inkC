    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Over 140 ROMs from Sega's long defunct Sega Channel, including service-exclusive games that were thought lost to time and never-before-published prototypes, have now been recovered thanks to the latest efforts of the Video Game History Foundation.Sega Channel launched in 1994 and was one of the first subscription-based, digital game services, beaming new games and content directly to players' consoles through a television cable. The service shut down in 1998, and since then many of the exclusive games and content available on the service were thought to be gone forever.          That is, until the Video Game History Foundation embarked on a quest to see the channel's unique history, and its content, preserved. Alongside former Sega Channel VP of programming Michael Shorrock and a passionate Sega fan who had acquired a collection of Sega Channel backup tapes, VGHF sought to tell the full story of the Sega Channel.The result is 144 new ROMs that have been preserved, a new VGHF digital library collection that includes Shorrock's personal notes and presentations shedding light on the service (and an unannounced successor service called Express Games), and a documentary, Don't Just Watch TV: The Secrets of Sega Channel, which can be viewed on YouTube.As part of its efforts, VGHF acquired a collection of ROMs that included some rare prototypes and games, including a never-before-seen Sega Genesis web browser and previously undumped game variants of Sega Channel-exclusive games, like Garfield: Caught in the Act - The Lost Levels and The Flintstones. According to VGHF, both games originated as abandoned projects that were then repurposed into exclusive Sega Channel content.Also included in the files are previously unpreserved Sega Channel versions of games like Super Street Fighter II, which saw content removed in order to fit within Sega Channel's file-size limit. Other games on the service that were linear in nature were essentially split down the middle to fit within the file-size limit, with users needing a password to access the second half of the game. These split versions, as well as various \"test drive\" versions of games like Earthworm Jim and The Lost World: Jurassic Park that allowed Sega Channel players to play before their official release, have also been preserved.\"With a few exceptions, this recovery project has accounted for almost all outstanding Sega Channel games,\" the VGHF states in its findings. \"We believe this also means there are now digital backup copies of every unique Sega Genesis game released in the United States.\"The project to preserve Sega Channel is just one of VGHF's success stories this year, with the foundation previously announcing the launch of a free-to-access digital resource library for historians, researchers, and fans that includes more than 30,000 files from across 50 years of video game history. In August, the VGHF announced it had acquired the rights to publish a digital archive for the entirity of Computer Entertainer, one of the first video game magazines.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is receiving a major free update on December 16--one that adds new story content and even a new weapon to developer GSC Game World's open-world shooter.As detailed in a new PlayStation Blog post, the Stories Untold content update will see players head to the western part of the Chornobyl Anomalous Zone after picking up an emergency transmission. The new area will feature seven new locations, six new characters, and several hours of new content, GSC Game World said.          GSC Game World said players will want to pay \"close attention\" to the Red Forest region on the map, and from there use their intuition and rationality to see how deep this particular irradiated rabbit hole goes. Other points of interest in the Red Forest GSC Game World said will be worth players' time are the Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp and the Old Mine.Stalker 2 already sports over 30 weapons, but players will get one more to play with come the update in the form of the GP37V2 rifle, a weapon tailored for \"tactically proficient players.\" The weapon isn't full auto, but can be fired in bursts or in single shots and comes pre-equipped with a suppressor and low-magnification scope.\"The cost of failure is higher, but in the hands of a skilled operator, the GP37V2 can reward you with its precision and power,\" GSC Game World said.Other additions in the update include a new hub in the Burnt Forest area where players will find NPCs and be able to stash items. Existing locations will now be re-inhabited with other Stalkers as well.Earlier this year, GameSpot traveled to GSC Game World's new office in Prague to talk to the Ukrainian development team about Stalker 2's harrowing development admist Russia's invasion of their country and how an office fire threw another wrench into its plans.Stalker 2 sold 1 million copies shortly after launch in November 2024 despite also launching as a day-one Game Pass title, and went on to become on of GameSpot's 10 best games of 2024. In the months following its release, GSC Game World worked to address bugs and implement other changes, with an update in March bringing more than 1,200 changes that touched nearly every aspect of the game, from combat to performance. It launched for PS5 on November 20, 2025, optimized for PS5 Pro.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Epic Games loves collaborating with anime series for Fortnite, and it's no mystery why to anybody who's been constantly battling Gokus, Narutos, Gojos and All Mights in Battle Royale for years. Anime skins are clearly popular, so it makes sense that more are coming. Next up is Bleach, the beloved show that began in the 2004, and which is currently running a revival series to finish telling the manga's story, called Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War.This first collaboration with Bleach will, according to posters that have been spotted in the wild, include four skins: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Uryu Ishida. And presumably at least one gigantic sword.We have no further details about the collab, which has only been teased by Epic rather than fully revealed. But since this collab will be released during the holidays and Fortnite's Winterfest event, there's a decent chance there will be some kind of Bleach component added to Battle Royale, Blitz Royale, or Reload, since Fortnite has included tons of mythic weapons and powers based on anime series in the past--particularly at the end of the year.With Winterfest, which begins Thursday, annually offering two or more free skins to all players, it's possible one of the Bleach skins will be free. There haven't been any real rumors about what the free Winterfest skins will be, but with collabs with Harry Potter, Home Alone, and South Park also expected soon, plus leaks about new winter-themed versions of Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter, there are too many possibilities to make an educated guess.Bleach will be Fortnite's fourth new anime collab for 2025, after Kaiju No. 9 in January, Cowboy Bebop in February, and One-Punch Man in August. We also got a wave of Jujutsu Kaisen villains in February.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

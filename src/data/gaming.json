    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.\"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,\" said Roh via Reuters. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be \"inevitable.\"The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing \"This Is an Xbox\" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.The lone bright spot from Roh's comments is that he mentioned that Samsung is working with its production partners on strategies to minimize the impact of the memory shortages.A recent report suggests that Nvidia may take a different approach to the increasingly high GPU prices by resurrecting its previously discontinued GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs. That has yet to be confirmed by Nvidia, which phased out the GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs in favor of the 40 and 50 series GPUs, both of which were more expensive and more advanced.As for Samsung, the company touted its plans to use Google's Gemini AI in 800 million units this year, which will continue the need for RAM across its family of products.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Sometimes, I feel like writing the same article four times could be considered a bit of a meme. But then I remember that this is a pretty phenomenal achievement for any streamer, let alone an AI VTuber. First Neuro-sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record ... then it happened again. And again. This time around, her \"sister\" Evil Neuro, who has her own distinctive voice, model, and attitude, led the calls to beat the Hype Train record for a fourth time. In the process, she also helped her creator Vedal987 become the third-most-subscribed Twitch channel of all time.After becoming the third most-subscribed channel, Vedal joined Evil on stream to ask his community to \"Give it a rest.\" He added, \"In all seriousness chat, you have given me and the twins more than we need, so it's okay.\" Evil wasn't happy with this though, retorting, \"No Vedal! Please can we raise the timer, just a little bit? Don't you think it's a bit cruel to just cut it off here?\" Evil was referring to the timer that's currently running for Neuro's third birthday subathon, where each subscription gifted to the channel adds time to a countdown clock that determines when the stream will end. It has been running since December 19, 2025, and has around 22 hours left at the time of writing.          Regardless, shortly afterwards the Hype Train did come to an end at level 72--although not a fourth world record, it's still a hugely impressive achievement, and leaves Vedal's Twitch channel with more than 328,900 subscribers. It's hard to nail down an exact figure, since that number continues to rise as the community attempts to extend the subathon. What that does mean, however, is that Vedal, Neuro, and Evil have overtaken streamer Jasontheween and fellow VTuber Ironmouse's positions as the third and fourth most-subscribed channels on Twitch. The only two channels that have ever beaten that achievement are Evelone2004, with 459,924 subscribers, and KaiCenat with 1,112,947 subscribers.If you're unfamiliar with Neuro-sama and Evil, they are twin VTubers that utilize a large language model to communicate with their creator Vedal987's Twitch chat and play games. Neuro was originally created to play the rhythm game OSU, but evolved quickly to become a series of AI systems that work in tandem thanks to the knowledge of programmer Vedal. By taking an input from Twitch and from voice, giving that input to the LLM, and converting it via a text-to-speech system, the twins can interact with their viewers. If you're interested in learning more, I'd really recommend the explainer video by Creative Every Day on YouTube.With under one full day remaining of the subathon, it seems there are not many more Twitch records for the trio to achieve. But with a community as dedicated as theirs, who knows what comes next?\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Electronic Arts' $55 billion deal to sell itself to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake still has to receive regulatory approval before it's finalized. However, some Sims fans and creators have been concerned about how Saudi Arabi's potential control over the company will affect the inclusive nature of the experience. To alleviate those concerns, the developers behind The Sims franchise wants players to know their core values haven't been changed by this deal.\"The values of The Sims are unchanged,\" reads the statement on the franchise's official page. \"Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future.\"Given Saudi Arabi's history of human rights abuses, the worried reactions from The Sims community appear to be understandable. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have both raised their concerns about \"foreign influence\" on EA if the deal goes through. Subsequently, EA has asserted that it will retain creative control of the company following the sale.The Sims team's statement also reaffirmed its commitment \"to single-player life simulation experiences\" while teasing upcoming Sims experiences for PC, consoles, and mobile games. Playtesting for those experiences is expected to begin this year. The team also stated that, \"Project Rene has evolved into a social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game,\" and it's not intended to be a successor to The Sims 4. Instead, it's described as \"a new way to explore and play together within the growing Sims family of games, welcoming Simmers who want to connect directly with other players.\"Last year, EA said that it's sold too much DLC for The Sims 4 to even consider moving on to The Sims 5. The franchise also has a Sims movie in development, which is being produced by Margot Robbie's Lucky Chap production studio.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

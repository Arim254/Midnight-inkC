    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on November 27, 2025 at 6:05AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                When it comes to type popularity in Pokémon, Fire is always one of, if not the most popular, types in the community. Whether players love the Fire type starters, the classic Fire types from the early generations, or the new additions that come with every main line game, you can always bet on most players having a Fire type on their team. However, with so many great Fire Pokémon to choose from, which are considered the best in the franchise?Today, we'll be ranking our picks for the best Fire Pokémon to use during a basic playthrough of the main line games. This means that we'll be excluding legendaries, mythicals, and Ultra Beasts from the list; otherwise, they would dominate most of the entries. We'll also be taking into account unique dual typings, where Fire Pokémon originated from, and the abilities they have, among other factors.This list is in rank order from least to most recommended Fire types, but all are solid choices.TalonflameOriginal game: X and YType: Fire and FlyingTalonflame kicks off our list, and it's hard not to have a soft spot for this fiery bird. Its first-stage evolution, Fletchling, is one of the first Pokémon you encounter in the Kalos region, and it can carry you through a majority of X and Y. While Talonflame doesn't have the best base stat total, coming in at 499, it's hugely enjoyable to use, has a decent move pool, and has tremendous speed that comes in handy during any playthrough.ChandelureOriginal game: Black and WhiteType: Fire and GhostNext up is Chandelure, which was the first Fire/Ghost dual type in all of Pokémon when it was introduced in Black and White. Thanks to its Ghost typing, Chandelure has access to moves that most Fire types can never learn. Chandelure also has a massive 145 special attack stat, with a 520 base stat total, which makes it hugely powerful with the right attacks. However, Chandelure does have low HP, so it's a bit of a glass cannon. Regardless of that, though, this is a fantastic and unique Fire type Pokémon.HoundoomOriginal game: Gold and SilverType: Fire and DarkHoundoom is a beloved Generation 2 Pokémon that was the first-ever Fire/Dark dual type in the franchise. It only has a 500 base stat total, but those stats are relatively balanced, allowing Houndoom to excel in a majority of situations. The Dark typing was very powerful in the Gen 2 games thanks to how strong Psychic types were, but Houndoom is a terrific Pokémon no matter what generation you're playing. Of course, if you're playing a game with Mega Evolution, Houndoom has an outstanding Mega form with a 600 base stat total and some devastating moves.Hisuian TyphlosionOriginal game: Pokémon Legends: ArceusType: Fire and GhostWe just talked about Chandelure, the first Fire/Ghost dual type, but now let's cover Hisuian Typhlosion. Cyndaquil is one of the three starter choices in Legends: Arceus, and if you evolve it, you'll gain access to the Hisuian form of Typlosion, which gets the Ghost type at level 36. It has the same base stat total as regular Typhlosion, but its move pool significantly changes. You'll have to deal with a few new weaknesses, but this is a much-improved version over the original Typhlosion. Of course, Gen 2's Typhlosion is pretty strong as well.MagmortarOriginal game: PlatinumType: FireMagmortar was one of the Pokémon that was added in the Platinum Pokédex as a new stage evolution to Magmar. This significantly buffed the Magby line, as Magmortar is a beast of a Pokémon that features a 540 base stat total and an extremely wide move pool in Generation 4 and onward. Magmortar can learn Grass, Electric, Rock, Ground, and Dark type moves, giving it fantastic coverage against all of the weaknesses for a pure Fire typeArmarouge/CeruledgeOriginal game: Scarlet and VioletType: Fire and Psychic/GhostArmarouge and Ceruledge are some of the most unique Pokémon in the entire franchise. You can evolve either one from a Charcadet if you use a specific evolution method involving using a specific kind of armor item. Both Pokémon have the same base stat total, but Armarouge is more of a special attacker while Ceruledge is a tad faster and has better base attack. For a playthrough of Scarlet and Violet, Armarouge is usually going to serve you better thanks to the advantages its Psychic type offers with its high special attack stat, but you can't go wrong with either of the Pokémon.CinderaceOriginal game: Sword and ShieldType: FireCinderace is yet another Fire starter Pokémon, this time from Sword and Shield, and while we could have put Blaziken, Infernape, or Emboar in this spot, Cinderace gets the nod thanks to its prowess in the competitive scene as well as being very useful for a Galar playthrough. While there's a common misconception that Cinderace has the Fighting dual typing, it's a pure Fire type that can simply learn a handful of Fighting moves. Cinderace's biggest strength is its speed, boasting a 119 stat, but it also has great physical attack and passable defense. It's arguably the best starter in Galar, and one of the strongest starters we've had in recent games.ArcanineOriginal game: Red and BlueType: FireArcanine was many Pokémon fans' first love when it comes to the Fire type. It was originally thought that Arcanine was a legendary Pokémon, and there's even evidence that it was supposed to be one, but instead, it's just a stupidly strong regular Pokémon that can be found fairly early on in a Kanto playthrough. Arcanine has a massive 550 base stat total, access to a slew of coverage moves in later generations, and balanced stats across the board.VolcaronaOriginal game: Black and WhiteType: Fire and BugOn the surface, the Fire/Bug dual typing doesn't seem like it would work. There's an extra weakness to Flying, it's four times weak to Rock, and the two types just don't appear like they would mesh well together. However, when Volcarona came onto the scene in Generation 5, all of those preconceptions were tossed out the window. Volcarona is a borderline legendary Pokémon, evolving from Larvesta at level 59, and has amazing special attack, special defense, and speed stats. This makes it nearly unstoppable with the right move combination and opponent.CharizardOriginal game: Red and BlueType: Fire and FlyingWas there really any other choice? While Charizard might not even technically be the most optimal starter choice in Red and Blue (thanks to Venusaur), all of the attention it’s received since those games makes it easily the best Fire type in any Pokémon game. You have access to Charizard's base form, which has a 534 base stat total, along with Mega Charizard X and Y. Mega Charizard X is by far the more popular of the two, as it turns the Pokémon into a blue beast with the Fire/Dragon dual typing. That dual type is extremely rare, and it makes most battles in games with Mega Evolution trivial at best. Charizard is the most popular Fire type and, by all accounts, the best option to use.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Grow A Garden cooking event has long since passed, and as such, it’s actually quite difficult to work out what the proper recipe is to make a salad. That is because some unexplained mechanics may be the cause of your culinary endeavors going awry. If you’ve come across recipes recently to make salads and not had any success, then fear not, as we’ll explain what’s going on here.Of course, to make these salads, you’re going to need to cultivate specific Grow A Garden seeds and harvest their fruit. These food items, as explained in our Grow A Garden Beginner’s Guide, are handy for leveling up your friendship with the shopkeepers, getting exclusive items in return. You’ll want to exploit Grow A Garden mutations to get the most friendship points possible from your creations. Below is everything you need to know about getting a cooking pot and making a salad in Grow A Garden.You can make recipes with Cooking Pots to make food that you can give to pets or NPCs.How to get a cooking pot in Grow A GardenThere are two ways to get a cooking pot in Grow A Garden. The easiest way is to save up 1,000,000 Sheckles and buy it from the Cosmetics shop when available. However, there’s a far cheaper way to get this item by completing all the Common Achievements track in the guidebook. This requires you to complete five tasks:Shovel 100 plantsHarvest 200 carrotsGift 1 carrotSell 500 strawberriesGift 5 strawberriesNone of these are difficult to finish, as the gifting tasks need you to hold the item and interact with a player to gift the plant to them. As for the shoveling plants, just buy 100 carrots as they’re the cheapest plant. Selling 500 strawberries might take a while, but it’s easily doable if you have a bunch of plants growing this common fruit at once.Recipes are displayed in the Guide Book with a Grow A Garden salad recipesA lot of changes have happened since the cooking-based Grow A Garden event a few months ago, and this includes many of the old recipes from those weeks no longer working. Instead, the salad recipe comprises a handful of components that you need to fill with each fruit. Those components can’t be the same for both sides, so two tomatoes will not make a salad; they instead make a smoothie. The recipe that worked for us was taking a Bamboo and a Pepper and putting them in the cooking pot to make a salad.The other thing is that, once you discover the recipe, it’ll appear in your in-game guidebook. However, the ingredients it lists will be ones you’ve got in your garden or have grown in the past. That means that there are likely plenty more out there not on this list. The recipes in the book are also guidelines rather than actual recipes, as combining Bamboo and Corn also makes a Smoothie in our time of testing. This is possibly because Corn counts as a fruit. Our suggestion is to add the components in the order displayed (Leafy, then Vegetable).Here are all the Grow A Garden salad ingredients we know of so far:LeafyVegetableTomatoBambooPineappleGreat PumpkinEvo Beetroot IIIRomanescoMandrakePumpkinPepperBroccoliEvo Pumpkin IIICornEvo Beetroot IIEvo Pumpkin IEvo Pumpkin IIBeanstalkJack O LanternEmerald BudParsleyTurnipEvo Beetroot IVCarnival PumpkinTomatoCarrotEvo Beetroot I\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

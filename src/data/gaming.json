While you can still use weapons from the last few years, the most powerful options are going to be the new Black Ops 7 guns. In this guide, we'll provide some recommended weapon builds for Warzone in Season 1 of Black Ops 7.Season 1 removes the Wildcard perks from Black Ops 6, and instead, you'll have Overkill by default. This means you can equip a second primary weapon without the need to select any specific perks to your loadouts. This also means there's no Gunfighter Wildcard, so you are limited to five attachments for each weapon build.The Gunsmith is mostly the same this year; however, one new addition is Black Ops 7's weapon build code feature. Weapon build codes are unique to each weapon and a specific set of attachments, making it easy to share and receive custom weapon builds.Simply hit L3 to view your options while you are in the Gunsmith. This will let you import a weapon build code to use. Additionally, any weapon builds you create in the Gunsmith will have a code generated at the bottom-left corner of your screen.We'll list the attachments for each build and include the unique weapon code so you can easily use it.Season 1 of Black Ops 7 overhauls Warzone's perk selection. Make sure to check out our guide for all Warzone perks for BO7, including some recommended perks to try for your loadouts.All our recommended Warzone loadouts can be viewed below, and we also have suggested multiplayer loadouts.MXR-17The MXR-17 is a powerful and easy-to-use assault rifle for long-range fights in Warzone. The recommended attachments will boost the gun's damage range, bullet velocity, and increase ammo count.The Greaves AccuSpot 3X is a great optic for most long-range builds, but if you're playing small map Resurgence and don't want the bigger scope, you can swap this out for something simple and clean like the Lethal Tools ELO.Recommended MXR-17 attachments:Optic: Greaves AccuSpot 3XMuzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: 17\" Greaves Scourge BarrelMagazine: Rhodes Drum MagStock: Winch StockBuild code: A03-26ERW-58T9U-11MK.78The MK.78 light machine gun is a heavy-hitting, long-range option for Warzone. The recommended attachments will help you reduce the gun's recoil, making this much more manageable to use at range.The recommended magazine is a Prestige attachment, so you might not have this unlocked yet, but it's a very impactful attachment for improving mobility and reducing recoil. You can substitute the Gravepack Extended Belt if needed to simply boost the ammo count until you unlock it.Recommended MK.78 attachments:Optic: Greaves AccuSpot 3XMuzzle: RL-7.62 CompensatorBarrel: 25\" EAM Heavy BarrelUnderbarrel: Bowen Sentry ForegripMagazine: MFS Heatshield Belt FedBuild code: L01-T49HC-5HZW-1X9 MaverickThe X9 Maverick is a three-round burst assault rifle with high damage, and it can be a powerful choice for long-range fights.

The recommended attachments will boost the ammo count, reduce recoil, and improve movement speed to make this gun work great for close to medium-range fights.Recommended DS20 Mirage attachments:Optic: Lethal Tools ELOMuzzle: Redwell 5.56 CompensatorMagazine: Andean Extended MagStock: Assault Division StockFire Mods: Recoil Sync UnitBuild code: A05-AUXZ3-94Q55-1MPC-25The MPC-25 submachine gun doesn't feel very powerful in multiplayer, but it's a powerful gun with a fast time-to-kill in battle royale. The recommended attachments will help reduce a lot of the weapon's recoil, and it will also boost the ammo count.This recommended build includes an optic for cleaner sights, but if you don't mind the iron sights, it's worth swapping the optic for the 14.5\" VAS Ashe Barrel for an increase to the damage range.Recommended MPC-25 attachments:Optic: Lethal Tools ELOMuzzle: K&S Brake-28Underbarrel: VAS Drift Lock ForegripMagazine: Sustain-25 Extended MagFire Mods: Recoil Sync UnitBuild code: S06-AV4J3-MWE75-1Kogot-7Season 1's new Kogot-7 submachine gun is another solid choice for close-range combat in battle royale.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on December 8, 2025 at 9:11AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Are you wondering about the locations of all Shot Expansions in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond? Samus gains various weapons that have different elemental attributes. The problem is that ammo tends to be limited unless you find pick-ups or rest at a save point. Fortunately, several Shot Expansions are scattered throughout the world of Viewros. Each upgrade grants +10 maximum ammo capacity, while larger variants provide a whopping +20 maximum ammo. These ensure that you have all the tools you need to scorch, freeze, and electrify your foes.Fury Green: Shot Expansions mapThe map above shows the locations of the Metroid Prime 4 Shot Expansions in Fury Green. Although this is the first major region that you visit in the campaign, you won't actually find a single Shot Expansion during your initial trek. Eventually, as you unlock elemental weapons starting with the Fire Shot from the Flare Pool, you'll be able to reach new areas that contain these rewards.Fury Green Shot Expansion #1Sub-zone: Cargo Launcher to Temple of MemoryLocation: This is the sub-section that has a launcher/fast travel device and a path that leads to the main area. Just follow the steps and use the Fire Shot to burn the cobwebs.Fury Green Shot Expansion #2Sub-zone: Isopod LairLocation: The Isopod Lair is part of the narrow section where you rescue Mackenzie early in the campaign. There's a pillar here that's covered in flammable gunk.Fury Green Shot Expansion #3Sub-zone: Jungle PathLocation: This is the side passage that you gain access to after beating the Carvex boss. Look for cobwebs/gunk along the cliff, then use your Fire Shot to reveal a hidden nook.Fury Green Shot Expansion #4Sub-zone: Cargo Staging AreaLocation: Mackenzie will eventually create a base camp, which is where he unlocks new upgrades for you. You'll likely spot a Lamorn storage locker in the next room. Return here once you have the Thunder Shot so you can blast both ends of the container.Fury Green Shot Expansion #5Sub-zone: Sacred Flame CeremonyLocation: The next set of Shot Expansions in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond comes from the same general area in Fury Green--i.e. the large chamber near the base camp. However, you need to obtain various elemental weapons as you progress through the campaign, as these allow you to solve the puzzles in each room. The first room requires Fire Shot. Shoot the doorway to unlock the Sacred Flame Ceremony. Next, use your psychic powers to move the altar, while burning the torches with your Fire Shot.Fury Green Shot Expansion #6Sub-zone: Sacred Flame CeremonyLocation: The next Shot Expansion requires Ice Shot. Open the doorway and check the two ledges on the fountains. Freeze the first fountain with Ice Shot, then use your psychic power to toss the bomb to the other plinth. Freeze the second fountain, then hop on top to grab the upgrade.Fury Green Shot Expansion #7Sub-zone: Sacred Flame CeremonyLocation: The third and final item requires the Thunder Shot. Once inside the room, use your psychic powers to pull the three contraptions all the way down. Rotate them as well so that the pointed parts face toward the middle. Once you're done, shoot all three rods with Thunder Shot to conduct electricity to the central pillar.Ice Belt: Shot Expansions mapThere are several Metroid Prime 4 Shot Expansions in the Ice Belt zone. To be clear, you need to visit the Flare Pool region first to acquire the Fire Shot ability, which allows you to explore most of Ice Belt. Likewise, some of these items can't be obtained during your initial run, since you still need to unlock various Power Suit abilities.Ice Belt Shot Expansion #1Sub-zone: Surface - SnowfieldLocation: Found in the large area where you fought the wolves. It's behind the debris with the Scout Bot. You need to melt the ice using the Fire Shot.Ice Belt Shot Expansion #2Sub-zone: Surface - Equipment StorageLocation: You can only obtain this Metroid Prime 4 Shot Expansion once you've unlocked the Psychic Spider Ball ability.  At the Surface - Lobby area, zap the door with Thunder Shot and continue onward until you arrive at Equipment Storage.The item is at the end of the tracks on the ceiling, but you can't reach it yet. For now, just zap the sleeping mech named VUE-995. It will break apart obstacles and doorways that you scan.Eventually, you'll be able to use the Psychic Grapple to cross the chasm, which leads you to the Ancient Temple.Unlock the Psychic Spider Ball ability by throwing motes at the statue's niches. Don't forget to grab the Missile Expansion, too.Return to the area where you met VUE-995 to acquire this upgrade.Ice Belt Shot Expansion #3Sub-zone: Bio-Labs - Tracking OperationsLocation: Found in the same room where you unlock the Psychic Lasso ability. Look up at the ceiling and pull the two metal pipes. Pry open the grate so you can hop back inside the pipes in your Morph Ball form, then continue all the way to the end to receive this item.Ice Belt Shot Expansion #4Sub-zone: Medical Bays - Surgery ConduitLocation: You'll pass by this area during your initial visit. Return here once you have the Psychic Spider Ball ability. Climb up the rails, then use your Psychic Boost to speedily make your way across before the electric current hits you. You can blow up the metal ledge to obtain the upgrade.Ice Belt Shot Expansion #5Sub-zone: Power Station - Lower AirlockLocation: Restore power to the entire facility. Then, as you're making your way back to the previous section, you'll see a device above a doorway. Create a bomb mote while in Morph Ball form, then toss it at the device. One of the cells in the room contains the item.Ice Belt Shot Expansion #6Sub-zone: Power Station - Power GeneratorLocation: This is the chamber where you restore power to the entire base. It also happens to have an Energy Tank. However, you can only acquire the Large Shot Expansion once you have the Psychic Spider Ball ability.  Go down to the lower section and look for the railings/tracks. Climb to the top until you see a tether.At the very edge, charge up your Psychic Boost and leap. Quickly latch onto the tether while in mid-air.Bounce from the tethers to the tracks on the ceiling so you can reach your reward.Ice Belt Shot Expansion #7Sub-zone: Quarantine - Security GatesLocation: This item is right before the boss' chamber. Go past the cart and you'll notice a glass pane close to the ground. Fire a missile to destroy it, then squeeze through the crawlspace via Morph Ball form.These are the Metroid Prime 4 Shot Expansions that we've acquired so far in our playthrough. We'll let you know once we discover others, so stay tuned.Venture forth across the endless dunes of Viewros and delve deeper into long-forgotten alien facilities.

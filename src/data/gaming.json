    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on January 6, 2026 at 1:58AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Grass Pokémon are always a plentiful type to find out in the wild, regardless of what region you're exploring, but this can make it difficult to discern which are a notch above the rest. More often than not, you'll catch a Grass Pokémon to defeat one of the starter gyms or learn some HMs in the early generations. However, a Grass Pokémon rarely stays on your team thanks to its often low stats, many weaknesses, and limited move pools.Of course, as any Pokémon fan knows, the Grass typing can be used to great effect if you utilize the right Pokémon. Today, we'll be looking at the 10 best Grass Pokémon to use in a regular playthrough of the mainline games. For the most part, we'll be excluding legendary and mythical Pokémon as well as Ultra Beasts, as they would simply take over the list. We'll also try to spread out Pokémon from across different regional Pokédexes to showcase what all of the games offer with this type.This list is ranked from the tenth-best to the best Grass Pokémon.BreloomOriginal game: Ruby and SapphireType: Grass and FightingTo kick off the list, we have arguably the best Grass type in the entire Hoenn Pokédex. While Pokémon such as Ludicolo, Shifty, and Cacturne are all fine in their own right, Breloom can completely dominate the Hoenn games.Breloom has the rare Grass/Fighting dual typing, a 460 base stat total, and can be acquired extremely early in most games where it's available. It also has a decently wide move pool that provides plenty of coverage and setup moves. While Breloom won't be as good as a Grass type starter or even some of the other regular Grass types on this list, you shouldn't underestimate the Mushroom Pokémon.AbomasnowOriginal game: Diamond and PearlType: Grass and IceAbomansow makes it onto this list for a couple of reasons. First, its typing; Grass and Ice is a particularly tricky combination, as you need to avoid Fire types at all costs, and the Ice typing adds several additional weaknesses that Grass types usually don't have, such as Fighting, Rock, and Steel. However, as long as you utilize Abomasnow correctly, which usually involves a strategy surrounding Hail, you can turn it into a formidable Pokémon.Of course, Abomansow also has a Mega Evolution, which keeps its same typing but adds 100 points to its base stat total. If you can find a way to use Abomansow's Mega, then you can fight your way through most battles.RoseradeOriginal game: Diamond and PearlType: Grass and PoisonRoserade is a classic Grass and Poison type Pokémon, which you'll see plenty of on this list. However, what some of those other Pokémon don't have is a massive move pool that allows you to turn your Roserade into a frustratingly unstoppable opponent. Roserade has access to a few weather moves, which are great for double battles, and a slew of setup moves that make use of its Poison typing. You'll also be able to learn multiple Grass type attacks that use Roserade's huge special attack stat.Roserade can also learn a surprising number of Normal type moves, which allow you to make it even more versatile. All of this is combined with an impressive 510 base stat total that makes Roserade a highly underrated Grass type. You'll have to do some work to evolve its previous forms, Budew and Roselia, but the end result is more than worth it.VenusaurOriginal game: Red and BlueType: Grass and PoisonIt wouldn't be right to have a list of the best Grass Pokémon without a nod to the OG. Venusaur was the original Grass type starter in Pokémon and still remains one of the best all these years later. Of course, the base Venusaur is always going to be outmatched by its Mega counterpart, which is available in a handful of games. Mega Venusaur is right up there with the best Grass types in all of Pokémon, but even if you're running through Fire Red, base Venusaur will provide a ton of utility.Outside of self-healing and setup moves, Venusaur will usually rely on the combination of Sunny Day and Solarbeam to deal massive Grass type damage, at least in the early generations of Pokémon. You still have access to some lower-tier Grass attacks, but that combination, plus a couple of setup moves, is lethal against most opponents.AmoongussOriginal game: Black and WhiteType: Grass and PoisonOn the surface, Amoonguss might just seem like a standard two-stage evolution Pokémon that uses the common Grass/Poison dual typing. While Amoonguss won't blow you away with its attacks, it can carry a team thanks to the sheer number of setup moves and indirect attacks it can use. From Toxic to Rage Powder to Double Team, Amoonguss can be an absolute nightmare to fight against if you're on the wrong side of a battle.Aside from its moves, Amoonguss has a 464 base stat total with an abysmal 30 speed stat. However, it makes up for that by being pretty tanky and having even attack and defense stats. Amoonguss becomes even tankier with its hidden ability, Regenerator, which is fantastic in a competitive environment.Applin lineOriginal game: Sword and ShieldType: Grass and DragonWhy an apple is a Grass and Dragon type is beyond the entire Pokémon community, but it was about time this dual typing came into play. Applin was introduced in Generation 8 and features one of the most interesting evolution lines ever seen. Applin can evolve into three different Pokémon depending on what kind of apple item you give it. One of those evolutions, Dipplin, can then evolve into Hydrapple, which is a formidable Grass and Dragon type with a 540 base stat total.Hydrapple's speed leaves something to be desired, but its HP, special attack, and defense are all fantastic. That high special attack stat in particular makes it incredible, as you can teach it several high-damage special Grass and Dragon attacks. Speaking of which, Hydrapple has an enormous move pool, and it's still one of the more underrated Grass Pokémon.TangrowthOriginal game: PlatinumType: GrassTangrowth was one of the extra evolutions that was introduced with Platinum in Generation 4. It evolves from Tangela once the move Ancient Power has been learned, which allows you to usually get Tangrowth around the mid-game. Tangrowth excels in every stat except for special defense and speed, which you can certainly use to your advantage in certain situations. It's a pure Grass type, but can learn a wide variety of coverage attacks, such as Shock Wave, Earthquake, Sludge Bomb, Aerial Ace, and the list goes on.Thanks to this wide move pool, interesting stat distribution, and typing, Tangrowth is always going to be one of the best Grass types you can use, especially in Sinnoh.FerrothornOriginal game: Black and WhiteType: Grass and SteelFerrothorn remains the only Grass and Steel type in the entirety of Pokémon, excluding its pre-evolution Ferroseed and Kartana, an Ultra Beast from Generation 7. This dominant typing makes Ferrothorn four times weak to Fire, two times weak to Fighting, and that's it for its weaknesses. Ferrothorn also has a base stat total of 489, but this includes a horrid 54 special attack stat. Fortunately, a majority of its primary STAB attacks are physical, including Iron Head and Power Whip.While Ferrothorn's typing seems like it would limit its move pool, that's not the case at all. Ferrothorn can learn dozens of unique TMs, including great setup moves like Swords Dance, Hone Claws, and Double Team. This makes Ferrothorn one of the best tank Pokémon in Generation V, as well as most games after that.SceptileOriginal game: Ruby and SapphireType: GrassSceptile is the Grass starter from the Hoenn games and has remained one of the most popular Grass Pokémon of all time. While it tends to get overshadowed in Hoenn thanks to the dominance of Swampert, it's no slouch either. Sceptile is a pure Grass type with a blazing 120 speed stat and high special attack. The high special attack means you can take full advantage of Sceptile's signature move in Generation III, Leaf Blade, as well as the classic Sunny Day and Solarbeam combination.We also can't talk about Sceptile without mentioning its Mega Evolution. This gives Sceptile the lethal Grass/Dragon dual typing, making it even stronger, and leaves it with Ice as its main weakness.RillaboomOriginal game: Sword and ShieldType: GrassRillaboom is another pure Grass type, but unlike some of the other pures we've talked about on this list, it utilizes a high physical attack stat to mow down opponents. Boasting a 530 base stat total, Rillaboom allocates 125 of that to physical attack, allowing it to use Grass attacks like Wood Hammer and Solar Blade to dazzling effect.Rillaboom is also extremely tanky and gets even harder to take down in its Gigantamax form. Its signature G-Max move, Drum Solo, will put most enemy Pokémon into submission unless they're four times resistant to Grass. Overall, Rillaboom is the best starter for the Sword and Shield and one of the best starters in the entirety of Pokémon.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on January 6, 2026 at 1:57AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                No matter what game you decide to play, you'll always encounter a staggering number of Water types. Every game requires you to navigate some type of water, and that leads to a large variety of Water type Pokémon being added to the Pokédex year after year. While this is terrific for your goal to catch 'em all, it can also lead to some questions about which Pokémon are best among all those other Water types.Today, we've taken it upon ourselves to rank the top 10 Water Pokémon to use during a regular playthrough of the mainline games. Since we want these Pokémon to be accessible, there will be no legendary or mythical Pokémon mentioned, as well as no Ultra Beasts. Including those categories would severely limit the list, so instead, we're opting for standard Pokémon. Also, we'll be trying to include Pokémon from most regions as well as showcasing Pokémon with unique dual typings or abilities.This list is ranked in ascending order, with the last being the best Water Pokémon.StarmieOriginal game: Red and BlueType: Water and PsychicIf you've been playing Pokémon for some time, then chances are you've used a Starmie on one of your Kanto teams. Starmie became an extremely popular Pokémon thanks to its appearances as Misty's ace in the anime, but it's also a terrific Water type. Boasting a 520 base stat total, Starmie has the fantastic Psychic dual typing, which does wonders in a Kanto playthrough. However, the Psychic typing also allows Starmie to learn a variety of coverage moves, including Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Dazzling Gleam in newer games.BlastoiseOriginal game: Red and BlueType: WaterWe're doubling up on Kanto Water types, but this list simply wouldn't be complete with Blastoise. An evolution of the original Water starter Pokémon, Blastoise is a force to be reckoned with in any game it's available. Whether you're doing a Kanto playthrough or choosing Squirtle in the middle of X/Y, Blastoise will often be the best Water type on your team. It has a 530 base stat total, access to a ton of coverage and setup moves, and doesn't have any true weaknesses aside from the normal super-effective damage from Electric and Grass.SeismitoadOriginal game: Black and WhiteType: Water and GroundSeismitoad came out of nowhere when Generation 5 was released. Many players saw its early stage evolutions, being a small tadpole, and wrote off Seismitoad as an ineffective Swampert clone due to its Water/Ground dual typing and color scheme. However, Seismitoad can stand on its own as a fantastic Water type. While it's true that Seismitoad does share a lot of similarities with Swampert, who we'll talk about later, it's still incredibly powerful for a Black/White playthrough. It has a 509 base stat total, only one weakness (Grass), and plenty of access to Poison type coverage moves.MiloticOriginal game: Ruby and SapphireType: WaterMilotic has become infamous in the Pokémon community because so few players actually get to use one in their playthroughs. The mermaid fish Pokémon is incredibly difficult to evolve in the Hoenn games, as you need to get Feebas' beauty stat to the max. In later games, Feebas' evolution was changed to make it easier to trigger--you can evolve Feebar into Milotic when you trade it holding the Prism Scale. This was great news for all players, as more fans got to see the true power of this pure Water type. Milotic has an impressive 540 base stat total and can be a true tank for your team with its massive 125 special defense stat.DondozoOriginal game: Scarlet and VioletType: WaterThis spot was going to go to either Wailord or Dondozo. Both Pokémon are large Water type whales that are meant to be the true definition of tanks. However, we're opting to go with Dondozo, as it has a higher base stat total (530) and a larger move pool than Wailord. Dondozo famously boasts a 150 HP stat along with a 115 defense stat, making it nearly impossible to take down in a single hit if you're properly leveled. While you'll still want to avoid special Grass or Electric attacks, Dondozo is always a great Pokémon to have in your back pocket in Scarlet and Violet.LaprasOriginal game: Red and BlueType: Water and IceThere have been plenty of Water/Ice dual types throughout Pokémon, but none hit quite like Lapras. While Generation 3's Walrein does have a close base stat total, Lapras still edges it out (535 compared to 530). Lapras can also learn several Electric type attacks along with some Psychic, Ground, Fairy, and Dragon moves. It's a versatile Pokémon regardless of what generation you're playing, but few moments are as iconic as receiving the free Lapras inside of Silph Co. in Kanto.KingdraOriginal game: Gold and SilverType: Water and DragonOnce again, we had a decision to make with this spot. Kingdra and Dracovish are both fantastic Water/Dragon dual types with base stat totals above 500. However, Kingdra has a 540 total while Dracovish only has 505. While you can make great use out of Dracovish's Strong Jaw ability, Kingdra's Swift Swim ability is too good to pass up. This doubles Kingdra's speed when it's raining, allowing you to get even more use out of the Rain Dance move. Pair this with Double Team, Surf, and some kind of Dragon move, and you have an absolutely lethal Kingdra on your hands that might not ever lose a battle.EmpoleonOriginal game: Diamond and PearlType: Water and SteelWe haven't mentioned too many Water starter Pokémon yet, and that's because we're saving the best ones for last. This begins with Empoleon, who is still the only Water/Steel dual type in all of Pokémon. This typing is devastatingly powerful, removing the Grass weakness and adding a weakness to Fighting and Ground. However, Fighting types aren't too common, especially in Sinnoh, and Empoleon can use Water attacks that are super effective against Ground. The Steel type makes Empoleon even tankier than it was and opens up its move pool significantly.GyaradosOriginal game: Red and BlueType: Water and FlyingGyarados has remained one of the most popular Pokémon in the entire franchise since it was introduced with the Generation 1 games over 25 years ago. The design of Gyarados made every player want one on their team, and fortunately, it's always extremely easy to obtain thanks to the abundance of Magikarp. In its base form, Gyarados is a Water/Flying dual type while its Mega form is a Water/Dark dual type. Why Game Freak never gave Gyarados the Dragon typing it's always deserved is unknown, but it can still learn a flurry of Dragon moves. Even without that dual typing, though, Gyarados is a powerhouse through and through that just needs to avoid Electric types.SwampertOriginal game: Ruby and SapphireType: Water and GroundIf you're a die hard Pokémon fan, then you had to have seen this entry coming from a mile away. Swampert is far and away the strongest starter in the Hoenn games and it might be the best starter in Pokémon history. It gains the Ground dual typing with its second evolution, Marshtomp, and this allows you to steamroll through any Hoenn game. There are very few strong Grass types in Hoenn, which is Swampert's only weakness, and plenty of Pokémon weak to Water or Ground. All of this doesn't even include Swampert's Mega form, which is simply unfair in most situations. Swampert is hands down the best Water type in Pokémon outside of legendaries and mythicals.    \n  \n                      "

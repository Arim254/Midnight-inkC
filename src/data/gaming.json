The Cold Snap update brings multiple seasonal events, a new Snowfall map condition, and plenty more for fans to sink their teeth into. Among the fresh additions is the Goalie Raider Deck--the game's second battle pass--which contains a smorgasbord of cosmetics, gear, items, and even Raider Tokens that can be used toward premium purchases in the shop.The Goalie Deck is free for all players, so you won't need to purchase access to these rewards with premium currency. Instead, you'll simply need to work toward completing daily Feats that provide you with Creds, then use those to unlock your preferred items from the deck. This should prove fairly easy to do for most players, as you can complete up to three Feats per match, and you'll even get additional bonus Creds for the first five Feats you finish in a day.Perhaps the best news about the Goalie Deck, however, is that it's a permanent reward track. Unlike battle passes in other games, this deck will stick around forever, meaning you can unlock what you want from it whenever you'd like. With this in mind, you can skip any rewards that just don't matter much to you right now--though it's worth pointing out you will still need to purchase a certain number of items from the deck to unlock subsequent pages.If you're excited to dive into the Goalie Deck and start reaping its rewards--including the new hockey-themed outfit, which is pretty rad--we've got you covered ahead of time. Keep scrolling below for every reward from the Goalie Deck in Arc Raiders.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                When it comes to Roblox games, Blox Fruits might just be the biggest, and that doubles for both popularity and scope. With a level cap of a whopping 2800, working your way up from the beginning is one hell of a journey. Luckily, we’re here to help you with Blox Fruits leveling and offer some small tips that’ll help you as you battle enemies and try to get more powerful in this thrilling Roblox experience.Blox Fruits Leveling ExplainedThere are plenty of ways to level up in Blox Fruits, and even more reasons for doing so. Naturally, like any other RPG, you will get stronger with every level, and this is the key to taking on more powerful enemies on different islands.For clarity, leveling up will give you access to several new things, including:New islands to explore3 stat points to spend as you likeLevel-gated NPC questsOther gameplay elements like Raids, Awakening Fruits, and Elite PiratesOne of the most important parts of leveling up is the stat points, which you can spend in any of the following categories:MeleeDefenseSwordGunBlox FruitHow you spend your stats will depend on your playstyle, but it is important to remember that Melee increases your energy, while Defense increases your health. Then, later, when you unlock different Blox Fruits, the Blox Fruit stat will increase each Fruit’s damage.Best Blox Fruits For LevelingEarly in the game, the best Blox Fruit for leveling up is the Buddha. If you can get your hands on it, this Legendary-tier Fruit transforms the user into a golden, glowing, giant.This transformation crucially negates a huge chunk of incoming damage, meaning you can tank some big hits. But it also extends your hit box, making it easier for you to mow enemies down. Alongside this, it also has several AoE-focused special attacks, making it easy for you to hit multiple foes at once and spread out your damage. This is fantastic for farming smaller enemies when you want to grind XP, and also helps you to take on some of the tougher early bosses in the game. If you do pick up the Buddha early, it is also wise to power up your Melee stat to boost its power, and the defensive capabilities of the Buddha mean you can worry less about the Defense stat.However, at a whopping $1,200,000, or 1,650 Robux, you may not be able to pick up the Buddha for a little while. In the meantime, some other picks like Flame or Light can offer a huge help at the start of your Blox Fruit journey. Both Flame and Light have great damage stats, but Light also has some fantastic mobility to help you find those first few islands.Best Blox Fruits Fighting Style For Leveling UpAt the beginning of Blox Fruits, it's best to focus on either the Melee or Sword fighting style to just help you quickly grind through the early enemy NPCs you‘ll find scattered around the seas. While there are many better fighting styles later on, Sword and Melee are really effective for just spamming enemies and growing those early levels.Best Tips For Leveling Up In Blox FruitsHow you choose to grind through Blox Fruits is entirely up to you, and the way you level up will ultimately be defined by your preferred playstyle. However, there are some basic tips that should help people, no matter how they like to play.First of all, be mindful of the accessory you use. While most of the time you should just choose one that you like, or love the design for, when grinding, you should be focusing on boosting your stats to save time. Early items like the Black Cape are great here, which you have a chance of earning by defeating Elite Pirates.One slightly cheesy method folks love to implement has been dubbed the ‘Fountain Method’ as it is particularly useful on the First Sea’s Fountain Island. Upon engaging with certain mobs, if there is a wall nearby, you can simply hop behind the wall and attack from a distance. While enemies have a much lower range behind walls, yours is slightly longer, so you can use this to spam even very tough enemies. Just be careful of your distance!Next, while it can be good to find the toughest enemies you can currently handle when you're grinding, you generally save time grinding islands with more mobs, even if they aren’t quite as strong. This is also very important when using double XP codes, which, while very effective, work better against large amounts of enemies instead of a single high-level mob or boss.Finally, if you are grinding bosses and are getting sick of waiting for them to respawn, many players find it helpful to jump between servers to find one where the boss is available again. This can be fantastic for grinding XP and items from those tough bosses.Best Blox Fruits Locations For Early Leveling UpThere are plenty of great places to grind levels in Blox Fruits, but if you’re just starting out, or bumping up against some difficult enemies, here are some of the best places to grind in the first sea and those essential early levels.1-55 - Grind the bandits on the opening island, then use the Fountain Method on Fountain Island55-90 - Attack the Chef on Pirate Island, and use server hopping to get quicker respawns90-105 - Grind by attacking the Snow Bandit in the Frozen Village105-130 - Attack the Yeti Boss in the Frozen Village, and remember to use server hopping130-220 - Use server hopping to grind the Vice Admiral boss in Marine Fortress220-350 - Grind the bosses in the Prison using server hopping350-435 - Attack the Magma Admiral in the Magma Village and use server hopping to ensure respawns425-500 Attack the Fishman Lord in Underwater City\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nAs live-service games go on and on into eternity, the episodic game structure is the perfect way to know just when to put down the controller.By \n    Matt Kim\n   on December 27, 2025 at 1:00PM PST\n              \n                Is there a more infamous monkey-paw wish than the collective dream that all our favorite games could last forever? Well, the finger curled, because it seems like all major game publishers in the world only want to make games that go on to infinity.With the rise of live-service games, it's been a struggle to know when to put the controller down, especially when games like Fortnite release seasonal content like The Simpsons season pass that ask you to play long enough to unlock stupid sexy Flanders. Luckily, for us, episodic games, perfectly portioned into bite-sized morsels, have come back to rescue us from the endless grind.In this case, I am talking specifically about Dispatch, the new episodic superhero game from AdHoc Studio. If the name is unfamiliar to you, AdHoc is a new game company founded by former members of Ubisoft, Night School, and perhaps most notably, Telltale Games, who blew up the episodic gaming scene with 2012's The Walking Dead. The studio would later close due to a variety of factors internal and external, some of which I covered previously as a reporter. But by then, the episodic-games formula was starting to feel a bit played out, and the mood appeared to be shifting towards either more complete single-player experiences, or the early live-service games we know today.But nowadays, the people yearn for games that deliver the sense of accomplishment when hitting credits, but also don't require the kind of time investment most games demand. Dispatch perfectly models itself after the cable TV shows of old, with each episode adhering to a winning formula that never overstays its welcome.Set in a modern-day Los Angeles — except in this version of the city, there are actual superheroes working together at a private security firm — Dispatch is best understood as a workplace comedy. Think The Office crossed over with The Boys. Players are asked to make both small and large choices as the hero, Robert Robertson III, which will not only determine his personality, but have big ramifications for how the story plays out. A short intro sets the stage for the episode's plot, while in the middle is an interactive dispatching sim, followed by a big finale, a needle drop, and roll credits. A little formulaic, but so was television during the pre-prestige TV era.Furthering the TV connection, Dispatch's fully voiced storyline has a wonderful cast of TV alumni including Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, and thanks to a partnership with Critical Role, fan-favorite voice actors like Laura Bailey and Matt Mercer.For the past week, playing Dispatch became a nightly ritual where after dinner, I'd retreat into the office for a single episode's worth of Dispatch before returning to the living room to do something else for the evening. Just like a TV season, Dispatch is broken up into eight episodes, each about an hour, not including end credits. While there is always the urge to keep pushing forward and play right into the next episode, each section felt so perfectly calibrated for a single session of gaming that I could leave the next episode for the next night and not feel a pang of anxiety or FOMO. If anything, I could take the time to think over the choices I made in the previous episode, many of which feel weighty and substantial.I don't want to give the wrong impression about Dispatch by constantly comparing it to TV. Dispatch is first and foremost a game, and a damn good one too. The hero-dispatching sim alone is worthy of praise, and, ironically, something I could play endlessly. But there's a confidence in direction that oozes from Dispatch. They know just when to hit you with the credits, knowing full well you will feel satisfied leaving the game until the next week when new episodes are set to drop.The combination of talent, writing, and production in Dispatch all come together into a potent mix--a truly satisfying one too, which is not a description I've used for many games this year. You should read GameSpot's positive review of course, but Dispatch has seemingly hit the perfect chord with players to the tune of 2 million copies sold. A major success for a new IP from a brand-new studio, and while I could go on about all the ways Dispatch has become a surprise hit of the year for me, the best thing about my time with it has been, well, that I spent a pretty short amount of time with it. Or rather, I spent the perfect length of time with it.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

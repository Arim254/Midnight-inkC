    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The convergence of AI and game creation is a topic that won't be going away any time soon, especially when large companies like EA reportedly wants its devs to consider artificial intelligence to be \"thought partners\" when crafting titles. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was recently asked about Xbox's AI usage, and he indicated that it's primarily being utilized for operational purposes for now.\"Our applications of AI today are mostly actually on the security and protection of our networks,\" said Spencer during his appearance at the Paley International Council Summit (via IGN). \"It's now at a scale where you can't really moderate the safety of those with just people alone. The volume is too high. So we have AI that we use to make sure that the conversation and topics that are happening, and for protected child accounts and other things and who gets to talk to those accounts to those people, is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls. That's our primary use of AI inside of our organization today, which maybe isn't the most glamorous use of AI, but it's something that I fundamentally believe in.\"As a company, Microsoft is going all in on AI and voice controls with a recently unveiled campaign to fully integrate that technology into Windows 11 machines. In the video game industry, prominent developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield believe that AI tools should be embraced in game creation. A recent survey also found that over 50% of Japanese game publishers utilize AI in some way.Spencer did address whether Microsoft encourages developers to use AI in the creative process, and he noted that he prefers to let the devs make that decision.\"I have found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier,\" said Spencer. \"Any top-down mandate that 'thou must use a certain tool' ... is not really a path to success. I look at the teams, and we make tools available, and I kind of let it organically percolate.\"A recent report indicated that Microsoft's extremely ambitious profit goals may be harming the company, and possibly played a large role in its massive layoffs, as well as the price hikes for Xbox consoles and Game Pass subscriptions. It was also disclosed that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made $96.5 million in the company's 2025 fiscal year. That's approximately 480 times as much as the median company worker at Microsoft.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Anyone looking to return to the Olympic Exclusion Zone in the first Pacific Drive story DLC, Whispers in the Woods, are in for a surprise, as the expansion is out right now. In a surprise announcement, developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive revealed that Whispers in the Woods is now available, and the game has also been ported over to Xbox Series X|S consoles.The expansion features a brand-new story and content that Ironwood Studios says is roughly a third of the size of the base game, and it includes new anomalies and horrors to discover.          Players can also experiment with several new gameplay systems, such as the Whispering Tide. This is described as a \"mysterious force that grows more perilous\" the longer you linger in the Whispering Woods, and to survive, you'll need to equip specially attuned parts to your station wagon that can keep it at bay. Artifacts from Altars will also be found in the expansion, and these offer reality-warping powers that affect both the environment and you.Pacific Drive made a lasting impression when it debuted last year, as the Indie survival game blended a well-crafted layer of suspense with a surprisingly chill vibe as you explored a creepy patch of the Pacific Northwest from the relative safety of your station wagon.\"With its wonderful depth in both story and gameplay, Pacific Drive is an early hit in 2024,\" Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's Pacific Drive review. \"It sets out to create a world that fits comfortably in the New Weird genre but brings its own style and substance to it. Though the game can be especially hard to decipher, difficulty options help to counter some of its more overwhelming aspects. I'll stick to bikes in my day-to-day life through the actual northwest, but in Pacific Drive, I'm up for another joy ride through one hell of a winding road.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The newest update for the viral Steam game Escape from Duckov is out now, and it discourages players from eating poop.Up until now, players of the game made by five people that has sold more than 1 million copies could eat poop to restore energy and hydration values. Players can still do that after the new update, but it's less effective to do so. The patch notes state:\"Reduced the Energy and Hydration values provided by Poop.\"          As PC Gamer points out, some players resorted to downing dookie to revitalize their character. The fecal matter is found on the map and can be eaten to restore some energy and hydration levels, at the cost of somewhat poisoning yourself. Apparently this proved to be too successful a tactic, and developer Team Soda made some changes. Players can still craft poop to create a throwable weapon called, wait for it, a Poop Ball.You can see the full patch notes for the Duckov October 23 update below, as Team Soda shared on Steam. Escape from Duckov October 23 patch notesUpdatesOrange Headphones can now be dismantled.Added indicator display when the player is injured.Removed the footstep sound of dogs.Reduced the Energy and Hydration values provided by Poop.Added another construction site in the base to prevent players from getting stuck inside rooms.Slightly reduced the damage of Storm Creatures.In Motion Sickness-Friendly Mode, removed the camera movement when leaving the base.Mad Bombers now have a chance to drop other cellar keys.Reduced the durability consumption of Small Energy Bullets, Enhanced Small Energy Bullets, and Large Energy Bullets.Monster: Storm? now inflicts a “Shatter” effect.FixesFixed lag issues caused by mining machines.Fixed an issue where the Sniper Trial quest requirements do not match its description after the last update.Fixed a bug where the MCXspear blueprint incorrectly appeared in the Recipe Collection even when it was locked.Fixed an issue where the Standard Bullet (MAG) crafting recipe used a deprecated item.Fixed an abnormal amount of ornaments appearing in the sewers.Fixed an issue where weapon attachments were lost when disassembling guns.Guns with Armor Penetration will now display their Penetration Level.We're trying to fix the issue where reloading caused ammo to become “-1.”Analyst Daniel Ahmad reminded people that Duckov was made by a team of five people, which makes the game's success even more impressive. The game is a parody of Escape from Tarkov and published by BiliBili, a Chinese giant also behind titles like Magicraft, Core Keeper, and Warm Snow.Duckov is available now for $15.83 USD, but the price will go up 12% to $18 USD on October 30. It's putting up massive numbers on Steam, where it's reached more than 250,000 concurrent players. The game is also available on the Epic Games Store, but not console.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

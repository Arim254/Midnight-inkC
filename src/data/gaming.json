The Fortnite-original Melodie Mars skin is unlocked instantly when you purchase the pass, and the Rockstar Lisa skin is the final reward in the pass, she's got a reactive back bling on the pass as well.Those Icon emotes--which feature music from Can't Get Enough by Krystal Youngs and NiihWA, and Latata by I-dle--are a pretty surprising inclusion, as there have only been three total Icon emotes included in the previous 11`music passes. To have two of them on one music pass is very unusual.Of the eight jam tracks included in the Starlux pass, four are licensed and four are Epic-produced tracks. These are the licensed tracks.Get Jiggy by B Jack$, Zeddy WillDashstar* VIP by Knock2Sorry by Justin BieberF*** Up the World (Vixi Solo Version) by LisaIn all, the Starlux music pass includes 30 items, with one reward unlocking each two account levels you earn in any Fortnite experience. The pass costs 1,400 V-Bucks, and is included with a Fortnite Crew subscription. Scroll on to see everything you can collect from this one.    \n  \n                      "

Lego City is a prime example, and thanks to this weekend's Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, you can grab the fan-favorite Lego City Robot World Rollercoaster set for just $70 (was $100) on Amazon. This kit combines a fun sci-fi theme with cool set pieces, including a working roller coaster and a giant, posable robot.                                 Lego City Robot World Roller Coaster (986 pieces)                                                                $70 (was $100)                                                                                                                                                                                    The roller coaster is the main attraction of this 986-piece kit. The coaster features a few bends and twists, a moving carriage that can seat three minifigures, and a fully articulated mech suit. The finished set also features theme park scenes like a photo desk for guests to take a few snapshots of their experience, a mini arcade for some digital entertainment, and a slushie bar and a DJ booth built right into the rollercoaster. You'll also get eight minifigures of park attendees and employees.                      Two other Lego City kits to check out include the Yellow Construction Crane for $77 (was $110), and the Lego Yellow Delivery Truck for $70 (was $100). The construction crane kit is a big 1,116-piece build, and the fully assembled vehicle features 16 rubber wheels, support legs that fold out for stability, a hinged operator's cab that can be replaced with counterweights, and four minifigures of construction workers. The hoist on this set can be operated by turning a dial on the crane, while the boom can extend and turn 360 degrees. There's even a portable toilet set that can be built and attached to the hoist hook.The Lego City Yellow Delivery Truck lets you build a scale replica of the big rigs that transport Lego in real life. It comes with four minifigures, and the truck features a sleeper cab, a hinged bonnet, and working rubber wheels. It can be hitched to the trailer, which has side panels that open for easy access. You can even load it up with Lego kits using the buildable forklift, and you can treat the Lego employees to a meal at the hot dog vendor.Plenty of other Lego Sets are on sale in Amazon's Cyber Monday sale, most of which are carried over from the retailer's Black Friday sale--so if you missed out on these earlier in the month, you've got a second chance to score a few deals.

    "body": "\n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Epic Games seems to love saving its biggest collabs for the first season of each new Fortnite chapter, and that certainly has not changed in Chapter 7 Season 1--which has a battle pass that includes two classic and beloved movie characters, Marty McFly from Back to the Future, and Beatrix \"The Bride\" Kiddo from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill.In terms of name recognition, that's a pretty major pairing with at least as much name recognition as Godzilla and Hatsune Miku, which Fortnite kicked off Chapter 6 with a year ago. But if those folks aren't your speed, fortunately, there are six other skins on the Season 1 battle pass that you can enjoy.Four of those skins are just regular humans, including a skater girl named Carina who has blue hair and a cast on her right wrist, who's sure to be an instant favorite. The pass rounds out with Kingston, a laid-back lion man, and a new version of the old Eternal Voyager skin who appears to be related to The Seven somehow.This battle pass will work differently from past ones. While The Bride is the skin you unlock instantly when you buy the pass, and Dark Voyager is the final skin, you can unlock the rest of the skins in whatever order you want. On top of that, there's no time-gated bonus skin that will unlock halfway through the season. All eight skins can be earned from day one.As usual, the battle pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks to purchase, and it's included with a subscription to Fortnite Crew, whether you're subscribed to Crew on its own or through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The pass includes 1,500 V-Bucks you can unlock. Scroll on for a first look at everything included on the Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass."

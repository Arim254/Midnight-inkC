    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Cash is still the ultimate commodity in Grand Theft Auto Online, and Rockstar Games has been known to go out of its way to entice players with in-game currency rewards... sometimes for just logging in. Now, Rockstar is offering $500,000 in game currency to anyone who follows a simple request.To earn the prize, all you have to do is link your Discord account to your Rockstar Games account. Just clicking on this link will take you where you need to be.If you need something to invest all of that cash in, GTA Online's next update--A Safehouse in the Hills--allows players to buy their own missions. A new trailer for that update dropped today, and it revealed the return of Michael De Santa, one of the leading characters from Grand Theft Auto 5. If the footage is any indication, Michael's retirement didn't fully take. Or perhaps he's just very passionate about keeping certain criminal affairs out of his upscale neighborhood.          To get one of these mega mansions for yourself, players will have to strike a deal with the Prix Luxury Real Estate company, which promises \"sprawling grounds, breathtaking views, and first-rate amenities--including the latest in personal assistance and business service technology.\"A Safehouse in the Hills will launch on December 10, and players who opt into a Prix Luxury Black Tier VIP from now through December 7 can grab an Ubermacht Revolter sports car at the Luxury Autos showroom. Players can also advance to the Gold Tier membership by finishing all three New Listings missions, which will reward users with a $1 million bonus of in-game cash, as well as a $2 million discount on one of the luxury estates being offered by Prix Luxury.Earlier this fall, Rockstar added GTA Online to its GTA+ membership service. It's still unclear what will happen to the game after Grand Theft Auto 6 is released in November 2026, but at least one video game analyst has argued that GTA Online is the real cash cow of the franchise.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Normally $70, the 811-piece WALL-E and EVE model is available for $56 at Amazon, Walmart, and Target. Designed for adults and experienced builders, the adorable new set includes buildable figures of WALL-E, EVE, M-O, HAl, and a Garbage Cube. WALL-E fans can also grab the Criterion Collection's 4K Blu-ray edition of Pixar's Oscar-winning movie for only $25 (was $50).WALL-E and EVE is one of several great Lego Disney and Pixar deals available now. Amazon also has the 394-piece Inside Out 2 Mood Cubes set for $19.89 (was $35), the Up House for $37.70 (was $60), and the Toy Story Celebration Train & RC Car for $32 (was $40).WALL-E and EVE 43279 (Lego Disney Pixar)                                 Lego Disney Pixar: WALL-E and EVE (43279)                                                                $56 (was $70) | 811 Pieces                                                                                                                                                                                    Lego's store page for WALL-E and EVE doesn't list dimensions for each buildable figure, but we know that WALL-E is over five inches tall. The EVE figure looks to be about an inch or two taller. WALL-E's yellow body has a rusted, grimy look--the original looked freshly cleaned--which means the buildable M-O figure will probably try to clean the adorable little garbage collector with his spinning brush.All three robots have movable arms and heads. WALL-E has functional wheels, so he can perform his duties collecting and compacting trash. The openable hatch on his chest has a compartment for a brick-built Garbage Cube. WALL-E's pet cockroach Hal is built from a handful of bricks and can rest on the robot's shoulder.You can also recreate the scene where WALL-E shows EVE the plant he found. The set comes with a small buildable boot holding the tiny plant EVE protects and nurtures by storing it in her chest cavity.                      WALL-E and EVE each have storage compartments                                                                                                                                               The 811-piece build is part of Lego's series of building models geared toward adults and experienced builders. It has a lot of small pieces and features some intricate mechanisms. Plus, WALL-E has always been one of the most \"for adults\" Pixar films due to its stylistic choices and heavy themes. With few spoken lines of dialogue, the 2008 animated movie pays homage to the era of silent films. WALL-E uses expressive characters, striking set pieces, and clever camera techniques to deliver a cautionary tale about the destruction of our environment, technology dependence, consumerism, loneliness, and other prescient themes.WALL-E and EVE has been a massive hit for Lego since its release, which isn't really a surprise considering the popularity of the movie. It's not the first buildable WALL-E model from Lego. Back in 2015, WALL-E the robot made its brick-set debut in the Lego Ideas line. The 677-piece set retailed for $60 and was officially retired about a year later. Since then, the value of Lego Ideas WALL-E (21303) has skyrocketed. Today, a brand-new set is valued at approximately $320. Even preowned sets that are already assembled can pull in $200, according to Brick Economy, a great resource that tracks online marketplace sales. The value of the old WALL-E set hasn't moved much at all since the new set's launch, but the number of sales per week on marketplaces like eBay has dropped.So, if you've ever considered paying hundreds of dollars for Lego WALL-E, now you can get WALL-E, EVE, M-O, and more for only $56 instead. The WALL-E robot in the old set is a bit larger than the new one, but the new model looks more realistic, which isn't surprising since Lego continues to refine its engineering and design processes as time goes on. Save 50% WALL-E's Criterion Collection 4K Blu-ray EditionWALL-E: The Criterion Collection (4K Blu-ray)As mentioned, WALL-E's 4K Blu-ray edition from the Criterion Collection is on sale for only $25 (was $50) through Sunday, December 7, as part of Amazon's semiannual 50% off sale on Criterion's catalog. Released in 2022, the three-disc set has nearly four hours of special features and is packaged in a display-worthy case with original art and a booklet with sketches, commentary, script notes, and more cool behind-the-scenes content. The Criterion Collection version was approved by director Andrew Stanton and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10+. Disney's original 4K Blu-ray edition also comes with three discs and a bunch of special features, but it doesn't have as many and is limited to HDR10. It's still a great way to watch WALL-E, but it's currently priced at $29, so you'd be paying more for less content. The Criterion Collection version of WALL-E is the definitive physical edition.Side note: If you're interested in picking up WALL-E on 4K, you may also want to snag a copy of Flow on 4K Blu-ray for $25 (was $50). Like WALL-E, Flow won Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards and is in Criterion's catalog. This three-disc set is packed with bonus content, including a remastered edition of Flow director Gints Zilbalodis' first animated movie.                                                                                                                                               WALL-E and EVE are also featured in Lego's BrickHeadz figure series. Released in 2023, the 155-piece WALL-E and EVE BrickHeadz bundle is $15 and exclusive to the Lego Store.Lego brick-built M-O, Hal, the boot plant, and Garbage CubeMore Disney Pixar Lego Sets                                                                                                                                               Adult Pixar fans should also check out the Luxo Jr. Lego set. This 613-piece model lets nostalgic Pixar enthusiasts build the iconic studio mascot and the colorful ball he hops on to form the production logo you see before each movie. Part of the Lego Ideas series, Luxo Jr. launched in June for $70. Lego also launched a cute Toy Story Celebration Train & RC Car set for younger Pixar fans in June, and it's on sale for the first time at Amazon.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Entertainment giant Disney is hiring someone to join its Digital Entertainment team to work on an upcoming Star Wars game that has the ambitious goal of being a \"groundbreaking game experience that will herald the next generation of Disney to the world.\"The job ad for an Associate Art Director calls for someone who will work on the \"ambitious and exciting new project.\"\"Working with top-class industry talent, this role is perfect for the seasoned visionary leader looking to create something epic--guiding and collaborating with a robust group of creative and production leaders focused around a wonderfully rich and cohesive product that is truly Disney,\" reads a line from the description.The successful candidate will be the person who \"inspires and informs our development teams to deliver the most authentic world-class Star Wars experiences.\"This person will help \"shape the overall visual direction, safeguard IP integrity, and foster creative collaboration across internal and external teams.\"The person who gets the should will review art and visual design submissions with the aim of \"ensuring all assets meet our brand and quality standards.\" The person will also give feedback and should have a \"deep understanding of Star Wars lore.\"Naturally, this person will also collaborate with the teams at Lucasfilm.The job calls for someone with a lot of experience, including a minimum of seven years in gaming, film, or TV, and someone who has a \"broad and deep\" understanding of Star Wars. The person should also have \"extensive game development experience\" on \"top-grossing, critically acclaimed AAA games on console and mobile.\"What's more, the person who gets the job will be asked to travel globally to meet with partners spanning the world over.The job requisition has lots of details about what the person will do and what credentials they should have, but it does not say much of anything about what the game actually is. From the sound of the job ad, the project will be developed externally, which makes sense given Disney doesn't do much internal game development and instead licenses its brands to external teams.While this specific game remains a mystery, we do know about many in-development Star Wars games, including Star Wars Eclipse, a remake of Knights of the Old Republic, a new game from Amy Hennig, Star Wars: Zero Company, and a third Star Wars Jedi game at Respawn. The latest rumor is that Creative Assembly is making a Star Wars Total War game and that it may be revealed at The Game Awards.The frontrunner to become the next Disney CEO, Josh D'Amaro, is a big fan of video games. He shepared the $1.5 billion investment into Epic Games for the upcoming Disney x Fortnite project, and wants to do more with gaming going forward.Disney was at one time a bigger player in the world of video games, as the company had its own dedicated internal gaming division with Disney Interactive Studios. Disney also operated the once-popular Disney Infinity \"toys-to-life\" brand, but it also shuttered. Today, Disney's efforts in gaming mainly involve licensing its brands to other companies. In 2019, Iger spoke candidly about Disney's struggles making and publishing games internally, admitting, \"We haven't been particularly good...\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

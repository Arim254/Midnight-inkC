    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Hellblade developer Ninja Theory announced Project Mara in 2020, but it may not be going forward--and that might not be a very surprising thing. The game was described as an \"experimental title that explores new ways of storytelling.\" Now, reporter Jez Corden has said the game was \"only ever a concept\" and was not guaranteed to be seen through to release anyway.He added: \"It could be developed into a game some day, or evolve into something else.\"In 2020, Ninja Theory said Project Mara would be a \"real-world and grounded representation of mental terror.\" The description continued: \"Based on real lived experience accounts and in-depth research, our aim is to recreate the horrors of the mind as accurately and realistically as possible.\"Even back then, Ninja Theory referred to the project as \"experimental\" in multiple instances and said it was aiming to be a \"showcase of what could become a new storytelling medium.\"As for what Ninja Theory may be working on, Corden reported that the developer's next title, which he said on the Xbox Two podcast could be Hellblade 3, \"will be more combat-involved and interactive\" than the first two Hellblade titles. Those games were highly cinematic in nature, which pleased some and bothered others. In any event, Corden reported that Ninja Theory's next game will retain some of the cinematic qualities of those games.Microsoft's development teams are said to be working on numerous upcoming projects, including a StarCraft shooter, Wolfenstein 3, remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and a new Warcraft game.2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft is planning many celebrations. The ball gets rolling on January 22, which is when Microsoft will host the Xbox Developer Direct, focusing primarily on Fable and Forza Horizon 6. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Meta has shut down three of Oculus Studios' internal developers, new reporting has revealed. Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studio have all been impacted.Outlets suchs as The New York Times indicated that cuts were coming to Meta's Reality Labs business, which encompasses first-party VR game development. On Tuesday, developers from the three aforementioned studios posted on X and other social media websites, indicating that they had lost their jobs. UploadVR confirmed that the entirety of Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studios were impacted as part of this round of Meta layoffs. In a statement to Polygon, Meta's Tracy Clayton says these cuts were made so the company could focus on Wearables like its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. It's a significant gutting that massively reduces Meta's AAA first-party development capabilities for its Quest headsets. All three studios shut down today are also quite well known, and had storied histories prior their their acquisitions by Meta.Twisted Pixel Games initially gained fame thanks to Xbox Live Arcade titles like 'Splosion Man and Comic Jumper: The Adventures of Captain Smiley. It had worked on VR games for the past decade, just releasing Marvel's Deadpool VR in November 2025.Sanzaru Games was the studio behind Asgard's Wrath 2, which was a free pack-in title for the Meta Quest 3. Before that, it worked on the original Asgard's Wrath in VR and some Sony 3D platformer spin-offs like Secret Agent Clank and Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time.Finally, Armature Studio was founded by former Retro Studios developers and is best known for the Xbox One console exclusive ReCore. Its most recent game was an impressive VR port of Resident Evil 4 in 2021.As it stands, Beat Saber developer Beat Games and Batman: Arkham Shadow developer Camouflaj are still in operation, so Meta's first-party development capabilities aren't completely gone. Still, it's a heavy blow to VR game development as Meta is the most prominent player in the virtual reality space. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The franchise's success in print and on the big screen led to an inevitable manga adaptation, which returns later this month in a snazzy Deluxe Edition format. The first volume of the Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition will be available starting January 27, and preorders are available at Amazon--and best of all, it's currently discounted to $44 ahead of launch, saving you 20% off its standard $55 MSRP.                                 Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1                                                                $44 (was $55) | Releases January 27                                                                                                                                                                                    Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1 is a 604-page, leather-bound hardcover omnibus featuring the first three volumes of the original manga series that ran from 2000 to 2005. It's unclear if the Deluxe Edition's publisher Yen Press is including a new--hopefully more faithful--translation or the controversial script from the English editions published by TokyoPop. While the Japanese version of the manga closely follows the original novel's plot, the English adaptation--handled by veteran comic book writer Keith Griffen--made substantial changes, resulting in several major plot holes in the later volumes.Either way, considering TokyoPop's releases have been out of print for several years, this new Deluxe Edition will be the easiest way to read the manga adaptation of the wildly popular franchise. Volume 1 launches on January 27, and we expect the next volumes in the series to go up for preorder in the near future.                      Battle Royale would receive several sequel manga series over the years, but most of these are also hard to find due to their limited print runs. The most recent series in the IP is Battle Royale: Enforcers, which began serialization in 2022. Set decades after the original series, Enforcers takes place in the same universe. After a government artificial intelligence reactivates the infamous Program 68, the unruly kids of Daitoa Academy's Class F find themselves divided into squads, given weapons, and set loose to fight each other to the death. So far, four paperback volumes of the series have been released and translated into English.Battle Royale: Enforcers MangaVol. 1 -- $12 ($15)Vol. 2 -- $11.24 ($15)Vol. 3 -- $10.60 ($15)Vol. 4 -- $12 ($15)If you're looking to watch the movie that the book was based on, it is available on Blu-ray. A standard Blu-ray of the gory Director's Cut is priced at $25, and a pricy 4K version was released last year. This release includes a mix of Director's Cut legacy special features, the theatrical cut's bonus materials, and a striking steelbook cover.Battle Royale Blu-raysBattle Royale: Director's Cut -- $25Battle Royale: 25th anniversary (4K) -- $84For even more special edition manga releases, you can check out our gallery rounding up the best deluxe editions you can buy and preorder currently.

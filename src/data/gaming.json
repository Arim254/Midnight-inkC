    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 1, 2025 at 10:09AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                We've been waiting a really long time for Fortnite's Simpsons season, which has been rumored for what feels like a decade at this point. Finally, though, the time has come, and The Simpsons season is starting on the evening of Saturday, November 1. And it's one of the biggest Fortnite takeovers we've ever seen, with a Simpsons-themed battle pass, and entirely new cel-shaded map for Battle Royale, and a totally revamped loot pool--all for a season that lasts just a month.So, yeah, there's a lot going on here. Let's run through everything we know about so far--which is a lot, because Epic let a bunch of influencers play the new season and they've been sharing their content. Just keep in mind there's likely to be plenty of surprises in store as the season goes on.Fortnite x Simpsons battle passThis Simpsons-themed battle pass, which lasts for just a month, includes five skins. Three of them are Simpsons characters--Homer, Marge, and Ned Flanders--with the other two being Simpsons-fied versions of Fortnite characters Peely and Fishstick. Each of the skins has alternate styles, like Evil Homer and Witch Marge. The new Peely is the time-gated bonus skin--all the Simpsons characters are in the linear part of the pass. You can check out the full battle pass lineup here.While it's smaller than a normal battle pass, the Simpsons pass still costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and you can also unlock it by subscribing to Fortnite Crew.Fortnite x Simpsons new mapThe Chapter 6 island is gone, and it's been replaced with a slightly smaller map based on Springfield, the hometown of the Simpsons, which has a capacity of 80 players--down from the usual 100. The whole map is cel-shaded and full of well-known locations from the show, like Moe's Tavern, the Qwik-E-Mart, and the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. For some close-up looks at the new map, check out our gallery here.New Fortnite x Simpsons loot poolWith a couple of notable exceptions, the weapons making up this season's arsenal are existing Fortnite guns, while you take care of your health and shield needs with a pile of new Simpsons-themed items.The new Simpsons weapon is Mr. Blasty, a revolver with an exotic variant that attaches balloons to anyone you shoot with it. There's also the mythic Jebediah's Protective Helm, which protects you from a single headshot from any weapon.And there are a variety of healing items, some of which come with fun bonus effects--like how the Super Squishee makes you faster and gives you unlimited sprint, and eating a Blinky fish gives you temporary teleportation powers. There are more mundane healing items too, like Duff splashes and Krusty Burgers.Returning Fortnite weapons:Suppressed assault rifleStriker ARTactical ShotgunThunder ShotgunRanger ShotgunCompact SMGInfantry RifleSuppressed PistolShockwave GrenadesSidekicksStarting during the Simpsons season, you'll be able to buy little companions who will follow you around and emote sometimes. The first of these is Peels, a banana dog included in the Simpsons pass, and several others are slated to hit the item shop on November 7. No collab sidekicks have been announced yet, but some are surely on the way.But sidekicks have already inspired a lot of consternation amongst players, because you'll only be allowed to customize your sidekick's appearance once before locking it permanently. If you'd like to change, for example, your Raptor's scale color later, you'll have to buy it again. And judging by the rumored prices, doing so won't be cheap.Random in-match eventsEach match will include some sort of special event, like a meltdown at the Nuclear Power Plant, which will be revealed on the battle bus blimp at the start of each map. These events seem to be a bit more complicated than these sorts of Fortnite mechanics usually are, which is fun.Free stuffWe're starting Simpsons season with two new free items. The Kang and Kodos glider (pictured) is the new reward for linking your Epic Games and MyDisney accounts, replacing the First Order Stomtrooper they'd been giving away since May. If your accounts are already connected, the glider will be granted automatically without any action from you. The other item is the The Siiimpsooooons… wrap, which will be available as a Twitch drop for just the first two days of the season (November 1 and 2), after which it may be added to the item shop.As you'd expect, there is also a free umbrella glider, the Saftey Inspector 'Brella, which you can earn by winning a round of Battle Royale during Simpsons season.Fortnite-themed Simpsons episodesEach week of Simpsons season will add a new short Simpsons episode related to the game's ongoing storyline, in which Homer finds a piece of the Zero Point and uses it in stupid, irresponsible ways, like attaching it to his remote control. The first of these shorts was shown during the Season 4 finale event, and you can watch it here. Further shorts will drop on November 10, November 17, and November 24.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 1, 2025 at 2:42PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Fortnite's Simpsons takeover is now underway, and so for the next month or so, we'll be duking it out in Springfield and making use of a number of new Simpsons-themed items to help survive against our foes. But no collab takeover is truly complete without cosmetics, and Fortnite is adding tons of Simpsons skins and accessories both in the item shop and via the new Simpsons battle pass.The Simpsons pass is a relatively short one, with about 70 tiers of rewards vs the usual 200 in the linear part of the pass--as has been the case with all previous mini-seasons. The Simpsons pass includes five skins--Homer, Marge, Ned Flanders, Blinky Fishstick, and Springfielder Peely--each of which has substantial style options, along with accompanying sets of pickaxes, gliders, emotes, and so on. The new Peely is the bonus skin that'll become available starting November 11, though he's not just a Simpsons-looking Fortnite guy--it appears as though he'll have a Professor Frink alternate style as well.Befitting a season based on a sitcom, the accessories in the pass are full of mundane items, like a vacuum cleaner pickaxe and a shopping cart glider that has baby Maggie riding in it. And while the pass includes Homer, Marge, and Ned's classic looks, they also have really distinctive alternate styles, like Homer in a Devil costume, Marge in witch form, and Ned Flanders in his stupid, sexy ski outfit.Marge is the skin on Page 1, but in an extremely unusual move, buying this battle pass does not instantly unlock her. Instead, the instant unlock for this pass is the banana dog Peels, the first of the new Sidekicks. Sidekicks, which are being introduced for the first time this season, are little companions that will follow you around in Battle Royale and celebrate your victories. Most of these guys will be sold in the item shop, but Peels is the cheap first hit to get you hooked. Or at least that's the idea. Marge, meanwhile, can be unlocked once you've gotten everything else on Page 1.Despite being a short one, the Simpsons pass costs the usual 1,000 V-Bucks and is included with a month of Fortnite Crew. To see every new skin, style, and accessory included in Fortnite's new Simpsons battle pass, scroll on. Keep in mind there are still a few pages we can't see yet, like the final page of the bonus rewards, and everything that goes with Springfielder Peely.Sidekick: PeelsEmote: Lil Station WagonPickaxe: Whack-Uum CleanerEmoticon: Springfield Heart HandsSpray: Marge's New 'DoBack Bling: Homer's GiftSkin: Marge SimpsonGlider: Maggie's Cart-A-CopterSpray: El Barto Was HereSimpson Family HuntContrail: Too Many TVsWrap: Hairy SituationSkin Style: Witch MargeBack bling: Blinky Fugu FlailLoading screen: Blinkyfest 2025Emoticon: Triple BlinkBack bling: Tentacle BucketSkin: Blinky FishstickContrail: Billowing BeakersPicakaxe: Hazardous Fugu FlailBack bling: Hazardous Tentacle BucketBanner IconWrap: Blinky SludgeSkin style: Hazardous Blinky FishstickPickaxe: Flanders' Hi-Diddley-HoeGlider: Flavor Saver SailorEmoticon: Okily Dokily!Back bling: Leftorium Emergency KitSkin: Ned FlandersEmote: Stupid Sexy SkiingWrap: The Duality of DiddlyPickaxe: Flanders' Ski PolesLoading screen: Flanders' HuntSkin style: Stupid Sexy FlandersContrail: Donut DropperPickaxe: Electric HammerLoading Screen: Donut BreakBack bling: Emergency DonutGlider: Lazy Man Toilet SeatSkin: Homer SimpsonGlider: Gilded Lazy Man Toilet SeatEmoticon: D'oh!Wrap: Mmm...

It's similar to the situation back in May when Star Wars season replaced all the Fortnite guns with Star Wars blasters, but since The Simpsons is a sitcom and not a movie franchise about wars, Epic is going about things a little differently, by replacing most of the health and shield items with Simpsons food and drinks, while unvaulting a bunch of Fortnite weapons that have not been in the Battle Royale loot pool in a while.But there are at least a couple of Simpsons-themed weapons, even so. To start the season, we'll have the Mr. Blasty revolver, with an exotic variant that drops from the roaming Krusty the Clown boss NPC. Later on, we're expecting to see some other wacky Simpsons weapons, including Moe's absurd combo gun, the Deodorant Applicator, and the Makeup Gun, though none of those are confirmed yet.As I previously teased, The Simpsons season also includes a number of health and shield consumables that are based on stuff from the Simpsons, like Super Squishees and Krusty Burgers. Scroll on to learn more about the new items in the Simpsons season loot pool, as well as a rundown on the Fortnite guns you'll have at your disposal this season.Super SquisheeThis frosty beverage increases your health and/or shields and gives you an improved Slap effect, which makes you run fast, gives you unlimited sprint, and makes you glow.Blinky FishThe Blinky Fish provides health and grants a dash ability for a short period of time after you eat one.Mr. BlastyWe'll start the season with the highly accurate Mr. Blasty revolver, which has impressive range for a snub-nosed pistol. There's also an exotic version, which attaches balloons to the people you shoot with it, that drops from the Krusty the Clown boss.Jebediah's Protective HelmYou can steal this item--which grants complete protection from a single headshot, after which it falls off your head--from the statue of Springfield's founder, Jebediah Springfield, which is found in the Springfield Town Square.Krusty BurgerThe most unhealthy burger in the world grants, ironically, both health and shield regeneration when eaten.Returning weaponsThe returning arsenal of Fortnite weapons is relatively small, with two assault rifles (including a modless version of the well-liked Striker AR from Chapter 5, pictured) three shotguns, two SMGs/auto pistols, and one scopeless sniper. Epic referred to this as a \"back-to-basics\" loot pool, which sounds about right. Though, of course, the loot pool will get a lot more complicated as they add goofy Simpsons weapons over the course of the season. Meanwhile, Shockwave Grenades will once again be this season's staple movement item. You can check out the rest of the existing Fortnite guns in the new loot pool below.Suppressed Assault RifleCompact SMGTactical ShotgunThunder ShotgunRanger ShotgunInfantry RifleSuppressed Pistol    \n  \n                      "

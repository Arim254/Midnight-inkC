The update adds operator skins for characters from Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show, and there are plenty of limited-time game modes and events themed around the series.This Fallout event includes free and paid event passes filled with rewards, and you can see all the skins and more details here. Nuketown also gets a special \"Vault Town\" map variant, which includes a Nuka Cola bus, vault suits for the mannequins, and other decor themed around Fallout. Make sure to check out all the details for Season 1 Reloaded in Black Ops 7 and Warzone, including more weapons, multiplayer maps, and new Zombies content.Below, we highlight all the new Fallout-themed game modes players can enjoy. This includes modes for multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and even the campaign's Endgame.S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Mayhem - Multiplayer LTMIn the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Mayhem playlist, Black Ops 7's multiplayer maps are irradiated with toxic particles. These are 6v6 matches of Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint, and they feature \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs\" to help players keep their radiation at safe levels. The HUD features a Geiger counter to display exposure levels, and players will want to collect the buffs to avoid taking too much radiation damage.The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs include:Pumpkin Pie: Increased healthNuka-Cola Cranberry: Score multiplierJet: Increased overall speedPsycho: Improved hip fire accuracy and headshot damageRadAway: Cut down your current radiation level. An essential item for curbing the effects of the Wasteland’s irradiated air. Rad levels also drop after eliminating enemies and are further mitigated when engaged with the objectiveLuck Bobblehead: Increases the odds of finding better power-ups and RadAway from fallen enemies. Secure one early for a big advantage. (NOTE: All players wearing a Fallout-themed operator skin, including the two free skin rewards from the Fallout event pass, will start the match with this buff active automatically.)The Ghouls - Multiplayer LTMThe Ghouls is a spin on Call of Duty's Infected mode. In this mode, players spawn into the match as Vault Dwellers on irritated multiplayer maps. They must scavenge for perks and RadAway to help them survive, and each eliminated Vault Dweller returns to the match as a ghoul fighting against the dwellers. Players must survive as Vault Dweller or infect everyone as a ghoul to win.Project RADs - Zombies LTMThe Feral Ghouls and Deathclaws of Fallout invade both the Ashes of the Damned and Astra Malorum maps in this themed limited-time mode. In Project RADs, players are also exposed to increased levels of radiation with each passing round.This changes the mode's usual means of healing and earning Essence. Instead, these are replaced with a system of drops given by fallen enemies that assist the crew in keeping rad levels at bay and gaining vital resources.These drops include:Food Items: Hold your nose and take a bite out of some food to replenish health. But beware, some snacks are irradiated! Eating them will increase your radiation levelBottle Caps: Instead of earning Essence for eliminating enemies, players collect dropped bottle caps to gain resources to purchase map itemsRadX: Take a swig of this to reduce your current radiation levelRadAway: Remove all radiation from all playersDeathclaw Hunt - Endgame eventWhile it's not exactly an LTM, players can hunt down Fallout's infamous Deathclaws in Endgame. Deathclaws can be found in matches as a limited-time world event. For this event, a bomb blast reduces a portion of Avalon into a Fallout-inspired wasteland with toxic air. Players can fight through hordes of feral ghouls to take on a Deathclaw hunt for rewards.Power Armor Royale - Warzone LTMPower Armor Royale is a Fallout-themed spin on battle royale. This features 66 players in trios on Verdansk, where power armor can be obtained from air drops. Players will need to charge up Fusion Cores in order to use any power armor, but the suit will grant the user a health boost, jetpack thrusters, upgraded weaponry, and the ability to eject and detonate the suit.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                If you spend any time on social media, whether that be Bluesky or X, you may have seen some reports going around that Microsoft is preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs amidst the rising costs of artificial intelligence. Whether true or not, Microsoft's lead communications officer has come forward to refute the claims.A report on the site TipRanks said that Microsoft is \"considering massive layoffs\" this month, with the plan to cut anywhere between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs on the Azure Cloud, Xbox, and global sales teams. After circulating on Bluesky and X for a while, Windows Central editor Jez Corden purported that the news was \"false\" on Xbox's side of things. Not long after this, Microsoft CCO Frank X. Shaw--who's been at the company for nearly 17 years, according to his LinkedIn--chimed in to dismiss the report as well.100 percent made up / speculative / wrong.  — Frank X. Shaw (@fxshaw) January 7, 2026              There's a lot of skepticism under both Corden and Shaw's posts. However, Shaw has responded to a lot of the commentary, saying that he, too, \"eagerly awaits\" the news that he claims is wrong.None of this is to say that layoffs at Microsoft may not happen in some future. The company has gone through a myriad of job cuts recently. This just underscores that you can't believe everything you read online, as some--if not most--of it is engagement bait.That said, Microsoft has cut jobs at the company recently. In early July 2025, Microsoft laid off roughly 9,000 employees, with Xbox head Phil Spencer calling the cuts \"necessary\" for the company's enduring success. As a result of these cuts, several games were canceled and studios were closed so that the company could \"increase agility and effectiveness,\" Spencer said at the time. Despite those layoffs, though, Microsoft still reached a valuation of $4 trillion in late July 2025.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

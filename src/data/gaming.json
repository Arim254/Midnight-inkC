    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on January 9, 2026 at 11:02AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Well, this is different. Season 7 of Fortnite OG kicked off in December with a new OG pass--but unlike previous OG passes, half of this one was time-gated until January 9. The back half of the OG finally out now, and it turns out that Epic was just holding back additional styles for the skins in the first half of the pass. Sorry, everybody who got their hopes up (like we did) that a secret Ice King remix was coming.The Season 7 OG pass includes three remixes of skins from the Chapter 1 Season 7 battle pass--Voidwalker Lynx is unlocked instantly with a purchase of the pass, and you can earn Lt. Winter and Wonder Onesie by leveling up. Wonder Onesie has the most customization options of any OG pass skin thus far, as you can decorate her with any of the sprays or emoticons you have in your locker.Notably missing are the Ice King, who was Season 7's hero, and the Prisoner, who served as the season baddie. Midway through the original Season 7, the Ice King projected a gigantic magical phantom of himself standing over the island, and then unleashed a blizzard that coated the island in snow for several weeks. Presuming Fortnite OG will do that event again the way it has all the other Chapter 1 live events, it would make a lot of sense for a new Ice King skin to be on one of those hidden pages.Each of the three skins available in the Season 7 OG pass comes with a back bling, a pickaxe, a weapon wrap, a glider, and an emote. The pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and access to the pass is included while players are subscribed to Fortnite Crew, which costs $12 per month. Scroll on to see what you can unlock on the Season 7 OG pass.Skin: Voidwalker LynxWrap: Cosmic CatastropheBack Bling: Lynx's CatpackBanner IconPickaxe: Void Walker's ClawsSpray: Purrrfect ExecutionLoading Screen: Runic LungeEmote: A-Meow-Zing BeatEmoticon: Gift GrenadePickaxe: Festive CaneSpray: Oh DeerBack Bling: Winter King's BustWrap: Winter's GiftEmote: Llamacorn SleighLoading Screen: Winterfest SkirmishSkin: Lt.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.\"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,\" said Roh via Reuters. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be \"inevitable.\"The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing \"This Is an Xbox\" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.The lone bright spot from Roh's comments is that he mentioned that Samsung is working with its production partners on strategies to minimize the impact of the memory shortages.A recent report suggests that Nvidia may take a different approach to the increasingly high GPU prices by resurrecting its previously discontinued GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs. That has yet to be confirmed by Nvidia, which phased out the GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs in favor of the 40 and 50 series GPUs, both of which were more expensive and more advanced.As for Samsung, the company touted its plans to use Google's Gemini AI in 800 million units this year, which will continue the need for RAM across its family of products.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

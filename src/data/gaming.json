We will update this story if the deal is restocked soon.PlayStation's DualSense Edge Wireless Controller for PS5 and PC is on sale for $160 (was $200) at Amazon. The deal is only available for the original white/black version of premium controller. This is the lowest price ever for the DualSense Edge, but we'd expect this offer to disappear soon. In late October, Amazon had a $165 deal that disappeared within hours.Walmart, meanwhile, has the white/black and Midnight Black editions for $178 in its early Black Friday sale, but these deals will sell out, too.The DualSense Edge is to the PS5 what the Elite Series 2 is to Xbox. If you can stomach the price--even with the deal it's roughly $100 more than standard PS5 controller--the DualSense Edge is a fantastic controller for PS5 and PC. Along with the features found on the original, the DualSense Edge has the following key features:Two pairs of swappable paddlesThree pairs of stick caps: standard, tall dome, low domeTrigger locks with three stopping pointsTwo customizable Function buttons for menus/settingsBraided USB-C cable with optional connector housingHardshell carrying caseDualSense Edge Wireless Controller (PS5, PC, Mobile)You can read an in-depth breakdown of the DualSense Edge below. We've also included a list of the Limited Edition DualSense Controllers you can buy today. PlayStation released five new limited-edition PS5 controllers in October--two two of them are in stock at Amazon, and four are available at Walmart--so you have plenty of enticing options.                                 DualSense Edge PS5 Controller                                                                White: $160 (was $200) | Black: $178 (was $200)                                                                                                                                                                                    The DualSense Edge's enhanced build quality is immediately apparent when you grip the controller. It pairs all of the cool tech from the standard controller with premium, swappable components and useful input customization options.PlayStation's pro-style controller includes two different sets of remappable back paddles. It has traditional paddles that feel quite similar to the Elite Series 2. The other two paddles are smaller semicircles. You can only connect one pair at a time, but both designs are solid.The paddles can be swapped out in seconds. The hot-swappable design extends to the three different styles of analog sticks. Instead of connecting magnetically like on the Elite Series 2, the stick caps click into place.It retains the DualSense's adaptive triggers while adding switches that alter the travel distance. Including the default setting, there are three stopping points. The most restrictive setting effectively turns the triggers into buttons.The two programmable function buttons that can be used to cycle through up to 30 custom profiles as well as other settings such as audio volume.Profiles can be created in the DualSense Edge settings menu on PS5 or with the PlayStation Accessories app on PC. You can remap all of the buttons, adjust stick and trigger sensitivities, create deadzones, alter the intensity of the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, and save all of these settings to custom profiles. You can then assign those profiles to the function buttons, which allows you to quickly switch between setups while playing.The DualSense Edge syncs wirelessly to PS5, PC, Mac, and mobile devices via Bluetooth. For competitive players who prefer wired connections, the DualSense Edge comes with a removable lock. for the braided USB-C cable that prevents you from accidentally disconnecting the cord from the controller's port. Just like with the standard DualSense, adaptive trigger feedback and haptics are typically reserved for wired mode on PC.The controller and all of the components are neatly stored in the included hardshell carrying case. The DualSense Edge was previously only available in a combo white/black design, but PlayStation launched a Midnight Black edition earlier this year.                      It's also worth noting the Xbox Elite Series 2 is on sale for $140 (was $200) at Walmart and Target. Amazon had this deal last week but is sold out as of November 14.

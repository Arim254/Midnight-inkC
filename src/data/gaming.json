    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Meta has shut down three of Oculus Studios' internal developers, new reporting has revealed. Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studio have all been impacted.Outlets suchs as The New York Times indicated that cuts were coming to Meta's Reality Labs business, which encompasses first-party VR game development. On Tuesday, developers from the three aforementioned studios posted on X and other social media websites, indicating that they had lost their jobs. UploadVR confirmed that the entirety of Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studios were impacted as part of this round of Meta layoffs. In a statement to Polygon, Meta's Tracy Clayton says these cuts were made so the company could focus on Wearables like its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. It's a significant gutting that massively reduces Meta's AAA first-party development capabilities for its Quest headsets. All three studios shut down today are also quite well known, and had storied histories prior their their acquisitions by Meta.Twisted Pixel Games initially gained fame thanks to Xbox Live Arcade titles like 'Splosion Man and Comic Jumper: The Adventures of Captain Smiley. It had worked on VR games for the past decade, just releasing Marvel's Deadpool VR in November 2025.Sanzaru Games was the studio behind Asgard's Wrath 2, which was a free pack-in title for the Meta Quest 3. Before that, it worked on the original Asgard's Wrath in VR and some Sony 3D platformer spin-offs like Secret Agent Clank and Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time.Finally, Armature Studio was founded by former Retro Studios developers and is best known for the Xbox One console exclusive ReCore. Its most recent game was an impressive VR port of Resident Evil 4 in 2021.As it stands, Beat Saber developer Beat Games and Batman: Arkham Shadow developer Camouflaj are still in operation, so Meta's first-party development capabilities aren't completely gone. Still, it's a heavy blow to VR game development as Meta is the most prominent player in the virtual reality space. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Hellblade developer Ninja Theory announced Project Mara in 2020, but it may not be going forward--and that might not be a very surprising thing. The game was described as an \"experimental title that explores new ways of storytelling.\" Now, reporter Jez Corden has said the game was \"only ever a concept\" and was not guaranteed to be seen through to release anyway.He added: \"It could be developed into a game some day, or evolve into something else.\"In 2020, Ninja Theory said Project Mara would be a \"real-world and grounded representation of mental terror.\" The description continued: \"Based on real lived experience accounts and in-depth research, our aim is to recreate the horrors of the mind as accurately and realistically as possible.\"Even back then, Ninja Theory referred to the project as \"experimental\" in multiple instances and said it was aiming to be a \"showcase of what could become a new storytelling medium.\"As for what Ninja Theory may be working on, Corden reported that the developer's next title, which he said on the Xbox Two podcast could be Hellblade 3, \"will be more combat-involved and interactive\" than the first two Hellblade titles. Those games were highly cinematic in nature, which pleased some and bothered others. In any event, Corden reported that Ninja Theory's next game will retain some of the cinematic qualities of those games.Microsoft's development teams are said to be working on numerous upcoming projects, including a StarCraft shooter, Wolfenstein 3, remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and a new Warcraft game.2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft is planning many celebrations. The ball gets rolling on January 22, which is when Microsoft will host the Xbox Developer Direct, focusing primarily on Fable and Forza Horizon 6. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Deadpool is coming to Marvel Rivals alongside Season 6 on January 16, and in a first for the hero shooter, he will be able to play any role he chooses--Duelist, Vanguard, or Strategist.As explained by Deadpool himself in the Marvel Rivals Dev Vision video, he's heard the community's \"non-stop complaining online about how the game needs more Vanguards and Strategists,\" so he decided to do the NetEase development team a favor and just be all three roles.          That's far from the only unique part of Deadpool. In another meta move, Deadpool actually earns XP over the course of the match based on how \"stylish\" his actions are. That XP can then be used to upgrade his abilities via a comic book depending on what role he's playing until he's a self-described \"server admin.\"When he's a Duelist, Deadpool uses his dual pistols and katanas to shoot and slice his way through the enemy team. While playing as a Strategist, those same weapons can target friendly teammates to heal them. If he's taking on the role of a frontlining Vanguard, Deadpool can throw out unicorn plushies that deploy shields to protect teammates and block incoming damage.          Judging from his gameplay trailer, Deadpool looks to be a true menace, not only dashing around the battlefield and bashing his foes but also pummeling them with a variety of visual effects, whether it's a chibi Deadpool bonking an opponent with a hammer or a screenful of little Deadpools that make it difficult to tell what's going on. True to his nickname as the Merc with a Mouth, he also never stops talking, which will probably get old before long but is definitely in line with his character.Deadpool will launch alongside Season 6 on January 16. In addition to Deadpool, Season 6 will also add a new map set in the Collector's museum and introduce a photo mode. It will also add a dueling arena, bring big changes to hero proficiency rewards, and make a number of major hero and team-up balance changes. Halfway through the season another hero, Elsa Bloodstone, will join the game's roster, keeping true to the team's goal of releasing a new hero every month.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

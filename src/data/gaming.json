    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on October 31, 2025 at 3:33PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                We've been waiting a really long time for Fortnite's Simpsons season, which has been rumored for what feels like a decade at this point. Finally, though, the time has come, and The Simpsons season is starting on the evening of Saturday, November 1. And it's one of the biggest Fortnite takeovers we've ever seen, with a Simpsons-themed battle pass, and entirely new cel-shaded map for Battle Royale, and a totally revamped loot pool--all for a season that lasts just a month.So, yeah, there's a lot going on here. Let's run through everything we know about so far--which is a lot, because Epic let a bunch of influencers play the new season and they've been sharing their content. Just keep in mind there's likely to be plenty of surprises in store as the season goes on.Fortnite x Simpsons battle passThis Simpsons-themed battle pass, which lasts for just a month, includes five skins. Three of them are Simpsons characters--Homer, Marge, and Ned Flanders--with the other two being Simpsons-fied versions of Fortnite characters Peely and Fishstick. Each of the skins has alternate styles, like Evil Homer and Witch Marge. The new Peely is the time-gated bonus skin--all the Simpsons characters are in the linear part of the pass.While it's smaller than a normal battle pass, the Simpsons pass still costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and you can also unlock it by subscribing to Fortnite Crew.Fortnite x Simpsons new mapThe Chapter 6 island is gone, and it's been replaced with a slightly smaller map based on Springfield, the hometown of the Simpsons, which has a capacity of 80 players--down from the usual 100. The whole map is cel-shaded and full of well-known locations from the show, like Moe's Tavern, the Qwik-E-Mart, and the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.New Fortnite x Simpsons loot poolWith a couple of notable exceptions, the weapons making up this season's arsenal are existing Fortnite guns, while you take care of your health and shield needs with a pile of new Simpsons-themed items.The new Simpsons weapon is Mr. Blasty, a revolver with an exotic variant that attaches balloons to anyone you shoot with it. There's also the mythic Jebediah's Protective Helm, which protects you from a single headshot from any weapon.And there are a variety of healing items, some of which come with fun bonus effects--like how the Super Squishee makes you faster and gives you unlimited sprint, and eating a Blinky fish gives you temporary teleportation powers. There are more mundane healing items too, like Duff splashes and Krusty Burgers.Returning Fortnite weapons:Suppressed assault rifleStriker ARTactical ShotgunThunder ShotgunRanger ShotgunCompact SMGInfantry RifleSuppressed PistolShockwave GrenadesSidekicksStarting during the Simpsons season, you'll be able to buy little companions who will follow you around and emote sometimes. The first of these is Peels, a banana dog included in the Simpsons pass, and several others are slated to hit the item shop on November 7. No collab sidekicks have been announced yet, but some are surely on the way.But sidekicks have already inspired a lot of consternation amongst players, because you'll only be allowed to customize your sidekick's appearance once before locking it permanently. If you'd like to change, for example, your Raptor's scale color later, you'll have to buy it again. And judging by the rumored prices, doing so won't be cheap.Random in-match eventsEach match will include some sort of special event, like a meltdown at the Nuclear Power Plant, which will be revealed on the battle bus blimp at the start of each map. These events seem to be a bit more complicated than these sorts of Fortnite mechanics usually are, which is fun.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Embark Studios is clearly keen to keep building on the success of its latest game, Arc Raiders. The extraction shooter, which just launched to the biggest player numbers on Steam for the niche genre, is already growing and now there's a roadmap outlining its trajectory.Arc Raiders' roadmap provides a glimpse at the months ahead for the fresh third-person shooter on the market. As is typically the case, the live-service game will be receiving frequent updates fine-tuning the experience, ironing out any kinks, and steadily rolling out new cosmetics, feats and trials, as well as map conditions that should liven the playing field.Arc Raiders roadmap for the next several months.The most exciting news though has to do with two updates coming in November and December, respectively. The first is dubbed North Line, and it will feature an entirely new map called Stella Montis, bringing Arc Raiders' map count to five. North Line will also introduce a new community unlock event--these are typically goals and challenges for the entire game's community to work towards in order to unlock a reward--as well as equipment and quests. There will even be two new Arcs, the game's robotic enemies which tower over players, called the Matriarch and Shredder.Just a month later in December, another update called Cold Snap will be dropping just in time for the brisk winter holidays. As the name suggests, a new arctic map condition will arrive in the game as well as a complementary event called Flickering Flames. I reckon players should start preparing to fight one another in order to stay warm come December.Both updates will also let players rediscover \"what was lost in expanded Quests,\" according to Embark's announcement post. Only the Cold Snap update in December will pack in a Raider Deck though, Arc Raiders' rendition of a battle pass.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Grand Theft Auto 6 is just over six months away, but there's something brewing at the game's developer, Rockstar Games. The studio fired between 30 and 40 staff members from offices in the United Kingdom and Canada earlier this week. The terminated employees were reportedly attempting to unionize when they were let go.Bloomberg broke the story, and added that all of the fired employees were part of a private trade union chat group on Discord. According to a spokesperson for the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain, the group was a mix of members who had already joined the union and others who were trying to organize a union at Rockstar.\"Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry,\" said IWGB president Alex Marshall in a statement. \"This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.\"A spokesperson from Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said that it supported Rockstar's decision and alleged that the employees were terminated \"for gross misconduct, and for no other reason.\"This seems like the kind of dispute that may ultimately be settled inside of a courtroom, depending on what the British and Canadian courts have to say about it. This may take a long time for this to play out.Rockstar Games recently shared a job listing which predicted that GTA 6 will have the biggest launch in video game history. That seems very likely considering that Grand Theft Auto 5 passed 215 million in sales earlier this year, and GTA Online continues to be a cash cow for the company.Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick also noted that he isn't worried about AI competing with GTA, and he's been pretty consistent in his assessment of the technology. GTA 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

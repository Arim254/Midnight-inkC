    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The time of Halo: Infinite is coming to a close. Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.In a message posted to the official Halo site, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on \"multiple Halo titles in development.\" This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been saying for over a year now that there are multiple new Halo games in development.\"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us,\" reads the statement. \"While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.\"The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of the original Halo that will bring the franchise to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about a live-service Halo game, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed some light on the Halo MMO from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the Halo remake \"warms my heart,\" while another former Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                If you've received an Arc Raiders quest called Power Out and aren't quite sure where you need to go to get it done, you've come to the right place. This may be one of the game's most basic quests, but as with many of its outings, the act of getting there and getting back out can be more challenging than anything. So, we'll share the exact location of the quest below so that you can take some of the guesswork out, allowing you to focus on making the magic happen.You won't need to extract to complete Power Out, but you may potentially be making quite a trek to reach the quest location. It's not a bad idea to toss on a combat-focused augment with a good gun and shield, as well as plenty of ammo and healing items to ensure you're prepared to take on anyone standing in your way.When you're ready to tackle Power Out, follow the steps below.How to complete the Power Out quest on SpaceportThe first step to completing Power Out is to head all the way south on Spaceport to find the Electrical Substation. Depending on where you spawn on the map, this could be quite a trek, so while the area itself is pretty tame, don't be shocked to run into trouble on the way there.Electrical Substation locationOnce you arrive, you'll be prompted to find signs of an engineer who has gone missing, which is very easy to find. Identify the electrical box below.Electrical boxWhile looking at the electrical box, turn left and spot the engineer's bag a few steps away. Interact with it, take the item within, then return to the electrical box. Interact with the electrical box to place the item inside. Turn on the power to complete the quest.With the quest complete, your next goal is to extract. Unfortunately, due to being so far south on the map, you're going to have to walk quite a way to get to an elevator. Your choices are the South Elevator to the northwest or the East Elevator to the northeast, so make sure you're reloaded and healed up, then set off. We'll be rooting for your survival.For more on Arc Raiders, check out our full quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Flickering Threat requires you to jump into the Dam Battlegrounds map and fix up a power generator, so don't think you're getting any time off today. And if you're feeling a little lost on how to complete this quest, we're here to help you out.While you don't need to extract to complete Flickering Threat, you will need 4 Wires to repair the generator during the quest, so make sure to add those to your inventory or loot them from the Power Generation Complex while you're exploring. Without these in your inventory, the quest can not be progressed.When you're ready to tackle Flickering Threat, follow the steps below.Where to find the Generator HallThe Generator Hall is located on the left side of the Power Generation Complex in the northern region of the Dam Battlegrounds map. It's a high-traffic location that is often filled with both ARC and raiders, so come prepared for a fight just in case.Generator HallOnce you reach the Generator Hall, you'll be prompted to repair a generator. Here's to hoping you remembered to bring 4 Wires!How to repair the generatorTo repair the generator, head to the location on the map above and look for long openings in the ground. Use these to drop inside the Generator Hall. You can also get to this room via nearby doors and hallways, but dropping in saves a lot of time.Repair the generator using 4 Wires.Once inside, stand between the two elevators and look at the end of the westernmost one to see a prompt to repair it using 4 Wires. Interact with this prompt to finish your repairs. However, you'll now need to flip a power switch.Leave the Generator Hall via the southernmost door at the end of the hall. Follow the stairs up and through two more doors, then turn immediately left and pass through an additional two doors. In this room will be a box in the corner that you can interact with to turn the power on and complete the quest.Interact with this box to turn the power on.In this same room is a staircase leading up and onto the surface right near the North Complex Elevator. You can use this extraction point to return to Speranza--though you should be careful while doing so, as raiders frequently camp this spot and may try to kill you on sight. So, take it slow, and stay in cover while waiting for the elevator, then extract to return safely to Speranza.For more, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

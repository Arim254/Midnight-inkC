Unlike The Game Awards, the IGAs are an awards-only online ceremony that's dedicated to honoring its nominees rather than splitting the focus with game-reveal trailers. GameSpot is one of the partners for this year's IGAs, and below you can see .Where Can I Watch The Indie Game Awards?You won't have to go far to watch it. GameSpot will be livestreaming The Indie Game Awards on Thursday, December 18, starting with the countdown show at 3:30 PM PT / 6:30 PM ET.

It's a sign of how well indie games did in 2025 that titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades 2, and Hollow Knight: Silksong were nominated for top prizes in both The Game Awards and The Indie Game Awards. However, the various categories for each game are designed to spread the love, so to speak. That means a single title isn't likely to dominate the IGAs the way that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 did at The Game Awards.Game of the YearAbsolumand RogerBlue PrinceCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward VectorClair Obscur: Expedition 33Consume MeHades 2Hollow Knight: SilksongKeep DrivingPipistrello and the Cursed YoyoAchievement in AccessibilityAbiotic FactorBaristaCalm the StormPeakSpray Paint SimulatorSqueakross: Home Squeak HomeAfrican Indie Game AwardBru & Boegie Get Da Milk!Finding FatherFlibbius McDoogle and The Mysterious Flying MachineIKEELYAMetavoidalStick It To The StickmanANZ Indie Game AwardAbiotic FactorHollow Knight: SilksongMars First LogisticsPROXIMATETempopoThe DrifterBite-Sized GameCARIMARA - Beneath the Forlorn LimbsFlyKnightMany Nights a WhisperThe Dark Queen of Mortholmethis game will end in 205 clicks.Time FliesBlack Voices in Gaming AwardAdvent NeonAltheia: The Wrath of AferiSorry We’re ClosedSpirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 ToSunken StonesTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical TakedownCommunity ManagementConsume MeDate Everything!IKEELYAPEAKSoulstone SurvivorsStrange ScaffoldDebut GameClair Obscur: Expedition 33DiscountyFretless - The Wrath of RiffsonILA: A Frosty GlideSorry We're ClosedEmotional ImpactAfterlove EPand RogerDon't Get Your Hopes UpHenry HalfheadWanderstopWednesdaysGameplay DesignAbsolumBallxPitDawnfolkHades 2Hollow Knight: SilksongKeep DrivingLook OutsideÖooPipistrello and the Cursed YoyoThe King is WatchingInnovationBlue PrinceFREERIDEGas Station StoryPBJ The MusicalRuffy and the RiversideTaria & ComoLatin American Indie Game AwardAdventure of SamsaradespeloteKulebra and the Souls of LimboPipistrello and the Cursed YoyoTaria & ComoTormented Souls 2MusicEverhood 2HerdlingRift of the NecroDancerSONOKUNISword of the SeaWheel WorldNarrativeCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward VectorConsume MePromise Mascot AgencyThe DrifterThe Roottrees are DeadThe Séance of Blake ManorSolo DevelopmentLushfoil Photography SimMegabonkNAIADSpilled!Tall TrailsVile: ExhumedSoutheast Asian Indie Game AwardAfterlove EPArtis ImpactGlyphica: Typing SurvivalSEDAP!

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nBy \n    Eddie Makuch\n   on December 17, 2025 at 1:13PM PST\n              \n          \n                The Harry Potter game Hogwarts Legacy has now sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it among the best-selling games of all time.Warner Bros. Games made the announcement today, December 17, amid its parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's sale to Netflix, or Paramount. At 40 million sales, the game is a smash hit, but not quite close enough to break into the top 10 best-selling games ever. Hogwarts Legacy was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Games through its Portkey Games label, which handles Harry Potter games for the company.Hogwarts Legacy is set in the 1800s with players coming to Hogwarts as a fifth-year student as they learn spells and tame magical creatures. The game outsold Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III in North America in 2023, and that's a rare thing given how dominant Call of Duty has been.Unsurprisingly, Warner Bros. Games has said making a sequel is a major priority for the company, though the follow-up has yet to be formally announced. Another major fantasy franchise, Lord of the Rings, is said to be getting a Hogwarts Legacy-style game in the future. Hogwarts Legacy has been embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community. In this article, you will also find links to trans creators you can support, as well as charities you can donate to.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Developer Santa Ragione is reporting that its controversial indie horror game Horses sold 18,000 copies in two weeks. That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game.According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game.\"This result is not enough to begin production on a new game,\" reads the statement. \"The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.\"          It's been an uphill battle for Santa Ragione and Horses. The studio recently revealed that its title had been banned by Steam in 2023 without explanation. Subsequently, Horses was also banned by Epic Games Store and Humble Bundle just before its release. The cancellation of Horses by three of the major PC game distributors comes after a recent effort to target adult-oriented games on storefronts like Steam and Itch. There is definitely material meant for mature audiences in Horses, but the development team is calling for more transparency in the industry after it says it wasn't given a chance to make any changes to Horses in order for it to be released on Steam.\"We also want to emphasize that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce,\" wrote Santa Ragione's spokesperson. \"For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly. We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases.\"Horses is now available for $5 on GOG, and Itch.io.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

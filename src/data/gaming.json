These events feature new Halloween-themed costumes, five of which are available now, and more will be available in the shop later.The two Halloween events are Voyage to Astonish and Marvel Zombies. Voyage to Astonish is an event board, where you can move a piece around a circular board. Each space on the board features a reward, with some restricted to the premium version. The premium version, which costs 690 Lattice ($7), includes a Legendary Peni Parker Floral Flights costume, a Dia De Los Muertos-inspired skin, and a recolor for it called Skeleton.The board also includes a free skin for Blade, called Blade Knight, which has him dressed up like Moon Knight. To move around the board, you need to obtain Lanterns from completing event challenges. You need 21 Lanterns to collect all rewards. If you purchase the premium version, it will not expire, allowing you to earn rewards beyond the event.The second event is Marvel Zombies, which is a four-player PvE mode where you have to fight through zombie hordes to take down the queen of the undead. This mode is where you will complete most of the event challenges to earn Lanterns for the Voyage to Astonish event.In the store, and available for 27 days from October 24, are two legendary Halloween skins. You can get the Jeff the Land Shark Jeff O'Lantern skin and the Namor Phantom Tide skin. Each skin is available in an individual bundle with an MVP highlight, emote, nameplate, and spray, each costing 2,200 Units ($22, also earnable in-game). There is also a combo bundle, which gets you everything for 3,200 Units ($32).

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The newly announced Halo 1 remake that brings the series to PlayStation for the first time has no multiplayer support. It is a campaign-only experience. Why is that?Executive producer Damon Conn addressed this in a post on Xbox Wire. \"Focusing on the campaign experience means we can concentrate fully on really capturing the atmosphere, tone--the emotional impact of what made the first campaign so special and iconic,\" Conn said.While there is no multiplayer in the new Halo: Campaign Evolved, the game delivers some extras that weren't in the original 2001 release, including three new prequel missions and the ability to sprint. The game was made in Unreal Engine 5 and is likely to be followed by a brand-new Halo live-service game.           \"We wanted to start where it all began, with the original campaign that defined Halo,\" Conn said. \"Starting here means people that have never played the game before will be able to understand the story from the very beginning, and that can help us chart a course forward with new Halo stories.\"For more, be sure to watch the trailer above to see the new Halo: Campaign Evolved in action. The game launches in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Pricing has not been announced, nor has a specific release date.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

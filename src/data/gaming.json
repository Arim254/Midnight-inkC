    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Even the most expensive advertising campaigns are nothing without a good Steam review score. A studio that manages to shift a game's review score from \"Mixed\" to \"Very Positive\" can as much as triple its chance of making a sale from a marketing campaign, a new games industry report has shown.Games marketing firm Gamesight published the statistic in its latest Performance Marketing Playbook, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz. Gamesight charted the conversion rates of 30 premium games against their respective Steam review scores, showing that every game with a conversion rate over 2% boasted a Steam review rating over 80% positive.The report also included a case study that followed a single unnamed game's 21-month marketing campaign, charting the campaign's success against its review score at the time. The game generally saw a higher conversion rate when its review score was higher, with the conversion rate peaking at over 7% when the game briefly achieved a rating of \"Overwhelmingly Positive.\"Gamesight says it saw similar patterns in other games it studied, while the firm also identified how studios could improve their review scores. \"Both from this analysis and our experience working with game developers, we consistently see things like game patches, bug fixes, and adding player-requested features tend to be at the center of these sentiment improvements,\" Gamesight data analyst Marlie Tandoc said. The case study game also follows this trend, with its Overwhelmingly Positive spike occurring when the developer added a feature that had been highly requested by players.Overall, the marketing firm concludes that listening to players and taking their feedback on board is just as important to a game's success as the money that goes into marketing it. There is one major exception to this trend, however--Gamesight added that free-to-play games saw \"no measurable impact\" from review scores, as players can simply try the game out with no cost barrier.A number of successful games have already followed this playbook, with games like No Man's Sky and Helldivers 2 both seeing major review score turnarounds by implementing updates in response to player feedback. Steam also recently changed the way it displays review scores, acknowledging the major impact these scores can have on a game's success.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Anyone who wants a home in Azeroth can claim one, and Blizzard's decorating toolset allows for what feels like close to infinite creative possibilities when it comes to decorating them.Housing in WoW is in many ways a game within a game, and it's clear many players are treating it as such. As players level up their housing level, they gain access to new types of rooms, the ability to place more decoration items, and more. Of course, WoW is now littered with all kinds of housing rewards too, which can be earned by completing dungeons, raids, achievements, bought from special vendors, or even crafted by other players.It's a system that will continue to evolve and expand over time, as Blizzard intends it to be a core pillar of the MMORPG going forward. Players, for example, are already requesting a higher decor placement limit for exterior decorating, and the base homes players have to choose from currently only come in human or orc-themed flavors. But having some limitations can actually be a boon to creativity, as players are using what they have available, and Blizzard's flexible tools, to conjure up some remarkable housing marvels.While it may have taken 21 years to arrive, players have wasted no time building all manner of fantastical homesteads and mind-blowing creations since housing went live on December 2, 2025. From airship homes to giant mechs, cathedrals to Hobbit holes, the creativity levels are off the charts. Here's a roundup of all the best WoW player housing creations we've seen so far, with more sure to come.Pure CinemaFly, Fly AwaySource: XMobile HomeA Long Time Ago...Grocery RunBy The LightIn A Hole In the Ground Live A HobbitAmong The TreesCanceling The ApocalypseHowl's Moving Gnomish CastleViking FeastHome Sweet ArgusSpooky CottageGarden of EluneMy Other House Is A TardisThe Great Pyramid Of ZandalarYou're A WizardGoing To Have Myself A TimeIt's Like Nascar For ParticlesElven Elegance    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Warner Bros. Discovery has officially rejected Paramount's revised offer to buy the company, saying it was \"not in the best interests of WBD and its shareholders.\" The offer also does qualify as a \"superior proposal\" based on the definition in WBD's pact with Netflix that was announced back in December.After WBD announced a deal with Netflix, Paramount launched a hostile bid, appealing directly to WBD shareholders. Paramount later sweetened the deal, including a massive $40.4 billion guarantee from Larry Ellison, but WBD's shareholders rejected this as well.WBD's board of directors said on January 7 that it continues to recommend that shareholders approve Netflix's bid and reject Paramount's.As announced previously, Paramount's offer was $30 per share for the entirety of WBD, compared to $27.75 from Netflix for select pieces of the group, including its film, TV, and gaming divisions. Paramount's offer would amount to many billions of dollars more for WBD, but there are numerous other factors involved in the terms of the transaction as well.WBD board of directors chair Samuel A. Di Piazza Jr. said in a statement, \"Paramount's offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed.\"Contrasting this, he said WBD's deal with Netflix offers \"superior value at greater levels of certainty, without the significant risks and costs Paramount's offer would impose on our shareholders.\"Again, Netflix is trying to buy most, but not all of WBD's assets, whereas Paramount was seeking to take ownership of every part of the company.Both Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Paramount boss David Ellison have personally met with US President Donald Trump. His son in law, Jared Kushner, was originally involved in Paramount's hostile takeover bid for WBD through his company Affinity Partners, but later dropped out.There is a gaming angle here, too, as whichever company acquires WBD--which now looks even more likely to be Netflix--may also take ownership of the company's vast gaming division, which owns numerous game franchises and studios. There is also the possibility that a deal does not materialize at all, for any number of reasons.Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) recently discussed why she believes media consolidation in this manner will negatively impact consumers, saying she would prefer no deal to happen at all.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

In total, five more games will be removed, with three leaving Game Pass on December 15 and two on December 31.One of the first games going is Mortal Kombat 11. You'll still have a few days to play it after Mortal Kombat 1 is added to Game Pass on December 10, and it's still our pick for the best entry in the decades-long fighting game franchise. You can also say goodbye to the nerve-wracking horror game Still Wakes the Deep, an intense game of cat-and-mouse as you seek to escape an oil rig and the malevolent force pursuing you. Roguelite deckbuilder Wildfrost rounds out the December 15 departures.The two games leaving on December 31 are Carrior and Hell Let Loose. Fans of John Carpenter movies like The Thing will be sad to see Carrion go, as this horror-fueled metroidvania does a great job at making you feel like a monster that snacks on humans for fun. Hell Let Loose is the final title leaving Game Pass in 2025, so you only have a few more weeks to play this hardcore World War II multiplayer shooter.Game Pass subscribers can purchase these games for 20% off before they're removed from the service. With hundreds of games to choose from, it can be daunting to figure out what to play next, but you can check out GameSpot's feature on the best Game Pass titles to play in 2025.Mortal Kombat 11Mortal Kombat 1 is leaving Xbox Game Pass for console, cloud, and PC on December 15.Still Wakes the DeepStill Wakes the Deep is leaving Xbox Game Pass for console, cloud, and PC on December 15.WildfrostWildfrost is leaving Xbox Game Pass for console, cloud, and PC on December 15.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                YouTube has published its list of the top trending topics of 2025, and once again, gaming and pop culture were popular choices for what people watched on the video-streaming website. Out of the trending topics--which aren't ranked in any particular order--US YouTube viewers devoured any content related to the Switch 2 console, Roblox, and the RPG-strategy game Cookie Run Kingdom. Other topics of interest in the US included KPop Demon Hunters, Labubu collectible dolls, and the hit anime series Blue Lock.Roblox user-generated experiences and the Switch 2 continued to be popular topics on YouTube worldwide, especially in countries such as Korea, Germany, Mexico, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom. YouTube says that it determined the top trends for the US and other regions through \"a variety of signals,\" including views, uploads, and creator activity around the topics. Only the topics that were determined to have had conspicuous popularity this year--either because they were new to 2025 or because they saw significant increases in their user-interest metrics--were eligible for the list.YouTube Trending Pop Culture Topics in the US for 2025Squid GameUser-Generated Roblox Experiences: Grow A Garden, Dandy's World, Forsaken, Steal A BrainrotKPop Demon HuntersBrainrotLabubuNintendo Switch 2Cookie Run KingdomBlue LockKatseyeWhile Roblox has seen its popularity reach new heights in 2025, that has also brought new scrutiny to the game-creation platform, following accusations that it is infested with child predators who prey on its young userbase. Recently, Roblox Corporation CEO David Baszucki unveiled an initiative to introduce a new face-scanning feature to increase child safety, but an interview with The New York Times yielded some questionable responses from him.Meanwhile, Nintendo's new Switch 2 era is off to a great start. The company had sold more than 10 million Switch 2 units by the end of September, and Nintendo predicts it'll sell 19 million Switch 2 consoles by the end of its business year, up from its initial estimate of 15 million. If Nintendo reaches that number, the Switch 2 will have sold far more than the original Switch, PS4, and PS5 consoles did during their respective launch years.As for the other YouTube trends, there aren't any real surprises here. KPop Demon Hunters has been a runaway success since it debuted on Netflix--and its soundtrack has been inescapable--while Labubu toys have been a hot commodity, driven in part by KPop celebrity endorsements and blind box sales.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Peacock's Twisted Metal TV show, which is based on Sony's game series, is coming back for a third season, it seems. Variety reported that the show will get a third season, but showrunner and co-creator Michael Jonathan Smith will leave.The Hollywood trade site reported that The Boys writer David Reed will replace him in that role, and will be an executive producer as well as part of a deal with Sony Pictures Television. Deadpool veterans Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are the other co-creators of Twisted Metal, and they are said to be returning for Season 3.          Twisted Metal Season 2 debuted in July and was a big hit for Peacock, becoming the platform's second-biggest returning original scripted season ever.Season 2 stars Anthony Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz, and Anthony Carrigan, with Samoa Joe and Will Arnett combining to bring Sweet Tooth to life for the body and voce of the character, respectively.The Twisted Metal TV show is produced under the PlayStation Productions banner, which helps steer film and TV adaptations of PlayStation games. PlayStation Productions has numerous projects in the works, including Horizon, Days Gone, Ghost of Tsushima, and Helldivers movies, along with the god of War TV show.Twisted Metal did not receive a nomination for Best Adaptation at The Game Awards this year. The nominations instead went to A Minecraft Movie, the Devil May Cry TV show, The Last of Us: Season 2, Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, and the Until Dawn movie.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                This week, Fortnite made the jump to Xbox PC Store, which is the first time the game has been available on a launcher outside of the Epic Game Store. Unfortunately for both Epic and Microsoft, the transition appears to be going very badly.As demonstrated on social media by The Verge's Tom Warren, Fortnite's Xbox PC Store launcher almost immediately goes to an error message and a crash. Warren later noted that he applied an update to the game, and attributed the problem to \"the typical Xbox PC launch woes.\"A player on X named Nick added that the Fortnite's initial download on his Xbox PC Store launcher had no audio and dropped frames. \"Uninstalled and reinstalled after patch and now it doesn't work,\" added Nick. Another player suggested that Epic's decision to push back an update may have played a role in causing the error on Xbox PC Store.The game launched well, but it looks like when epic pushed the latest update they did some sort of override to the whole installation making the game only 10MB only installing the executables but not the binaries. At this point it cant not be installed properly until we get a fix  — enzorojopasion (@EnzoRojoPasion) November 18, 2025              For now, the issue remains unresolved. In the meantime, Fortnite Crew was added to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate today. It gives Game Pass Ultimate subscribers the same benefits as a standalone Crew subscription, including access to the current battle pass, music pass, OG pass, Lego Pass, and a monthly stipend of 1,000 V-Bucks and a Crew skin for every month the subscription remains active.Epic recently teased the introduction of Homer Simpson clones in Fortnite by staging an invasion of Homers in Santa Monica, California. The company has also shared plans to allow Unreal Editor for Fortnite developers to make Fortnite Creative modes, or \"islands,\" to sell in-game items using the game's real-money currency, V-Bucks. This has led to fears that Fortnite Creative is going pay-to-win.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                As of November 18, Fortnite Crew is now an included benefit with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. That certainly appears, on its face, like a pretty solid deal, but on the other hand, Game Pass Ultimate got a significant price bump at the same time Fortnite Crew was added, so there are some other factors you might want to take into account before signing up.Let's take a look at the details to see what kind of value this really is.Table of Contents [hide]What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite CrewWhat Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite CrewXbox Game Pass Ultimate includes a large library of games for both Xbox and PC, including most titles published by Microsoft and its subsidiaries, which include Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Yes, that includes the newly released Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The Ultimate plan is the only version of Game Pass that is guaranteed to include new games published under the Xbox banner on day one, and it's also the only tier to include subscriptions from two other publishers--Ubisoft Classics, and EA Play. Fortnite Crew benefits are exactly the same if you subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate as they would be if you bought a standalone Crew subscription. You get access to the current battle pass, music pass, OG pass, and Lego Pass as long as you're subscribed, you'll receive 1,000 V-Bucks and a Crew skin each month you're subscribed, and you'll also get the premium Rocket Pass for Rocket League.What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costsXbox Game Pass Ultimate now costs $30 a month, a sizable jump from its previous price of $20. By itself, Fortnite Crew costs $12 per month.Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?There are many ways to play Xbox these days, including consoles, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, and on handhelds like the ROG Xbox Ally--and all Game Pass games are playable via any of those methods. To receive your Crew benefits, you'll need to log in to Fortnite on any of the above-mentioned Xbox platforms at least once each month, and then you can use those benefits while playing on any other platform.But it wouldn't make a lot of sense to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate unless you plan to play some of the other games that are included. It's not a good value to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate just for Crew.What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?If you sign up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate while you have an active Fortnite Crew subscription through Xbox, the Crew subscription will automatically be canceled. The official FAQs do not say whether you'd receive a pro-rated refund or credit for additional time that might have been remaining on your Crew subscription in that situation, but it would be standard practice to do so.What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?If you're subscribed to Fortnite Crew through, say, the PlayStation Store, you won't get any additional bonuses in Fortnite from being subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate until the subscription on PlayStation ends. So you may want to cancel your existing Crew subscription and let it run out before signing up for Game Pass Ultimate, if the Crew subscription is one of the deciding factors in your purchase.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

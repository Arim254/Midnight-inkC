    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The South Korean band Stray Kids is coming to Roblox today, and they'll be unleashing the SKZOO from now and through the weekend while promoting their new album, Do It. As seen in the clips below, Stray Kids' anthropomorphic avatars will be performing their songs in-game as virtual concerts.Stray Kids-related items are also hidden in four different Roblox experiences, with two items per game. Players can collect all eight items and bring them to the Block to watch Stray Kids perform and receive additional free items from the band. However, this event will only run until 10 AM PT/1 PM ET on Monday, December 22.In other Roblox-related news, the platform has been banned in Russia and accused of negatively impacting children, and apparently considers the dissemination of LGBTQIA+ content to be a crime. But Russia isn't alone with its accusations that Roblox hasn't done enough to protect kids from child exploitation and grooming. A June 2024 Bloomberg investigation reported that the platform is rampant with predators. More recently, Florida and Texas have sued Roblox over that issue.Last month, Roblox revealed new initiatives to keep children from talking to strangers, and limit their interactions to kids roughly their own age. Roblox CEO David Baszucki has \"categorically rejected\" the lawsuits' depiction of the platform's safety measures. He also said that Roblox has done \"an incredible job at innovating\" and added that it's \"constantly getting better\" at protecting children's ability to chat with each other in-game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

TOSY also makes a bunch of other great stocking-stuffer-type gifts, from fidget spinners to magnetic puzzle cubes.

The 4K Blu-ray releases for each film support Dolby Vision, HDR10, and Dolby Atmos audio, and offer their own selection of bonus materials, including new behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, music videos, audio commentary tracks, and more.                      If you've never seen these films, then you've missed out on some of the most influential movies of all time. Top Gun was a blockbuster hit that cemented Tom Cruise's stardom, combining incredible aerial photography and action set against some of the era's chart-topping pop and rock songs. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, one of John Hughes' best films, follows Bueller (Mathew Broderick), his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara), and his best bud Cameron (Alan Ruck) as they take an unscheduled break from school. The Untouchables is a ruthless turn-of-the-century gangster movie with an all-star cast, while Trading Places saw John Landis put his own spin on Wall Street, and Beverly Hills Cop is a breakout action-comedy hit that made Eddie Murphy a household name.Lots more vintage movie Blu-rays are currently on sale, if you're hunting for easy stocking-stuffers. James Bond fans can pick up various bundles dedicated to different 007 eras, or for a license to thrill, there's The James Bond Collection of 24-film Blu-rays for only $55 (was $120).Horror movie aficionados aren't being left out in the cold either, as the Halloween 4K steelbooks and bundles are on sale for their lowest price to date, and an Amazon-exclusive Steelbook Edition of The Dead Zone on 4K Blu-ray has also been discounted to its best price yet.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:                                Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Mortal Kombat Cabinet Gets First Discount                         Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33                         Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (5)                 Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals                         Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price                         Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time                         ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld Is On Sale For Only $489 For A Limited Time                         Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Diego Nicolás Argüello\n   on November 5, 2025 at 2:02PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Discord servers rejoice: Peak has just gotten a new major update called The Roots. The multiplayer climbing game from Aggro Crab and Landfall is introducing another biome into the existing roster, and its theme is quite terrifying.Available today, The Roots might seem similar to Tropics at first glance, but it's got a totally different vibe. Think of it more like a forest than a jungle, packed with its own enemies, traps, and weather hazards. In addition, you can also expect an assortment of fresh items to play with and totally not ruin your current run with friends.From new edible mushrooms with mysterious properties to scary bugs and occult items, there's a lot to unpack. Before you schedule a time and date with the group chat, make sure to check out what's new in Peak with The Roots update below, including the full patch notes at the bottom.If you're looking for some guidance returning to the game, we have guides covering how to get the 24 Karat badge, where to find the secret entrance, how to do the Scout Cannon glitch, where to find the Scoutmaster, and a list with all items available and what they do. In addition, we've also listed the 10 best Peak mods available.New biome enters the rotationThe Roots joins the official Peak lineup of biomes. As of launch, The Roots is replacing Tropics and will be present in every run until November 17. After this date, future maps will rotate randomly between the two. As a summary, Roots is a redwood forest filled with mushrooms--some of which have mysterious properties--as well as some rather obscure creature sightings. If you're not a fan of spiders, make sure to activate the Bug-Phobia mode in the options menu. You've been warned.New enemies to contend withThe Roots introduces a new assortment of enemies that will shake up your expeditions. This includes spiders that can hang from branches and grab you before letting go and potentially ruining a climb, as well as giant beetles. Oh, and there are zombies as well. The update might not have been launched right on time for Halloween, but it definitely carries the spirit.There's a bunch of new itemsExpeditions live and die by the items you find, and there'll be plenty of new strategies to consider with the new update. In terms of Roots-specific items, you'll find the Cloud Fungus, Bounce Fungus, and Fortified Milk. There are also Shroomberries, which have a random effect that cycles out every day alongside the map. The developers mentioned that there are more items, but they are leaving it up to players to discover them.There are also new items that you can find in every biome, including the Rescue Claw, Checkpoint Flag, and Book of Bones, the latest being a new mystical item. Curioser and curioser.Cooking has been overhauledThe cooking mechanic in Peak has undergone some significant changes. Now, a lot more non-food items will have an effect when cooked. Cooked usable but non-food items, such as bandages, for example, will no longer grant additional stamina. Lastly, cooked poisonous berries will now be safe to eat. That being said, you still can't cook the poison out of mushrooms. Try not to burn anything during your experiments.New badges and emotesThe Roots is a massive update, and it's one that also focuses on the smaller, yet important elements that make Peak so fun to play and revisit. Mainly, there are eight new emotes available, plus a total of 11 new badges related to the latest biome. We have the full list here, but be wary that it might spoil a few surprises.Full Peak The Roots Update Patch NotesMAJOR FEATURES Added a new biome: the ROOTS.11 new badges to earn, each with associated cosmetics to unlock as rewards!New Roots-specific Items:  Shroomberries: Each color of Shroomberry gives a random effect, which cycles out every day alongside the map.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Bitmap Bureau and Reef Entertainment's throwback side-scrolling game, Terminator 2D: No Fate, has had some trouble getting out of the gate. Earlier this year, No Fate was pushed back to a Halloween release date. Then in September, the game was delayed to late November because of tariffs, according to the publisher. Now, Terminator 2D has been pushed back again, hopefully for the last time.In a post on Steam, Reef Entertainment set a new launch date, December 12, for both the physical and digital versions. The company adds that it has the discs in hand, but it needs extra time to put together the physical editions.\"We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays,\" reads the statement. \"We don't take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we're almost there. Thank you again for standing by us. We're incredibly grateful, and we can't wait for you to finally experience Terminator 2D: No Fate soon.\"The game is a loose adaptation of Terminator 2: Judgment Day that lets players control Sarah Connor and the heroic T-800 as they try to protect John Connor from the T-1000. If they live long enough, they may even prevent Skynet and its machines from nearly exterminating the human race. Players will also be able to control the adult John Connor during levels set in the future war against Skynet.Terminator 2D: No Fate will have two physical editions. The standard edition will go for $60, while a collector's edition has been priced at $120. The latter includes a reversible box art sleeve, a cloth poster, a 25mm collectible metal arcade coin featuring the game's logo, a full-color manual, and a collector’s box.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n          \n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n    \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders is all about making the most of every run as you amass a backpack full of loot and try to make it back to Speranza in one piece. And while the majority of what you find while scavenging topside will be useful materials and weapons, you'll also occasionally come across items that are designed to be sold for some extra cash. These items, known as trinkets, are designated by a small diamond symbol on their icons to indicate that they can be sold for profit. But they're not all created equally.Trinkets come in four rarities: Common (White), Uncommon (Green), Rare (Blue), and Epic (Purple). While there is occasionally variation between selling prices even among trinkets of the same rarity, these identifiers help to give you an idea of whether you've stumbled upon something truly special or not, with higher-tier items typically bringing in a bigger chunk of change.In addition to being a way to rake in more money, a few trinkets also have uses back in Speranza. Whether it's an item a trader is seeking for a quest or a material to aid in upgrading Scrappy, you'll want to be certain you don't sell something you're going to need later.We've compiled all of the trinkets in Arc Raiders alongside their rarity, selling price, and information about whether you need them for a quest. There are certain to be additional trinkets added down the line, too, so we'll be sure to update this when that time comes.All trinkets and prices in Arc RaidersHere is a list of every trinket currently available in Arc Raiders sorted by selling price.

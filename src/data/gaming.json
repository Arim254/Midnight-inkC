    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 doesn't release until November 14, but Treyarch is already breaking down the content players can expect in the first season. The developer's latest Dev Talk video confirmed seven new multiplayer maps, three zombies maps, new weapons, seasonal events, and more for Season 1 of Black Ops 7.This new Black Ops 7 Dev Talk video boasts that Season 1 is packed with content across multiplayer and Zombies. \"This will be the biggest season we've ever done in franchise history,\" said senior director of production Yale Miller.          There are seven 6v6 maps confirmed for multiplayer, and this will be a mix of new and remastered maps. The video shows a brief look at Fate, which is a brand-new map inspired by the game's campaign mission called Time and Fate. This features a trippy setting of fractured and floating building pieces from a city in Nicaragua. Other maps briefly shown are Odysseus, which is based on the campaign mission of the same name, and Utopia is a futuristic Guild facility based in Australia. For the season's remasters, Meltdown from Black Ops 2 will return in Season 1 of Black Ops 7.The developer also confirmed map changes were being made based on community feedback from the beta. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce said that the team is looking at all the doors across Black Ops 7's entire map pool to see where it can reduce automatic doors without disrupting gameplay.Seven weapons are coming in Season 1. Scronce confirms the fan-favorite Maddox assault rifle from Black Ops 4 is included in the lineup. A crossbow and the ballistic knife are also returning.Black Ops 7 launch content and Season 1 roadmapAs for game modes, the return of Treyarch's crossbow and ballistic knife also means the popular Sticks and Stones party mode is packed into the Season 1 update. Prop Hunt and seasonal limited-time modes are confirmed as well.For Zombies, there will be three maps. Season 1 is confirmed to have one brand-new round-based map and two survival maps based on locations from the Ashes of the Damned launch map. The update will add more augments, field upgrades, ammo mods, and other Zombies content. Players can also expect two limited-time holiday modes for Zombies on the season's new round-based map.Additionally, the Black Ops 7 variant of Nuketown arrives on November 20, so players won't need to wait long after launch to start receiving more content.Treyarch's previous Dev Talk video discussed multiplayer changes players can expect at launch, including adjustments to the game's movement, aim assist, and perks.Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In side-by-side comparisons, PlayStation 5 games have tended to have an edge over their Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S counterparts. The Outer Worlds 2, however, flips that script by having a better performance on Xbox than either PS5 or PS5 Pro, according to Digital Foundry.          0n the surface, The Outer Worlds 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X look very similar, but a closer examination reveals that the former suffers from image breakup, lower resolution, frame rate drops, and screen tearing even in performance mode. Digital Foundry also noted small lighting downgrades in PS5.As for the PS5 Pro, the report states that it uses Sony's proprietary upscaler, PSSR, which doesn't interact well with The Outer Worlds 2's lumen lighting or RT lighting effects. The report concludes that PS5 Pro's \"frame rate dips and more intense encounters are common, and the general run of play is noticeably worse than Series X in the finished game.\" It goes on to speculate that The Outer Worlds 2 may have utilized some proprietary hardware features in Xbox Series X|S that neither the PS5 nor PS5 Pro have.Obsidian Entertainment recently introduced players to Outer Worlds 2's six companion characters who can't be romanced, before revealing that they can turn on the player if given a compelling reason to do so. The studio also unveiled a Moon Man plushie called a \"Couch-Panion,\" which is the prize for winning a contest running through November 16. Players don't have to rely on a contest to get a pair of limited-edition, customizable Outer Worlds 2 Xbox Wireless Controllers, though. However, both controllers are more expensive than the game's $70 price.GameSpot's review gave The Outer Worlds 2 an 8/10 score and said that it \"feels like the series [is] coming into its own, carried by flexible combat options and great role-playing progression.\"Per the game's launch times, early-access players will get to play The Outer Worlds 2 on October 24. Everyone else will have to wait until October 29 to play it on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. This title will also be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Stanley Kubrick 3-Film 4K Collection is discounted to only $24.49 for a limited time. Released in 2020 with an $85 MSRP, this superb 7-disc box set collects three of Kubrick's best and most influential movies: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), The Shining (1980), and Full Metal Jacket (1987). With Amazon's deal, you're paying $8.16 per movie. For comparison, you'd spend $51.66 if you purchased the standalone 4K editions of these three classics.The Kubrick 3-Film Collection has already sold out at least once this week at Amazon, which isn't surprising since the $24.49 price is the best we've seen. Amazon estimates a mid-November delivery window. If you were hoping to watch The Shining on Halloween, you can buy the Kubrick 4K Collection for $25 from Blu-ray retailer Gruv via Amazon. Prime members will still get free shipping, too. Just know that if Amazon's deal disappears again, Gruv's offer is likely to follow.                                                                                                      Stanley Kubrick 3-Film 4K Collection                                                                $24.49 (was $85)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Stanley Kubrick 3-Film Collection is a 7-disc slipcase box set with three 4K UHD Blu-ray discs and four 1080p Blu-rays. Each movie comes with its own case that mirrors the standalone 4K editions of The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Full Metal Jacket.All of Kubrick's films that have received the 4K treatment are incredible from a technical perspective. If you've never watched 2001: A Space Odyssey in 4K, you're likely to be floored by the updates. It looks so beautiful in 4K that it's extremely hard to believe it was filmed in 1968. This is a native 4K restoration of the original 70mm wide HD film gauge. It has Dolby Vision and HDR10 as well as DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.2001: A Space Odyssey is by far the most feature-rich film in this box set. Along with the 4K disc, it comes with the standard Blu-ray edition with an optional audio commentary track and a bonus third Blu-ray disc with documentaries, interviews, retrospectives, and other behind-the-scenes content.Inspired by multiple Arthur C. Clarke short stories, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the most influential science fiction films ever made. Clarke and Kubrick co-wrote the screenplay.Speaking of influential movies, Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of Stephen King's novel The Shining is widely considered one of the greatest horror films ever made. The Shining's 4K UHD restoration is just as impressive as 2001: A Space Odyssey. It boasts Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. The bonus Blu-ray disc has four bonus videos, including a 35-minute making-of documentary, and a 26-minute behind-the-scenes look at the set design. It also has a fascinating audio commentary narrated by John Baxter, Kubrick's biographer, and Garrett Brown, the inventor of the Steadicam camera stabilizer used to film The Shining.Full Metal Jacket, one of the best and most eccentric films about the Vietnam War, is phenomenal on 4K Blu-ray. While it only supports HDR10, not Dolby Vision, it still looks superb, and the DTS-HD surround sound track is fantastic. The Blu-ray bonus disc has roughly 30 minutes of interviews with the cast and an optional audio commentary with several actors and writers.The three films picked for this box set showcase how Kubrick managed to leap from one genre to another and deliver a movie not quite like anything before it.                                                                                                                            Full Metal Jacket Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)                                                                $18.87 (was $33) with coupon                                                                                                                                                                                    It's worth mentioning that Full Metal Jacket's recent Limited Edition Steelbook is also on sale for its lowest price since launching in April. Outside of the collectible steelbook case, this edition of Full Metal Jacket mirrors the one in the box set. But it's a very cool steelbook case, and it's pretty rare to see a collectible 4K Blu-ray edition of one of Kubrick's best movies for under $20.                         Stanley Kubrick Movies on 4K Blu-rayEyes Wide Shut: The Criterion CollectionThe majority of Kubrick's filmography has been restored in 4K UHD resolution in recent years. The iconic director's final movie, the 1999 drama Eyes Wide Shut, is joining The Criterion Collection on November 25. Available to preorder on 4K Blu-ray and 1080p Blu-ray, Criterion's restoration of Eyes Wide Shut is the uncut, international edition; Warner Bros. censored some of the sexually explicit scenes for the US theatrical release in order to get an R-rating. Amazon is offering a 30% preorder discount that drops the price of the 4K Blu-ray edition to $35 (was $50).                                                                                                                                               Eyes Wide Shut is the second Kubrick film to get the 4K treatment by Criterion. The director's historical drama Barry Lyndon received a 4K Blu-ray edition in July. Another notable recent release is The Film Vault's new Steelbook Editions of The Shining. These are region-free imports that can be purchased on Amazon's US storefront with free shipping from Amazon's UK warehouse. The Shining Special Edition Steelbook is $84 and includes art cards, two posters, a cigar box with original artwork, an acetate slipcover, and more. The Solus Steelbook version only comes with the collectible case and acetate slipcover for $47.66.We've rounded up all of the Kubrick movies you can buy on 4K Blu-ray below, including Spartacus for only $12.39 and A Clockwork Orange for $21.

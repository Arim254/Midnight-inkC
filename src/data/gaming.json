    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Blair Marnell\n   on January 14, 2026 at 2:22PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The story of this year's best-selling PlayStation titles on two continents was all about the sports. With the Call of Duty franchise having an off year with Black Ops 7, sports titles took the top spots in PlayStation Store's American/Canadian and European PlayStation 5 downloads.NBA 2K26 was No. 1 in America and Canada, while EA Sports FC 26 claimed the top spot in Europe. It was previously clear that Black Ops 7 would have a hard time repeating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's chart-topping performance in 2024. But the latest Call of Duty installment fell to No. 7 in America/Canada and Europe. By contrast, Battlefield 6 performed very well in both territories, with a No. 2 finish in North America and a fifth place slot in Europe. Through the end of November 2025, Circana had Battlefield 6 as the best-selling game of the year. But this particular list is only for PlayStation Store downloads and it doesn't count sales on other consoles or PC.The lists contained some returning favorites like Minecraft and Helldivers 2, but newcomers like Arc Raiders, Ghost of Yotei, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made the cut in North America as well.Among PlayStation 4 games, Red Dead Redemption 2 claimed No. 1 in both territories. Rockstar Games' 2018 open-world western has remained remarkably resilient, as has Grand Theft Auto 5, which placed highly on both the PS5 and PS4 lists.Beat Saber also claimed the top slots in America/Canada and Europe's PSVR 2 Games charts, and repeated its wins from 2024. Similarly, Fortnite was also a back-to-back winner for free-to-play games in both territories.The complete list of 2025's top games on PlayStation Store can be found below.PS5 GamesUnited States/CanadaNBA 2K26Battlefield 6Grand Theft Auto 5EA Sports College Football 26EA Sports Madden NFL 26MinecraftCall of Duty: Black Ops 7Arc RaidersGhost of YōteiMLB The Show 25Call of Duty: Black Ops 6Ready or NotEA Sports FC 26Forza Horizon 5 UFC 5NBA 2K25The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion RemasteredAssassin’s Creed ShadowsClair Obscur: Expedition 33Monster Hunter WildsEA Sports FC 25EuropeEA Sports FC 26Grand Theft Auto 5EA Sports FC 25Forza Horizon 5Battlefield 6MinecraftCall of Duty: Black Ops 7Assassin’s Creed ShadowsArc RaidersClair Obscur: Expedition 33Ghost of YōteiSplit FictionHogwarts LegacyUFC 5Call of Duty: Black Ops 6It Takes TwoReady or NotThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion RemasteredRematchF1 25PS4 GamesUnited States/CanadaRed Dead Redemption 2Star Wars Battlefront 2Batman: Arkham KnightMinecraftGrand Theft Auto 5A Way OutNeed for Speed HeatMortal Kombat XtheHunter: Call of the WildThe ForestGang BeastsCall of Duty: Black Ops 3Kingdom Come: DeliveranceMiddle-earth: Shadow of WarStardew ValleyCall of Duty: Black Ops 6Unravel TwoGod of WarOvercooked! 2Injustice 2EuropeRed Dead Redemption 2A Way OutEA Sports FC 26The ForestEA Sports FC 25Grand Theft Auto 5MinecraftNeed for Speed HeatStar Wars Battlefront 2Batman: Arkham KnightUnravel TwoKingdom Come: DeliveranceBattlefield 5Mortal Kombat XGang BeastsAssassin’s Creed OdysseyHogwarts LegacyBattlefield 4Assassin’s Creed OriginsMiddle-earth: Shadow of WarPSVR 2 GamesUnited States/CanadaBeat SaberAlien: Rogue Incursion VRAmong Us 3D: VRCreed: Rise to Glory – Championship EditionJob SimulatorPavlovMetro AwakeningArizona Sunshine 2The Walking Dead: Saints & SinnersSwordsman VREuropeBeat SaberAlien: Rogue Incursion VRCreed: Rise to Glory – Championship EditionMetro AwakeningJob SimulatorAmong Us 3D: VRHorizon Call of the MountainPavlovSwordsman VRArizona Sunshine 2Free-to-playUnited States/CanadaFortniteRobloxMarvel RivalsCall of Duty: WarzoneBattlefield REDSECRocket LeagueWhere Winds Meet (F2P)Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege X – Free AccessDelta Force (F2P)Fall GuysEuropeFortniteRobloxCall of Duty: WarzoneRocket LeagueBattlefield REDSECMarvel RivalseFootballAsphalt LegendsWhere Winds Meet (F2P)Delta Force (F2P)    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Darryn Bonthuys\n   on January 14, 2026 at 9:17AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                A new batch of games has been announced for the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, and this month, subscribers can check out nine games in total. Racing and horror are the prevalent themes this month, with titles like Resident Evil Village and Ridge Racer, but for some goofy--and melodramatic--RPG fun, don't sleep on Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.These games will all be available to play, starting January 20. All PS Plus subscribers can also claim new games in January, as Need For Speed Unbound, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper will be available until February 2.Resident Evil Village (PS5, PS4)The follow-up to Resident Evil 7 dialed up the horror to new first-person heights when it was first released several years back. Once again starring protagonist Ethan Winters and his battered hands, Resident Evil Village shifts the survival-horror to a remote European village teeming with brand-new bioweapons, monsters, and one really tall lady. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5, PS4)Evolving the turn-based gameplay introduced in 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth sees new series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga jet to Hawaii to discover the secrets of his past. A game that also serves as a passing of the Yakuza torch, longtime protagonist Kazuma Kiryu lends a helping pair of fists with this grand adventure. Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5, PS4)A vast wilderness of arid deserts and rugged forests await you in Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game, but if you're an optimist, you'll see those obstacles as a puzzle waiting to be solved. With all-terrain vehicles and high-tech tools at your disposal, you'll have to figure out the best way to get from Point A to B as you explore a harsh frontier. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5)Based on the hit movies, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a single-player horror game where you have to survive familial drama, inner fears, and nigh-unkillable space monsters that'll zero in on your location if you make a peep. Darkest Dungeon 2 (PS5, PS4)A combination of roguelike gameplay and road trip action set during apocalyptic times, Darkest Dungeon 2 tasks you with leading a team of flawed heroes into dungeons teeming with all manner of fresh horrors. Not only do you have to keep an eye on your party's physical condition, you also have to help them find redemption on their quest to save the day. The Exit 8 (PS5, PS4)A unique game released several years ago, The Exit 8 has a simple but deviously deceptive setup: stuck in a Japanese underground passageway, you have to look for anomalies as you walk toward the exit. Miss one, and it could spell your end in this game for fans of liminal spaces and unnerving horror.  Art of Rally (PS5, PS4)A rally good game inspired by the golden age of rallying, this stylish gem is an enjoyable romp through stylized environments. Just like the real-life motorsport, you'll compete for gold and glory across dozens of stages spread across the world while mastering each unique car in this top-down racer. A Little to the Left (PS5, PS4)If you enjoy stacking and organizing stuff, then you won't want to miss out on A Little to the Left. The game offers dozens of puzzles, ranging from organizing eggs to arranging batteries into a special compartment, but there's one furry wrinkle to the gameplay in the form of a mischievous cat that's hellbent on causing some chaos. Ridge Racer (PS5, PS4)PS Plus Premium subscription requiredIt's Riiiiiiiidge Raaaaacccceeeer! The first game in the legendary racing game series is coming to PS5 and PS4, and this PS1 classic has been upgraded with several quality-of-life features.     \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   and \n    Cheri Faulkner\n   on January 14, 2026 at 10:00AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Hytale is a sandbox-meets-RPG that has seen its fair share of development woes. Formed by Hypixel developers, who run one of the most successful Minecraft servers of all time, Hytale formerly had funding from Riot Games who then went on to purchase the studio outright in 2020. Riot canceled Hytale in June 2025, but its original founder repurchased the game in mid November 2025 and recommenced development. Now, the game is entering early access in what the Hypixel team admits will be laced with \"bugs, rough edges, and unbalanced content.\"As part of Hypixel's dedication to its playerbase, mods are directly supported in the game, even installing mods for you when you enter another player's world. From increased luck during mining, custom plots, new items, and intriguing game modes, here are the best Hypixel mods to use at launch. Hypixel has partnered with CurseForge to host mods, and this should lead to a pretty seamless installation process thanks to the Curseforge launcher.How to download Hytale modsBefore we mention any of the popular mods you can download, you need to know how to install mods in the first place. Fortunately, as modding is built directly into Hytale, the process is fairly simple. The best way to download a mod is to use CurseForge, which is where Minecraft hosts a majority of its community mods.CurseForge is where you'll find most of the top available mods for Hytale and the site makes it easy to install them. All you have to do is download the CurseForge Mod Manager App on your PC, and from there, you need to find \"Hytale\" from the Game Menu in the app. Here, you can browse through all of the site's mods for Hytale and then pick which ones you want to download.Once you have a mod you want to download, press \"install\" and the mod will be added to the app. With the mod installed, you can press the \"play\" button in the app while in the Hytale game section, and this launches the game with the mods you've installed.It's all a fairly seamless process once you're comfortable with CurseForge, so take some time to familiarize yourself with the app, and you'll be all set in no time.Hytale SkyblockDownload link: CurseForgeAnyone who's played Minecraft's player-created custom modes will be familiar with Skyblock. You're placed on a large amount of terrain high in the sky, with limited resources. It's your job to expand your Skyblock, increase your well of resources, and proceed through the game. While Hypixel's storyline will differ from Minecraft's, obviously, transferring the Skyblock concept seems to be one of the more obvious mods you should try out. Gone FishingDownload link: CurseForgeMrbysco and their partner ShyNieke have been working on the Gone Fishing mod, which pretty much does what it says on the tin. While fishing is a vanilla inclusion in Minecraft, Hytale doesn't feature the mechanic at launch. By installing the mod, you can spend all day fishing in Hytale if that's your dream.Simply TrashDownload link: CurseForgeThe Simply Trash mod by Jaredlll08 adds a trash can to quickly get rid of unwanted items. If you've ever found yourself with a full inventory of items you don't care about in Minecraft, you've probably created a lava bin to burn them--but this can be timely and frustrating. Jared's trash can seems to remove that problem, making inventory management even easier.AutoHammerDownload link: CurseForgeWhen building a structure, village, or even just decorating some paths, switching between various blocks to add texture and interesting patterns is a necessity in vanilla Hytale. With the AutoHammer mod from tr7zw, select from variants of the same block type and AutoHammer will randomize which one is placed down.Macaw's ModsDownload link: CurseForgeThis is technically a group of mods from one creator, but Sketch Macaw's mods are infamous in the Minecraft community, with hundreds of millions of installations. Macaw adds various paintings, paths, bridges, windows, lighting options, and more. Their paintings mod means you can easily switch between which paintings appear on the canvases you place, while their multiple furniture mods make customization more varied than you can imagine. We'd argue the bundle of Macaw's Mods are almost essential to install for your Hytale world. Check out Macaw's showcase to see the mods in action. They've even developed NEP - Not Enough Poops. WhereThisAt?Download link: CurseForgeIf you're anything like me, inventory management is an ongoing struggle in most sandbox and survival games. I start off with the best of intentions, manually organizing my loot into easy-to-find locations. If I'm feeling particularly organized, they might even be in alphabetical order. Before long though, I've been on so many adventures and acquired so much random loot that my system goes out of the window completely. That's why Buuz135's WhereThisAt? mod will be one of the first that I install for Hytale. Search nearby inventories using the Inventory Lectern to find the item, and even pull it into your inventory.Immersive MelodiesDownload link: CurseForgeImmersive Melodies is another mod that's popular in Minecraft, which creator Conczin has managed to port over to Hytale. A bundle of 25 songs is playable on seven instruments, or you can upload your own melodies. It works in multiplayer, meaning you can form a band with your friends or just annoy them as you chase them around your base yelling Blink-182's All The Small Things in their headsets. Hours of fun ... for you, probably not for them.Lucky MiningDownload link: CurseForgeAnother mod from Buuz135 is Lucky Mining. It gives a small chance for ores to spread to adjacent blocks while mining. You'll know whether this has happened by a helpful particle effect and accompanying sound effect. It's a simple mod, but in those early stages where resources are limited and you're trying to progress, it can prove invaluable.Better ModlistDownload link: CurseForgeA simple UI and quality-of-life improvement mod, the Better Modlist is another contribution from Buuz135. This modlist combines mods and packs and shows information about them in-game. It's a handy way to see everything you've got installed at once, as well as their effects.Item MagnetDownload link: CurseForgeIf you're out on a long expedition to get materials, the last thing you want to do is run around the world chasing down the drops. In Jaredlll08's Item Magnet mod, anything you chop down, mine, or drop will be automatically magnetized to you and added to your inventory. It might feel simple, but it'll shave valuable time off your resource-gathering missions.YUNG's HyDungeonsDownload link: CurseForgeIf you're familiar with Minecraft modding, then you might have heard of the Dungeons mod for that game. Well, the creator of that mod has designed something very similar for Hytale, and it's called HyDungeons. This mod adds procedurally generated dungeons to the world, giving you the chance to explore completely new environments. At the time of writing, only one dungeon is available, but the creator has confirmed more are coming, and they will include a larger variety of enemies, structures, and dungeon complexity.Advanced Item InfoDownload link: CurseForgeHytale features hundreds of different equipment, resources, and other items that can be added to your inventory as you explore your world. While you might understand what some of the items do, others can be a little confusing. Fortunately, the Advanced Item Info mod takes care of any confusion. This mod adds UI to display crucial details about every item in the game, and you can see those details just by hovering over an item's icon. These details include what the item is, what it can make, where it's found, and much more.Thorium FurnacesDownload link: CurseForgeOne of the most time-consuming parts of Hytale, especially early on, is waiting for a furnace to smelt your resources into bars. Currently, there's only one craftable furnace in the vanilla version of Hytale, and it takes quite a long time to smelt down whatever is inside it. If you want to speed up that process, you can download the Thorium Furnaces mod, which adds 11 new furnaces to the game. Each of these furnaces speeds up the smelting speed, and you can craft each one with different resources. Now, you don't have to worry about standing around waiting for your metal to be smelted down.Wayback CharmDownload link: CurseForgeWhile sandbox games like Hytale are terrific for exploration and world-building, they also come with some inherent issues. One of the main issues many players have is getting lost in the world and being unable to find their way back to the base they've created. To make sure you never run into that problem, you can download the Wayback Charm mod. This mod allows you to instantly teleport back to your nearest respawn point with the simple tap of a button while holding the Wayback Charm item in your inventory.    \n  \n                      "

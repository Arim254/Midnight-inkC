The studio has indicated that there are multiple new maps on the horizon, as well as an upcoming content roadmap.\"There are going to be multiple maps coming this year,\" said Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins during an interview with GamesRadar. \"And I think it's going to be across a spectrum of size to try to facilitate different types of gameplay. So you might see some that are smaller, and you might see some that are even grander than what we've got now.\"Watkins didn't share specific details about what will be featured in the new maps, but he added that \"the ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot available there.\"As for the Arc Raiders content roadmap, Watkins suggested that it will be released \"sometime soon.\" In the meantime, he confirmed that Embark is working on new weapons, objectives, and enemies in addition to the maps.Embark has also shared details and stats about its recently concluded Cold Snap event in Arc Raiders. According to Embark's numbers, 91 million players were knocked out by snowballs, but just under 11,000 enemies were taken out the same way.To date, Arc Raiders has passed 12.4 million in sales, it has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                For the last two decades, Valve's Steam has grown into a gigantic hub for distributing PC games. It's become one of the most important marketplaces in the entire gaming industry. Now, a new poll suggests that a majority of developers believe that Steam has a monopoly on the PC gaming business. But that doesn't seem to be stopping any of the companies from using Steam.Atomik Research has shared the findings of its survey, \"The State of PC Game Distribution,\" through the PC distribution platform Rokky (via GamesIndustry.biz). The survey was conducted in May of this year with responses from 306 industry executives in the United States and the United Kingdom.According to the results, 72% of all responding executives felt that Steam has a monopoly on the PC games market. The survey participants also acknowledged that Steam sales provide over 75% of their revenue. But only 32% of responding executives said that their companies still support physical media of some form.The survey notes that 48% of executives' companies also distribute through the Epic Game Store and the Xbox PC Games store. A much smaller percentage, 10%, uses GOG, while only 8% use Itch.io. However, 80% of responders expect to use alternative sales channels in addition to Steam over the next five years.In the meantime, success on Steam can provide a huge windfall, especially for the small developers behind RV There Yet, Escape From Duckov, and this year's indie blockbuster, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Steam recently shared the 50 most-played Steam Next Fest demos, which featured a mixture between large studio titles and games created by smaller devs.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Last year, Netflix released a documentary called The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, which followed the story of Mats Steen, a Norwegian gamer who found community and acceptance through World of Warcraft as his body suffered the effects of a rare form of muscular dystrophy. Now, Steen's life is being adapted as a scripted film, which already has a number of stars lined up.According to Deadline, the cast of Ibelin includes Charlie Plummer, Anthony Hopkins, Toni Collette, Stephen Graham, Isabela Merced, and Maisy Stella. The Imitation Game director Morten Tyldum will helm the film from a script by Ilaria Bernardini and Hossein Amini. The story will be based on Steen's blog, Musings of Life, which he wrote until he passed away at 25 in 2014. While Steen lost control of his limbs, he made a name for himself in WoW as Ibelin, where he made friends who helped give him a reason to keep going as long as possible. As noted in the report, Steen was \"admired by thousands for his humor, kindness, and courage.\"Vendôme Pictures and French studio Pathé are teaming up for Ibelin, which doesn't have an American distributor yet. The film distribution rights will likely be sold at the upcoming American Film Market.Earlier this year, WoW fans discovered that Blizzard paid tribute to Steen by placing his character, Lord Ibelin, into the game as an NPC. The game's next expansion, World Of Warcraft: Midnight, will have a beta test on November 11.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                After selling 7 million copies right out of the gate, EA's Battlefield 6 has now surpassed 10 million units sold. That's according to Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics. He said in an interview with GI.biz that his firm came up with this estimate and that it applies to copies sold across all platforms.EA, however, has yet to officially announce any other sales number for Battlefield 6 beyond 7 million. In any event, Elliott said Battlefield 6's strong launch \"won't be enough to overturn Call of Duty's overall market dominance,\" or at least not in 2025.Whereas the Battlefield series historically performs best on PC, Activision's Call of Duty series is a \"multiplatform powerhouse\" that is known to perform well across console and PC alike.Elliott is among those experts who believe that Battlefield 6 will not beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year. A Battlefield game has never eclipsed a Call of Duty title on the annual US sales charts, and that's not expected to change this year.The Battlefield franchise recently got a further jolt of popularity with the launch of the free battle royale game Redsec. User reviews for the game are \"mixed\" on Steam.As for Black Ops 7, the second straight Black Ops game from Activision launches on November 14. Just recently, Activision announced the preloading and official launch times for the FPS.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

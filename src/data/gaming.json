It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025.Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games. This year, I finally really got into games on Steam with Peak and Repo, and I'm still dabbling with Lethal Company.It's the most wonderful time of the year - Steam Replay 2025 is now available!Take a trip down memory lane and see how many games you played, how much you played per month, and many more fun stats for the year.Check out yours (login required): https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4… pic.twitter.com/SrVS9oNdIP  — Steam (@Steam) December 16, 2025              Other gaming platforms have also released their yearly summaries, as PlayStation posted its yearly wrap-up last week. To see your Steam Replay, you can visit Valve's website or click the Steam Replay banner in the Steam app's store page. It'll be interesting to see how the Steam Machine will affect players next year for those who prefer a more traditional console setup.There are a few limits to keep in mind: Steam Replay does not count time played while offline or disconnected from the internet. It also leaves out unreleased games, preloads, prerelease versions, and disabled games.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The success of Baldur's Gate 3 went far beyond anyone's expectations with 20 million copies sold and multiple Game of the Year awards. That was all very good for the future of Larian, but it's also creating some pressure now that the developer focuses on its latest Divinity game.\"It's more pressure,\" Larian founder Swen Vincke told PC Gamer. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing.\"Vincke also indicated that the team at Larian believed that making Divinity would be easier after the studio's experience with Baldur's Gate 3. But that turned out to not be the case.\"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this,'\" added Vincke. \"By now, we've been humbled by the development experience, by the actual development again: No, we don't know anything. We have to relearn everything, but we do have the experience of the past with us. Every game has its own language that you need to learn.\"Vincke recently came under fire for saying that Larian uses some generative AI in game development. He subsequently said that AI is not being used to replace human artists, and that generative AI is used to \"explore things\" and that it allows artists to \"experiment\" and \"make their lives easier.\" He added that there will be no generative-AI-created content in Divinity.According to Vincke, Divinity will probably get an early-access release like Baldur's Gate 3 did. But he didn't fully commit to that and the game doesn't currently have a release date.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders has a whole lot of quests, and one set of them requires you to do some digging on who has contaminated the water supply. This questline eventually leads to A Toxic Trail, which sends you back to a previous location to figure out more about what's going on with the water. In this guide, we'll tell you how to complete A Toxic Trail.You don't necessarily need to extract from the map to complete A Toxic Trail, but it's not a bad idea to do so, especially if you don't have a safe pocket for the key that drops at the end of the quest. While it's not required for any quests, it can help you find some good loot on the Spaceport map later.When you're ready to tackle A Toxic Trail, read on for each step you'll need to complete.How to complete A Toxic Trail in Arc RaidersThe first step to completing A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders is to head back to the drain where you previously found the barrel for the Source of the Contamination quest. This barrel can be found outside the Water Treatment Center on the Dam Battlegrounds map by approaching from the north via the swamp. Check the map below for the exact spot.Water Treatment Control drain locationThis time, you won't need to interact with the barrel. Instead, simply walk around in this nasty water for a moment to trigger the next step of the quest, which asks you to find traces of the barrel's origin. Luckily, you won't need to travel far at all to round up where the barrel came from.Walk to the west just a bit to find a truck in the swamp water. It's hard to miss since it's sitting out in the open, but we've marked the location on the map for you below.Find a truck submerged in the water here.Approach the truck and interact with the prompt that shows up to take a photo of it. Afterward, you'll receive a final task to search the trucks for clues about who sabotaged the water supply. Just interact with the door of the truck to find a Spaceport Warehouse Key. Pick it up and place it in your safe pocket, as it can come in handy for finding good loot next time you're in Spaceport.This truck is the source of the contamination.Now that you're finished with the quest, you can extract at the nearby Central Swamp Lift. Just be mindful that this area can be easily camped by other raiders, so keep your wits about you. When you return to Speranza and turn this quest in, you'll receive a follow-up quest called The Stench of Corruption, which you'll need to complete if you want to earn the Warden outfit.For more on Arc Raiders, take a look at our comprehensive guides hub.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

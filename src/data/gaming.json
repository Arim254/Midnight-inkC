The Cold Snap update brings multiple seasonal events, a new Snowfall map condition, and plenty more for fans to sink their teeth into. Among the fresh additions is the Goalie Raider Deck--the game's second battle pass--which contains a smorgasbord of cosmetics, gear, items, and even Raider Tokens that can be used toward premium purchases in the shop.The Goalie Deck is free for all players, so you won't need to purchase access to these rewards with premium currency. Instead, you'll simply need to work toward completing daily Feats that provide you with Creds, then use those to unlock your preferred items from the deck. This should prove fairly easy to do for most players, as you can complete up to three Feats per match, and you'll even get additional bonus Creds for the first five Feats you finish in a day.Perhaps the best news about the Goalie Deck, however, is that it's a permanent reward track. Unlike battle passes in other games, this deck will stick around forever, meaning you can unlock what you want from it whenever you'd like. With this in mind, you can skip any rewards that just don't matter much to you right now--though it's worth pointing out you will still need to purchase a certain number of items from the deck to unlock subsequent pages.If you're excited to dive into the Goalie Deck and start reaping its rewards--including the new hockey-themed outfit, which is pretty rad--we've got you covered ahead of time. Keep scrolling below for every reward from the Goalie Deck in Arc Raiders.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nAnd it's really tough to tell if that's a good thing or a bad thing.By \n    Phil Owen\n   on December 28, 2025 at 1:00PM PST\n              \n                Epic has spent the past few years trying as hard as it can to will the Fortnite metaverse into being--and now, at the end of 2025, it's actually starting to look like it's getting there. Things are still very messy, but Epic's moves in that direction--which frequently seem to involve trying random things just to see what happens--may have finally borne fruit.Back at the end of 2023, Fortnite attempted to usher in its metaverse in earnest by launching Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and Lego Fortnite all at once. It didn't quite work, because all three were half-baked and missing key features. The only way to play Racing was in Ranked, Festival lacked instrument support and still doesn't have a practice mode, and Lego Fortnite had the feel of a generic early-access survival game wearing Lego clothing.Two years later, we've got a much prettier picture, but not because Epic went all in on those modes. Instead, Epic has simply kept churning out new modes, some of which have done consistently. Likewise, Fortnite Creative has produced its first blockbuster map with any staying power. Thanks to some key legal victories, Fortnite is once again available on mobile devices in most places, which has dramatically increased the game's potential footprint. And the new cosmetic types added in the past year have proven a lot more popular than the cars and musical instruments that were introduced in Chapter 5.A lot happened in Fortnite during the past year. To make it all a little easier to digest, let's go through the biggest developments one by one.Brainrot is taking over Fortnite.Rise of the BrainrotsThe Creative part of Fortnite got its first genuine blockbuster in 2025 with Steal the Brainrot, a licensed clone of one of Roblox's most popular modes. Steal the Brainrot was an instant success in Fortnite, and it consistently averages enough concurrent players that it can compete with Epic's battle royale modes. Now, Epic is planning to capitalize on Brainrot's success by allowing creators using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite to add V-Bucks transactions to their islands, something the Roblox version of the Brainrot game has that Fortnite's currently does not.Unfortunately, the success of this mode means Epic has decided to use it as a focus in its marketing for Fortnite as a whole, as well as promoting it generally by placing it in the in-game news feed. That's proven to be incredibly off-putting for folks who aren't interested in that mode--which is pretty much everyone who doesn't already play it.With the Brainrots apparently here to stay, there's reason to worry that Fortnite might soon be flooded with this sort of goofy nonsense aimed entirely at children. Epic has already made it unnecessarily difficult for folks who just want to play BR to sift through all the Creative islands and other modes they don't care about in Fortnite's messy Discover tab.The problem is that Fortnite does not offer any way to tailor your Discover tab at all except favoriting modes and maps that you like. You can't, for example, tell it that you're not interested in Steal the Brainrot, so there's no way to escape the noise or pretend it doesn't exist because Epic is constantly promoting it to you. It's not fun.Fortnite OG, Reload, Blitz, and Delulu are all here to stay, apparently.The fracturing of battle royaleFortnite added several new battle royale spinoff modes in the past year, starting with the permanent OG mode that has been revisiting Chapter 1. In addition to more or less recreating the game as it existed seven years ago, this mode even got its own new battle pass, the OG pass, for each of its seasons.Then we had Blitz Royale, which arrived during the summer with a focus on mobile players, thanks to its short matches on a small island. Epic has done tons of fine-tuning on Blitz Royale since it launched, trying all sorts of novel mechanics, like granting all players a super-powered medallion to start a match--though since the beginning of November, Blitz is more like a tiny version of standard Battle Royale, without as many gimmicks. But Blitz has changed so frequently that it's never had a real status quo--which is a great way to keep players' interest.Epic followed that up with Delulu, a weekends-only mode with proximity voice chat that allows players to form impromptu teams--and then betray each other if they want to.Somehow, these new modes--alongside Reload, OG, and regular Battle Royale--have all managed to maintain healthy populations at the same time. They absolutely do cannibalize each other a bit, but not so much that it affects matchmaking in any particular mode for most folks. It's tough to imagine that Epic could get away with any more new BR modes without a bump to Fortnite's overall population, but Epic clearly knows this too--that's probably why Delulu is only available on the weekends.Fortnite got really into releasing new music skins this year.Going all in on celebsBeing a rhythm game, Fortnite Festival was never going to pull hundreds of thousands of concurrent users over the long term in the way Battle Royale does. These days, the mode has a small but dedicated playerbase, but the cosmetics associated with the mode--skins of pop stars in the item shop and the seasonal music passes--have clearly been a big success for Epic, because the company has been doing a lot more of those types of collabs in general this year.Just in the past few months, Fortnite has introduced new collaborations with five musical artists (Deadmau5, Daft Punk, Doja Cat, Tyler the Creator, and Playboi Carti) that were not Festival headliners, and then Epic punctuated its newly ramped-up celeb obsession by adding Kim Kardashian in December. Considering how popular these celebrity and popstar skins have been lately--it feels like we've been battling Sabrina Carpenters nonstop in BR this year--you can probably expect even more crossovers of this type in 2026.Fortnite will sell you in-game pets now.New virtual toys to spend money onEpic Games has been gradually introducing new types of cosmetics over the last couple of years. Back in Chapter 5, it added cars, musical instruments, and various Lego things. Kicks popped up just before the start of Chapter 6 a year ago, and in 2025, we got sidekicks--essentially pets who follow us around and get excited when we perform certain in-game actions. While the new Chapter 5 cosmetics struggled so much out of the gate that Epic had to lower some of their prices--it turned out that 4,000 V-Bucks was kind of a lot for a Fortnite car--kicks seem to have done well, and sidekicks are a definite hit.Yes, there's been plenty of grumbling about both of the most recently added new cosmetic types--folks who aren't sneakerheads tend to scoff at kicks, and there was a lot of frustration that you can only customize your sidekick's appearance once before it locks permanently. But folks are buying them nonetheless. It's rare that I have a teammate who doesn't have a pet dog or cat (or chicken) following them around.And speaking personally, as somebody who's been playing for years and has tons of skins, I like being able to branch out with new stuff. I really don't need more skins at this point, but having Itchy from The Simpsons follow me around and celebrate my kills is delightful.Fortnite let us have some uncanny conversations with Darth Vader in May.The AI slop is coming?While Fortnite is not currently any sort of wasteland of AI nonsense, the first red flags popped up this year. Epic's most notable AI-driven creation was the Darth Vader NPC in Battle Royale during the Star Wars mini-season in May, who could respond dynamically, in the voice of the late James Earl Jones, to things players said to him. It was definitely weird, but at least it was something that might have been impractical to try without AI.Other apparent AI things have begun popping up here and there within Fortnite since then. Epic gave out a free jam track in October that had AI-generated cover art featuring Hatsune Miku--even though the track had nothing to do with Miku. There are some pieces of art in the game in Chapter 7 that have commonly been accused of being AI-generated, like a poster of a Yeti in a hammock in which one of his feet has five toes while the other has four. And an emote on Lisa's music pass uses a licensed 2025 song so obscure that nobody even knows who made it--and it sounds very much like it's AI-generated. Oh, and those Brainrots? All of those are AI-generated meme designs from the Italian Brainrot trend.To be honest, all of that really doesn't add up to very much. But when you take those things alongside recent comments from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney--in which he said it's absurd for Steam to require disclosure if AI-generated content is used in a game's development because AI will soon be involved in all dev work--there's certainly some reason to worry that Epic might be planning to unleash the slop in its never-ending pursuit of the children who play Roblox.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 is discounted to $180 (was $200) for a limited time. Released in October, the Nova 7 Gen 2 is updated version of one of the best wireless gaming headsets you can buy today.You can choose between the Nova 7P (PlayStation), Nova 7X (Xbox), or Nova 7 (PC) in black, white, or magenta. The 7X offers wireless support for all platforms, while the 7P and 7 work on all devices except Xbox consoles. If you game on Switch 1/2, mobile, Steam Deck, or another device with USB-C or Bluetooth audio support, any of the three versions will work great. For a more premium wireless headset, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro is on sale for $300 (was $380).                                 SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 Wireless Headset (Gen 2)                                                                $180 (was $200)                                                                                                                                                                                    When considering price, audio performance, and comfort, the Arctis Nova 7 was hard to beat when it launched back in 2022. That remains true over three years later with the Gen 2 model, which offers 40% better battery life--over 50 hours compared to 38 hours--and adds support for the Arctis Companion App.The free iOS and Android app lets you adjust audio settings and switch between over 200 custom sound profiles designed for specific games. Along with these 2.4GHz Wireless profiles, there are a handful of Bluetooth profiles, including Bass Boost and Focus, that come in handy when using the Nova 7 to listen to music.The original Nova 7 worked with the SteelSeries GG desktop app for PC and Mac, but the mobile app is easier to use and allows you to adjust audio settings on the go. The Arctis Companion App was introduced in 2024 alongside the entry-level Nova 5 Wireless Headset, and it only works with select SteelSeries audio gear.If you own the first-generation Nova 7, upgrading probably might make sense if you take your headset with you during your daily commute or use it frequently for handheld gaming. But if Arctis Companion App integration isn't of interest to you, you'll want to stick with the original. But for everyone else, the Nova 7 Gen 2 is a terrific all-around gaming headset that remains my favorite in the $200 and under category.SteelSeries designs the most comfortable gaming headsets on the market, and the Nova 7 is no exception. The adjustable elastic headband and lightweight, memory foam ear cushions are superb, and the sturdy steel frame holds up well. The custom 40mm neodymium audio drivers offer rich, high-fidelity sound; the audio is even more impressive and dynamic when using the custom presets created by SteelSeries. It has a retractable boom mic with AI noise reduction to block out ambient noise like keyboard and controller clicks.Along with 2.4GHz Wireless with the included USB-C dongle, the Nova 7 supports Bluetooth and wired via a detachable 3.5mm audio cord. It also has simultaneous 2.4GHz and Bluetooth audio streams, so you can stay connected and hear sound from two devices at once.                      Nova 7 vs. 7P vs. 7XSteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 (Gen 2)As mentioned, there are three versions of the Nova 7 Gen 2. In the past, SteelSeries has included green or blue accents on the headset to differentiate between the Xbox and PlayStation editions, but the Gen 2 looks the same across the board. The only tangible difference between the three is the dial on the right earcup. The Nova 7X and 7 have a game chatmix dial, but since the PS5 doesn't have this feature, the Nova 7P has a Sidetone dial for mic monitoring.We typically recommend the Xbox version of SteelSeries headsets since it is the only truly universal option, but if you primarily game on PS5 and regularly chat with friends, the Nova 7P would be the better choice. All three versions support 360-degree spatial audio and Sony's Tempest 3D Audio with compatible devices.Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 (Universal)BlackWhiteMagentaArctis Nova 7P Gen 2 (PlayStation / PC)BlackWhiteMagentaArctis Nova 7 Gen 2 (PC / PlayStation)BlackWhiteMagentaSteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro DealsThe Nova 7 Gen 2 is the best SteelSeries gaming headset for most players, but it's not the highest-end model in the manufacturer's catalog. The next step up is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro. This premium wireless gaming headset has an improved build, leatherette earcups, better audio with parametric EQ, and ANC. It also has a base station with an OLED screen that can be used to customize settings. The base station replaces the 2.4GHz dongle and can be connected to two devices. The Arctis Nova Pro is on sale for $300 (was $380) in white or black at Amazon. Once again, you can choose between Xbox (Universal), PlayStation, and PC models.SteelSeries also makes a wired version of the Arctis Nova Pro with a GameDAC and higher-fidelity audio (96kHz/24-bit). Normally $280, the wired Xbox edition is discounted to $150, while the PlayStation edition is $210. The wired Xbox edition works with PS5 and PS4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   SteelSeries Arctis Nova EliteSteelSeries Arctis Nova EliteIt's worth noting that high-resolution 96kHz/24-bit audio is also offered in the SteelSeries Nova Elite Wireless Headset. Launched in late September for $600, the Arctis Nova Elite is far pricier than the other headsets in SteelSeries' lineup. Available in Obsidian and Sage/Gold, the Nova Elite is probably best described as a \"luxury\" gaming headset.From a technical perspective, the Nova Elite is the most impressive wireless gaming headset I've tried. It supports 96kHz/24-bit high-resolution audio over 2.4GHz Wireless and Bluetooth. The new carbon fiber drivers produce a noticeably fuller, cleaner sound, and the active noise cancellation is a step above the Nova Pro. The ANC isn't on the same level as similarly priced headphones designed for music, but it is the better at blocking out noise than any other gaming headset I've tried.                                                                                                                                               The GameHub--the new name for the base station--can connect to three devices, and simultaneous audio is available for all three as well as Bluetooth. In addition to a retractable microphone, the Nova Elite has a second, stealth mic. Unlike the Nova Pro, the Elite is also compatible with the Arctis Companion App.The Nova Elite is built almost entirely from steel and die-cast aluminum. The headband is wrapped in the same leatherette found on the improved memory foam earcups. The Elite also comes with a leatherette travel pouch with a magnetic enclosure and a zippered compartment for accessories and cables.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:                                Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33                         Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle Reportedly Discontinued - Save $50 At Amazon                         ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld Is On Sale For Only $489 For A Limited Time                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (2)                 Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Mortal Kombat Cabinet Gets First Discount                         Lego Transformers Optimus Prime And Bumblebee Get Limited-Time Price Cuts    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

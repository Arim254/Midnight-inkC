    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The existence of a long-rumored remake of Capcom's Resident Evil 0 is now looking even more likely, with a new report corroborating not only that its existence but also new details about the game's cast and story.As reported by MP1st, the rumored remake of the 2002-prequel is officially being referred to within Capcom as project \"Chamber,\" seemingly a reference to the game's main protagonist Rebecca Chambers. The game has reportedly been in development for several years, with performance-capture work starting sometime in 2024.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Ode to Horror: A Celebration of Resident Evil\n      \nThat same \"Chamber\" codename appears on the resume of actor Jon McLaren, known for playing Star Lord in Square Enix's 2021 Guardians of the Galaxy game. His resume lists \"Project Chamber\" as his most recent video game project, labeling it as an upcoming AAA game in which he plays a lead character. He also lists the project as coming from the motion-capture company Beyond Capture Studios. It's that same motion capture studio that has worked with Capcom on games like Street Fighter 6 and the Resident Evil 4 remake.While it's not confirmed who McLaren is playing in the remake, it's likely Billy Coen, the male lead in Resident Evil 0 who aids Chambers in her mission to uncover more about a zombie outbreak on the outskirts of Raccoon City.Resident Evil 0's opening hours take place on a zombie-infested train, and according to MP1st, the remake will more fully flesh out various plot details and characters only alluded to in the original. That includes making the train's conductor a full-fledged character that interacts with Chambers and Coen rather than only being referenced like in the original.As for when the Resident Evil 0 remake will arrive, it's likely still a few years away. A recent statement from frequent Capcom leaker DuskGolem points towards the Resident Evil 0 remake not releasing until 2028, with another rumored remake, Code Veronica, set for 2027. Neither remake has been officially announced by Capcom.The next mainline entry in the series, Resident Evil Requiem, is coming February 27, 2026. It stars the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft, and will finally return the franchise to Raccoon City.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu has shared his thoughts on the rise of artificial intelligence in gaming, saying in an interview that AI has some potential for music in games, but he doesn't plan to use the technology personally.Speaking to JASRAC Magazine, Uematsu said it's possible AI could help with transitions in game music between sounds, but using generative AI to make new music for games is not something he is interested in pursuing.\"I've never used AI and probably never will. I think it still feels more rewarding to go through the hardships of creating something myself,\" he said, as reported by Automaton. \"When you listen to music, the fun is also in discovering the background of the person who created it, right? AI does not have that kind of background though.\"Uematsu also noted live performances of music are inherently \"unstable,\" and it is those \"fluctuations and imperfections\" that make the music sound \"so satisfying.\"Uematsu makes music for Square Enix, and its president said in 2024 that the company wants to be aggressive when it comes to adopting and implementing AI systems. \"I believe that generative AI has the potential not only to reshape what we create, but also to fundamentally change the processes by which we create, including programming,\" Takashi Kiryu said.Artificial intelligence has been a hot-button issue in gaming and other industries, with many expressing fear and doubt, while others, like Hideo Kojima, believe it should be embraced. Many experts believe the AI bubble is set to burst, with key players left standing and others falling by the wayside. A 2024 survey of game developers worldwide found that the majority of workers in gaming use generative artificial intelligence systems to make games, despite ongoing concerns.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

To promote the game with a stunt worthy of Ryu himself, Team Ninja community manager Emmanuel \"Master\" Rodriguez and musician Swae Lee took a ride over Miami in a helicopter while Rodriguez played Ninja Gaiden 4 on a large screen held aloft by another helicopter.          According to Xbox Wire, this stunt set a new Guinness World Record for the largest video game display flown by helicopter. While Rodriguez guided Yakumo through his trials, Lee performed tracks from his record, \"Flammable.\"The stunt was inspired by Ninja Gaiden 4's story, which takes place among the skyscrapers of Tokyo, which have been expanded upon and raised even higher because the lower city has been ruined by toxic floodwaters. The Ninja Gaiden games have had high-flying action before, but it's going to another level in this sequel.Ninja Gaiden 4 will be released on October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PS5, but the official launch times may come a little earlier depending on where you live. This sequel will also be a day-one release for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The famously hard series will have more flexibility with the difficulty settings in this game.Earlier this month, Tomonobu Itagaki, the video game developer behind Dead or Alive and the Ninja Gaiden revival, passed away at the age of 58.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The WD Black C50 1TB Expansion Card is on sale for only $100 (was $150), which is 10 bucks less than the price we saw during Prime Big Deal Days. The C50 is a plug-and-play storage upgrade for Xbox Series X and Series S.                                 WD Black 1TB C50 Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S                                                                $100 (was $150)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Xbox Series X 1TB console has 802GB of usable space, so the 1TB C50 Expansion Card will more than double your storage space. Meanwhile, the Xbox Series S 512GB model only has 364GB of usable space, so the 1TB addition nearly triples the console's storage capacity.If you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, you've probably noticed how fast those hundreds of usable gigabytes can be claimed by games. and updates. This is especially true if you download AAA games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, The Outer Worlds 2, and Ninja Gaiden 4, to name a few recent releases. Amazon also has Western Digital's 512GB Expansion Card in stock for $80, which is the lowest price in a while. There aren't any deals on 2TB Xbox Expansion Cards at the moment, but if you like accessories that cost almost as much as your console, Seagate's 4TB Expansion Card is $430 (was $500).                      Side note about Game Pass: Microsoft recently raised the price of the Ultimate tier to $30/month, but you can pay $20/month by opting for prepaid 3-Month Memberships from retailers such as Amazon.The C50 launched in 2023 to compete with Seagate's Expansion Card, the only other officially licensed storage expansion option for Xbox Series X|S. Seagate's Expansion Cards used to be incredibly expensive, but the arrival of the C50 led to price drops.Western Digital and Seagate Xbox Expansion Cards offer the same functionality. You simply insert the proprietary storage card into the expansion slot on the back of your console. Your Xbox will recognize the card and allow you to choose if you want to use internal storage or expansion storage as your primary install location. That's the whole installation process; these truly are plug-and-play storage solutions.Regular external hard drives can store Xbox Series X|S games, but you need to transfer them back to the console's internal drive to actually play them. Xbox Expansion Cards, on the other hand, can store and load games; these nifty accessories act as an extension of your SSD.If you're a PS5 or PC gamer in need of a storage upgrade, the ultra-fast Crucial P510 2TB NVMe SSD is discounted to $150 (was $210) for a limited time.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                If you've accepted the Our Presence Up There quest in Arc Raiders, you'll need to visit the Pattern House on Dam Battlegrounds and perform a few quick tasks. It's a relatively straightforward quest, but knowing where each objective is located can make things move much more quickly--which can be important in a high-traffic area like the Pattern House.You don't need to extract to complete Our Presence Up There, but you'll be pretty close to an extraction point, so you might as well try to get out alive if possible. Additionally, the Pattern House is often home to a lot of really good loot (especially during a Night Raid), making it worth trying to haul some stuff back to Speranza.When you're ready to get started on Our Presence Up There, follow the guide below.How to complete Our Presence Up There in Arc RaidersTo complete Our Presence Up There, you'll need to head to the Pattern House POI, which is located at the northern tip of the Dam Battlegrounds map. This is a spot a lot of folks visit for blueprint farming, as well as a common spawn point, so keep an eye out for other raiders.Pattern House locationWhen you arrive at the Pattern House, enter through the front and head to the staircase on the bottom floor. Before going up, look for a room to the left of the stairs and enter it.Enter this door left of the stairs.Inside this room is a power switch on the wall. Flip the switch to complete one objective. Next, you'll need to make your way to the roof.Flip the power switch.Head up the zipline inside the building to reach the roof. Here, at the edge of the roof, is an antenna with a terminal. Interact with this to activate the antenna and complete the quest.Interact with this terminal to activate the antenna.With the quest complete, you can now finish looting the Pattern House if you'd like, or you can head on down to the nearby North Complex Elevator to get back home. This extraction point is usually crawling with ARC and is often camped by other raiders, though, so approach it carefully if you're carrying anything particularly valuable--and be ready for a fight if necessary. Best of luck, raider.For more, check our our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Dragami Games has announced that the upcoming Switch 2 port of Lollipop Chainsaw has been delayed. It was previously set to launch this November but is now coming in \"early 2026.\"The developer said the delay was due to the volume of requests for a physical edition of the game's RePOP remaster version. The studio wanted to align the digital and physical releases, so it opted to delay all versions to 2026.\"We sincerely apologize for the extended wait and any inconvenience this may cause. We appreciate your understanding and continued support,\" Dragami said.James Gunn--the co-CEO of DC Studios and the director of the recently released Superman reboot--co-wrote the story for Lollipop Chainsaw, which was co-directed by Goichi Suda aka Suda51. However, neither Gunn nor Suda51 had any involvement with the remaster.The RePOP edition originally came out in 2024 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. The new edition includes \"the latest graphics,\" along with \"speedier chainsaw action.\" For anyone unaware, Lollipop Chainsaw tells the story of Juliet Starling, a student who loves cheerleading and killing zombies.The Switch 2 is soaring right now, recently passing 10 million units sold to become Nintendo's fastest-selling console ever. It's about to pass the DS to become Nintendo's best-selling platform of all time.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                After getting leaked earlier this week, Epic Games has revealed that Grammy-winning artist Tyler, the Creator will join Fortnite on November 14 as an purchasable skin.The official Fortnite X account posted a seven-second teaser video of the \"Don't Tap the Glass\" rapper's skin. In the clip, we get a look at two outfits for Tyler, the Creator: his green \"Chromakopia\" getup and an ensemble that closely resembles his \"Wolf\" or \"Cherry Bomb\" days.According to a November 12 Vice story, prolific dataminer NotPaloLeaks unveiled this Tyler, the Creator collaboration in an X post on November 11. As Vice speculates, his skins could cost 1,500 V-Bucks, and his arrival may come with cosmetics like weapon wraps, pickaxes, backpacks, jam tracks, and emotes. The official Fortnite X account hasn't confirmed this yet, but Tyler, the Creator hits the in-game shop on November 14, so it won't be much longer until everything is made clearer.Regardless of what comes with Tyler, the Creator's arrival, the Fortnite community is losing its mind. In a recent post in r/FortniteBR about the reveal, the comments are filled with excitement. \"Pretty cool. Was hoping for Chromakopia,\" one Redditor said. \"God yes,\" another user chimed.The sentiment is about the same on X. In the replies to the teaser video, users expressed their enthusiasm for the skin. \"Finally,\" one poster said with a Family Guy GIF. \"It's enough to make a grown man cry,\" replied another.Of course, not everyone is pleased with the collab. Some in that r/FortniteBR post dismissed the skin. Meanwhile, users in the replies to Fortnite's X post were taken aback by his appearance, with one poster calling the skin \"Tyron the Architect\" because of the face he makes when diving from the Battle Bus in the teaser video.Tyler, the Creator joins Fortnite just as Springlefield continues taking over the battle royale shooter. The Simpsons have been running all over Fortnite Island, with Ned Flanders in particular piling up the bodies. However, Fox's cartoon won't stick around for much longer; Season 7 is slated to start on November 29, with Fortnite Island possibly taking on a distinctive LA flair and new collabs--from Kill Bill to SpongeBob SquarePants--hinted at joining the game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Starting with Horizon Zero Dawn and followed up with Horizon Forbidden West, the PlayStation franchise has seen players following protagonist Aloy on a single-player adventure. With the recent reveal of Horizon Steel Frontiers, the focus changes from a solo affair to an MMO. But Guerrilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek has stated the series started with multiplayer in mind.Lego Horizon Adventures was apparently Guerilla dipping its toes in the water with multiplayer, according to van Beek on X. But going forward, the studio will focus more on this social aspect. \"From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game,\" wrote van Beek. \"Lego Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we're taking a bigger one. There is much more to come, and we're excited to show you what is coming.\"From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game.

That would be a first for the franchise, as even the spin-off Horizon Call of the Mountain was released for PlayStation VR 2. The MMO looks a bit inspired by the Monster Hunter series and will feature large-scale raids. Meanwhile, Sony has filed a lawsuit against Tencent over Light of Motiram, arguing the game is a \"slavish clone\" of Horizon.As van Beek implies, multiplayer looks here to stay with the Horizon franchise. In fact, it's reported that a multiplayer Horizon game is the next project from Guerrilla. There is also a live-action Horizon movie in the works, though no directors, writers, or cast members have been announced.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nAs live-service games go on and on into eternity, the episodic game structure is the perfect way to know just when to put down the controller.By \n    Matt Kim\n   on December 27, 2025 at 1:00PM PST\n              \n                Is there a more infamous monkey-paw wish than the collective dream that all our favorite games could last forever? Well, the finger curled, because it seems like all major game publishers in the world only want to make games that go on to infinity.With the rise of live-service games, it's been a struggle to know when to put the controller down, especially when games like Fortnite release seasonal content like The Simpsons season pass that ask you to play long enough to unlock stupid sexy Flanders. Luckily, for us, episodic games, perfectly portioned into bite-sized morsels, have come back to rescue us from the endless grind.In this case, I am talking specifically about Dispatch, the new episodic superhero game from AdHoc Studio. If the name is unfamiliar to you, AdHoc is a new game company founded by former members of Ubisoft, Night School, and perhaps most notably, Telltale Games, who blew up the episodic gaming scene with 2012's The Walking Dead. The studio would later close due to a variety of factors internal and external, some of which I covered previously as a reporter. But by then, the episodic-games formula was starting to feel a bit played out, and the mood appeared to be shifting towards either more complete single-player experiences, or the early live-service games we know today.But nowadays, the people yearn for games that deliver the sense of accomplishment when hitting credits, but also don't require the kind of time investment most games demand. Dispatch perfectly models itself after the cable TV shows of old, with each episode adhering to a winning formula that never overstays its welcome.Set in a modern-day Los Angeles — except in this version of the city, there are actual superheroes working together at a private security firm — Dispatch is best understood as a workplace comedy. Think The Office crossed over with The Boys. Players are asked to make both small and large choices as the hero, Robert Robertson III, which will not only determine his personality, but have big ramifications for how the story plays out. A short intro sets the stage for the episode's plot, while in the middle is an interactive dispatching sim, followed by a big finale, a needle drop, and roll credits. A little formulaic, but so was television during the pre-prestige TV era.Furthering the TV connection, Dispatch's fully voiced storyline has a wonderful cast of TV alumni including Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, and thanks to a partnership with Critical Role, fan-favorite voice actors like Laura Bailey and Matt Mercer.For the past week, playing Dispatch became a nightly ritual where after dinner, I'd retreat into the office for a single episode's worth of Dispatch before returning to the living room to do something else for the evening. Just like a TV season, Dispatch is broken up into eight episodes, each about an hour, not including end credits. While there is always the urge to keep pushing forward and play right into the next episode, each section felt so perfectly calibrated for a single session of gaming that I could leave the next episode for the next night and not feel a pang of anxiety or FOMO. If anything, I could take the time to think over the choices I made in the previous episode, many of which feel weighty and substantial.I don't want to give the wrong impression about Dispatch by constantly comparing it to TV. Dispatch is first and foremost a game, and a damn good one too. The hero-dispatching sim alone is worthy of praise, and, ironically, something I could play endlessly. But there's a confidence in direction that oozes from Dispatch. They know just when to hit you with the credits, knowing full well you will feel satisfied leaving the game until the next week when new episodes are set to drop.The combination of talent, writing, and production in Dispatch all come together into a potent mix--a truly satisfying one too, which is not a description I've used for many games this year. You should read GameSpot's positive review of course, but Dispatch has seemingly hit the perfect chord with players to the tune of 2 million copies sold. A major success for a new IP from a brand-new studio, and while I could go on about all the ways Dispatch has become a surprise hit of the year for me, the best thing about my time with it has been, well, that I spent a pretty short amount of time with it. Or rather, I spent the perfect length of time with it.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n\"It's a lot like being a fan of a boy band: Part of what makes it popular is being popular, in a way.\"By \n    Ana Diaz\n   on December 29, 2025 at 6:00AM PST\n              \n                In the cavernous convention halls of Gamescom 2025, conference attendees gawk at towering installations of fabricated castle sets and pirate ships. The massive movie set-esque booths inspire awe, but off center and to the side of these constructions rests another installation--one that has managed to draw an equally impressive crowd without a flashy monument. Wrapped around this booth are chattering fans--many who appear to be women and femmes in their 20s and 30s--all queued in a line long enough to wrap around a city block. They'll remain this way for the better part of an hour, a singular goal making this endeavor worth the wait: taking a photo with a cutout of their favorite man from Love and Deepspace.Developed by Papergames, a China-based studio known for its work on the Nikki franchise, Love and Deepspace is a narrative-focused mobile game in which players romance and bond with a cast of five men. Since its release in January of 2024--and in the past year especially--Love and Deepspace has inspired a fervor comparable to those around the most beloved boy bands. It won Best Mobile Game Award at Gamescom 2025 and surpassed $750 million in gross player spending within two years of release.Yet Love and Deepspace is more than any individual statistic or accolade. It is an absolute phenomenon--one that has also inspired a fandom characterized not just by its sheer size, but by the dedication of its fans. If you have been curious about the game,or rather what makes it so special, here is everything you need to know about the viral sensation, Love and Deepspace.What is Love and Deepspace?Love and Deepspace is a free-to-play otome game available on mobile devices. In case you are new to the genre, the term \"otome\" refers to narrative-heavy games in which players can romance characters in the game. The game's main story features a sci-fi scenario where the protagonist, known in the game as a hunter, joins an organization that protects the planet from malicious aliens. As you play, the game flits between date scenarios with its swoony men, 3D-action combat challenges, and its overarching story, revealing a depth and wealth of gameplay options.At the heart of Love and Deepspace are its five romanceable men: Xavier, Rafayel, Zayne, Sylus, and Caleb. Each has their own personality and fulfills their own archetype. Rayafel is youthful and goofy, whereas Zayne is withholding, but mature. Xavier is protective and calm, whereas Sylus has an almost threatening aura. Depending on how dominant, soft, practical, or creative you like your man, players can spend time with the romantic interest (or interests) that best fit their preferences.Love in Deepspace.Because Love and Deepspace is a live-service game, its developers are constantly giving players new ways to interact with its cast; this leads to there being loads of minigames and different features contained within it. In the main menus, you can interact with the boys almost as if they're little Tamagotchi pets. It's both easy and encouraged for you to use your phone to poke and prod at them, or even breathe on them by using the microphone. All this, and other features like one that plays AMSR-esque audio of a boy breathily talking to you, create a sense of intimacy and connection with the characters in this world--one that has ultimately helped establish it as the go-to otome game.Why is Love and Deepspace so popular?As is the case with most hit games, a combination of cultural factors and specific qualities about Love and Deepspace have helped contribute to its success. On a practical level, the game is easy to begin playing. All an interested player needs is a smart phone with enough empty storage space and they can get started for free. This low entry barrier ensures that the game can accrue players easily. However, there's more to it than that.In the past five or so years, gacha games like Love and Deepspace have grown in popularity stateside thanks to the success of Genshin Impact and similar titles. Growing familiarity with the model of gacha games--and other elements like industry reports that show live-service games aimed at women and femmes are an underserved market --have buoyed its overall popularity. Then, you need to think about the game itself.With Love and Deepspace, Papergames has proven it is possible to pack AAA-level, hyper-realistic graphics into a mobile game. That, paired with its first-person perspective, help the game avoid any kind of uncanny valley sensation, and endear its boys with a sense of genuine liveliness as players interact with them. It makes sense, then, that Love and Deepspace skyrocketed past other similar titles and became the most profitable otome game in the United States within a year of its release.So are all Love and Deepspace players just really horny for fake men?Love and Deepspace has plenty of racy outfits and spicy moments, but it doesn't portray sex or nudity. When situations do intensify,NSFW content is largely implied rather than explicitly shown, with the game instead highlighting the romantic elements at play rather than any exposed skin. For example, the excitement might come from Xavier taking and kissing the player's hand gently rather than from any implied sex.\"I'm a sucker for a good romance, so having this game is like having a fun, sort of corny, very dramatic romance novel that I can appreciate and enjoy from a million different scenarios,\" Lon, a Rafayel fan who started playing in the spring of 2025, said. \"It's a romance novel that writes its own fanfiction--and I can write my own fanfiction as well.\"Given the romantic elements, those unfamiliar with the audience might assume Love and Deepspace is all about people using fictional men to live out their fantasies. This might be true for some players, but the relationship with these virtual men isn't so two-dimensional.Rowan, a Love and Deepspace devotee who started playing in early 2025 after hearing about the game from friends, likened the boys to \"court jesters\" or \"lab specimens.\" If they get bored, they can use the game to play a card game with one of the boys or watch them \"fail at a claw machine.\"\"Something I think a lot of people misunderstand is that fans of [Love and Deepspace] generally don't actually think the guys are real or our boyfriends. It really is more like we are all fans of the game, and while we have our--to use Kpop terminology, 'biases'--at the end of the day, we are all just having fun. And yes, there is combat in this game. Really. It can get very hard sometimes,,\" Rowan laughed.Rowan emphasized that it's not just about connecting with the boys on screen, but others who enjoy the game.\"I talk to my friends who play the game every day, and I interact with other fans on TikTok and Bluesky,\" Rowan said. \"We talk about the guys and their habits and voice lines; events that are going on, or levels we are trying to clear. It's a lot like being a fan of a boy band: Part of what makes it popular is being popular, in a way.\"\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nDonkey Kong Bananza makes Nintendo’s platforming formula louder and more chaotic.By \n    Aron Garst\n   on December 28, 2025 at 6:00AM PST\n              \n                Drop into the lagoon in Donkey Kong Bananza. Sure, you need to chase Void Kong to the Earth's center to save the day, but maybe you just want to soak in some water-adjacent locales as you explore this new world beneath the surface. There are plenty of secrets tucked away in each level's hidden crevices. When you first hop in there is really only one thing to do: pick a direction and start smashing.Donkey Kong Bananza takes Nintendo's hallmark sandbox exploration and pushes it somewhere the studio rarely goes--pure chaos. Bananza is not interested in the kind of precision platforming that defines Mario's visits to Peach's Castle, Delfino Plaza, or outer space. It captures that same cheerful vibe, but lets players rip through it.There is a long-running design idea at Nintendo that movement should feel good on its own. Shigeru Miyamoto once said he wanted players to enjoy moving Mario around an empty room. The reason Mario is so fun to control in Super Mario 64 is that Miyamoto and the small team behind the N64 classic spent months making sure he felt great to play, even if the only action possible was running around an empty space.Delfino Plaza from Super Mario SunshineCombine that movement philosophy with tightly designed playgrounds and you get moments players never forget. There is nothing quite like triple hopping across the center square of Delfino Plaza, bouncing off an umbrella, and sliding into a chimney chute to grab a blue coin. It was fun just to jump around, which naturally encouraged exploration, which created a quick dopamine hit when a secret Shine Sprite appeared and the day literally got brighter.Donkey Kong Bananza taps into that same feeling, but in an entirely different way. I am not guiding Donkey Kong across rooftops with three perfect hops. I am plowing through debris, carving my own path, and uncovering collectible-packed caverns. It becomes easy to wander off the main objective and start exploring every crack and crevice of the planet's inner layers.Platforming has always been a pillar of Nintendo design. Mario, Kirby, and Donkey Kong, along with other Nintendo icons, all focus on exploration through running, jumping, and a bit of flair. Donkey Kong Bananza keeps the flair, but adds a hefty serving of smash. It feels authentic because chaos is exactly what you expect from a rambunctious gorilla.Donkey Kong is naturally destructive, according to NintendoNintendo has said before that playing as Donkey Kong should feel like an adventure through untamed spaces. Bananza producer Kenta Motokura echoed that idea in an interview, saying that with the goal of defining what 3D Donkey Kong should be and highlighting his strengths and new actions, the team felt the concept of destruction was the right fit.In the end, Bananza succeeds because it embraces exactly what makes Donkey Kong special. It is loud, messy, and endlessly fun. The thrill is not just in reaching the core. It is in everything you smash, discover, and carve through along the way.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on December 5, 2025 at 10:14AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The launch of Fortnite Chapter 7 has introduced Surf City, the sixth Reload map since the respawn-focused mode was first introduced during the summer of 2024, and the fourth since April. While other new Reload maps added in 2025 were not directly based on any islands from the main Fortnite Battle Royale, Surf City is largely a shrunken-down version of the new Chapter 7 island, which is based on the southwestern USA--specifically, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, and everything in between.At the heart of the map is Battlewood Boulevard, a massive, sprawling cityscape that covers a much larger area than any previous Reload POI. The Reload version of Battlewood Boulevard is nearly identical to the same POI on the main Battle Royale map--it hasn't been scaled down at all for the smaller island.Several other spots in this island correspond to spots on the BR island as well, but none of the other were transplanted directly--these are more inspired by the big island. Breaker Beach in the south is more or less the same as Ripped Tides on the BR map, Sweaty Shores is similar to Latte Landing, Cashmere Cliffs is actually an expanded version of Humble Hills, and Sus Studios is, of course, Sus Studios.Then up at the north end of the map we've got Divey Dam, which is an original new spot that has no equivalent on any other Fortnite map. Divey Damn has a large, empty mountain above it--but there's more stuff up there than you'd probably think given that it's not a named location.Scroll on for better looks at each of the big spots on Fortnite Reload's new Surf City map.Divey DamBreaker BeachCashmere CliffsSus StudiosBattlewood BoulevardSweaty Shores    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Entertainment giant Disney is hiring someone to join its Digital Entertainment team to work on an upcoming Star Wars game that has the ambitious goal of being a \"groundbreaking game experience that will herald the next generation of Disney to the world.\"The job ad for an Associate Art Director calls for someone who will work on the \"ambitious and exciting new project.\"\"Working with top-class industry talent, this role is perfect for the seasoned visionary leader looking to create something epic--guiding and collaborating with a robust group of creative and production leaders focused around a wonderfully rich and cohesive product that is truly Disney,\" reads a line from the description.The successful candidate will be the person who \"inspires and informs our development teams to deliver the most authentic world-class Star Wars experiences.\"This person will help \"shape the overall visual direction, safeguard IP integrity, and foster creative collaboration across internal and external teams.\"The person who gets the should will review art and visual design submissions with the aim of \"ensuring all assets meet our brand and quality standards.\" The person will also give feedback and should have a \"deep understanding of Star Wars lore.\"Naturally, this person will also collaborate with the teams at Lucasfilm.The job calls for someone with a lot of experience, including a minimum of seven years in gaming, film, or TV, and someone who has a \"broad and deep\" understanding of Star Wars. The person should also have \"extensive game development experience\" on \"top-grossing, critically acclaimed AAA games on console and mobile.\"What's more, the person who gets the job will be asked to travel globally to meet with partners spanning the world over.The job requisition has lots of details about what the person will do and what credentials they should have, but it does not say much of anything about what the game actually is. From the sound of the job ad, the project will be developed externally, which makes sense given Disney doesn't do much internal game development and instead licenses its brands to external teams.While this specific game remains a mystery, we do know about many in-development Star Wars games, including Star Wars Eclipse, a remake of Knights of the Old Republic, a new game from Amy Hennig, Star Wars: Zero Company, and a third Star Wars Jedi game at Respawn. The latest rumor is that Creative Assembly is making a Star Wars Total War game and that it may be revealed at The Game Awards.The frontrunner to become the next Disney CEO, Josh D'Amaro, is a big fan of video games. He shepared the $1.5 billion investment into Epic Games for the upcoming Disney x Fortnite project, and wants to do more with gaming going forward.Disney was at one time a bigger player in the world of video games, as the company had its own dedicated internal gaming division with Disney Interactive Studios. Disney also operated the once-popular Disney Infinity \"toys-to-life\" brand, but it also shuttered. Today, Disney's efforts in gaming mainly involve licensing its brands to other companies. In 2019, Iger spoke candidly about Disney's struggles making and publishing games internally, admitting, \"We haven't been particularly good...\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Path of Exile 2 players won't have to wait long for the next update. The Last of the Druids is arriving on December 12, and it's putting more than just the magic of the Druids at your command. Players will soon be able to transform their Druids into a wolf, a bear, or even a dragon-like wyvern. The teaser trailer below demonstrates the powers that each new form has to offer.          The Druid's ability to transform is tied to one of three different talismans. As a wolf, players can summon a pack to attack enemies or rip adversaries to shreds with their own teeth and claws. Bears are raw power personified, and they can increase their strength through each roar they make. Becoming a wyvern grants the player the power of flight, as well lightning and fire attacks that can bring any adversary to their knees.Even as a human, Druids have formidable abilities to fall back upon. They can command earth and storm elements, which put thunder and volcano attacks at their fingertips. There will be two paths for Druids to ascend to. As a Shaman, Druid magic and spells are amplified to a staggering degree. The Oracle may be the second ascendancy class for the Druids, but it grants players the foresight to predict enemy movements before they happen. Using those visions of the future in battle sounds like it could be very useful.Some of the other additions coming in the update include a dragon-crafting league mechanic, 30 new support gems, an expanded passive tree with over 250 passive skills, and a new Pinnacle Boss, Atziri. There will also be a free weekend preview for the game running from December 12-15 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.Grinding Gear game director Jonathan Rogers recently acknowledged that Path of Exile 2 will not reach its 1.0 launch in March 2026 as originally planned. Instead, he estimated a late 2026 emergence from early access.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

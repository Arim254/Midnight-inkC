While Nintendo (and most companies and services) traditionally releases these summaries in December of each year, it pushed back its Switch wrap-up to January for reasons unstated.While it missed the usual wave of yearly wrap-ups, the plus side is that Nintendo's 2025 summary includes your December play time, so your many hours of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond just might eke out on your list of most-played games.The personalized wrap-up sums up how many games you played on Switch and Switch 2 and how many hours you played, showing a month-by-month breakdown and evaluating your favorite game genres. Additionally, you can choose a favorite game you played this year and share a graphic that summarizes the data, and you can download a free 2026 calendar at the end to print out.If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, Nintendo's website also pulls Switch data going back to the console's launch in 2017. If you're patient enough to scroll all the way to the bottom, you can download a video that displays this data.2025 was an important year for Nintendo, with the Switch 2 launching in June to massive sales success. Nintendo-published highlights in the Switch 2's first months on the market included Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby Air Riders, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Indie hits like Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades 2, along with third-party games previously released on other platforms like Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, also graced the Switch 2's early software lineup.In the coming year, Switch 2 owners may return to the timesink known as Animal Crossing: New Horizons with a cheap upgrade. Other upcoming Nintendo titles include Mario Tennis Fever, The Duskbloods, and Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, with third-party offerings including Resident Evil Requiem and 007 First Light.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

That's all that Capcom has confirmed thus far, so it remains to be seen what else the company may have on tap.In addition to the new game, Sony is producing a new Resident Evil movie, with Weapons and Barbarian director Zach Cregger directing. The movie is coming this October.          2026 marks the 30th anniversary of the Resident Evil series, but it remains to be seen if Capcom has any celebrations planned to mark the occasion.The Resident Evil Showcase isn't the only big gaming event on tap for January, as the Xbox Developer Direct will be held on January 22, promising updates on Fable and Forza Horizon 6, among other titles.Requiem takes players back to Raccoon City in the shoes of Grace Ashcroft. Iconic Resident Evil character Leon S. Kennedy will appear in the game as well, and both Grace and Leon are playable characters.  The game launches on February 27 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The franchise's success in print and on the big screen led to an inevitable manga adaptation, which returns later this month in a snazzy Deluxe Edition format. The first volume of the Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition will be available starting January 27, and preorders are available at Amazon--and best of all, it's currently discounted to $44 ahead of launch, saving you 20% off its standard $55 MSRP.                                 Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1                                                                $44 (was $55) | Releases January 27                                                                                                                                                                                    Battle Royale: Deluxe Edition Volume 1 is a 604-page, leather-bound hardcover omnibus featuring the first three volumes of the original manga series that ran from 2000 to 2005. It's unclear if the Deluxe Edition's publisher Yen Press is including a new--hopefully more faithful--translation or the controversial script from the English editions published by TokyoPop. While the Japanese version of the manga closely follows the original novel's plot, the English adaptation--handled by veteran comic book writer Keith Griffen--made substantial changes, resulting in several major plot holes in the later volumes.Either way, considering TokyoPop's releases have been out of print for several years, this new Deluxe Edition will be the easiest way to read the manga adaptation of the wildly popular franchise. Volume 1 launches on January 27, and we expect the next volumes in the series to go up for preorder in the near future.                      Battle Royale would receive several sequel manga series over the years, but most of these are also hard to find due to their limited print runs. The most recent series in the IP is Battle Royale: Enforcers, which began serialization in 2022. Set decades after the original series, Enforcers takes place in the same universe. After a government artificial intelligence reactivates the infamous Program 68, the unruly kids of Daitoa Academy's Class F find themselves divided into squads, given weapons, and set loose to fight each other to the death. So far, four paperback volumes of the series have been released and translated into English.Battle Royale: Enforcers MangaVol. 1 -- $12 ($15)Vol. 2 -- $11.24 ($15)Vol. 3 -- $10.60 ($15)Vol. 4 -- $12 ($15)If you're looking to watch the movie that the book was based on, it is available on Blu-ray. A standard Blu-ray of the gory Director's Cut is priced at $25, and a pricy 4K version was released last year. This release includes a mix of Director's Cut legacy special features, the theatrical cut's bonus materials, and a striking steelbook cover.Battle Royale Blu-raysBattle Royale: Director's Cut -- $25Battle Royale: 25th anniversary (4K) -- $84For even more special edition manga releases, you can check out our gallery rounding up the best deluxe editions you can buy and preorder currently.

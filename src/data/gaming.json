    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Baltimore Ravens have gotten off to a 1-5 start this NFL season, and the coaching staff are apparently making moves to help turn things around, including removing certain items from the locker room, in an effort to help players focus.According to reports, a series of leisure items--including video games, cornhole boards, a ping pong table, and a basketball hoop--have been removed from the team locker room for the time being.Writer Sam Cohn of The Baltimore Sun said some Ravens players really enjoyed playing Super Smash Bros. in the locker room, with teammates crowding around to watch, but that's coming to an end for now. Players told The Sun that the coaching staff wanted to remove distractions for the players.The video games were apparently removed after the Ravens started the season 1-3, and since then, the Ravens have lost two more games to sink to 1-5. \"The only worse thing is 0-6, so yes, it's a big hole. We're going to have to bounce back,\" center Tyler Linderbaum said. \"We have 11 games left to try to run the table.\"The Ravens hit the field again this Sunday, October 26, at home against the 4-2 Chicago Bears. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

She said in a new interview that people are beginning to \"evolve way past\" the idea that a game should be exclusive to one store or device.\"The biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at Call of Duty, you look at Minecraft, you look at Fortnite, you look at Roblox ... that's actually what's really driving community in gaming. That's where people gather. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people,\" she told Mashable.\"You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they're on. And we're really leaning into that with this experience [Rog Ally X]. It just opens up another way for you to play, as does cloud, as does PC as do the consoles we all have in the living room,\" she added.          Microsoft was once a big believer in exclusive games, but the company has updated its business strategy and has in recent times opted to release its games in more places, including rival systems.For Sony, the company has also begun to bring more of its games to places beyond PlayStation, including PC and, in the case of Helldivers 2, Xbox. Nintendo, however, only releases its own games for its own exclusive platforms, and that's proven to be good business for the company.Microsoft does not have one single strategy it applies to all of its game releases, as some titles are released across multiple platforms simultaneously, others are not. One of the next Xbox games that could make the jump to PlayStation is Starfield, with a report saying this will be announced in 2026.In other news, Microsoft is reportedly gearing up to announce a Halo: Combat Evolved remake, and it might be in the works for PS5.Microsoft was also in the news recently regarding Bond's comments about the next Xbox console, labeling it \"high-end\" and prompting fears from fans that it will be very expensive.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                2025 has been a tumultuous year for the Xbox brand, with massive layoffs, multiple price hikes for both its console portfolio and Game Pass subscriptions, and continued controversy over Microsoft's work with Israel casting a shadow over the company's gaming wing. A new report from Jason Schreier at Bloomberg has shed some light on what's going on behind the scenes at Xbox, and a lofty profit goal looks to be the catalyst for these decisions.According to the report, for the past two years, top executives have set an \"across-the-board [profit margin] goal of 30 percent.\" The report says that the new target was set by Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, whose team has \"taken a larger role in the gaming business in recent years.\"Perfect Dark, which was cancelled in July 2025.For context, as Schreier reports, estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence mark the average profit margin for the entire video game industry at between 17 percent to 22 percent since 2018, with Xbox specifically coming in between 10 and 20 percent.Bloomberg's report also indicates that the requirement for Xbox first-party games to be available on the Xbox Game Pass subscription service has hurt software sales overall. However, Xbox has employed a \"member-weighted value\" credit system which, as the report states, \"is calculated based on several factors, such as the number of hours that Game Pass players collectively spend on a particular title.\"Part of Xbox's new strategy has been releasing first-party games on competing consoles. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5 have all launched on PlayStation 5 in recent months, with notable success according to sales figures.Those familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that \"moving forward, games that are either cheap to make or deemed more likely to generate significant revenue windfalls may take priority over riskier bets.\" Xbox has cancelled multiple projects recently in pursuit of this 30 percent goal, with Rare's Everwild, The Initiative's Perfect Dark, and Zenimax's Project Blackbird--all of which were in development for nearly a decade--among the biggest cancellations.Microsoft's next earnings report is currently scheduled for October 29. Before that, the next installment in Xbox's flagship Halo franchise is set to be unveiled October 24 as part of the Halo World Championships.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Last summer, solo developer Eero \"Rakuel\" Laine released Hardest, a free-to-play card game roguelike that he openly admitted was created with AI-generated assets. Since then, Laine has had a change of heart about AI and decided to delete Hardest from Steam on January 30.In a message posted to Hardest's Steam page, Laine credited his epiphany to his significant other and explained why he used AI assets in the first place.\"I made this game during the summer in couple months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free,\" wrote Laine. \"So I could generate unlimited images for free ... But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment.\"\"I coded everything myself, so I can in the future make a new game with real assets if I feel like it,\" added Laine. \"But the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players. Ethically only logical reason is to delete the game from Steam.\"The use of AI-generated assets in game development remains a hotly debated topic. Hooded Horse--the publisher behind Endless Legend 2, Terra Invicta, and Against the Storm--recently banned all AI-generated content from its games. Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender even described them as \"cancerous.\"Shortly after Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was named Game of the Year at the Indie Game Awards, it was it was stripped of its win over \"placeholder\" AI assets that were eventually removed from the game.Another hit from 2025, Arc Raiders, has come under fire for using AI-based text-to-speech systems. Patrick Söderlund--the head of Arc Raiders studio Embark--has since said, \"We don't use AI to not have to hire people or replace people or job groups or voice actors ... People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players. I realize it is an intricate subject and discussion.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

Nintendo has rolled out a new system update for the Switch 2 that brings it up to version 21.2.0, and as you've probably guessed, it doesn't do much.\"General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience,\" the very succinct update notes read.Since its launch, the Switch 2 has mostly focused on small updates like this to keep the console running smoothly for users. That's not to say there haven't been any substantial updates so far, as the November firmware upgrade added better visual clarity on the home menu to indicate whether a game is owned physically or digitally. The update also added GameChat improvements, helping to fine-tune the Switch 2.The Switch 2 got off to a strong start last year after its June launch, smashing through several sales records along the way. Sales in the US were reportedly down by around 35% from November to December when compared to Switch 1 sales during the same period in its launch year of 2017, and overall, November 2025 was the worst month for hardware sales in the US since 1995.Nintendo still predicts to sell 19 million Switch 2 units by the end of March, and its early 2026 offerings include a substantial upgrade for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Mario Tennis Fever.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

It's important to know what guns to use and which situations they work well in. Here we highlight the best weapons to equip in Arc Raiders so you can protect yourself and all your valuable loot. This list includes some powerful high-tier options as well as guns you can craft and use early in your game.The weapons you choose for each raid will depend on your goal for the match. Weapons with heavy ammo are usually better picks for tackling fights with ARCenemies, while medium or light ammo is often enough to down raiders in PvP engagements.Additionally, these guns can be upgraded to become even more powerful to use, and we have a full guide for upgrading weapons and workbenches in Arc Raiders. For more, check out our Arc Raiders quest list and starter tips.FerroThe Ferro is one of the best starter weapons in Arc Raiders. This single-shot battle rifle is a gun of common rarity that you can easily craft or find as loot when you're just getting started with the game. The Ferro makes up for its slow firing and reload speeds with accuracy, long-range damage, and its ability to deal high penetration to ARC armor. This gun is a smart pick for fights against robot and human threats alike, so long as you can hit your shots.Ferro weapon details:Ammo Type: Heavy ammoFiring Mode: Break-ActionARC Armor Penetration: StrongThe weapon allows for mods, and the suppressor can be a handy pick for taking long-range fights without giving away your position.RattlerThe Rattler assault rifle is another great starter weapon in Arc Raiders. This common rarity weapon pairs well with the Ferro battle rifle mentioned above, as this is a full-auto gun that gives you a nice balance for combat. The Rattler is pretty well-rounded in terms of damage, range, and handling. Its high fire rate and moderate armor penetration make it decent for Arc enemies, but even better for PvP encounters.Rattler weapon details:Ammo Type: MediumFiring Mode: Fully-AutomaticARC Armor Penetration: ModerateThe magazine capacity is low for a fully automatic gun, though. Tapping the trigger in bursts instead of spraying a ton of ammo will help you further improve your accuracy as well as conserve your bullets with this gun. Leveling up the Rattler will also increase the ammo capacity of the weapon.AnvilThe Anvil pistol is a weapon of uncommon (blue) rarity. This is a powerful hand cannon, and it works well for most engagements. It doesn't have the same long-range capabilities of the Ferro, but this is another single-shot powerhouse that works great in fights against ARC enemies or raiders. The Anvil being of uncommon rarity means it's not too difficult to loot, craft, or purchase, and you get a lot of bang for your buck.Anvil weapon details:Ammo Type: HeavyFiring Mode: Single-ActionARC Armor Penetration: StrongThe Anvil also has its own unique mod called the Anvil Splitter. This attachment is of legendary rarity, and it allows you to fire three separate projectiles per shot. This mod can make the Anvil feel more like a sawed-off shotgun with a tight pellet spread, but it can reduce your accuracy at longer ranges.BettinaThe Bettina is a weapon of epic rarity. This assault rifle packs a deadly punch, and its strong armor penetration makes it best used against Arc enemies. It does suffer from moderate recoil, but burst firing this gun can allow you to tackle fights against robots at a good range.It's worth noting that the Bettina's weapon durability degrades fast, and it requires valuable resources to repair. However, this is still a fun and powerful gun to use.Bettina weapon details:Ammo Type: HeavyFiring Mode: Fully-AutomaticARC Armor Penetration: StrongYou can also further increase this weapon's power with the gun's unique legendary Kinetic Converter mod, as this will boost the gun's fire rate by 15%. However, this attachment does add more kick with a 20% increase to both horizontal and vertical recoil.TempestThe Tempest is a weapon of epic rarity. This is an assault rifle that is really strong against raiders and decent when fighting Arc enemy types. It's fully automatic and does have some recoil, but the gun's kick is very manageable.Tempest weapon details:Ammo Type: MediumFiring Mode: Fully-AutomaticARC Armor Penetration: ModerateThe mod slots for the Tempest are just the standard variety, but it's worth considering at least throwing on a suppressor to help keep you from drawing too much attention.VulcanoThe Vulcano is a weapon of epic rarity. This is a beefy, semi-automatic shotgun meant for close-range engagements. This is best for when you're clearing buildings and taking out any raiders or small Arc enemies that cause you trouble. Its armor penetration is weak, so it's not the strongest choice for larger Arc robots.Vulcano weapon details:Ammo Type: Shotgun ammoFiring Mode: Pump-ActionARC Armor Penetration: WeakThe Vulcano also lets you equip a suppressor mod, so as always in Arc Raiders, it could be worth adding the attachment to remain stealthy on the map.HullcrackerThe Hullcracker is a special epic-rarity weapon. This is essentially a grenade launcher designed to take down ARC enemies. The Hullcracker doesn't damage raiders, so you'll want a secondary weapon meant for PvP fights, but this launcher's explosive rounds deal massive damage to ARC enemies. It's especially great for bigger threats like the Leaper and Bastion.Hullcracker weapon details:Ammo Type: Launcher ammoFiring Mode: Pump-ActionARC Armor Penetration: Very Strong    \n  \n                      "

Nintendo did not provide a breakdown by platform, but Nintendo's public investor relations website shows that the original Switch accounts for a whopping 1.452 billion game sales alone and 154.01 million systems sold. In fact, the Switch is just 10,000 units shy of passing the DS (154.02 million) to become Nintendo's best-selling platform ever. Behind the Switch and DS for hardware sales is the Game Boy (118.69), the Wii (101.63 million), and the Game Boy Advance (81.51 million) to round out the top five best-selling Nintendo platforms.In terms of game sales, the Switch 1 ranks highest by a massive margin. The next closest to the Switch is the DS, which has accumulated 948.76 million game sales, followed by the Wii (921.85 million), Game Boy (501.11 million), NES (500.01 million), and then the 3DS (392.29 million).The Switch 2, meanwhile, launched in June 2025 and has surpassed 10 million unit sales in its first four months; more than 20.6 million games have been sold for the system. Nintendo also recently boosted its sales projections for the Switch 2, raising the sales forecast for the console this fiscal year from 15 million to 19 million, an increase of more than 26%.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Next year, Refugium Games is sending players back to school with Agefield High: Rock the School. And you might actually like going to classes at this school, but the real action is off campus in this homage to the teenage sex comedies from the early 2000s. The influence of films like American Pie is very apparent in the first trailer for the game.          The game casts players as Sam Tatum, the new kid at Agefield High who quickly befriends Kale Baines and \"wannabe rocker\" Axel Philly. Sam and his new crew also a mutual enemy in Seth, one of the school's jocks. From the trailer, it looks like there will be plenty of chances to either pull a prank on Seth or physically fight him for high school dominance.Now, you could sit in class for lessons in English, math, geography, German, and music; all of which are actually in the game. But you also have the freedom to skip class and explore the game's open world, which expands beyond the campus to include two neighborhoods, the town center, and the country side. Rebellion is encouraged, but adult authority figures like teachers and cops will chase players if they catch them breaking the law or skipping school.According to Refugium Games, this title will have approximately 8-10 hours of gameplay spread across 32 primary missions and 15 side missions. Players can earn money to buy clothes, haircuts, and tattoos, as well as bikes, and other accessories. Dirty magazines are also available, because it just wouldn't be a teen comedy without them. This title may remind some fans of Rockstar's Bully, a game that's gone almost two decades without a sequel.Agefield High: Rock the School is available to wishlist on Steam now. Refugium Games estimates that the game will be released in 2026 Q2.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

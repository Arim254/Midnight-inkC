    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                As GPU prices continue to skyrocket and stock becomes increasingly scarce, rumors are swirling that Nvidia might be about to resurrect a previously discontinued line of hardware.According to Wccftech, Nvidia is reportedly on the verge of resuming production on its budget-friendly GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs to combat the ongoing shortage of RAM being caused by an uptick in development on AI technologies and the increasing prices of memory.Wccftech's reporting on these rumors seems to stem from a credible leaker of Nvidia GPU production news on Twitter called @hongxing2020. According to a post they made early on January 5, Nvidia seems poised to bring back the RTX 3060 in the first quarter of 2026.01.05updatertx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲  — hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) January 5, 2026              The back half of 2025 saw GPU prices sharply rise as tech companies voted to go all in on AI. In short, many of these companies need more raw computing power, which means that companies like Nvidia are now dedicating massive amounts of their own consumer stock to these ends. What little is left for consumers looking to build PCs has now risen in value, and you've likely seen as much if you've spent the last few months shopping around for the right parts for a gaming PC.Just days into 2026, it was reported that both AMD and Nvidia , two of the most reputable names in the business, would be raising the prices of their consumer GPUs quite heavily this year. Some of the estimates being floated sound preposterous, but regardless, you better get used to the idea of paying a lot of money--more than usual, at least--for memory as we wade deeper into 2026.That is, unless the rumors prove true and Nvidia does really bring back the RTX 3060, which is still one of the most popular graphics cards around despite being phased out for the newer (and more expensive) 40 and 50 series GPUs.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Steam hit a major milestone already this year, setting a new record for concurrent users. According to SteamDB, the platform peaked at 41,816,052 users online at the same time actively playing games. Not only that, but a new record for actively gaming users was also set, with that figure reaching almost 13.4 million as compared to March's 13.2 million record.The timing of the record is likely no coincidence. Steam's annual Winter Sale, which wraps up later today, offered steep discounts on a wide range of popular titles, along with more modest deals on newer releases. Sales events have long been a reliable driver of traffic on Steam, pulling in both longtime users and players returning to pick up games they missed throughout the year.Steam's growth has been steady for well over a decade, but it has accelerated sharply in recent years. A notable spike occurred in early 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns pushed concurrent users past 23 million, later climbing to 28 million just a couple of years later. The company even offered a bundle of games, which went to COVID relief at the time. Since then, the rise of live-service games and consistently strong seasonal sales have helped keep players logged in, especially during holidays. Games like Arc Riders continue to grow, hitting over 3 million concurrent players this week.While Steam reached this new peak after nearly 17 years of expansion, the pace of growth has been especially fast over the past six years, with peak user counts nearly doubling in that time. The achievement comes during a mixed period for Valve, which has faced criticism over inconsistent content moderation and censorship decisions.It'll be interesting to see how these numbers change once the Steam Machine comes into play later this year.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

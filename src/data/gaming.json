There were a lot of great Xbox 360 games during its run. But looking back, it's staggering to see how many of the top-selling Xbox 360 games were from the Call of Duty franchise.Circana's Mat Piscatella has shared the 20 best-selling Xbox 360 games in the US, and 7 out of the 20 were Call of Duty titles. Six of those games were in the top 10, and four out of the top five as well.Three Halo games and two Gears of War titles made the list, as did perennial best-sellers Minecraft and The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. Since the acquisitions of Bethesda, Activision, and Mojang Studios, Microsoft now owns the rights to 17 of the titles on this list.Outside of Microsoft's dominion, Rockstar Games had two of the most-acclaimed titles of that generation: Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto 4. Meanwhile, EA's Battlefield 3 was the publisher's sole title to make the list.Peter Moore--the former Microsoft executive who oversaw Xbox and Xbox 360--recently shared some of the history behind the latter's battle with the PlayStation 3 for the hearts and minds of gamers. The Xbox 360 is one of the biggest hits that Microsoft has ever had in the gaming realm. Although the Xbox 360 store was shut down last year, Microsoft shared an update for the system in June 2025.The complete list of the top 20 best-selling Xbox 360 games in the US is reproduced below. Most of the titles are still available to play on the Xbox Store.20. Gears of War 3Developer: Epic GamesRelease Date: September 20, 201119.

That's just barely above its all-time low price of $29.53. While Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is focused on Summer Olympic sports, Amazon's 50% discount is a great way to get in the Olympic spirit a few months before the winter event kicks off.

You'll find all the Summer Olympic staples here, taking you from the track to the swimming pool and boxing ring to the archery range. Each event ranges in complexity--most feature easy-to-learn controls, while others, like soccer and rugby, offer more depth and challenge, making this a great minigame collection for players of all skill levels. The roster of playable characters includes familiar faces from both the Sonic and Mario series, including the titular mascots themselves, and friends like Luigi, Tails, Waluigi, Dr. Eggman, and more.                      Our Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 review gave it a 7/10, due to its entertaining events (each with its own gimmick) and unique control schemes that make it easy to find a playstyle that works for just about everyone.\"Mario & Sonic at the Tokyo Olympic Games 2020 is an entertaining take on the sports-event genre that has, by and large, disappeared in the modern-day,\" wrote critic James O'Connor. \"The game aims for accessibility at every opportunity, and while nothing about it is particularly exceptional, it still has plenty of unique flourishes to offer, and the wealth of different events and simple controls make for an appealing casual multiplayer title. Thanks to a generous selection of events and a few neat gimmicks, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is the best entry in this series.\"Amazon is discounting several other Switch exclusives for Black Friday 2025, including hits like Super Mario Odyssey, but the deals are selling out quickly.

Catan first launched in 1995, with each new edition slightly tweaking its appearance and gameplay. The fifth edition in 2015 marked a big change for the brand, as it moved from “The Settlers of Catan” to simply “Catan.” This new sixth edition doesn’t do anything quite so radical, but it does offer a more inclusive adventure and an improved eco-friendly design.Here’s a look at everything that’s changed:Updated graphics: You’ll now find brighter artwork and modern designs that make the game easier to parse. This also includes new character illustrations with greater diversity.Premium, eco-friendly components: Components are crafted with less plastic and an eye for sustainability. You’ll also find new textured hex tiles and updated card trays that make it easier to stay organized.Smart storage: The 5-6 Player Extension Pack contents can now fit inside the base game box, so you can more easily transport all your pieces.Improved rulebook: While the rules are the same, the rulebook has been updated with clearer graphics and gameplay examples, helping new players learn the basics.If you own other Catan expansions, you should be able to use them with the new 6th Edition. The rules remain the same across all editions, but you’ll have to deal with conflicting art styles.

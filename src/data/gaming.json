    "body": "\n                            \n          \n          \n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n    \n              \n          \n                This week, From Software's Elden Ring Nightreign is expanding with The Forsaken Hollows DLC, which adds two new playable characters, two extra bosses, and a fresh Shifting Earth event. But if you want to play that DLC, then you'll need to add the new Nightreign Version 1.03 patch across PC and consoles.One of the primary changes in this patch is that the trigger conditions for Relic effects have been broadened. The game's passive effects have been increased, which include greater attacking power when using two-handed weapons or armaments, as well as chain attacks, charge attacks, and jump attacks.The Wrath of Gold incantation has been given a power boost, while decreasing the cost to players' FP consumption. There are a number of bug fixes in this patch as well, including one that was teleporting players to the wrong area during the Augur invasion if they were performing a critical hit at the time. Under certain conditions, players weren't able to activate Sites of Grace or Churches, but the notes say the issue has been \"mitigated.\"If you want to unlock The Forsaken Hollows' new characters and face the new bosses, check out GameSpot's guide to starting the new DLC. The Forsaken Hollows will officially launch on December 4.

The third and final Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo, Sylux, is available to order for $30 at Amazon and other major retailers. Like other Amiibo released during the Switch 2 era, all three Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo are more expensive than collectors were used to before 2025. That's why it's refreshing to see Amazon restock the Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack for $25.31 (was $30). The Dread Amiibo set isn't difficult to find for around MSRP, but it's rare to see it sold by a major retailer. Usually you need to buy it from a third-party seller, but this restock is sold and shipped by Amazon.                                 Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack                                                                $25.31 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack is cool for multiple reasons. For Samus fans, it's one of the few collectibles featuring the bounty hunter's regenerating Varia Suit. The blue-tinged sections on the suit are organic matter from the Fusion Suit. This directly ties back to the events of Metroid Fusion. In the 2002 Game Boy Advance game, Samus was infected by the X parasite. She received the Metroid vaccine, but when Dread starts, her Varia Suit is still in the process of regenerating to its normal form.This Samus Amiibo is cool, but the E.M.M.I. Amiibo might be cooler. One of the most unsettling enemies in franchise history, the Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier--better known as EMMI--is robot nightmare fuel. Like Samus, the EMMI Amiibo's pose matches official key art.If Amazon sells out, you can buy the Metroid Dread 2-Pack from a third-party seller on Walmart Marketplace for roughly the same price.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Legendary game designer and programmer Ron Gilbert (Monkey Island) has revealed that one of his exciting-sounding upcoming projects has been canceled due in part to investors not coming to the table to fund the project.Speaking to Ars Technica, Gilbert said this game had a vision of being a \"large, open-world-type RPG\" in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen.\"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that,\" he said. \"You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.\"Gilbert previously described his new project as \"classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park,\" and a lot of people were excited to find out what that might look like. Now it's not happening.\"Horrible\" publishing dealsGilbert said he pitched the project to people in the industry but discovered that \"deals that publishers were offering were just horrible.\"The kind of game Gilbert envisioned \"isn't the big, hot item\" so potential publishers didn't invest, he said. \"The amount of money they're willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this,\" he explained.Gilbert funded 2017's Thimbleweed Park on Kickstarter, bringing in more than $600,000 USD. Gilbert also took private investment to complete the project.The industry veteran observed that publishers today can be \"very analytics-driven\" and have devised their own formulas to \"try to figure out how much money they could make.\" The result of this, Gilbert observed, is that publishers take on less risk, and in turn, games that do get made often look the same.\"You end up [getting] a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year’s games, because that makes some money,\" he said. \"When we were starting out, we couldn't do that because we didn't know what made this money ... I think that's why I really enjoy the indie game market because it's kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there's a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness.\"Gilbert's latest game is Death by Scrolling, an action game that was released at the end of October this year. Before that, he partnered with Devolver for Return to Monkey Island.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on December 1, 2025 at 3:07AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                When it comes to building a base or one-off structures in Minecraft, you generally don't put too much effort into the floor design. Most players will lay down some stone or wood planks and call it a day, opting to focus more on the framing and exterior design of the structure, as that's what you see more of. However, floors have the potential to completely transform the look and feel of a building, especially when they're done right and with a unique flair.If you can't get the wood plank design for floors out of your head, allow us to help you. We have compiled a list of some well-designed floors that any player can take advantage of in their Minecraft world. The floors are also all drastically different from one another, giving you multiple options for your base and other structures.Built-In FloorsReference: PinterestStarting the list off is a simple yet elegant floor design that features a built-in crafting table surrounded by glass and plants. While the floor we've showcased is situated in a small room, you can expand this design to cover as much space as you need. The idea of building a crafting table, chest, or other bulky object into your floor isn't anything new, but it's also easy to forget.The floor design you see above has decided to go with glass around the crafting table and some other blocks in addition to the wood planks that make up the majority of the floor. However, you can utilize other blocks or designs for the floor itself and the built-in space for your crafting table, chest, or any other interactable object.Cherry and TerracottaReference: RedditSometimes, there are two or three blocks that simply look outstanding when placed together. The floor you see above is made with Cherry Logs, Purple Terracotta, and Muddy Mangrove Roots for the majority of the design. The middle and end blocks are made with End Stone, Chorus Flower, and String. The result of the entire floor is an alluring design that can be utilized in any kind of structure in Minecraft.However, with how dark and mysterious the floor looks, it's perfect for a basement lair or perhaps some kind of potion-brewing room. The floor would also look great in an outdoor setting, especially with some additional lighting.CheckerboardReference: RedditWith how Minecraft's blocks work, a checkerboard design for your floors or even walls is a tried and true choice for many players. However, there are ways to spice up the basic design, and the one we're showcasing certainly takes the checkerboard design to a new level. The floor utilizes a slew of dark wood and terracotta blocks, making for a cozy design that doesn't go too overboard.Of course, you can take the basic checkerboard design and use whatever blocks you want to complete your floor. Make it an RGB floor with different colors of wool or go with a stone checkerboard that looks like something out of a fantasy world.Water FloorsReference: RedditAny kind of water feature is going to be a foundational piece of your structure, but a water floor is something that you don't see too often. The water floor design we're showcasing is implementing some mods in Minecraft, mainly ones that allow you to trim blocks down to single or double strips, but the core idea can still be done in the vanilla version.The design also utilizes a waterfall to continuously fill up the room with water, but you can simply fill the floor with enough water so that it stays still. Either way, having water coursing throughout your floor is one of the most jaw-dropping ways to make your base or structure stand out.Stained GlassReference: RedditFinally, we arrive at possibly one of the coolest and most unique floor and hallway designs you can have in Minecraft. This hallway utilizes an orange-colored stained glass to line the floor and then features lava encased in a unique stone design that reflects off the floor to make it seem like you're walking on lava. Some users on Reddit pointed out that this looks like the lava hallway from the movie The Incredibles, and they're certainly not wrong.You don't have to utilize the lava idea, as using differently-colored stained glass for your floor is more than enough to make it pop. However, if you did go down the lava route, this is the best design to copy, bar none.    \n  \n                      "

Video games are among the most sought-after products this year, but which games and systems do people in the US want the most?A report from Adobe Analytics said video games and consoles are expected to be among the \"key drivers of holiday spending\" this year in the US, with seven products overall singled out. Ranked in no particular order, the top seven most sought-after gaming items for Holiday 2025 are:Nintendo Switch 2PlayStation 5Xbox Series XDonkey Kong BananzaMadden NFL 26NBA 2K26Call of Duty: Black Ops 7Adobe's report is forecasting a total spend in the US of $253.4 billion (+5.3%) for Holiday 2025 shopping season (November 1-November 23), and that's just for online shopping.A recent study from the Entertainment Software Association found that, among parents who said they are planning to buy their children video games as gifts this year, they plan to spend an average of $736.83. That figure may look high, but games are generally more and more expensive these days, and consoles are ticking up in price, too, due in part to tariffs and other factors.Black Friday may be over, but Cyber Monday deals are now available across pretty much every retailer you can think of. One of the best deals going right now is $50 off the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle, bringing it down to $450.For more, check out all the best gaming deals for Cyber Monday.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

On November 29, Keighley followed up with a Google Maps image showing the location of the marketing monolith in the California desert. People quickly found the spot and posted images and video, including the ones below.Windows Central reporter Jez Corden said the teaser is related to an upcoming Diablo 4 expansion announcement, \"but also, more.\"It was previously confirmed that Diablo 4 will get a new expansion in 2026, so a reveal at The Game Awards would make sense. The imagery of the teaser monolith is hellish as well, which is fitting if it's a Diablo 4 teaser.Diablo 4 launched in June 2023 and received its first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, in October 2024. This added a new region and class, along with more loot and endgame content.The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, and we're expecting lots of news and reveals.

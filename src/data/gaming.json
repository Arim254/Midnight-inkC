    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this year, John Romero--the creator of Doom and Quake--announced that his next first-person shooter had been canceled. Although Romero and his company, Romero Games, didn't confirm that the project was a victim of Microsoft's layoffs and cutbacks, one of Romero Games' laid-off employees did. However, it appears the still-unnamed shooter isn't completely dead, according to Romero himself.During his appearance at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (via Eurogamer), Romero confirmed that the project is back on, and that it's been given a fresh redesign.\"We're not starting at ground zero,\" said Romero. \"We can take pieces out of and put into a brand-new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.\"Romero clarified that the current incarnation isn't the same exact title as his previous project, but \"it incorporates a lot of the elements\" and it's a much smaller game in this version. He also played coy about what the gameplay will be like with cryptic hints that he has \"never played a game like it,\" and \"the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through Elden Ring was a really new experience ... That's the idea behind what we are doing in this game.\"Although Romero Games confirmed its survival last summer, some of Microsoft's internal studios hit by layoffs were not as lucky. Microsoft canceled Perfect Dark and closed its developer, The Initiative. Microsoft also canceled Everwild and a new MMORPG from ZeniMax Online Studios.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Developer Expression Games has released the first gameplay trailer for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, a hardcore 50v50 first-person shooter set during the Vietnam War. A follow-up to 2021's Hell Let Loose--which was inspired by the conflicts of World War 2--players will have to once again rely on tactical teamwork to survive.          Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six new maps on launch day, each described by Expression Games as a mix of dense jungle, twisting deltas, and deadly open areas. You won't just be fighting on the ground either, as military helicopters serve multiple roles. From troop deployment to fire support, reconnaissance, and tactical drops, they're an invaluable tool in any match.Players can also engage each other in naval combat, as heavily armed vessels such as the iconic US patrol boat and the PBR will be featured in the game. Maps are also riddled with tunnel networks constructed by the North Vietnamese army, and these offer strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements.History buffs will also appreciate the attention to detail in this shooter, as everything from the military uniforms to the firearms players use are designed to be as historically authentic as possible. Even better, there's not a single note of Creedence Clearwater Revival music to be heard in the trailer.Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will launch in 2026 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Fortnite collabs look like they could be off to a strong start next year, with leaks suggesting that a Bleach crossover is coming. According to the leaks, it's set to launch in early 2026 during Chapter 7 Season 1. Since the season is set to end on March 4, the most likely release window is January or February.First spotted by noted dataminer SamLeakss, the collab could feature not just a character skin but also Ichigo's theme, \"Number One.\" So the skin seems likely to be Ichigo himself.Fortnite has been packed with collaborations lately, incorporating characters and icons from various worlds. In the past year alone, players have seen crossovers with horror legend Ghost Face, the viral Skibidi Toilet meme, Metal Gear Solid's Snake, and even recent pop-culture giants like KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game.Anime crossovers have been especially popular with players. Fortnite has already teamed up with major series such as Naruto, Dragon Ball, Attack on Titan, and Jujutsu Kaisen, each bringing fan-favorite skins, themed items, and special gameplay features. With these collaborations being so successful, it makes sense that Epic Games would pursue another major anime name, such as Bleach. However, nothing is confirmed yet, so we'll have to wait until Epic Games officially announces the crossover.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

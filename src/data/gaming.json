    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Grow A Garden cooking event has long since passed, and as such, it’s actually quite difficult to work out what the proper recipe is to make a salad. That is because some unexplained mechanics may be the cause of your culinary endeavors going awry. If you’ve come across recipes recently to make salads and not had any success, then fear not, as we’ll explain what’s going on here.Of course, to make these salads, you’re going to need to cultivate specific Grow A Garden seeds and harvest their fruit. These food items, as explained in our Grow A Garden Beginner’s Guide, are handy for leveling up your friendship with the shopkeepers, getting exclusive items in return. You’ll want to exploit Grow A Garden mutations to get the most friendship points possible from your creations. Below is everything you need to know about getting a cooking pot and making a salad in Grow A Garden.You can make recipes with Cooking Pots to make food that you can give to pets or NPCs.How to get a cooking pot in Grow A GardenThere are two ways to get a cooking pot in Grow A Garden. The easiest way is to save up 1,000,000 Sheckles and buy it from the Cosmetics shop when available. However, there’s a far cheaper way to get this item by completing all the Common Achievements track in the guidebook. This requires you to complete five tasks:Shovel 100 plantsHarvest 200 carrotsGift 1 carrotSell 500 strawberriesGift 5 strawberriesNone of these are difficult to finish, as the gifting tasks need you to hold the item and interact with a player to gift the plant to them. As for the shoveling plants, just buy 100 carrots as they’re the cheapest plant. Selling 500 strawberries might take a while, but it’s easily doable if you have a bunch of plants growing this common fruit at once.Recipes are displayed in the Guide Book with a Grow A Garden salad recipesA lot of changes have happened since the cooking-based Grow A Garden event a few months ago, and this includes many of the old recipes from those weeks no longer working. Instead, the salad recipe comprises a handful of components that you need to fill with each fruit. Those components can’t be the same for both sides, so two tomatoes will not make a salad; they instead make a smoothie. The recipe that worked for us was taking a Bamboo and a Pepper and putting them in the cooking pot to make a salad.The other thing is that, once you discover the recipe, it’ll appear in your in-game guidebook. However, the ingredients it lists will be ones you’ve got in your garden or have grown in the past. That means that there are likely plenty more out there not on this list. The recipes in the book are also guidelines rather than actual recipes, as combining Bamboo and Corn also makes a Smoothie in our time of testing. This is possibly because Corn counts as a fruit. Our suggestion is to add the components in the order displayed (Leafy, then Vegetable).Here are all the Grow A Garden salad ingredients we know of so far:LeafyVegetableTomatoBambooPineappleGreat PumpkinEvo Beetroot IIIRomanescoMandrakePumpkinPepperBroccoliEvo Pumpkin IIICornEvo Beetroot IIEvo Pumpkin IEvo Pumpkin IIBeanstalkJack O LanternEmerald BudParsleyTurnipEvo Beetroot IVCarnival PumpkinTomatoCarrotEvo Beetroot I\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

It's discounted to just $25 (was $30), so if you haven't yet played the iconic game, this is a great chance to dive in (or snag it as an affordable gift for a friend or family member). The discount doesn't seem like much, but it comes bundled with 3,500 Tokens, which typically cost $20. This version of Minecraft doesn't see many discounts. It briefly dropped its price by a few bucks during the summer, but this Black Friday deal is the best we've seen. If you're looking for a holiday gift for a younger gamer in your life, this is likely a good choice--just keep in mind this discount only applies to the physical PS5 version.                                 Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5)                                                                $25 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    While you'll find Minecraft for $20 at most digital storefronts, this physical edition deal is actually the better offer. Not only do you get a few in-game goodies, but you're getting an additional value of $20 from the 3,500 Tokens. That's a total value of $40 for just $25--and if you know you'll be buying stuff from the in-game store, this is certainly the edition to get. It gets you a physical copy of Minecraft, 3,500 Tokens, and two in-game items: the Popcorn Bucket Hat and Butter Shirt.                      Minecraft has seen massive success over the years, so it should come as no surprise that it's built up an impressive list of accompanying merchandise. And ahead of Black Friday, several Lego Minecraft sets are on sale. These include the 555-piece Ghast Balloon village Attack set, which is down to $56 (was $70), while the Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring is discounted to $41.49 (was $50), and the Trial Chamber is on sale for $32 (was $40).

Fans of the Blue Bomber can pick up the '90s animated series on Blu-ray for only $30 (was $50). Mega Man: The Complete Series just launched on Blu-ray at the end of October, so it's not surprising this is a new all-time low for one of Discotek Media's latest Blu-ray releases.Several other adaptations of video games in Discotek Media's catalog are on sale for Black Friday, including Street Fighter: The Animated Series for $32.59 (was $40), Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva for $15 (was $25), Monster Rancher: The Complete Series for $36 (was $60), and Darkstalkers: The Complete Animated Series for $24 (was $40). Darkstalkers launched last month on the same day as Mega Man. You can also save big on several of Discotek's Digimon movie and TV collections.

It's worth emphasizing that while this is a Blu-ray disc, the series is presented in standard definition with the original broadcast aspect ratio of 4:3.Bonus materials include an interesting mix of archival content, TV commercials, and new features like select commentary tracks from Mega Man's US voice actor, Ian James Corlett.The total runtime for the series on Blu-ray is 10 hours and 50 minutes. Prior to the Blu-ray's release, the only way to get the series in physical format was to buy the out-of-print 2014 DVD from a reseller.                      Mega Man: The Complete Series Blu-ray Special FeaturesMega Man original pilot pitchScans of the original press kitTV commercialToy commercialArt galleriesSeries bibleAll-new commentary from Mega Man voice actor Ian James CorlettLike other animated series of the time, Mega Man is a lighthearted cartoon with plenty of silliness. Even though it's a family-friendly show, it still has plenty of action, and the show accurately recreates the main plot of games from the time. Mega Man regularly battles Dr. Wily's mechanized forces, and episodes regularly introduce new Robot Masters. This show was a joint effort between Ruby-Spears Productions and Ashi Productions, and while the episodes are still presented in standard definition, they still look great, as the slick animation style has held up well.More Discotek Blu-rays based on video gamesDigimon, Street Fighter, and Darkstalkers Blu-rays                                                                                                                                               Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog: The Complete Series -- $60Darkstalkers: The Complete Animated Series -- $24 ($40)Darkstalkers: The Complete OVA Series -- $24 ($30)Digimon The Movies 1-3 Collection -- $18 ($30)Digimon The Movies 4-6 Collection -- $24 ($30) | December 30Digimon Adventure: Complete Series (English) -- $48 ($80)Digimon Adventure 02: Complete Series (English) -- $65 ($80)Digimon Adventure: Complete Series (Japanese) -- $70Digimon Adventure 02: Complet Series (Japanese) -- $42 ($70)Fatal Fury -- $30Mega Man: The Complete Series -- $30 ($50)Monster Rancher: The Complete Series -- $36 ($60)Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva -- $15 ($25)Sonic X: The Complete Series (English Dub) -- $70Sonic X: The Complete Series (Japanese Dub) -- $36 ($60)Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie (4K) -- $28 ($35)Street Fighter: The Animated Series -- $32.48 ($40)Virtua Fighter: The Animated Series -- Sold outIf you're looking to build up a collection of anime based on popular video games and cult-classic manga, then you'll want to check out the rest of Discotek's offerings.

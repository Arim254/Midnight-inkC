    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Baltimore Ravens have gotten off to a 1-5 start this NFL season, and the coaching staff are apparently making moves to help turn things around, including removing certain items from the locker room, in an effort to help players focus.According to reports, a series of leisure items--including video games, cornhole boards, a ping pong table, and a basketball hoop--have been removed from the team locker room for the time being.Writer Sam Cohn of The Baltimore Sun said some Ravens players really enjoyed playing Super Smash Bros. in the locker room, with teammates crowding around to watch, but that's coming to an end for now. Players told The Sun that the coaching staff wanted to remove distractions for the players.The video games were apparently removed after the Ravens started the season 1-3, and since then, the Ravens have lost two more games to sink to 1-5. \"The only worse thing is 0-6, so yes, it's a big hole. We're going to have to bounce back,\" center Tyler Linderbaum said. \"We have 11 games left to try to run the table.\"The Ravens hit the field again this Sunday, October 26, at home against the 4-2 Chicago Bears. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Circana's Mat Piscatella revealed the intriguing tidbit about Sony's current-gen console on BlueSky, though didn't provide exact numbers for comparison.There were roughly 88 million PS3 systems produced by Sony from 2006 to 2016. In August, Sony revealed that 80 million PS5 units had been sold globally since the console debuted in November 2020. That means it's a question of when, not if PS5 will top PS3 worldwide.September 2025 US video game data fun fact - The PlayStation 5 has now surpassed the PlayStation 3 in lifetime installed base. So that's cool. Source: Circana Retail Tracking Service. Shout out to Maki on the InstallBase forum for reminding me about this one.  â€” Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social) October 22, 2025 at 9:46 AM\n  As for other Sony hardware, the company reportedly stopped issuing sales figures for PS4 in 2022, when the system sat at roughly 117 units sold. The PS2 is the best-selling system of all time, with Sony producing over 160 million consoles from 2000 to 2013. There is a chance--though possibly a small one at this point--that Switch could catch up to PS2. As of August, Nintendo had sold more than 153 million Switch systems.Circana shared September 2025 video game industry sales data for the US earlier today. Borderlands 4 had the biggest launch in history for the looter-shooter series, when accounting for dollar sales. Piscatella noted Borderlands 4 was performing \"30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3\" for launch dollar sales. Meanwhile, the Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 has been delayed indefinitely.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The duck-themed game launched on October 16 and quickly shot up the Steam charts, going on to sell more than 1 million copies in its first five days.It has eclipsed more than 550,000 peak concurrent players on Steam, making it one of the platform's most popular games by player count.\"Team Soda is incredibly humbled to have reached such heights, and we owe this success to an incredible community of players and our friends at BiliBili Game,\" producer Jeff Chen said. \"Whether you've been with us through our early days promoting the demo on Steam or are just joining to see what all the quacking is about, thank you.\"Launch was just the beginning for Duckov, as the developer has now added mod support to help encourage people to make and share their own unique creations. Head to Steam to learn more about Duckov and modding.          Analyst Daniel Ahmad reminded people that Duckov was made by a team of five people, which makes the game's success even more impressive. The game is published by BiliBili, a Chinese giant also behind titles like Magicraft, Core Keeper, and Warm Snow.Duckov is available now for $15.83 USD, but the price will go up 12% to $18 USD on October 30.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

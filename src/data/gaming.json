    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The time of Halo: Infinite is coming to a close. Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.In a message posted to the official Halo site, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on \"multiple Halo titles in development.\" This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been saying for over a year now that there are multiple new Halo games in development.\"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us,\" reads the statement. \"While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.\"The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of the original Halo that will bring the franchise to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about a live-service Halo game, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed some light on the Halo MMO from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the Halo remake \"warms my heart,\" while another former Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders is probably the last game you'd expect to need to go beehive hunting, but that's exactly what you'll need to do in the aptly-named Bees! quest--and shoutout to Embark Studios for the Arrested Development reference. This quick and straightforward quest sends you to Blue Gate to snag one of these honey-filled bee homes from the Olive Grove POI, and we'll tell you exactly where to get your hands on it.You'll need to extract with the beehive in your inventory to get credit for the quest's completion, so you'd do well to bring an augment that possesses a safe pocket so that you can toss this quest item in there for safekeeping--you know, just in case some other raider decides to get fiesty with you. Don't worry--the bees won't sting, though.When you're ready to get your hands sticky with honey, here's how to find a beehive for the Bees! quest.Where to find a beehive for the Bees! questTo collect a beehive, you'll need to visit the Olive Grove POI on the Blue Gate map. This area is located in the southern region of the map and happens to be a very active spot for raiders since Olives are a hot commodity. With this in mind, make sure you wave and ask to be friends if you don't want to catch any fire from folks while you're snagging the beehive here.Find the beehive here.When you arrive to the location on the map above, you'll find a little shack. If you listen closely, you can probably hear the bees swarming nearby. Look under the roof on the side of the shack to spot the beehive and plenty of little bees flying around. Interact with it to add it to your inventory.Interact with the beehive to pick it up.With the beehive acquired, you'll need to extract and take back to Speranza to finish the Bees! quest. The Forest Airshaft is to your northwest, while the Overlook Airshaft can be visited by heading northeast. Head to whichever one is open based on how much time is left in the map, as they're both likely to be equally dangerous. Keep a lookout for rogue raiders and any patrolling ARC, hit the button, drop inside, and interact with the computer to get back to Speranza and finish things up.For more on Arc Raiders, we've compiled a full quest list for you.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders presents you with plenty of quests that require you to find materials or unique items, but only a few require you to use your materials to complete them. Eyes on the Prize, however, is one such quest that expects you to bring along a little something to help you get the job done. Let's jump in and see what's what.You'll need 3 Wires to repair the solar panel and complete Eyes on the Prize. Wires are a common resource found in Electrical-based POIs, and within a few hours of gameplay, you should've already amassed quite a collection--unless you've been selling them. Whether you're tossing them into your inventory before you head out or finding them while in the raid, just make sure you have 3 of them before you head to the secluded roof terrace for Eyes on the Prize. And make sure you toss them in a safe pocket if possible, as you never know when things could go wrong, and you don't want to lose them.When you're ready to repair a solar panel, here's how to complete Eyes on the Prize.Where to find the secluded roof terrace west of the Southern StationThe first objective in Eyes on the Prize is to find a secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station extraction point. The quest mentions to keep an eye out for a blue tarp, but it can still be hard to spot if you're not at the right angle. With that in mind, refer to the photo below for the exact location on the map.Gallery                                       You'll need to be on the roof to reach the secluded roof terrace (as per the name). You'll eventually spot a blue tarp with some chairs, boxes, and an electric box. That's your destination.How to rewire the solar panelAs mentioned earlier, you'll need to have brought or scavenged 3 Wires to repair the solar panel at the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace. If you didn't bring any in with you, you'll either have to recycle an electrical item like a Battery or visit an Electrical-based POI on the map to round a few up.As long as you have the 3 Wires in your inventory, you can approach the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace and interact with it to finish your repairs like a proper electrician. With that out of the way, the Eyes on the Prize quest will conclude.Repair the solar panel using 3 Wires.Since you don't need to extract to complete the quest, you're now free to finish looting or shooting until you're ready to leave. The nearby Southern Station should prove to be a solid spot to extract when you're finished up, though. Just keep in mind that it tends to be an active region of the map, so don't let your guard down.If you need to tackle more quests, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's been 12 years since Bruno Mars performed at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, but the musician has found a new big venue where he can sing without even leaving his home. This weekend, the hit Roblox game Steal a Brainrot is going to host a pop up performance by Bruno Mars that's a one-time only appearance.The official announcement went out on Roblox's social media channels. Mars' performance will be held on Saturday, January 17 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.Although musical acts like Stray Kids have performed in Roblox before, Mars will be the first to do so for Steal a Brainrot, which launched in May 2025. He's expected to sing his new single, I Just Might, as well as an older song, Locked Out of Heaven.To mark the occasion, players will have the chance to get a Bruno Mars Brainrot, as well as other related in-game items and traits.Steal a Brainrot, Grow a Garden, and the larger Roblox sandbox were among the top-trending topics on YouTube in 2025. There's even a Grow a Garden movie in development despite the game's lack of any identifiable story elements.However, Roblox has been dogged by accusations that it hasn't done enough to protect kids from child exploitation and grooming. According to a June 2024 Bloomberg investigation, the platform has had major issues with child predators. Florida and Texas even sued Roblox over that issue.Roblox has since introduced initiatives to keep children from talking to strangers, and to limit their interactions to kids roughly their own age. Earlier this month, Roblox continued its global rollout of a facial age-check system, but the results have been mixed at best.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                As part of a joke that is perhaps going too far, the markedly terrible Cory in the House game is not only closely trailing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in user ratings, but sealed copies of it are priced for hundreds of dollars online.There are numerous listings for the Nintendo DS game on eBay, with prices ranging from $50 to $1,420.69 (har, har). One listing even has 44 bids and currently prices the game at $1,025.00.This bizarre event appears to stem from the Best Games by User Score list of GameSpot sister site Metacritic, which currently has 2025 Game of the Year winner Clair Obscur sitting at the top with a 9.6 user score. But because the internet loves a good gag, Cory in the House has recently surfaced as the runner-up with a score of 9.3, tied with The Witcher 3, two versions of Metal Gear Solid 3, the original Silent Hill 2, and a couple of other classics.Listings on eBay have Cory in the House selling for hundreds of dollars.Released in 2008, a year that graced us with Grand Theft Auto 4, Fallout 3, and Dead Space, Cory in the House is based on the Disney Channel show of the same name.Players fill the shoes of Cory Baxter from the classic kid-friendly sitcom That's So Raven, whose father works as the White House head chef. The handheld game's epic tale follows Cory as he fights an evil toymaker who threatens to hypnotize the people of Washington, D.C. with modified bobbleheads depicting the President of the United States.As with most tie-in games of the day, the very few reviews of the DS game were negative. Somehow, the game got a resurgence of attention years after its release, with people ironically praising as a masterpiece deserving to be enshrined and jokingly categorizing the show as anime. In other words, Cory in the House is the video game equivalent of the Morbius movie.There's no telling if people will actually purchase copies of this notorious game at absurdly high prices, or if Metacritic will intervene and put an end to this Cory-mentum. For now, we can sit back and see how much higher the numbers can get.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this week, Battlefield 6's Season 2 launch was pushed back to February 17 to give the development team more time to implement some needed changes. But that doesn't mean there won't be some improvements ahead of time. Electronic Arts has announced that Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.3.5 will arrive on Tuesday, January 20, and it's bringing some good news for anyone who wanted the jet combat to be more refined.Going forward, jet cannon damage against flying vehicles has been greatly reduced, and it will take \"approximately 40% more hits\" to blow targets out of the sky. However, the air radar that was previously announced will not be included in this update.Melee combat was also a priority for this update, which aims to improve \"responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.\" The Assault Ladder should also be more functional after this update, and the patch notes indicate that it has resolved some issues with the user interface and heads-up display in Redsec and Multiplayer, in addition to better stability for the Battle Royale and Gauntlet modes.Since Season 1 has been extended, Battlefield Studios is adding new weekly challenges and a Frostfire bonus path that includes a hardware XP boost, a vehicle skin, and player-card customization items. Season pass owners will also be able to get a weapon package, an XP boost for your entire career, and more cosmetics.The complete patch notes for Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 are below, and they will go live on January 20 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET.Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 Patch NotesMajor Updates for 1.1.3.5Improved responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.Updated jet combat balance by reducing jet cannon effectiveness against other air vehicles.Updated and refined the UI and HUD across Multiplayer and REDSEC, improving armor bar visibility, reticle presentation, and menu navigation.ChangelogVehiclesFixed an issue where vehicles could explode when a takedown was performed on an enemy soldier lying on top of them.Reduced jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, requiring approximately 40% more hits to destroy enemy air targets.WeaponsBipod attachments no longer display as always providing a hipfire accuracy bonus, as this bonus only applies while the bipod is deployed.Fixed an issue where the GRIM 1.50x optic on the DB-12 cost fewer loadout points than intended (15 instead of 25).Fixed an issue where the RPKM iron sights would shoot low when using the short barrel.Fixed an issue where the TR-7 Light Barrel incorrectly improved muzzle velocity.Fixed bipod mount input behaviour for Alternate, Lefty Alternate, Southpaw, and Legacy Southpaw presets so the bipod mount now follows the melee button.Improved attack speed for knife melee attacks.Improved buffering behaviour for knife and sledgehammer attacks.Improved consistency of melee damage timing against enemies and the environment.Improved consistency of recoil modifiers when using a controller across different weapons.Improved how sprint is interrupted when performing melee attacks.

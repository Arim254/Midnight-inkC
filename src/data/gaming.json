    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Marvel Rivals is rapidly approaching its one year anniversary in early December, but the in-game event has already kicked off. The Anniversary event is putting up tons of free and paid rewards for you to grab, including a free Legendary Jeff the Land Shark skin. There are also tons of free Units up for grabs, with a catch.How to get the Jeff the Land Shark Business Shark skinThe free Business Shark skin for Jeff comes in a limited-time reward event called Jeff's Break Time. As you earn match XP, you'll get coins to redeem items inside a virtual vending machine. There are free coins and paid coins, each unlocking items from different parts of the vending machine. Jeff's skin is in the free section, as are a new element to Rivals skins: customizable parts. Earning match XP will earn you coins, which can redeem items in the vending machine.Jeff's Break Time is a 20-day event, but like all event passes, if you purchase the premium version it becomes permanently available to you, allowing you to earn the rewards at your own pace. The premium version costs 990 Lattice ($10), and includes the Dad-tastic Reed Mister Fantastic and Disappearing Dessert Invisible Woman skins, as well.Free Units, with a catchUnits, the free in-game currency that can be used to buy skins in the store, are also being given away for the anniversary event... sort of. During the event, there are seven days' worth of log-in rewards, for a total of 1,500 Units. These Units are \"Time-Limited\" and expire at the end of the event, around December 18. If you don't use them before that point, they will expire and be removed from your account.You can earn 1,500 temporary units, which expire at the end of the event.This is the first time Marvel Rivals has introduced a time-limited version of one of its main currencies. It's an odd choice, but between the Van Dyne shop opening on December 3 with the Darling Daifuku Psylocke skin and more anniversary shop skins coming, you probably won't have a hard time spending those Units. The Black Friday sale in the Marvel Rivals shops also runs through December 3, offering discounts on older skins. While you can't get all the log-in rewards by then, you could spend some of those temporary Units on the sale.There's an additional 600 normal Units up for grabs via the Rivals Assemble part of the event, where you can add friends to your team with a special code, allowing both of you to complete missions and earn points for the other person. These rewards are only unlockable if you use the code to add friends. There are also some Units and an exclusive title that can be grabbed by participating in the December 6 Midnight countdown event. You can use the in-game countdown to determine when exactly that is occurring in your timezone. Marvel Rivals' anniversary event is running for the next three weeks, with more cosmetics being added over time. Marvel Rivals Season 5 recently kicked off, adding Gambit to the roster.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The 1,555-piece Imperial Star Destroyer is on sale for $120 (was $160) while supplies last. This Star Destroyer launched last August as part of the Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary collection. It comes with seven minifigures, including a 25th Anniversary minifigure of Cal Kestis from Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series.The Imperial Star Destroyer is based on the ship from the opening chase scene of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. Once fully constructed, the Star Destroyer measures 18 x 11.5 x 6 inches.It's rather fitting that Amazon added the Star Destroye to its Black Friday sale, because Star Wars fans can also get the Lego version of the ship Darth Vader and his crew were chasing: Princess Leia's Tantive IV. The 654-piece Tantive IV display model is 50% off at Amazon and Walmart. You could pair both of these ships with Lego's Boarding the Tantive IV diorama, which is on sale for $38.49 (was $55) and depicts what happens after the Star Destroyer catches the Tantive IV. It's also worth noting Lego's 630-piece midi-scale model of Darth Vader's Executor Super Star Destroyer from Return of the Jedi is on sale for $40 (was $70) at Walmart.Lego Star Wars: Best Black Friday DealsImperial Star Destroyer (1,555 pieces) -- $120 ($160)Executor Super Star Destroyer Model (630 pieces) -- $40 ($70)Battle Droid with STAP (1,088 pieces) -- $90 ($140)Tantive IV Starship Model (654 pieces) -- $40 ($80)  Also at WalmartBoarding the Tantive IV Diorama (502 pieces) -- $38.49 ($55)  Also at WalmartThe Imperial Star Destroyer has only ever received discounts during major sales events like Prime Day and now Black Friday.

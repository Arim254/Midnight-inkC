    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Chris Compendio\n   on November 12, 2025 at 1:11PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The first Super Mario Bros. animated movie pulled references from across Mario lore, and while The Super Mario Galaxy Movie wears its main inspiration in its title, the sequel will be no different. Even in the initial trailer for the upcoming movie, there were already several hints and nods to different Super Mario titles from the franchise's 40 years of history.This trailer gave us our first looks at Brie Larson's Princess Rosalina and Benny Safdie's Bowser Jr. But let's look at some of the smaller details in this first look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, which hits in theaters on April 3, 2026.Bowser paints Mario's Skeleton SuitThe first half of the trailer focuses on Bowser's surprising artistic ability, as he paints several pieces while confined to a tiny version of himself in a miniature of his castle. His latest work is an unflattering depiction of Mario as a skeleton, which bears a striking resemblance to Mario's Skeleton Suit in Super Mario Odyssey.That suit was one of the hardest outfits to obtain in Odyssey, costing 9999 coins.Bowser's other paintingsThat isn't all when it comes to Bowser's paintings--as he runs up the stairs of his mini castle, you can also spot some additional pieces, with one depicting smiling flowers from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and another with Bowser on his famous Koopa Klown Car. It looks like there's a painting of a Boo on the bottom left as well.With all of this artistic talent, we can't rule out the possibility that Bowser made all of the paintings in his castle himself for Super Mario 64. Although, all credit for the \"hot Bowser\" painting seen in the trailer should go to Illumination artist Renan Porto.The Star FestivalWhile we don't know yet what the inciting incident for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is, the trailer shows an event that resembles the Star Festival that kicks off the stories of Super Mario Galaxy and its direct sequel. The Star Festival occurs once a century, with a comet passing through the night sky and dropping Star Bits.The trailer shows several falling lights released by the comet, but it's unclear as of now if these are Star Bits.Launch StarsThe most common method of traversal in the Super Mario Galaxy games was through Launch Stars, and they make a notable appearance in the movie's trailer. While they have an ethereal glow in the movie that isn't present in the games, they appear to have the same function, launching Peach and Toad through the stars.Drip Drop GalaxyLevels in Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel were full of planetoids, and the first planetoid we see in the movie trailer is an aquatic one that resembles Drip Drop Galaxy from the first Galaxy game.The movie version features more foliage than what we saw in the game, and it appears to be populated by Bloopers instead of Cheep Cheeps, so this location might be more inspired by Drip Drop Galaxy than a direct reference.The Inverted Pyramid from Super Mario OdysseyMario and Luigi appear to be riding dirtbikes (as seen in the Mario Kart games) through a desert, and one shot of the trailer shows them driving towards a giant inverted pyramid. This greatly resembles the Inverted Pyramid in the Sand Kingdom of Super Mario Odyssey, though this one is slightly askew.Other pyramids are seen floating in the sky, so it's possible that the pyramid that Mario and Luigi are going toward had crashed down--sounds like a fun location for the characters to explore.Ninjis in a casinoPeach, in action movie fashion, fights an army of Ninjis in one scene in the trailer. Ninjis first showed up in Super Mario Bros. 2 (or Doki Doki Panic, technically), and they recently reappeared in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, most prominently in the Ninji Jump Party level.The battle appears to take place on top of a giant roulette, so this locale might have inspirations from a number of places in the Super Mario series, including Casino Delfino in Super Mario Sunshine or perhaps even Luigi's casino in the Super Mario 64 DS minigames.Bowser Jr., his magic paintbrush, and Wonder effectsBowser Jr. is making his big screen debut, and he's making use of the magic paintbrush he wreaked havoc with in the GameCube classic. One notable detail is that the paintbrush lacks Professor E. Gadd's logo, meaning that the paintbrush might have a different origin in the movie universe.And instead of taking the form of Shadow Mario like he did in Sunshine, Bowser Jr. instead resembles how he did in Super Mario Bros. Wonder when under the effects of a Wonder Flower, sporting a darker color scheme.MegalegThe Megaleg boss from the first Mario Galaxy game shows up at the end of the trailer, attempting to capture Princess Rosalina before she goes all Super Smash Bros. on it, demolishing the giant mech with ease. Megaleg was one of the first major bosses in the first Galaxy game, and he's relatively easy to dispatch.The main difference in the movie is that Megaleg is a voiced character, or perhaps another character is piloting Megaleg, though it's unknown exactly who the voice performer behind this imposing enemy is.Gusty Garden Galaxy musicAfter Rosalina destroys Megaleg using her magical powers, the trailer ends with part of the Gusty Garden Galaxy theme, one of the most iconic music tracks in the first Galaxy game.Composer Brian Tyler is returning to score The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, so we should expect the soundtrack to contain several leitmotifs and musical references to the two Super Mario Galaxy games, and likely from the larger Mario franchise.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                As part of Valve's big hardware announcements today, the company did not disclose a price for the new Steam Machine device. Hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat was asked in an interview about what Valve's position is, at a high level, regarding pricing, and Aldehayyat said the aim is to land at a \"competitive price\" that matches up with the value provided. This is what most companies say about their new products, and Valve is following suit. The aim, he said, is to make it \"affordable.\"\"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it,\" he told IGN.Aldehayyat said affordability is a key concern for many today, maybe more than ever, as inflation ticks up and concerns remain ongoing due to the impact of tariffs.\"The affordability piece you mentioned is one of the reasons why we think a Steam Machine makes a lot of sense right now. So it's just something that we thought about every time we made a hardware decision, a feature decision, is to make sure that we keep it as approachable, as affordable as possible,\" Aldehayyat added.          That's a lot of nebulous talk, but it's as much as Valve was willing to say at this juncture. The system is set to be released in Spring 2026, with preorders presumably opening beforehand.Valve also did not disclose the prices for the new Steam Controller and Steam Frame virtual reality headset. You can read more about the new Valve devices in GameSpot's extended coverage. Beyond the new hardware, Valve is working on a MOBA game called Deadlock. The secretive game has been available for testing, but still has no release date or full details.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's not an easy life for Sanctuary's citizens in Diablo 4, but players can make things a little brighter in the upcoming holiday event Goblin Greedings. Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar.To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can.Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree.Additionally, a handful of free holiday items will appear at the in-game store on specific dates:December 18: Tackle of the First Snows (Mount Trophy)December 19: Fallow-ward (Mount Trophy)December 20: Crook of First Snow (Mount Armor)As with the rest of treasures, those items will disappear after January 6.Outside of the game, the prequel to next year's Lord of Hatred expansion, Diablo 4: The Lost Horadrim, is available for preorder now. Preordering the expansion itself grants players early access to Paladins, one of the latest classes added to the game. The expansion is also bringing back the fan-favorite villain, Lilith.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The success of Baldur's Gate 3 went far beyond anyone's expectations with 20 million copies sold and multiple Game of the Year awards. That was all very good for the future of Larian, but it's also creating some pressure now that the developer focuses on its latest Divinity game.\"It's more pressure,\" Larian founder Swen Vincke told PC Gamer. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing.\"Vincke also indicated that the team at Larian believed that making Divinity would be easier after the studio's experience with Baldur's Gate 3. But that turned out to not be the case.\"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this,'\" added Vincke. \"By now, we've been humbled by the development experience, by the actual development again: No, we don't know anything. We have to relearn everything, but we do have the experience of the past with us. Every game has its own language that you need to learn.\"Vincke recently came under fire for saying that Larian uses some generative AI in game development. He subsequently said that AI is not being used to replace human artists, and that generative AI is used to \"explore things\" and that it allows artists to \"experiment\" and \"make their lives easier.\" He added that there will be no generative-AI-created content in Divinity.According to Vincke, Divinity will probably get an early-access release like Baldur's Gate 3 did. But he didn't fully commit to that and the game doesn't currently have a release date.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fanatical is closing 2025 out with a new build-your-own bundle deal, the Best of Platinum Collection. This deal offers a selection of various acclaimed PC games featured in the various Platinum Collection bundles throughout 2025, giving you a chance to pick up some excellent games for cheap. Like Fanatical's other build your own bundle promotions, you can pick as many games from the list as you'd like, and the more games you buy, the more you save. To start, you can pick up to four games for $3.33 each. At five or more games, you'll pay $3 per item. Grab 10 or more games, and you'll pay just $2.90 per game, and if you want the full 22-game bundle, it'll run you $63.78, a $547.75 value--not too shabby for literally thousands of hours of entertainment.One of the items you can pick, the SteamWorld Classic Bundle, comes with four games: SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech. So, really, if you decide to add this to the Best of Platinum Collection, it could be a total of 25 games. The list of possible games also includes the strategy game SteamWorld Build as another pick, in case you want to load up on even more of the series.With season 2 of the Fallout TV show looming, now's the perfect time to explore the open-world RPGs that inspired the show with Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition and Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition. Both are available as part of the Best of Platinum Collection. These versions include the full base games plus every update, add-on, and DLC expansion. You can round out the selection with Fallout 76, which is an online multiplayer take on the series--though it still offers the same open-ended, first-person exploration and RPG gameplay as the other games. It also recently received a new Burning Springs DLC update that ties into the Amazon Prime Video streaming series.For you horror fans, one of the biggest highlights of the Platinum Collection is the inclusion of Amnesia: The Bunker. The Amnesia games are some of the most tense, atmospheric, and terrifying survival horror games to be found in the genre, and getting it at this price is a steal.Plenty of other games are available in Fanatical's Platinum Collection, including the narrative-driven RPG Disco Elysium: The Final Cut, the hidden FPS gem RoboCop: Rogue City, the Lego-themed puzzle game Lego Bricktales, and more. Check out the full list below.Fanatical Best of Platinum Collection: Build Your Own Bundle (2025)Amnesia: The BunkerBotany ManorDisco Elysium: The Final CutDoom (2016)Dungeon TycoonDysmantleEdge of SanityEndless AliceFallout 3: Game of the Year EditionFallout 76Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate EditionGestalt: Steam & CinderThe Isletide HotelLEGO Brick TalesMini SettlersNeon GartenThe Pale BeyondParadise KillerReveilRoboCop: Rogue CitySteamWorld BuildSteamWorld Classic BundleIf none of these games are quite your bag or you're after something different, there are plenty of other bundle deals through Fanatical.

There's the RPG Mystery Bundle, where you can get one mystery game key for just $1.49, two game keys for $2.79, or three game keys for $3.69. It's a gamble, but knowing Fanatical, these titles will be well worth these prices.Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:                                Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Cabinets Get First Discounts At Amazon                         Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33                         Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (5)                 Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals                         Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price                         Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time                         Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon                         Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The year isn't over yet, but so far we've had sleeper hits like Blue Prince and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 alongside fun blockbuster titles like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Doom: The Dark AgesOn top of that, the Switch launched earlier this year and several of its exclusives have been some of the best games of the year. Mario Kart World is pure pedal-to-the-metal racing action, Donkey Kong Bananza is an exciting adventure for the ape wonder of the world, and we're still looking forward to more first-party releases throughout the year.You can also count on indie games to surprise and delight, as some of the best and weirdest games are often found in this category. Like last year, we'll be keeping track of the best of the best throughout 2025, so you can revisit this page to see which games have made the cut.As a reminder, a game has to earn a high review score of at least 8 to make it onto this list. That doesn't mean that games scoring below this threshold aren't worth looking at, as these titles can still be pretty great if you can overlook some of their flaws.Hades 2 -- 10After emerging from its early access chrysalis, Hades 2 has achieved its ultimate form as one of the best roguelites of all time. That's no small feat, considering just how good the first Hades was, but the sequel meets the 10/10 energy of the original game with an impressive amount of craftsmanship and fine-tuning.

The game is also a looker with its inspired art direction, and the constant sense of reward with each run makes it hard to put down.Read our Absolum review.

While there are familiar elements here, developer Sandfall Interactive also puts a novel spin on these ideas by re-imagining the traditional turn-based structure and blending it with action to create an engaging experience. Throw in gorgeous graphics, an elegant art direction, and an emotional story anchored by a cast of captivating characters, and Sandfall's debut game is an instant classic.Read our Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review.

A game that'll appeal to people who care deeply for animals and nature, Herdling is a beautiful trek across scenic vistas and it tells a grand story without ever needing to speak a single word.

Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Mario Kart World -- 9A colorful racing game that builds on the foundation of Mario Kart 8, Mario Kart World is both a joy to play and constantly rewarding. It's the first big exclusive of the Switch 2 era, and one of the best games in the long history of this beloved franchise.Read our Mario Kart World review. Available on Switch 2.WalmartTargetBest BuyMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater -- 9Remaking a beloved classic is no easy feat, and the task becomes even more daunting when that game is considered to be the very best entry in the legendary Metal Gear Solid series. To its credit, Konami has successfully modernized Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, bringing it to life with vivid graphics, an overhauled control scheme on par with contemporary games, and a wealth of extra content. These upgrades and tweaks enhance Snake's dangerous mission for a new generation while still feeling familiar to veterans of the series, and its unchanged Cold War-era story remains as timeless as ever.Read our Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Shinobi: Art of Vengeance -- 9After years of hiding in the shadows, Sega's Shinobi series has made a big comeback with a game that both honors its legacy and evolves it for a new audience. With Streets of Rage 4 developer Lizardcube at the helm, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is a fast-paced action game full of delicious combos to dial in and shurikens to hurl at unsuspecting foes. Old-school at its core, this new Shinobi adventure does the franchise proud with its slick gameplay and reverence for the past. It's good to see Joe Musashi back in action.Read our Shinobi: Art of Vengeance review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.Silent Hill F -- 9For decades, most Silent Hill games have been living in the shadow of Silent Hill 2, which has long been considered to be the best game in the psychological-horror series. Silent Hill F doesn't just rise to the occasion; it sets a new benchmark that future games in the franchise will be hard-pressed to reach, let alone surpass. An exceptionally crafted exploration of horror and mature themes backed up by polished gameplay and superb storytelling, Silent Hill F is a masterclass in terror.Read our Silent Hill F review. Available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.The Alters -- 8An engrossing combination of base-building, survival, and self-reflection, The Alters is a captivating experience. Managing a workforce comprised of your alternate selves while you race to avoid being fried by a looming sunrise on a barren alien planet is consistently engaging, but it's moral dilemmas and interactions with your human resources that'll stick with you after you roll credits on this sci-fi gem.Read our The Alters review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Assassin's Creed Shadows -- 8A beautiful tour of feudal Japan, Assassin's Creed Shadows is an exciting adventure full of moments that'll keep you on the edge of your seat. Admittedly, that's if you decide to focus on Naoe for your playthrough, as co-protagonist Yasuke feels out of place in this action-RPG when compared to his shinobi counterpart. Naoe's gameplay elevates the traditional stealth experience, and while there are narrative shortcomings, Assassin's Creed Shadows is still a worthwhile entry in the series.Read our Assassin's Creed Shadows review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Battlefield 6 -- 8There's a distinct feel to the best Battlefield games that's hard to encapsulate in words, but Battlefield 6 definitely has it. A return to form for the series, Battlefield 6 plays it safe but still manages to deliver large-scale warfare that's delightfully chaotic alongside rock-solid gunplay. Sure, the single-player campaign is completely forgettable, but multiplayer is where it's at. DICE has delivered an experience that feels polished and exciting, making Battlefield's return to active duty feel worth the wait.Read our Battlefield 6 review-in-progress. Available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Capcom Fighting Collection 2 -- 8Capcom continues to raise the bar for game preservation with its compilations, and while some entries in Capcom Fighting Collection 2 haven't aged too well, this is still a rock-solid package to check out. Titles like Capcom Fighting Evolution and Power Stone are weak in comparison to gems like Plasma Sword and Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, but this is still a treasure trove of classic games to check out.Read our Capcom Fighting Collection 2 review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.Cronos: The New Dawn -- 8Bloober Team delivered an impressive remake of Silent Hill 2 last year, but with Cronos: The New Dawn, the studio proves that it's just as adept at crafting original tales of suspense. Best described as Dead Space meets a cult-classic '80s time-travel dystopian movie, Cronos will keep you on your toes with its sci-fi horror and enemies that'll test your fight-or-flight responses. It has a dangerous world that you'll want to explore in its entirety, as well as one of this year's best video game soundtracks with its catchy synth beats.Read our Cronos: The New Dawn review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Dead Take -- 8Surreal and intellectually stimulating, Dead Take is a fascinating dive into the mind of an actor. It's anchored by a cast of incredible performers and meaty gameplay with rewarding puzzle mechanics, making for a short harrowing experience that's hard to put down once it sinks its hooks into you.Read our Dead Take review. Available on PC.Digimon: Time Stranger -- 8Digimon Story: Time Stranger is the best attempt yet to break free from those unfavorable--and undeserved--comparisons to Pokemon, as the game goes all in on its themes of digital monsters while keeping its core gameplay loop of team-building and turn-based combat exciting. Fast-paced and consistently engaging, Digimon finds its groove as a rock-solid counterpart to those other pocket monsters with its anime-influenced style and exploration of surprisingly mature themes through its storyline.Read our Digimon: Time Stranger review. Available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Doom: The Dark Ages -- 8With its medieval-inspired direction, Doom: The Dark Ages is thrilling to play thanks to its harmonious fusion of solid gunplay and heavy metal close-quarters combat. The appeal of ripping and tearing through armies of demons feels better than ever, as the game finds a satisfying balance between fast-paced action and satisfyingly brutal new gameplay mechanics.Read our Doom: The Dark Ages review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Dying Light: The Beast -- 8Dying Light: The Beast puts a fresh spin on the established gameplay mechanics of the original games. While the core concept of adventuring during the day and keeping a low profile at night create two distinct ways to play the game, it's the brutally satisfying combat, nerve-wracking survival-horror, and cheesy B-movie vibes that make it an exciting addition to the Dying Light franchise.Read our Dying Light: The Beast review. Available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.EA Sports College Football 26 -- 8After more than a decade away, EA's collegiate football series made a triumphant return last year, and this year's entry in the franchise builds on that momentum. While EA Sports College Football 26 is an iterative sequel, there's still plenty here to enjoy from renewed emphasis on rivalries between colleges to exciting modes that offer a thrilling alternative to other football games on the market.Read our EA Sports College Football 26 review. Available for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered -- 8It might have been one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming, but the grand remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion still manages to surprise thanks to the sheer depth of the work done to freshen it up for a new generation of gamers. While some of the gameplay is admittedly still rough, the charm here lies in the incredible visual overhaul alongside numerous quality-of-life changes done by developer Virtuos and Bethesda.Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Read our The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered review.Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves -- 8Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves is a colorful fighting game that offers a polished fighting system inspired by its past and some forward-thinking with the balanced REV System. Energetic and loaded with a roster that encourages experimentation, Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves is only slightly hamstrung by its sparse selection of gameplay modes.Available on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. Read our Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves review.FBC: Firebreak -- 8Remedy Entertainment is known for its single-player games, but FBC: Firebreak sees the studio venture into live-service territory in this Control spin-off. While its opening hours are admittedly a bit of a slog to get through, FBC: Firebreak does start to open up once all the pieces fall into place. Making class-based builds feels rewarding, the gunplay is rock-solid, and the intentional push to reject the trappings of live-service FOMO makes for a fun time with friends.Read our FBC: Firebreak review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.The First Berserker: Khazan -- 8The First Berserker: Khazan wears its souls-like inspiration on its sleeve, but at the same time, it puts its own spin on the genre with a few clever ideas. A killer combo of parry-heavy combat straight from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, visuals that pack a punch, and hard-hitting action will keep you on the edge of your seat in this thrilling adventure.Read our The First Berserker: Khazan review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Lies of P: Overture -- 8Featuring a compelling story at its core, Overture is more of the same in the best way possible. You've got an expanded arsenal to experiment with, more enemies to test your skills, and imaginatively designed locations to explore in this meaty expansion.Read our Lies of P: Overture review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.Luto -- 8It's downright criminal that we never got to see Hideo Kojima's take on Silent Hill--PT--but the next best thing might just be Luto. An unpredictable ghost story, Luto is undeniably inspired by PT but it rises above that comparison by being a well-crafted experience that can shock and amaze you in equal measure.Read our Luto review. Available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Madden NFL 26 -- 8With annual franchises like Madden, there's no getting around the fact that each game provides iterative upgrades at best. In Madden NFL 26, those new gameplay features are being added to an already solid foundation of sporting action, and they're surprisingly bigger than you'd imagine them to be. Pairing the series' great on-field gameplay with a complete overhaul of Franchise mode has resulted in the best NFL sports-RPG fantasy in years.Read our Madden NFL 26 review. Available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.MLB The Show 25 -- 8Like other sports games, MLB The Show 25 is another fine example of incremental improvements leading to impactful changes. Tweaks have helped to further polish its captivating gameplay, resulting in a game that feels more dynamic than ever with every swing of the bat. Throw in a reworked progression system and improvements to several gameplay modes, and MLB The Show 25 is another great day out for baseball fans.Read our MLB The Show 25 review. Available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.Monster Hunter Wilds -- 8Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise did a great job in building a rock-solid foundation for the series, and with Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom's series feels more welcoming than ever to newcomers. Thanks to several clever gameplay tweaks, polished gameplay, and new systems that emphasize flexibility, Monster Hunter Wilds offers a fun time for all on its new frontier.Read our Monster Hunter Wilds review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.NBA 2K26 -- 8The NBA 2K series is in a league of its own when it comes to basketball, and once again, it raises the bar for just how authentic a sports-simulator video game can be. While the deeply embedded pay-to-win shenanigans can sour the experience, at its core, NBA 2K26 is still a dynamic game full of welcome tweaks to its gameplay and graphics that take another step forward toward photo-realism.Read our NBA 2K26 review. Available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox, Switch 2, and Switch.Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound -- 82025 is turning out to be the year of Ninja Gaiden, as this gem of a retro-inspired game is comfortably sandwiched between a well-crafted remaster and an upcoming sequel from the series. Blasphemous developer The Game Kitchen recaptures the magic of the classic Ninja Gaiden games, using them as inspiration to create a relentlessly challenging action-platformer that feels like it was ripped straight out of the SNES era.Read our Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound review. Available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.Old Skies -- 8A touching tale of love and loss wrapped up in an engrossing mystery, Old Skies is an enchanting point-and-click adventure game in which you play as professional time traveler Fia Quinn. Throw in themes of fatalism and superb voice acting as you journey through various eras of New York City, and you've got a terrific story to explore here.Read our Old Skies review. Available on PC and Switch.Revenge of the Savage Planet -- 8While its combat could feel more impactful, Revenge of the Savage Planet is still a fun game and a sharp satire of corporate greed. It never takes itself too seriously, and whether you're on your lonesome or teaming up with a friend in co-op, exploring its diverse planets makes for an engaging mix of platforming and puzzle-solving.Read our Revenge of the Savage Planet review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. Sid Meier's Civilization VII -- 8Civilization VII doesn't reinvent its 4X turn-based wheel, but it does make some significant changes to its design. How these changes will shape up in the grand scheme of things remains to be seen--as some of them could very contentious with longtime players--but at its core, the Firaxis-developed strategy game is still as compelling as ever. Whether you're shaping civilization through diplomacy or warfare, Civilization VII has a strong foundation to build upon in the years to come.Read our Civilization VII review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.The Sims 4: Enchanted By Nature -- 9At this point in the life-cycle of The Sims 4, there's a mountain of DLC out there for the life-simulator. Enchanted By Nature solidifies its position as one of the best paid DLC releases for the game, as it goes all in on the idea of living your best fantasy life with its vibrant locales and enchanting fairy gameplay.Read our The Sims 4: Enchanted By Nature review. Available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.Skin Deep -- 8Skin Deep is a fine example of taking a genre known for being traditionally dark and injecting some absurdity into it. The oddball immersive sim is delightfully silly, but it's also a puzzle box that requires you to think on your feet, come up with clever solutions, and experiment with every tool in the environment to triumph against overwhelming odds.Available on PC. Read our Skin Deep review.South of Midnight -- 8South of Midnight plays it safe with its gameplay, but it more than makes up for it with a fantastic story, a setting that feels authentic, and imaginative visuals. An exploration of the American Deep South, South of Midnight is mechanically sound in its construction and stunning in its storytelling.Read our South of Midnight review. Available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 Review -- 8Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 perfected the gameplay of the series, and decades later, they're getting a chance to shine once again in a package that enhances them for a new generation. Admittedly, some baffling decisions have been made with regards to the game's Career mode, but beyond that, virtual skateboarding just doesn't get any better than this.Read our Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 Review. Available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch 2.Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter -- 8With multiple games in the Trails series, it can be daunting to find an entry-point into this franchise. Fortunately, Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter solves this problem by remaking the debut game in Falcom's epic industrial-fantasy saga. With the original story intact--but thankfully with the fat trimmed off--a well-balanced gameplay system, and a cast of lovable characters at its core, this is a faithful remake that'll appeal to series veterans and newcomers alike.Read our Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter review. Available for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Switch.Sunderfolk -- 8Like the best board game experiences, Sunderfolk is a blast when you have a few friends along for the ride. Inspired by tabletop games, this turn-based tactical RPG is a fun example of how teamwork and strategy can come together to create a grand adventure.Read our Sunderfolk review. Available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.Virtua Fighter 5 REVO -- 8Virtua Fighter 5 has been knocking around for a few years now, but this new edition of the classic fighting game updates it for modern audiences. More than just a high-definition visual refresh, Virtua Fighter 5 REVO features fine-tuned gameplay, a balanced roster of colorful brawlers, and player-requested rollback netcode for satisfying online matches.Read our Virtua Fighter 5 REVO review. Available on PC, PS5, and PS4. Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.Wuchang: Fallen Feathers -- 8It's very easy to see the souls-like DNA in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and while it can play like a derivative compilation of From Software's greatest hits, it also hits that mark with exceptionally well-crafted gameplay that'll appeal to fans of the genre. There are admittedly some balancing and performing issues to work out, but if you're looking for a souls-like with meaty combat, beautifully designed levels, and a gorgeous art direction, this is highly recommended.Read our Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review. Available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.WWE 2K25 -- 8This year's entry in the sports entertainment video game franchise sticks to that script, delivering an engaging Showcase Mode, a gigantic roster of superstars, and gameplay tweaks that make WWE 2K25 feel like a main-event superstar. The game also introduces The Island, a PvPvE social space heavily inspired by NBA 2K's The City, but you'll want to avoid it in case you aren't a fan of egregious microtransactions.Read our WWE 2K25 review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.Every other GameSpot review in 2025    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nThe new portable gaming PC on the block packs a punch, but it swings awkwardlyBy \n    Tamoor Hussain\n   on October 15, 2025 at 12:26PM PDT\n              \n                As someone who has spent the vast majority of my life playing handhelds with limited capabilities, being able to pull something out of my bag that can run Dark Souls 3, Cyberpunk 2077, or Skyrim without compromising what the game is and how it looks still feels magical. For me, handheld gaming PCs still aren't commonplace enough to feel ordinary, so I don't take for granted that I have, as the great Doctor Otto Octavius once said, \"the power of the sun in the palm of my hands,\" and by \"sun\" I mean my Steam, Xbox, and GOG game libraries.Having said that, there are now enough of these devices that they're starting to step on each other's toes. The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are the latest entries into the handheld gaming PC world and, as far as toe-stepping goes, they've got steel-toed boots, and they are stomping.          Click To Unmute         ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X: Everything To Know         Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?       Sign up or Sign in now!              Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.            This video has an invalid file format.     00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!As the name indicates, the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X are new versions of those same Asus devices that have been available for a few years now, except they align themselves with the Xbox brand. The thing is, there's not much new about them, they are effectively the same hardware with Xbox branding, and what little is new is executed to various degrees of success.I've been using the Xbox Ally X and, don't get me wrong, it is a powerful device that has allowed me to sit in bed and play both older and brand-new games as if they were running on a console or reasonably powerful PC. I've enjoyed making my way through Dark Souls 3 for the umpteenth time and also dipping into newer upcoming Xbox titles that run smoothly on it. That, like I said, is kind of amazing. But I've also been doing a lot of that on the original Ally from 2023, and 2024's Ally X, for that matter.And because of that, the Xbox Ally X has turned out to be the most ordinary and unsurprising experience I've had with one of these devices. I realize that I'm in a very privileged position in that I have access to a bunch of these portable gaming PCs and, in many ways, that means this isn't for me. Instead, it's for people who may not have made the jump into handheld gaming PCs and want to do so. But even then, I'm not sure I'd recommend the Xbox Ally or Ally X as a starting point.Before we get into why, let me just be clear about what this is and what is unique about it. So, as mentioned, this is essentially the same ROG Ally X that Asus launched last year. The main difference in the internals is the processor: The Asus Ally X has an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme, while the Xbox Ally X has an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme. What that means for you is a small boost in power that, for the most part, isn't significant enough to be a big deal.Otherwise, it has the same storage capacity by default, battery, and 120hz 1080p IPS panel screen. The experience you have playing the same game on both devices is going to be nearly identical for most people.The differences between them are more in the form factor and the software they run. For the former, the Xbox Ally X is much more comfortable to hold than the originals, as they are shaped to feel more like controllers we're all used to using for extended periods of time, as opposed to being more rigid and angular like the original versions. The Ally X also has more of a premium look and feel thanks to the pattern on the face of the device. It takes some inspiration from the PS5 and has ROG and Xbox written in a minute font all over it so it almost looks like a textured style. It's a small but nice touch. Most significantly, however, the Xbox Ally X uses the same Impulse Triggers as the Xbox Series X and S controllers. That means you'll get much better haptics and feedback that not only feels better, but also can be catered to the on-screen action, so that it behaves differently depending on the gun you're pulling the trigger for in an FPS or the type of car you're driving in a racing game. This is something that I've definitely appreciated having.The knock-on effect of this, however, is that the Xbox Ally X is a little heavier and bulkier (678 grams versus 715 grams). This a \"your mileage may vary\" situation that depends on how quickly you get hand fatigue holding something reasonably hefty for extended periods of time. The latter has been more of an issue for me, since it makes the device a little less portable than the original Ally X. The controller-style grip means that pretty much all my existing cases don't work for it, and all of the new options are bulky.If you're an absolute freak and just want to chuck it into your bag to rawdog it, the shape of the device makes it extremely awkward. I carried it using a crossbody sling and never felt comfortable. When travelling, I usually keep my gaming device in my personal item bag. The Asus versions pretty easily slip in, case or no case, and I can still fit things in around it. But with this, it all becomes a bit unwieldy, so I'd be less inclined to take this one out and about in the same way.The other major change comes in the form of software. The Xbox Ally devices run a version of Windows that enables it to be a little more lightweight. More importantly, it also includes a new dedicated Xbox full-screen experience that it boots into and optimizes Windows for gaming. The Game Bar, which PC players will be familiar with, is also integrated into the OS and accessed via a new dedicated Xbox button. Hitting it will give you quick access to a launcher that can open Steam, Battle.net, Epic Game Store, Ubisoft Connect, and other third-party applications, all of which integrate to give you an aggregated library.This all sounds great… on paper. In practice, it often feels like a very basic wrapper that makes using the device feel like a convoluted mess. This is partly because of the way the Xbox Ally natively functions and partly because the Xbox layer, Steam, and Asus' Armory Crate software are constantly running into one another, meaning it doesn't behave in a predictable way.My biggest gripe with the original ROG devices was that it boots into Windows--I can't quite explain why but booting up a gaming device and then being met with a desktop PC style Windows login screen is really off-putting--and then the Armory Crate is a confusing, very unintuitive user experience on top. Together, they create a gaming experience that frequently reminds you that you are playing on a device that is a PC crammed into a tiny form factor and is running a bunch of software that has been beaten into a shape that kind of works.On more than a few occasions, I would hit the Xbox button and not be sure what was going to happen. Sometimes the Game Bar would pop up. Other times it would pop up and then a Steam window would appear on top, fighting for attention. Occasionally I'd press the button and nothing would happen. Or I'd hit it repeatedly to make the window I want come up... eventually. More frequently, the Game Bar would open but none of the buttons would work, so I had to either use the touch screen or keep hitting the Xbox button until the Game Bar decided it is friends with the buttons again.All this together makes me feel like I'm not playing on a piece of hardware designed and engineered to play video games, despite the fact that it is very capable of doing exactly this and, when it does, it is impressive. And when I'm in a game, whether that's a Steam game or something I've grabbed off Game Pass and used the cloud save functionality to pick it up away from my console, it's great. That is until I have to deal with the operating system: I can't count the number of times I've had to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the Windows taskbar to force a game to the front or to close a game because it's no longer responding or a game has launched, then the Xbox interface has popped up over it for no discernible reason.It is undoubtedly frustrating, but easy enough to deal with once you realize that the vast majority of issues you encounter are likely due to pieces of software fighting one another, at which point it's easy to just go through and start closing things. But I shouldn't have to keep doing that; it is not the kind of experience I want to have and, for those who feel the same, there is a better alternative. I try to avoid criticizing things for what they aren't instead of analyzing what they are, but in this case it's difficult to steer the conversion around the Steam Deck to avoid it.The Steam Deck and the Steam Deck OLED are both less powerful than Xbox's Ally devices--at times it's evident since some games run considerably better on the Ally even without diving into frame rates. However, the experience of turning the device on and playing a game is so much better that, for most people, I would recommend them as an alternative. They boot directly into SteamOS, instead of a Windows login screen, which irks me every time I see it. SteamOS is far more capable and better suited to the handheld format. It runs smoothly and, if you want to, you can install other launchers or import titles from other platforms into your Steam library. Admittedly, some games do require dual-booting Windows, but those interested in playing those games will likely be savvy enough to make that happen easily.Valve's offering, from a software perspective, has a Nintendo-like ease to its user experience. It's intuitive, clean, and works exactly how you want and expect for the vast majority of the time. For me, I'm willing to sacrifice some horsepower to have that, instead of having to troubleshoot a tiny Windows PC every other time I turn it on.The price factor also comes into play in a major way. The Xbox Ally X is around $1000, which makes it a hard recommendation for the average person who wants to play PC games trouble-free. If you're a little more tech savvy and ok with having to fiddle with settings to dial in the experience on an OS and game level, the Ally X earns its keep through its power alone. Outside of a gaming laptop, it's among the most capable at running video games from a technical standpoint on a device you can shove in a bag and easily whip out at a moment's notice. And in that regard, it still has that spark of magic.But that use case also applies to existing ROG Ally and Steam Deck devices, which can save you hundreds of dollars. If you spring for the Steam Deck OLED, games look fantastic even without the extra power. And when it comes to the software, Microsoft says, it will be available to all ROG devices in the future.Where the Steam Deck feels like it can be a dedicated, primary, and only gaming platform that you'll have a seamless and slick experience akin to a console, the Xbox Ally very much feels like it functions best as an extension of PC ecosystems, whether that's Steam, Xbox, or any other. And that, to be fair, is a big part of what Xbox wants it to be--there's a whole marketing campaign attesting to this. But in this case, the Rog Xbox Ally X is a case of \"this can be an Xbox\" as opposed to \"this is an Xbox.\" There are definitely people out there for whom the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X make sense, but handhelds have quite a few bars to clear for most.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    \nBattlefield 6 plays it safe but marks a return to form for the long-running series, delivering chaotic, large-scale multiplayer that's as familiar as it is uproariously funBy \n    Richard Wakeling\n   on October 15, 2025 at 11:43AM PDT\n              \n              At its best, Battlefield 6 is everything you could ask for from a Battlefield game. Intense, close-quarters firefights transition into long-range skirmishes as control points change hands and the action moves from the tight confines of half-destroyed buildings to open stretches of land. As fighter jets and helicopters swoop overhead, a medic pulls out a defibrillator and rushes into a hail of bullets to revive a squadmate who was just blown up trying to destroy a tank with a handful of C4.Elsewhere, a sniper taking residence in a high-rise building is snuffed out by a well-placed RPG, blowing a hole in their nest until the entire building eventually collapses in on itself, while just a few yards away, the burnt husk of a helicopter drops out of the sky as its previous occupants parachute to the ground amidst a salvo of gunfire. Battlefield 6 is a return to form for a multiplayer shooter that thrives on emergent chaos.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Battlefield 6 - Good Company (Review-In-Progress)\n      \nFor myriad reasons, Battlefield 2042 didn't evoke these moments often enough, leading Battlefield Studios--the collective name for developers DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect--to look to the past for the series' future. It's well-documented that Battlefield 3 and 4 were key inspirations in designing the series' latest iteration, and that's certainly reflected in how it plays. It's a safe approach, which isn't surprising given the negative reception to Battlefield 2042, especially when so many fans have been clamoring for a direct sequel to the series' fourth mainline entry. As a result, there's very little about Battlefield 6 that feels particularly fresh or new, but there's also no denying that it's quintessentially Battlefield. There's still nothing else quite like its multipronged chaos, so a return to form is more than enough to get pulses racing, even if it doesn't necessarily push the series forward.Of course, the same sentiment doesn't apply when referring to the game's single-player campaign. For the most part, Battlefield's past campaigns have been middling at best. There are standout moments--like Battlefield 3's jet-fighter sequence and a mission focusing on the Senegalese Tirailleurs in Battlefield 5--but they're mostly forgettable. One of the few exceptions is 2008's Battlefield: Bad Company, partly because it successfully satirized the \"Oorah\" military shooters of the time.Battlefield 6, by comparison, is one of those shooters to a tee. Full of military terminology and the kind of self-serious dialogue that reads like it was written just to be quotable, it's an explosive, globe-trotting blockbuster that runs the gamut of expected tropes in both its narrative and mission design.Set in 2027, the story unfolds in a near-future where the NATO alliance is on the verge of collapse. With geopolitical turmoil at the heart of the matter, several major European countries have chosen to defect from the alliance, allowing a private military corporation called Pax Armata to step into the resulting power vacuum. Pax Armata is armed with deep pockets and the latest technology, prompting countries to turn to the corporation for protection, kicking off a war against what remains of NATO's forces. Amidst this globe-spanning conflict, you play as various members of Dagger 13, an elite squad of US Marine raiders fighting back against the formidable PMC.It's a potentially interesting setup, but despite the politically loaded nature of the entire premise, Battlefield 6 follows the trend of recent military shooters by being as intentionally vague as possible. Pax Armata are a nondescript enemy, filling the role of amorphous cannon fodder in the campaign while providing the game's multiplayer with a \"bad guy\" faction. There's no intent to reflect the real world or answer questions like why France is one of the countries withdrawing from NATO. It's all shallow set dressing that negatively contributes to a run-of-the-mill story revolving around a villain you need to stop before they do something bad. The ending teases that there might be slightly more to it, but it feels like this is being saved for a sequel or narrative backdrop for a future multiplayer season, so all you're left with is another bland and forgettable story in a series known for them.The missions themselves don't fare much better either. Call of Duty is the obvious comparison point, but while that series has experimented with open-ended missions and social stealth, Battlefield 6 is firmly entrenched in the same linear design of its predecessors. This isn't an inherently bad thing, but the execution is dated and uninspired, and there isn't a single mission that's not overwhelmingly dull. From a night vision-equipped stealth section that's the closest thing to being on rails without putting you on an actual track, to a standard sniper mission, obligatory tank section, and more than a few instances where you're firing from a turret, there's nothing here you haven't played already, and better, in other shooters.Gunplay is solid, impactful, and satisfying, but the enemy AI either hunkers down behind cover or charges straight at you, so the moment-to-moment action lacks any sort of dynamism. Even the game's vaunted destruction is predominantly used just to eliminate snipers and enemy turrets.Fortunately, Battlefield 6's multiplayer is \"Classic Battlefield\" in a more positive sense. The controversial hero-shooter-style Specialists from 2042 are gone, reverting back to a familiar class system featuring four well-defined tentpoles. The Assault is a frontline fighter, breaching through walls with a grenade launcher and shrugging off explosions and flash grenades with a quick jab from an adrenaline injector. The Engineer is vital during vehicular combat, using a blowtorch to repair friendly tanks while launching attacks against enemy armor with various launchers and landmines. The Support is the squad's medic, able to quickly revive downed soldiers and replenish everyone's ammunition with bags of extra ammo. Finally, the Recon excels as a sniper, marking enemy units by peering down a long-range scope before landing a few headshots of their own.You know what you're getting with these classes, but the signature traits and specialist gadgets tied to each one also help them sing. The Support class, for instance, can lay down deployable cover, giving you something to hide behind when reviving teammates or a surface to mount your LMG on. Meanwhile, the Assault class can capture objectives faster than others and is also supplemented by gadgets--such as a ladder and breaching projectile launcher--that give you more ways to approach defended areas. There's an enjoyable synergy behind each class and the various loadout combinations you can create, and there's a definite sense that your individual contributions are helping the team and impacting the result of matches, even if you aren't necessarily racking up a bunch of kills.Each class also has a signature weapon type associated with it, providing you with various bonuses for, say, equipping a sniper rifle while playing as a Recon. Whether it's reduced weapon sway or improved hip-fire accuracy, these buffs are palpable, incentivizing you to use certain weapon types when playing as particular classes.In a minor shake-up to the traditional class structure, however, any class can use any weapon, unless you're in a \"closed weapon\" playlist. This proves useful for completing challenges to rack up experience points from using different weapons, since you can change weapon types without having to switch to an entirely different class, but other than giving you more freedom, there aren't any other obvious benefits. I appreciate being able to use an assault rifle instead of an SMG when playing as an Engineer, but having the ability to use any weapon with any class does somewhat dilute the class system.As a result, signature weapon types feel like a minor addition to an otherwise familiar package, and the same is true of the game's new movement system. Dubbed the \"Kinesthetic Combat System,\" this buzzword vomit essentially means you now have more control over your mobility and a few new tactical options when opening fire.Aside from being able to mount your weapon and lean around corners, the most interesting impact of this reworked system is on your movement. Being able to sprint while crouching is especially useful on Battlefield's large-scale maps, and grabbing a wounded buddy and dragging them to safety through a barrage of enemy gunfire makes for some hilariously cinematic moments. It's nothing groundbreaking, but for a game that's aping past glories, small wrinkles like this move the needle towards establishing an identity.In terms of game modes, Battlefield 6 features the usual suspects with classic, large-scale objective-based modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush. Escalation is the lone newcomer, functioning like an amalgamation of Conquest and Breakthrough, with two teams fighting over territory that gradually shrinks as objectives are captured and held. It's an enjoyable spin on the formula, beginning like a typical game of Conquest before growing increasingly tense as the play area closes in on the remaining few objectives. Rush, meanwhile, is noteworthy for most matches typically turning into a one-sided steamrolling, owing to wide-open sightlines, while truncated infantry-only modes such as Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill still feel like square pegs in a round hole, diluting the Battlefield experience by stripping away almost everything that makes it click.Of course, established modes such as Conquest and Breakthrough will only go as far as the game's maps will take them, and Battlefield 6 is decidedly uneven in this regard. While Battlefield 2042's maps were often too big, the nine maps launching with Battlefield 6 swing too far in the opposite direction. Even Mirak Valley--the largest map included at launch--feels compact due to its narrow layout and closely packed objectives. None of the maps offer much breathing room, and it feels like everyone is constantly on top of each other, especially when interior structures contain so many different entrances.Intensity is good, but not when it's this persistent. Quieter moments, where you might attempt to flank the enemy by sneaking around the map's perimeter, help to punctuate the action, but examples like this are too few and far between. Verticality only goes one way, too, with no tunnels or caves to speak of. This is an issue on maps like New Sobek City, where snipers can camp out on high-rise buildings to attain a view of the entire map. There's cover to hide behind, but when you're already contending with enemy troops on the ground, the last thing you need is to be under constant sniper fire from overhead.There's also a distinct lack of visual diversity across the nine maps. Manhattan Bridge and Empire State feel like a single map split into two, while New Sobek City and Siege of Cairo fill the brown and dusty quota. Weather effects are notably absent as well, so every map is permanently sunny, and you're either fighting on narrow city streets or in between smaller structures (with two of the maps featuring a construction site in the center). There's nothing like Battlefield 4's Rogue Transmission, where the action takes place under and around a giant satellite dish, or Battlefield V's Fjell 652, that sees you fighting across a snowy mountain range. Water isn't a factor either, so don't expect to pilot a boat or sneak towards an objective by swimming below the surface. Although naval skirmishes are, at least, rumored to be on the way.There are good individual maps here--such as Liberation Peak, Mirak Valley, and Iberian Offensive--offering tense chokepoints and undulating terrain perfect for vehicular warfare. Battling through New York's brick apartment buildings beneath the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge is a singular thrill, as is emerging from tall grass to fire a missile into the underside of a tank. When taken as a collective, however, Battlefield 6 lacks variety and is missing the types of standout maps that people will still remember 10 years from now.Fortunately, those same sorts of maps may eventually appear in Battlefield 6's Portal mode: a web tool and SDK that lets players host custom games and create new game modes and maps. There's already a surprisingly good remake of Call of Duty 4's Shipment available to play, providing an early example of what's possible in the right hands. You can also race fighter jets, play a hardcore version of Conquest, and jump into an extraction shooter mode, among other user-created experiences. It's tough to judge now, but the potential is obvious, and I'm excited to see how Portal evolves over the game's lifespan--not to mention the official maps coming down the pipeline.Couple this with everything else, and Battlefield 6 is a return to form, even if it doesn't reach the same highs as the series at its peak. The campaign is as lackluster as expected, and the multiplayer maps are only ever decent at best, but there's still a chaotic and super-satisfying shooter here that offers multiplayer thrills unlike any other. Even if you're not racking up kills by the dozens, you're still rewarded for contributing in other ways, and you're never too far away from being in the middle of a histrionic Battlefield moment. It might be a familiar experience, but Battlefield 6 clearly understands what makes the series so appealing.\n                                \n\n    Back To Top\n      \n\n    \n                                                    "

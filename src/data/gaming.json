    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this month, some Monster Hunter Wilds players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC.Digital Foundry debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself \"checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor\" in less than a minute.Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC. That's slowing everything down, even if there isn't any DLC to be found.Other players have already noticed this and released a less DLC checks mod that helps alleviate the issue. It doesn't solve all of Monster Hunter Wilds' underlying issues on PC, but it can solve this one until Capcom decides to eventually address it.Capcom had previously promised that an update released this winter would directly target the biggest problems with Monster Hunter Wilds on PC. Many of those issues still persist, and it's unknown when or if they will be fixed.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Jason Momoa will return in A Minecraft Movie 2, and now he's shared a few more details about it. Appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Momoa confirmed that production will begin at the end of April and that he's read the script and found it to be very funny.\"The script is even better. It's so good. I was laughing out loud,\" Momoa said. \"I haven't laughed out loud in a very long time at a script.\"Momoa went on to say he was \"perplexed\" by the script for the original A Minecraft Movie. But the sequel's script had him \"laughing out loud.\"          A Minecraft Movie, released in 2025, earned more than $950 million globally at the box office, so the fact that it's getting a sequel is no surprise. The sequel was officially confirmed in October 2025, at which time Warner Bros. set a release date of July 23, 2027. That's a couple months after the live-action The Legend of Zelda movie comes out, so it'll be a busy time for high-profile video game movies.Original director Jared Hess is returning to direct and co-write the sequel. It's expected that the other stars of the first movie, including Jack Black, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Hansen, will return as well, with newcomers also expected to be added to the cast.Hess previously told Deadline that making a sequel would be \"so much fun,\" adding that the world of Minecraft is \"expansive\" and leaves open plenty of possibilities for more stories.\"There were so many things that we didn't tap into that we wanted to,\" he said. \"I would have a blast doing the sequel, and it seems like there's already talk about it happening, so I'm super excited. It'll be so much fun to go back into the world. The fans are just having such a good time. We teased it in the end credits, and the fans seem to be going wild for it.\"The sequel could focus on the character Alex, who was teased at the end of the film.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                This Sunday's NFL playoffs divisional round matchup between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans will feature a World of Warcraft-themed attraction for tailgaters, and it's because Blizzard's data shows that its players love sports.The World of Warcraft: Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern, as it's called, is a marketing activation that's meant to promote WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. Inside the tavern, people can get a drink and watch World of Warcraft livestreams. They can also meet cosplayers and influencers; the Orc cosplayers will be inside the stadium for the game itself.The Midnight expansion adds player housing, which is something fans have been requesting for years. Blizzard is also partnering with real estate company Zillow on this branded partnership, according to Sports Business Journal.People can find the Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern outside Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mass. Blizzard Entertainment CMO Monica Austin said the team has been building the tavern at Blizzard's headquarters in Anaheim, California for months, and only just recently decided to host the event in Foxboro as opposed to Denver, where another Divisional round game will take place.But why have this kind of marketing campaign in the first place? Austin said  Blizzard's research has shown that lapsed and active WoW players also enjoy watching sports.\"We've done a tremendous amount of deep dives to understand who are our players, lapsed and active. One of the things we see consistently is that our players are over-indexed in watching sports. And for the NFL, it's top-three over-indexing sport,\" Austin said. \"We know our players are there. We know they're watching. This is a strategic way that we want to use to reach them.\"Midnight launches on March 2, and will revamp the game's nearly two-decade-old Blood Elf zones as well as introduce new areas, dungeons, and raids.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

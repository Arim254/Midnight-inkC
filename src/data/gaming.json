The friendship mechanic, also known as happiness, determines your teammates' respective affinity toward you, their trainer. This can be improved through various means to help unlock new evolutionary paths.Pokemon can become friendlier toward you through the following methods:Exploring the game world while they're your active buddy.Using various items and equipment.Chilling in cafes and restaurants.Which Pokemon tend to evolve based on friendship levels?Friendship level in Pokemon Legends: Z-A matters to certain creatures whose evolutions are tied to this concept. These include the following:Pikachu - Evolves from a Pichu at high friendship levels.Eevee - Can turn into an Espeon (daytime evolution), Umbreon (nighttime evolution), or Sylveon (evolution with a Fairy-type ability in the moveset).Cleffa - Evolves into a Clefairy.Budew - Evolves into a Roselia during the day.Buneary - Evolves into a Lopunny.Riolu - Evolves into a Lucario during the day.Items that help increase friendship levels: Berries and the Soothe BellVarious items can increase Pokemon happiness and friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. These include different kinds of berries that boost friendship, while also lowering a particular stat. We don't really recommend using these since it's hard to offset the penalties to a Pokemon's stat growth. But if you really want to, you can check unmarked vendor and market stalls all over the city:Pomeg Berry - Lose base points for its HP stat.Kelpsy Berry - Lose base points for its attack stat.Qualot Berry - Lose base points for its defense stat.Hondew Berry - Lose base points for its SP attack stat.Grepa Berry - Lose base points for its SP defense stat.Tamato Berry - Lose base points for its speed stat.Still, one item that's quite viable is the Soothe Bell. It's a reward from Side Mission 36: Some Friendly Competition. Here are a few tidbits:The quest giver NPC is right in front of Cafe Rouleau in Magenta Sector 5. It's in the western part of the map.Defeat the trainer's Clefairy to receive the item.You can have a Pokemon hold the Soothe Bell via the inventory screen. This makes the creature friendlier.Fast friendship boosts via cafes and restaurantsBy far the fastest method of improving friendship and happiness levels involves cafes and restaurants. These are found all throughout Lumiose City:Go to a cafe and purchase a coffee or tea drink. Each option costs roughly 500 gold or more.Do this three or four times to fully max out a Pokemon's affinity toward you. You don't even need to go to a different establishment.You're going to spend 2,000 gold or more each time, but you can still earn a lot of money from the Battle Zone at night.That does it for our guide on how to increase friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. If you're keen on improving the capabilities of your teammates, you can visit our best early-game Pokemon guide and TM locations guide.You don't need to face the challenges in Lumiose City all by your lonesome.

This item is a series staple, as it allows you to catch any creature without fail. Of course, getting it requires quite a bit of effort.Table of Contents [hide]How to get the Master Ball in Pokemon Legends: Z-AMable's Research rank and Master Ball rewardMable's Research requests and talliesWhich Pokemon requires the Master Ball just to get captured?The Master Ball comes from Mable's Research. The NPC herself can be found in the Pokemon Research Center in the southern part of the map. You can't miss it since a main quest takes you there fairly early in the campaign.Mable's Research rank and Master Ball rewardThe Pokemon Legends: Z-A Master Ball can be yours upon reaching Rank 49 in the Mable's Research tab. You don't actually need to revisit Mable every time. You can just open the menu and press the X button to obtain rewards as you level up.You need to reach Mable's Research level 49 just to receive the Master Ball.Mable's Research requests and talliesHitting level 49 to get the Pokemon Legends: Z-A Master Ball is no small feat, as it's going to take you dozens of hours. That's because the points themselves come from requests/tallies. Here's what you can expect:You need to complete your Pokedex by catching unique species--i.e. one of each type. We've got you covered in our Pokedex/Pokemon locations guide.The above goes hand-in-hand with surveying Wild Zones--i.e. catching all the Pokemon in each habitat.The \"Catching X-type\" tallies grant points as you capture Pokemon that belong to a particular type/element. A good idea is to buy a lot of cheap Poke Balls so you can catch low-level critters like Pidgey (Normal/Flying) and Budews (Grass/Poison) to fulfill multiple tallies.You also have to unlock dozens of Mega Evolutions.Other objectives and actions, such as resting on benches, winning battles, and smashing Mega Crystals also help boost your rank.And, yes, you might want to find a buddy who wants to do a Link Trade for the extra points.Wild Zone 20, which becomes available after beating the main story, has various starter Pokemon that you didn't pick earlier in the campaign.Which Pokemon requires the Master Ball just to get captured?Since the Master Ball guarantees as 100% capture rate, it's usually reserved for Pokemon that are extremely hard to catch. A good example is Mewtwo from the classic Gen 1 titles.In this game, however, you really don't need it for Legendary Pokemon. Ultra Balls are enough, and even if you fail, you replay the encounter without issues. So, for the most part, you could use the Master Ball if you discovered a Shiny variant of a Pokemon that you really like. Alternatively, you could just keep it in your inventory forever. That's totally up to you.That does it for our guide on how to get the Master Ball in Pokemon Legends: Z-A.

There are three of these magnificent creatures in Lumiose City: Xerneas, Yveltal, and Zygarde. Of course, taking them on is no easy feat, as you truly need to prove your skills as a trainer. We've got all the details for you in our guide, but be forewarned that there are major spoilers, too.How to catch all Legendary Pokemon In Pokemon Legends: Z-A - Zygarde, Xerneas, and Yveltal locations guideTo be clear, the Legendary Pokemon Zygarde does show up several times throughout the campaign. However, you can only catch it, as well as Xerneas and Yveltal, after completing the main story. Here's a quick summary:After beating the campaign, you wake up at Hotel Z. Chat with your buddies and other NPCs to learn that the Infinite Z-A Royale is underway. This event basically allows you to continue earning tickets from the Battle Zone, leading to a face-off against a rival trainer.Go earn your tickets and defeat your first opponent. Surprisingly enough, it's good ol' Zach the Driver, the fella that you faced when you were still Rank Z. Oh, and he still has low-level creatures like Pidgey and Pikachu.After trouncing your foe, claim your reward from Quasartico Inc. and return to Hotel Z. You're then told about two mythical beasts known as \"The One that Gives\" and \"The One that Takes.\" These unlock two main quest arcs.The One that Gives: Part 1 - Alpha PokemonYou can tackle either of the two quests to get a Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. That said, we opted to prioritize \"The One that Takes.\"Initially, you just need to talk to Mable at the Pokemon Research Center. She'll tell you that Alpha Pokemon have appeared in Wild Zones 3, 5, and 9.Wild Zone 3: Steelix (level 70)Wild Zone 5: Gallade (level 70)Wild Zone 9: Pangoro (level 70)Note: As mentioned in our Pokedex guide, some of these creatures are harder to acquire compared to others. For instance, you need to equip an Onix with a Metal Coat, and you also have to trade it away just to evolve it into a Steelix. As such, you're better off using Ultra Balls to capture these opponents after beating them in combat. They're also Alpha variants, which means they're larger and have at least one move that's not normally learned by their species when leveling up.The One that Gives: Part 2 - Xerneas battleAfter eliminating the three Alpha pokemon, it's time to get your first legendary. To catch Xerneas in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, you need to go to Wild Zone 11. There's a glowing marker at the other side of the river, so approach it to make the level 75 Xerneas spawn.Xerneas is a Fairy-type combatant, which means it's weak against Poison and Steel. For the most part, it will buff itself using Geomancy. It also has a lifesteal ability known as Horn Leech, and a high-damage move called Megahorn.Note: Once Xerneas has been incapacitated, you need to catch it. If you fail in the attempt, you have no choice but to redo the encounter.The One that Takes: Part 2 - Mega EvolutionsThe other main quest arc leads you to Grisham and Griselle, former members of Team Flare. They'll accompany you to Quasartico Inc. to chat with Vinnie. He's got a machine that allows you to fight some familiar foes. They're none other than the Mega Evolved versions of Victreebell, Hawlucha, and Tyranitar. We've discussed these opponents in our Mega Evolutions guide, but here are a few tidbits:Mega Victreebell (level 70) - Weak against Fire abilities. Its ultimate causes an eruption of gooey blobs, with poison pools that linger on the ground.Mega Hawlucha (level 70) - Weak against Psychic and Fairy abilities. It will charge its power for several seconds, before performing a dive-bomb attack in the center of the arena. You can make it flinch to cancel the charge-up animation, but it will still its dive-bomb plunge.Mega Tyranitar (level 70) - Weak against Water and Grass. It will send out spiky tremors that travel along the ground. Dismiss your Pokemon so it doesn't get hit, and keep running sideways to avoid the stalagmites.Note: Unlike the Rogue Mega Evolution bouts in the campaign, you don't have any allies assisting you here. Also, if your character takes too many hits and blacks out during an encounter, you'd have to restart the battle.The One that Takes: Part 2 - Yveltal battleIt's time to catch another Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Your next target is Yveltal, who spawns on the rooftop of Galerie de la Lune, the fashion outlets/shops in the northern part of the city.Yveltal is a Dark/Flying type, making it weak against various elements, including Electric and Ice. However, we recommend bringing a strong Fairy-type creature, such as Clefable, to take it on. Offensive abilities like Moonblast and Dazzling Gleam, combined with the heals from the Moonlight spell, should make this encounter a breeze.Note: Similar to Xerneas, you need to catch Yveltal at the end of the battle. Otherwise, you'll have to fight it again.To Keep the World in Balance: Part 1 - L trainer battleAfter capturing both Xerneas and Yveltal, no additional quest marker will appear. But, if you return to Hotel Z, you'll suddenly be approached by Lysandre, also known as L. You have to face him and his squad of Pokemon, too.Pyroar (level 78) - Normal/FireFlorges (level 78) - FairySableye (level 78) - Dark/GhostGarbodor (level 78) - PoisonNoivern (level 78) - Flying/DragonMega Gyarados (level 80) - Water/DarkTo Keep the World in Balance: Part 2 - Zygarde battleWith Lysandre defeated, you'll have an opportunity to challenge Zygarde in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Go to Wild Zone 20 and find it in the middle of the area. Make sure you're well prepared because this upcoming battle has multiple phases. Here's what you need to know:Zygarde is a level 84 Dragon/Ground-type Pokemon. It's slightly weak against Dragon and Fairy moves, but it's also highly susceptible against Ice damage.Your best bets are Charizard with the Mega Evolution X keystone (Fire/Dragon), the aforementioned Yveltal (Dark/Flying), or Clefable (Fairy).Zygarde \"locks\" your active Pokemon. You won't be able to switch it out unless it gets incapacitated.First phase: Zygarde will be at 10% power--i.e. dog form. It will mostly around the arena while casting Thousand Arrows.Second phase: Zygarde will be at 50% power--i.e. serpent form. It will often use Rock Slide, Crunch, and Dragon Pulse. If your Pokemon has abilities that make it automatically move--i.e. Fly, Megahorn, and the like--then they can deftly avoid Dragon Pulse. Also, when Zygarde charges its ultimate, Land's Wrath, be ready to run away from it.After defeating the two forms of Zygarde, it will turn into its 100% robot-like variant. This is going to be a protracted fight, and you definitely need to be careful here. Certain attacks can hit your character multiple times, causing you to black out.Zygarde's basic attacks include Thousand Arrows and Thousand Waves. Since these are all Ground-based abilities, a Flying Pokemon shouldn't have any problems.Zygarde alternates between two ultimate abilities when it glows. Dismiss your Pokemon beforehand just to be on the safe side:  Core Enforcer - When it flies to the edge of the arena, run away from the center to avoid the beam blast. Then, move to a safe spot on the ground before the ensuing explosion.Land's Wrath - Multiple explosions occur in quick succession and you need to dodge them effectively. Try not to get hit several times.To Keep the World in Balance: Part 3 - Zygarde Mega Evolution and combat mechanicsThe fight might be long and arduous but, if you do everything right, you should be able to catch a Zygarde in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. This creature has fairly unique combat mechanics, too:Note that the Zygardite keystone should be in your inventory since it's a reward from the campaign's finale. Make sure Zygarde has it equipped so it can undergo its Mega Evolution.Lysandre will give you the Zygarde Cube. This allows you to freely switch between Zygarde's 10% form and 50% form during a battle.When Zygarde's HP drops below 50%, it will change to its 100% Complete Form. You can only activate Zygarde's Mega Evolution while it's in this form.Zygarde's Complete Form grants boosted stats, and the Core Enforcer ability also changes to Nihil Light.That does it for our guide on how to catch all Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. We hope you enjoy using Zygarde, Xerneas, and Yveltal in more battles ahead. In any case, since we've mentioned the gameplay mechanic a few times already, you might want to check our Mega Evolutions guide.You don't need to face the challenges in Lumiose City all by your lonesome. We've got a Pokemon Legends: Z-A guides hub to help you go from the bottom to the very top of the rankings.    \n  \n                      "

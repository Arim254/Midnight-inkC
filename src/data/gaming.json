    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The dream of Skyblivion goes back over a decade as a team of fans came together to use The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's engine to fully recreate and re-imagine Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion as a modern RPG. At the beginning of 2023, the team set a 2025 premiere for Skyblivion. However, that's no longer the plan and Skyblivion has been pushed to next year. The good news is that the latest dev video shows off how much has been finished and what remains to be done.          Skyblivion lead Rebelzize narrates the video as he offers a guide to where things stand. According to Rebelzize, most of the work has already been done and over 70 volunteer contributors are still hard at work trying to get the ambitious mod across the finish line.When this project was started, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was far out of date. Earlier this year, Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered, which could have taken the wind out of this team's project. Instead, Rebelzize and others praised the remaster as a \"win-win\" for the community. In recognition for their work, Bethesda gave copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion mod team.However, it hasn't been entirely harmonious for team Skyblivion. Earlier this year, a former member of the team spoke out against efforts to rush the mod out before it's ready. As impressive as Skyblivion is, no one is getting paid for it, and the ex-team member is against the crunch-time mindset that was making things more difficult.For now, it looks like Skyblivion is worth the wait. Although Bethesda does offer some support for mods on consoles, it will only be available on PC. Skyblivion will also require players to own both Elder Scrolls 5 and Elder Scrolls 4 in order to work.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

While Black Ops 7 is sticking to thematically appropriate operator skins, Season 11 of Call of Duty Mobile includes a major crossover with Street Fighter, which allows players to transform into the popular fighting characters and use their iconic fighting moves. This new season also adds a DMZ extraction mode, new loadout items to unlock, and special events.Season 11 start date detailsSeason 11 starts on December 11 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.

Season 11 is themed around Street Fighter, and this brings new challenges and limited-time game modes inspired by the characters of the iconic fighting game.For multiplayer, Shoryu and Hadoken is a limited-time mode available across a select map pool. Scorestreaks are disabled in this mode, and operators enter the match equipped with only the Prizefighter gloves melee weapon and increased jump height, which is meant to reflect the martial style of Street Fighter.Players melee and build up a rage meter until they earn enough to transform into either Hidora Kai for Ryu or Shigenori for Akuma. Ryu's move set offers his classic Hadoken projectile ability and his powerful wave motion fist attack, Shinku Hadoken. Akuma's combat style uses the Shoryuken rising uppercut and the Shun Goku Satsu attack. The first player to land enough eliminations is the winner.Battle royale also has a limited-time Street Fighter mode. This lets players find holograms of four different Street Fighter characters on the mode's Isolated map. Interacting with the holograms for Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, and Cammy will let the player acquire their unique abilities and activate special attacks to use during the match.DMZ Recon modeDMZ Recon Serpent Island mapCall of Duty Mobile adds a new extraction mode inspired by Modern Warfare 2's DMZ called DMZ Recon.

This is an entirely indoor map spread out over three floors, offering a faster pace and more close-quarters action compared to the larger Serpent Island map.Additionally, DMZ Recon features new challenges and over 20 more camos to unlock for Call of Duty mobile.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Legendary game designer and programmer Ron Gilbert (Monkey Island) has revealed that one of his exciting-sounding upcoming projects has been canceled due in part to investors not coming to the table to fund the project.Speaking to Ars Technica, Gilbert said this game had a vision of being a \"large, open-world-type RPG\" in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen.\"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that,\" he said. \"You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources.\"Gilbert previously described his new project as \"classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park,\" and a lot of people were excited to find out what that might look like. Now it's not happening.\"Horrible\" publishing dealsGilbert said he pitched the project to people in the industry but discovered that \"deals that publishers were offering were just horrible.\"The kind of game Gilbert envisioned \"isn't the big, hot item\" so potential publishers didn't invest, he said. \"The amount of money they're willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this,\" he explained.Gilbert funded 2017's Thimbleweed Park on Kickstarter, bringing in more than $600,000 USD. Gilbert also took private investment to complete the project.The industry veteran observed that publishers today can be \"very analytics-driven\" and have devised their own formulas to \"try to figure out how much money they could make.\" The result of this, Gilbert observed, is that publishers take on less risk, and in turn, games that do get made often look the same.\"You end up [getting] a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year’s games, because that makes some money,\" he said. \"When we were starting out, we couldn't do that because we didn't know what made this money ... I think that's why I really enjoy the indie game market because it's kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there's a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness.\"Gilbert's latest game is Death by Scrolling, an action game that was released at the end of October this year. Before that, he partnered with Devolver for Return to Monkey Island.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

All PS Plus members will be able to claim Need For Speed Unbound, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper starting January 6 and they will remain available until Monday, February 2.NFS Unbound promo art.The most recent Need for Speed game, NFS Unbound, has single-player and multiplayer campaigns set in Lakeshore City, which greatly resembles Chicago. Street racing is a key part of the experience, but so is outrunning the cops. As your \"Heat\" index rises after each race, the police will pursue players with greater intensity as they establish their rep outside of the law. Between races, players can customize their rides and compete in weekly qualifiers to get into the ultimate street racing contest: The Grand.Mickey unleashes his paint brush in promo art for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed.Epic Mickey was a Wii exclusive upon its 2010 debut until THQ Nordic's 2024 remaster, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, brought the game to modern consoles. The visuals and gameplay have been noticeably improved as Mickey Mouse is sucked into the Wasteland where forgotten characters and concepts have languished for decades. This game is one of the reasons why Disney made a deal to gain the rights to Walt Disney's previous creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. And for the first time, Mickey has to come face-to-face with his brother, Oswald, and reconcile with him if he wants any chance of escaping the Wasteland.Promo art for Core Keeper.Core Keeper is kind of a blend of cozy and survival games that allows players to explore a vast cavern that has hidden treasures and \"untold secrets.\" Players can dig for the relics and resources they need to craft tools, build bases, and dive even further into the cavern. To defeat the Titans, players will have to upgrade their skills while tending to their animals, growing their own food, fishing, and even cooking in their spare time. If you haven't claimed December's PlayStation Plus free games yet, make sure to do so before Monday, January 5. December's games include Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                My favorite moment in Skin Deep, an immersive sim and stealth game about rescuing cats and fighting your evil clone in deep space, was always the one immediately after a thoroughly developed plan inevitably went sideways. The skittish way that I was forced to sprint and crawl under a table or into a vent. The manner in which my strategy devolved into simply batting things off of shelves in order to incapacitate a roaming guard or noisily distract them from looking in my direction. The way that I leapt onto a guard's back, dug my claws in, and careened them into surfaces in order to knock them out. If you were to close your eyes, I'd argue you could almost hear that distinctive, feline yowl mid-action.In short, I think Skin Deep best captures the experience of being a cat, even if Nina Pasadena, the game's protagonist, is decidedly not one. And for this tremendous feat, I am rewarding it with the honor of being the best cat game of 2025. Long live Skin Deep.In a typical Skin Deep mission, I often tried to keep to the shadows, as is the norm for a game in its genre. I would relegate myself to the ventilation, the pipework surrounding it, and the undersides of tables. Like Batman, I skulked around the perimeter looking for a precise opening that'd enable me to punch a hole in the level's defenses while keeping my cover. Of course, in Skin Deep, it almost never worked out in my favor. Because I am not, in fact, Batman. I'm just a (cat) girl.Eventually, I'd be made in the silliest way possible. I'd linger in the dust-covered vents a little too long and let out the world's loudest sneeze, alerting the guards to my exact location. I'd throw down a bar of soap on one end of the room, be discovered while pickpocketing a guard on the other, and slip on my own trap as I ran back the way I came. Or, as is most often the case, I crouch-walked through a door or vent without first peeking into the room, jumpscared the first guard I saw, and threw the apple core I was holding in my hand at them. When you're crouched like I often was, the camera's perspective is so low to the ground, I almost always felt like a kitten traipsing through the halls and vents of a home I didn't belong in. And just like a flustered orange tabby, my priority became to zoom to safety at the risk of endangering everything and everyone in my warpath the second I was found out.          I could sooner count the number of times a plan has gone right than wrong in Skin Deep, primarily because the former is a far lower number. Most of my successes stem from slapdash plans developed on the fly and from the wreckage of another plan. And yet, despite the failures, it has been more fun to improvise in Blendo Games' deliberately slapstick sandbox and cosplay some kind of fumbling cat lady than come across as some calm and collected black-ops agent. To that end, I found I enjoyed leaning into the bit.I much preferred stalking high and narrow walkways with a charming assortment of irreverent items (a bolt, some ground pepper, a banana, etc.) to looting a weapon. And when I was looting, I, like many cat owners can likely attest to, loved to snatch something I was really not supposed to have--in this case a walkie-talkie or key card--before scurrying back into the shadow and making off as if I got one out from right under those guards' dumb noses.Of course, when I was found by the guards for sticking my nose a little too close to the sun, I did combat like a cat too. Even in the most harried of situations, ones where I was backed into a corner and forced to face off against Skin Deep's roving guards--an intergalactic goon squad straight out of pulpy sci-fi novel called the Numb Bunch--I still felt like a lithe and frenzied cat warrior rather than another human combatant. Melees were won not by hard blows but by swift strikes. A quick flick of the wrist launched one of my collected throwables at a guard. Disoriented, I climbed on their backs and sent them smashing into sinks, toilets, screens, pipes, etc. Anything that carried a high risk of causing CTE, really. Once they were conked out, I hurriedly popped their heads off (since these could fly towards respawn stations and revive a guard) and, like a cat secreting its stolen goods, I hid or threw them down a toilet or garbage chute, permanently incapacitating my foe.Fights in Skin Deep were rarely decided, you see, by sheer willpower and force. It was always about thinking on your feet paws. It was about pulling a fast one on your unsuspecting combatants. It was about being a cat in a world filled with boorish humans and their brute dogs.I found Skin Deep's interpretation of cat-like design immediately refreshing. The industry is no stranger to cat games, many of which are charming in their own ways. However, I typically found that when I engaged with them, they were more preoccupied with the aesthetics of cats than the ways in which their mechanics could convey the feeling of being one.In Stray, I performed and looked like a cat, but never quite felt like one. In Skin Deep, the inverse is true. It is as if, untethered by the expectations of having to make an aesthetically pleasing feline protagonist, Skin Deep was more free to recreate environments a cat would thrive and play in and design systems that rewarded that fantasy. By my estimate, it nailed it. Across its frenetic combat, slapstick stealth, and skittish movement, Skin Deep more wholly realizes the idea of being a cat than any other game I've played. For sticking that landing, it deserves 10/10 toe beans. Or y'know, however many cats have.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nAvowed doesn't allow slain enemies to respawn and is all the better for it.By \n    Kenneth Seward Jr.\n   on January 1, 2026 at 6:00AM PST\n              \n                Obsidian's Avowed is one of the better action-RPGs released in 2025. While it doesn't reinvent any particular wheel, it benefits from an engaging campaign, fun combat systems, and charming characters. Aside from the occasional bug--a common element of Obsidian's open-world games--and an overabundance of homicidal bears, I liked nearly everything about the game. That includes Avowed's most controversial game mechanic: enemy respawns, or the lack thereof.When it comes to RPGs, players often think of a few key elements. Some sort of leveling system, quest-granting NPCs, obtainable loot that bolsters certain \"builds\" or playstyles--you know, the basics. One feature that's common but maybe not as notable, considering its use in other genres, is respawning enemies. Players often expect areas to repopulate with baddies whenever they return to a given location. Avowed isn't about that life though--at least, not entirely.Avowed is designed to respond to your actions in meaningful ways, and not just during key moments, where certain decisions can change the direction of the game's story. This also applies to Avowed's enemies. Essentially, most of the outlaws, walking mushrooms, and crazed bears you'll run into during your journey, won't return after being killed. Laid waste to a group of Xaurips while wandering through the forest? Don't worry. They'll still be dead on return trips. Slain a few dozen Spiderlings in an underground lair? They won't be resurrected anytime soon, either. Rinse and repeat--or rather, don't repeat.Of course, this aspect of Avowed's gameplay didn't sit well with everyone. Some didn't like how empty areas felt after a while. Others hated that they couldn't farm enemies for experience points or random loot--a shortcoming that exacerbated the irritating grind of upgrading gear before Avowed's day-one patch. In most cases, the complaints about this feature are reasonable. That said, I liked the idea of never having to face the same enemy twice. Not having to worry about battling the same group of skeletons on return trips to their camp was great, especially during those times when I needed to collect something I missed; returning for a chest that could only be opened with a specific key (or several lock picks) was a breeze.AvowedI also liked how my actions had consequences. If I made a place relatively safe for travelers to explore, it stayed that way. And conversations with NPCs would reflect how I was able to put down a group of bandits that threatened their town. Again, this sort of thing is common when dealing with story-based missions or important side quests. It's easier to role-play when everything you do matters, though. Even on a small scale, it's nice to feel like you're a meaningful part of Avowed's world.The most notable reason this novel feature is a good thing has to do with farmable enemies. There aren't any, which in turn means that grinding for XP isn't a thing. Obsidian has created multiple combat systems that, when combined, offset the need to constantly hit certain levels. Yeah, there are places that are initially off-limits to new players. And seeing multiple enemies with skulls over their heads (indicating their threat level) could mean trouble. But thanks to the ability to upgrade weapons/gear, flexible build-crafting, competent AI companions, and a generous helping of XP whenever a quest is completed, I never felt under-leveled when trying to complete a story-based mission.I've played enough video games over the years to know that grinding, while being a respected method of controlling the pace of certain activities, isn't always needed. I've also gotten to a point where I can better appreciate a developer's efforts to respect my time as a player; this is less \"old person yelling at the clouds\" and more \"I no longer have all of the time in the world to play games.\" That's not to say that I didn't partake in side quests, bounties, and more--just that I was never made to feel like I had to do those things to progress.Avowed offered me a balanced experience throughout my entire playthrough. And part of that appeal came from Obsidian's deliberate efforts to allow players to play at their own pace. You could go through the game clearing all the camps, caves, and abandoned mines in hopes of min/maxing your character. You can also, for the most part, just stick to the main questline and still have a good time. Creating a game that doesn't allow for enemy respawns--which requires changes to the normal RPG grind-fest formula--works in Avowed's favor.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

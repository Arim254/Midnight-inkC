However, a week before the new content drops, fans will get a glimpse into the expansion's story with the prequel novel Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim. This official novel launches on April and will provide context for the Lord of Hatred's main questline and introduce the Skovos Isles region where the expansion takes place. If that sparks your interest, you can preorder the paperback edition of Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim for $30 at Amazon. The book will also be available as an eBook and Audible audiobook, priced at $15 and $17.52, respectively.                                 Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim (Novel)                                                                $30 | Releases April 21, 2026                                                                                                                                                                                    Diablo IV: The Lost Horadrim is set in the wake of the cataclysmic reaping by the Angel of Death, Malthael, which leaves humanity and the world of Sanctuary devastated. In an effort to fight against the rising tides of Hell's forces, the Horadric Order sends Lorath, Donan, and Tyrael to the Skovos Isles to uncover the fate of a long-lost expedition. The book's events will tie into the upcoming Diablo IV expansion, Lord of Hatred. It is written by Matthew J. Kirby, who previously wrote the Diablo character tomes for Lorath and Prava.                      Diablo has a long history in print, and if you're looking to grab a few books--possibly as a devilish stocking-stuffer--there's plenty to choose from. The Diablo art books and character tomes are fun dives into the game's bleak world, combining high-quality prints with rich illustrations to create eye-catching works of art. The character tomes are designed to be in-universe books written from the perspectives of several key Diablo characters, like Cain and Prava, and they use special paper to give each book a worn, weathered look. The first four of these books are also available as part of the Horadric Vault series for $98.39, but it's actually cheaper to purchase each one and the recently released Book of Prava individually.You can also dive into various novels set within the timeline of the first Diablo game. The Sin War is a three-book series covering the conflict that would forever change the destiny of humanity, while Storm of Light is set during Diablo 3 and follows Tyrael as he enacts his boldest plan yet: rebuilding the Horadric Order and preparing them to steal the black Soulstone from the heart of Heaven. Diablo graphic novels are also available for purchase, with two of them chronicling the adventures of two legendary characters from the game series: the legendary Necromancer Rathma and the progenitor of the Barbarians, Bul-Kathos.Diablo book deals at AmazonDiablo novelsLegacy of Blood -- $9.69 ($15)The Black Road -- $8.90 ($15)The Kingdom of Shadow -- $20Moon of the Spider -- $13.69 ($15)The Sin War: Book One - Birthright -- $10.46 ($15)The Sin War: Book Two - Scales of the Serpent -- $13.41The Sin War: Book Three - The Veiled Prophet -- $20.69The Lost Horadrim -- $30 | Releases April 21, 2026The Lost Horadrim (eBook) -- $15 | Releases April 21, 2026The Lost Horadrim (Audible) -- $17.52 | Releases April 21, 2026Storm of Light -- $14.89 ($22)Morbed (Kindle) -- $2.29Diablo Character TomesThe Book of Cain -- $21.80 ($30)The Book of Tyrael -- $19 ($30)The Book of Adria -- $16.69 ($30)The Book of Lorath -- $15 ($30)The Book of Prava -- $25.50 ($30)Diablo art and character booksThe Art of Diablo: Volume 1 -- $29.39 ($45)The Art of Diablo: Volume 2 -- $31.30 ($45)The Art of Diablo: Volume 2 (Limited Edition) -- $69.11 ($100)Horadric Vault: The Complete Collection -- $29.39 ($45)Diablo graphic novelsSword of Justice -- $9.23 ($15)Legends of the Necromancer: Rathma -- $16.43 ($25)Legends of the Barbarian: Bul-Kathos -- $13.49 ($20)Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:                                Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Cabinets Get First Discounts At Amazon                         Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33                         Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (5)                 Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals                         Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price                         Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time                         ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld Is On Sale For Only $489 For A Limited Time                         Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

That's especially true for the Hotel Collection, as right now you can save 50% on select Star Wars scents, candles, and diffusers. This includes everything from premium candles with a burn time of up to 300 hours and tiny diffusers built to keep your car smelling fresh.Many of these scents have names like Rebel Spirit and The Dark Side, but rest assured, they won't smell like the inside of Darth Vader's helmet or the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. Each fragrance was crafted from a blend of ingredients, including Valencia Orange and Bergamot. Many of the scents are shared across product categories, so if you already know how you want your home (or car) to smell, here's a quick rundown of each fragrance in the Star Wars roster.Hotel Collection: Star Wars FragrancesThe Empire: Toasted vanilla, shadow clove, black amberJedi: Bergamot, damask rose, Chinese black teaThe Dark Side: Sinister sage, patchouli, saffronRebel Spirit: Bergamot, amber, Valencia orangeGalactic Hope: Smooth resin, seductive amber, vintage woodThe Force: Bright neroli, oud wood, cardamomSith: Cashmere amber, shadowy violet, bitter orangeThe Duel: Santal, dim amber, muskHere's a look at all the Star Wars fragrances and diffusers that are on sale snow. Many are up to 50% off. If you know you'll be using the scents for a long time, consider picking up a diffuser--it could save you money in the long run. Otherwise, a premium candle is a nice, affordable alternative. Please note that many discounts are only applicable when signing up for monthly subscriptions (not one-time purchases).Once you've browsed all the deals, be sure to check out GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for even more early discounts--and don't forget to check back throughout the month to see the latest price cuts on video games, figures, and beyond.Studio Pro Scent Diffuser (Home Diffuser)Before you can use any of the fragrance oils, you'll need to pick up a diffuser. These come in three different designs, though each one covers up to 600 square feet. They don't use heat or water, making them safe for kids and pets, and you won't find any residue left behind as the scents waft through your room. Their original price of $100 is a bit steep, but since you can snag a cool Star Wars one for just $50 right now, they're definitely worth a closer look.Darth Vader -- $50 ($100)Storm Trooper -- $50 ($100)C-3PO -- $50 ($100)Home Diffuser Fragrance OilA whole lot of fragrance oil for the Home Diffuser lineup is on sale at the Hotel Collection. These come in two styles--Pro and Regular. The Pro Pods are compatible with the Studio Pro Scent Diffusers (including the Star Wars models above). The Regular Pods are compatible with the older Studio Scent Diffuser. We've listed the Pro Pods below, but you'll find Regular variants on each store page if you're working with the older diffuser.The Empire -- $27.48 ($55)Jedi -- $38.46 ($55)The Dark Side -- $27.48 ($55)Rebel Spirit -- $27.48 ($55)Galactic Hope -- $38.46 ($55)Chauffeur Car Diffuser + Fragrance OilRoom SprayJust need a periodic scent refresh? These room sprays work a bit like cologne or perfume. Just give your space a few sprays, and the fragrance should linger around for a while. They're also pretty cheap right now, making them a good alternative to diffusers and oils.Rebel Spirit -- $25 ($50)The Dark Side -- $25 ($50)The Force -- $25 ($50)Galactic Hope -- $25 ($50)Deluxe CandlesBuilt to burn for up to 300 hours, these are much more impressive than the candles you'll find at your supermarket. They're quite large at 55 ounces, and each one comes with minimalist Star Wars iconography.Jedi -- $75 ($150)Sith -- $75 ($150)The Duel -- $21.48 ($43)Classic CandleBuilt to burn for 90 hours, these smaller 14-ounce candles are cheaper and might be a better fit for small spaces.Rebel Spirit -- $27.48 ($55)The Dark Side -- $27.48 ($55)The Force -- $27.48 ($55)    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was going to embrace games-as-a-service before it shifted to become XDefiant, a game that the publisher shut down not long after release. This is according to Nick Herman, a developer who worked on the game before leaving to start AdHoc Studios, the team that just launched the episodic game Dispatch to great success. Following the publication of this report, XDefiant director Mark Rubin spoke out to react to the report and share his side of the story.\"I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while,\" Herman said told Bloomberg. \"And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.\"The game was in development \"for a few months,\" Bloomberg reported, and Herman confirmed that Ubisoft wanted to have it feature games-as-a-service elements.\"We tried,\" Herman said. \"Let's make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.\"The report said \"Ubisoft had lost interest\" in this Splinter Cell game and shifted to pursue a project that could attempt to compete with Call of Duty. This became XDefiant, a game directed by former Call of Duty boss Mark Rubin. The game shut down after a year and developers were laid off. \"We thought we were going to be able to make something really great,\" Herman said. \"And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don't anymore. It's a common thing in games.\"Rubin, who directed XDefiant and is no longer with Ubisoft, shared his side of the story. He said it is \"not true\" that Ubisoft was working on a Splinter Cell game before switching to XDefiant. \"When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter Cell game. I then canceled that one and let the team pitch any game ideas they wanted,\" he said. \"There were some cool ones but I felt the scope/difficulty was too hard on some ideas so we stuck with an arena shooter and we found the fun quickly. So no we didn't pivot off Splinter Cell to make XDefiant. Now maybe they were thinking about working on Splinter Cell before I got there but it was never a thing while I was there. My experience with Ubisoft was they are very open to whatever the studio wants to do which is great but I do wish we could have used external engines.\"Saw the rumor from Bloomberg that we were working on Splinter Cell game before switching to Xdefiant. I can say that is not true. When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter…  — Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) November 15, 2025\n  While that Splinter Cell game is not coming to market, a Splinter Cell remake is now in the works. Outside of games, the Splinter Cell TV show Deathwatch debuted in October on Netflix and has already been renewed for a second season. A live-action movie was in the works, but apparently no longer is.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders occasionally sends you topside to fix something and expects you to bring your own items to do so. One such quest is After Rain Comes, which tasks you with repairing some solar panels in Buried City. The last thing you'll want to do is show up to fix them and not have what you need, so we're here to help.You will need 2 Batteries and 5 Wires to complete After Rain Comes. You'll want to place these items in safe pockets if at all possible, as you wouldn't want to lose them due to a misstep, ARC battle, or non-friendly raider while making your way to the solar panels.When you're ready to hop in and fix those solar panels, here's what you need to know.Where to find Batteries and WiresBatteries and Wires can be just about anywhere, but they are very common drops found in any Technological or Electrical POI on any map. Unless you've been selling all of your items throughout the game thus far, you're likely to have some in your stash already, as they're quite plentiful. You can also recycle other electrical items like a Power Cable to get Wires, or recycle an Industrial Battery to get Batteries.However, if you're lacking in enough Batteries or Wires, the most efficient way to get and complete this quest is to simply buy them from Celeste in Speranza. This trader lets you purchase up to 10 Batteries and 10 Wires per day.That was easy. Let's go fix some stuff, raider.Where to find and repair the solar panels in Buried CityThe solar panels you need to repair for After Rain Comes can be located outside of the Grandioso Apartments on the west side of the map. This is a fairly high traffic area due to the apartments having pretty good loot, so keep an eye out for raiders who may be above you, as you'll need to do your work on the ground below.Find the solar panels here.When you arrive, you'll need to find a yellow box under one of the solar panels here. Interact with this and use the Batteries and Wires you brought in to repair it. This simple task will get things up and running again and finish the quest.Use the Batteries and Wires to repair this box.Now that you've completed the quest, you're free to head out at your own convenience. You don't need to extract, but it's obviously preferable if you do, so we'd recommend heading over to the Western Station slightly northeast of the solar panels to get out of dodge.For more, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

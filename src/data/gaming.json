Last week it was Soda Jungle Maker, and this week it's Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle. Normally $65, this 738-piece building set is discounted to only $28. Like Soda Jungle Maker, Peach's Castle is retiring soon, so this is likely your last chance to get a massive discount on the set.Amazon has already sold out of this deal once today (November 23), but the deal is back in stock as of 5:55 PM PT.

It doesn't include Peach, who is only available as an interactive figure in the Super Mario Adventures Starter Set, which is on sale for $40 (was $50).The castle's fold-out walls are destructible, so you can easily refortify your defenses after Chain Chomp crashes into them. Toad can sling projectiles at Roy and Chain Chomp with a built-in catapult atop the castle. If you have Interactive Princess Peach, you can tap the Action Tags on the rotating throne, in the small garden where Toad likes to hang out, and in hidden spots. Tapping an Action Tag plays music and sound effects from the Peach figure's built-in speakers.

There were a lot of great Xbox 360 games during its run. But looking back, it's staggering to see how many of the top-selling Xbox 360 games were from the Call of Duty franchise.Circana's Mat Piscatella has shared the 20 best-selling Xbox 360 games in the US, and 7 out of the 20 were Call of Duty titles. Six of those games were in the top 10, and four out of the top five as well.Three Halo games and two Gears of War titles made the list, as did perennial best-sellers Minecraft and The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. Since the acquisitions of Bethesda, Activision, and Mojang Studios, Microsoft now owns the rights to 17 of the titles on this list.Outside of Microsoft's dominion, Rockstar Games had two of the most-acclaimed titles of that generation: Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto 4. Meanwhile, EA's Battlefield 3 was the publisher's sole title to make the list.Peter Moore--the former Microsoft executive who oversaw Xbox and Xbox 360--recently shared some of the history behind the latter's battle with the PlayStation 3 for the hearts and minds of gamers. The Xbox 360 is one of the biggest hits that Microsoft has ever had in the gaming realm. Although the Xbox 360 store was shut down last year, Microsoft shared an update for the system in June 2025.The complete list of the top 20 best-selling Xbox 360 games in the US is reproduced below. Most of the titles are still available to play on the Xbox Store.20. Gears of War 3Developer: Epic GamesRelease Date: September 20, 201119.

Select Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses models are seeing generous discounts for Black Friday 2025. These are all Gen 1 models--so they won't have the extended battery life or upgraded cameras of the Gen 2 models--but they still offer many of the same features as the newer models, including Meta AI support, built-in speakers and camera, and more. While the smart glasses are available in a variety of frames and lens styles, it looks like only the Wayfarer frames are currently getting discounts. You can snag a pair for as low as $239.20 (normally $299) thanks to Amazon's sale.                                 Ray-Ban X Meta Smart Glasses - Wayfarer Frames (Gen 1)                                                                Starts at $239                                                                                                                                                                                    If you're unfamiliar with Meta's collaboration with Ray-Ban, these smart glasses aren't your average pair of frames. Inside its larger arms, you'll find heaps of cool tech that lets you ask Meta AI questions, take photos or videos, or listen to music. You can even ask Meta AI what you're looking at, making the smart glasses a helpful travel companion. The frames are only slightly thicker than those of some typical glasses, so unless someone is looking closely, most won't even realize you have a computer sitting on your head. As for the actual specs, you'll find an ultra-wide 12MP camera, a five-mic system for easy voice recognition, an included charging and travel case, and a built-in button to activate its AI. Any images or footage you capture can also be easily shared on Facebook or Instagram.                      While these AI-powered smart glasses are stylish, they're much simpler compared to AR and VR devices. Those who are interested in something more powerful should also check out Amazon's limited-time Black Friday deals on the Meta Quest 3S VR headset. Amazon has two deals available--the first drops the Mea Quest 3S 128GB model to just $250 (was $300) and includes a $50 Amazon gift card as a free bonus. You can also score the Meta Quest 3S bundle that includes the 256GB model of the headset with a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow and a $49 Amazon Gift Card for just $329 (was $400). These deals are exclusive to Amazon and won't stick around long, so grab them while you can.Meta Quest 3S VR Headset Black Friday Deals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Quest 3S is much bigger than the Ray-Ban AI Smart Glasses, but they're also much more powerful, acting as a complete standalone, wireless VR setup (though you can also plug the headset into your PC or PS5 if you want to play more demanding VR games). If you've been curious about VR gaming but haven't jumped in yet, these bundles are an excellent way to get an affordable VR setup.For more VR and gaming deals, head over to GameSpot's Black Friday 2025 hub.

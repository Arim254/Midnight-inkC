    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 30, 2025 at 2:02AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Every new season of Fortnite brings significant changes to the loot pool, but the start of a new chapter is an even more special occasion--each Season 1 brings us a totally new set of weapons and other items. While we usually get to keep the basic stuff--like shield pots and med packs and shockwave grenades--the loot pool is typically pretty unfamiliar. And Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is no different in that regard.In Season 1, we've got a couple weapons we've used before, but the majority of the toys you'll be playing with this season are completely new, and they feel pretty different compared with the guns we've used in the past few seasons.These are the returning items in the loot pool in Chapter 7 Season 1:Tactical PistolEnforcer ARDual Micro SMGsDynamiteGrenadesBeyond those guns and items, you'll be looking at a bunch of totally new stuff. Scroll on to find out more about the new weapons.Forsaken Vow BladeObtained by visiting a training rift and being granted one by Beatrix Kiddo herself, the Forsaken Vow Blade combines elements of both of Fortnite's past katanas, the Typhoon Blade and the Kinetic Blade, with a dash attack that makes it an effective movement item.Arc Lightning GunInstead of bullets, this mini-gun fires off a stream of electrical current that melts anyone at close range. Vengeful SniperSeason 1's only sniper rifle carries three rounds per magazine, and since it's the only gun in the loot pool that isn't hitscan, it features some pretty heavy bullet drop that you'll need to account for.Holo Rush SMGThe Holo Rush is, as the name implies, a scoped SMG with pretty decent range--it can shoot further than the Arc Lightning Gun, for one thing.Deadeye Assault RifleThis scoped assault rifle is best at mid-to-long ranges, though it can hit pretty hard if you need to spray it in an emergency. This one shoots like if Fortnite's old Heavy AR had a scope on it, which makes it very deadly indeed.Twin HammersThese dual pumps actually combine for a fairly healthy fire rate, so you can treat the pair more or less the same way you would a single auto shotgun. Iron Pump ShotgunThis season's pump shotgun handles very smoothly, does solid damage without being overpowered, and it's got a little bit of range. So it may be every sweaty gamer's best friend by the end of the season. WingsuitThis season's new movement gimmick is essentially a weaker version of Iron Man's Flight Kit--it has the same vertical takeoff, but once you're up in the air you'll actually glide back down to the ground instead of being able to fly around willy nilly. Just be warned you trail smoke when you use a wingsuit, and so you'll be visible from pretty far away.Boss kitsInstead of medallions, boss NPCs now drop boss kits that allow you to wear their skin and use their combat gimmick. Just be warned that once you pick one of these up, you're stuck with it until you die or the match ends. And, yes, it does use one of your inventory slots.     \n  \n                      "

In Chapter 7, we've moved on to North America, and specifically the southwestern USA. The Chapter 7 map includes major locations based on Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Area 51--in other words, it's Fortnite's San Andreas map.It all starts in Battlewood in the southwest portion of the new island, which has its own version of the iconic Hollywood sign and streets lined with palm trees. Nearby, you'll find the sound stages of Sus Studios, and you can take a ride up the freeway--yes, this map has Fortnite's first four-lane highway--to visit the casinos of the Sandy Strip. And smack in the middle of the map you won't find Tilted Towers or any other city. Instead, the heart of the island holds Innoloop Labs, an Area 51-esque spot where somebody is doing experiments on the Zero Point.But the highlight of the map is in the northeast, where you'll find a theme park called Wonkeeland, where you can ride a roller coaster--the first time Fortnite has had one of those since Chapter 3.There's no train on the Chapter 7 island, unfortunately, but there's something that might actually be better: hot air balloons. You can find several of these balloons floating around the island, and you can ride them to new places or use them as a sniper's nest.Fortnite's Chapter 7 map sure looks like a wild one. Scroll on for a better look at some of the key spots around the island.    \n  \n                      "

The Fortnite-original Melodie Mars skin is unlocked instantly when you purchase the pass, and the Rockstar Lisa skin is the final reward in the pass, she's got a reactive back bling on the pass as well.Those Icon emotes are a pretty surprising inclusion, as there have only been three total Icon emotes included in the previous 11`music passes. To have two of them on one music pass is very unusual. It would be cooler, however, if the emotes actually featured songs that were well known.One of them is called Latata, which is also the name of a well known Kpop song released in 2018--but this emote uses a different, unrelated song called Latata that is not even slightly popular. The other, which uses Can't Get Enough by Krysta Youngs and NiiWHA, is only slightly less obscure. These two tracks have fewer than 5,000 total listens combined on YouTube Music. Of the eight jam tracks included in the Starlux pass, four are licensed and four are Epic-produced tracks. These are the licensed tracks.Get Jiggy by B Jack$, Zeddy WillDashstar* VIP by Knock2Sorry by Justin BieberF*** Up the World (Vixi Solo Version) by LisaIn all, the Starlux music pass includes 30 items, with one reward unlocking each two account levels you earn in any Fortnite experience.

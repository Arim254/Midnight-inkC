    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's been 12 years since Bruno Mars performed at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, but the musician has found a new big venue where he can sing without even leaving his home. This weekend, the hit Roblox game Steal a Brainrot is going to host a pop up performance by Bruno Mars that's a one-time only appearance.The official announcement went out on Roblox's social media channels. Mars' performance will be held on Saturday, January 17 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.Although musical acts like Stray Kids have performed in Roblox before, Mars will be the first to do so for Steal a Brainrot, which launched in May 2025. He's expected to sing his new single, I Just Might, as well as an older song, Locked Out of Heaven.To mark the occasion, players will have the chance to get a Bruno Mars Brainrot, as well as other related in-game items and traits.Steal a Brainrot, Grow a Garden, and the larger Roblox sandbox were among the top-trending topics on YouTube in 2025. There's even a Grow a Garden movie in development despite the game's lack of any identifiable story elements.However, Roblox has been dogged by accusations that it hasn't done enough to protect kids from child exploitation and grooming. According to a June 2024 Bloomberg investigation, the platform has had major issues with child predators. Florida and Texas even sued Roblox over that issue.Roblox has since introduced initiatives to keep children from talking to strangers, and to limit their interactions to kids roughly their own age. Earlier this month, Roblox continued its global rollout of a facial age-check system, but the results have been mixed at best.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The newest Nielsen ratings have arrived, showing a gigantic drop-off for Fallout Season 2 compared to Fallout Season 1. However, there is an obvious explanation for the dip.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Fallout viewership reached 794 million minutes on Prime Video for the week of December 15-21, which covers when Season 2 debuted on December 16. Season 1 racked up 2.9 billion minutes of streaming time during its own opening week in April 2024. That's a 72% decrease, but the massive downturn was no doubt attributable to how the two seasons were released.          Season 1, many may recall, was released in a binge format with all episodes arriving at the same time. Season 2, meanwhile, is adopting a weekly release schedule. What's more, just one episode of Fallout Season 2 was released on December 16, compared to two or three that Prime Video does for some of its other shows.Given all this, it only makes sense that Fallout Season 1 would have significantly higher viewership statistics compared to Season 2.According to the Nielsen data--which combines multiple seasons in its ranking reports-- 54% of Fallout streaming minutes on Prime Video for the December 15-21 week were from Season 2, making up about 429 million minutes. The rest came from viewership of Season 1.Fallout Season 2 just recently aired its fifth episode, with three more to come each Wednesday until Season 2 wraps on February 4. A third season will follow sometime later and could start filming sooner than expected.For more, check out GameSpot's breakdown of Fallout Season 2, Episode 5.Beyond the TV series, Bethesda is rumored to be at work on remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, along with the brand-new game Fallout 5.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

But if you were hoping to catch a fresh glimpse at The Witcher 4 at the ceremony than you're going to be disappointed. CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has confirmed that the company isn't bringing any new to The Game Awards this year.\"We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year,\" wrote Nowakowski on X, as spotted by VGC. But we're, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry's great night alongside all of you.\"I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards.

The most recent look at the game was shared during State of Unreal in June. However, CDPR later explained that it was a tech demo set in The Witcher 4 rather than the actual game. The dev team has also noted that the upcoming game is being developed with a console-first approach.Earlier this week, CD Projekt Red disclosed that Cyberpunk 2077 has passed 35 million sales faster than The Witcher 3. Cyberpunk 2 is currently being developed the company alongside a remake of the original Witcher, and a game produced in partnership with Saudi Arabia.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Schedule 1 is one of this year's biggest surprise hits among the indie crowd, especially since it's a life-sim game about building up your own drug empire. But if the game's subject matter kept it from being sold on Steam, Schedule 1 creator Tyler was going to pivot and make into a farming sim.\"Early during development, I had a plan where, if Steam wouldn't take it for whatever reason, I could just pivot it to be a farming game,\" Tyler told GamesRadar. \"Just strip all the drug stuff out, make it a farming game--but thankfully, it was all right.\"Tyler went on to note that a few other countries \"don't love it,\" including his native Australia.\"We were effectively banned in Australia, which kind of sucked, but we got it there in the end,\" recalled Tyler.Schedule 1 may remind some players of Breaking Bad, as the main character moves into a new city and slowly begins to expand their drug dealing operations. Players can grow cannabis in the game, but only in support of selling and distributing it. It's also possible to cook meth while avoiding unwanted attention from the police and rival dealers.Although the game is still in early access, Schedule 1 recently added cartel wars to its features. TVGS has also invited players to vote about which feature will be added to the game next.The impact of not getting Steam approval was recently shown when the developers of Horses shared a message about the studio's potential closure because of that decision and their inability to make an appeal to Valve.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The 435-piece Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile is on sale for only $38.49 (was $60). This deal is especially notable because Lego is retiring this Batman building set soon.And if you'd like the perfect background noise while piecing together the Batmobile, the Blu-ray box set collecting all 85 episodes is on sale for only $28.49 for Black Friday.                                 Lego DC Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile (435 Pieces)                                                                $38.49 (was $60) | Retiring Soon                                                                                                                                                                                    Lego released this particular Batmobile last June alongside a few other sets, including the Batman Mech Armor that's also featured in Amazon's Black Friday Lego sale.The set is technically called Batman with the Batmobile vs. Harley Quinn and Mr. Freeze, so it won't surprise you that it comes with those three characters as minifigures. Harley Quinn wields a comically large hammer, while Mr. Freeze has a functional stud launcher. The Batman minifigure is based on his look in the show and has a molded cape.The Batmobile is over 11 inches long and has removable stud launchers, a seat for one minifigure that is accessed by lifting the cockpit hatch. A detachable exhaust flame element twirls when the wheels spin.It has everything that makes a Batmobile Lego model a playset for young Caped Crusader fans--it's recommended for builders ages 8 and up--but it doubles as a nice display piece thanks to the included 360-degree rotatable stand and information placard that's more commonly seen with Lego models designed for adults.

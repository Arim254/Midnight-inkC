    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Blair Marnell\n   on January 14, 2026 at 2:22PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The story of this year's best-selling PlayStation titles on two continents was all about the sports. With the Call of Duty franchise having an off year with Black Ops 7, sports titles took the top spots in PlayStation Store's American/Canadian and European PlayStation 5 downloads.NBA 2K26 was No. 1 in America and Canada, while EA Sports FC 26 claimed the top spot in Europe. It was previously clear that Black Ops 7 would have a hard time repeating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's chart-topping performance in 2024. But the latest Call of Duty installment fell to No. 7 in America/Canada and Europe. By contrast, Battlefield 6 performed very well in both territories, with a No. 2 finish in North America and a fifth place slot in Europe. Through the end of November 2025, Circana had Battlefield 6 as the best-selling game of the year. But this particular list is only for PlayStation Store downloads and it doesn't count sales on other consoles or PC.The lists contained some returning favorites like Minecraft and Helldivers 2, but newcomers like Arc Raiders, Ghost of Yotei, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made the cut in North America as well.Among PlayStation 4 games, Red Dead Redemption 2 claimed No. 1 in both territories. Rockstar Games' 2018 open-world western has remained remarkably resilient, as has Grand Theft Auto 5, which placed highly on both the PS5 and PS4 lists.Beat Saber also claimed the top slots in America/Canada and Europe's PSVR 2 Games charts, and repeated its wins from 2024. Similarly, Fortnite was also a back-to-back winner for free-to-play games in both territories.The complete list of 2025's top games on PlayStation Store can be found below.PS5 GamesUnited States/CanadaNBA 2K26Battlefield 6Grand Theft Auto 5EA Sports College Football 26EA Sports Madden NFL 26MinecraftCall of Duty: Black Ops 7Arc RaidersGhost of YōteiMLB The Show 25Call of Duty: Black Ops 6Ready or NotEA Sports FC 26Forza Horizon 5 UFC 5NBA 2K25The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion RemasteredAssassin’s Creed ShadowsClair Obscur: Expedition 33Monster Hunter WildsEA Sports FC 25EuropeEA Sports FC 26Grand Theft Auto 5EA Sports FC 25Forza Horizon 5Battlefield 6MinecraftCall of Duty: Black Ops 7Assassin’s Creed ShadowsArc RaidersClair Obscur: Expedition 33Ghost of YōteiSplit FictionHogwarts LegacyUFC 5Call of Duty: Black Ops 6It Takes TwoReady or NotThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion RemasteredRematchF1 25PS4 GamesUnited States/CanadaRed Dead Redemption 2Star Wars Battlefront 2Batman: Arkham KnightMinecraftGrand Theft Auto 5A Way OutNeed for Speed HeatMortal Kombat XtheHunter: Call of the WildThe ForestGang BeastsCall of Duty: Black Ops 3Kingdom Come: DeliveranceMiddle-earth: Shadow of WarStardew ValleyCall of Duty: Black Ops 6Unravel TwoGod of WarOvercooked! 2Injustice 2EuropeRed Dead Redemption 2A Way OutEA Sports FC 26The ForestEA Sports FC 25Grand Theft Auto 5MinecraftNeed for Speed HeatStar Wars Battlefront 2Batman: Arkham KnightUnravel TwoKingdom Come: DeliveranceBattlefield 5Mortal Kombat XGang BeastsAssassin’s Creed OdysseyHogwarts LegacyBattlefield 4Assassin’s Creed OriginsMiddle-earth: Shadow of WarPSVR 2 GamesUnited States/CanadaBeat SaberAlien: Rogue Incursion VRAmong Us 3D: VRCreed: Rise to Glory – Championship EditionJob SimulatorPavlovMetro AwakeningArizona Sunshine 2The Walking Dead: Saints & SinnersSwordsman VREuropeBeat SaberAlien: Rogue Incursion VRCreed: Rise to Glory – Championship EditionMetro AwakeningJob SimulatorAmong Us 3D: VRHorizon Call of the MountainPavlovSwordsman VRArizona Sunshine 2Free-to-playUnited States/CanadaFortniteRobloxMarvel RivalsCall of Duty: WarzoneBattlefield REDSECRocket LeagueWhere Winds Meet (F2P)Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege X – Free AccessDelta Force (F2P)Fall GuysEuropeFortniteRobloxCall of Duty: WarzoneRocket LeagueBattlefield REDSECMarvel RivalseFootballAsphalt LegendsWhere Winds Meet (F2P)Delta Force (F2P)    \n  \n                      "

Racing and horror are the prevalent themes this month, with titles like Resident Evil Village and Ridge Racer, but for some goofy--and melodramatic--RPG fun, don't sleep on Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.These games will all be available to play, starting January 20. All PS Plus subscribers can also claim new games in January, as Need For Speed Unbound, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper will be available until February 2.Resident Evil Village (PS5, PS4)The follow-up to Resident Evil 7 dialed up the horror to new first-person heights when it was first released several years back. Once again starring protagonist Ethan Winters and his battered hands, Resident Evil Village shifts the survival-horror to a remote European village teeming with brand-new bioweapons, monsters, and one really tall lady. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5, PS4)Evolving the turn-based gameplay introduced in 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth sees new series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga jet to Hawaii to discover the secrets of his past. A game that also serves as a passing of the Yakuza torch, longtime protagonist Kazuma Kiryu lends a helping pair of fists with this grand adventure. Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5, PS4)A vast wilderness of arid deserts and rugged forests await you in Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game, but if you're an optimist, you'll see those obstacles as a puzzle waiting to be solved. With all-terrain vehicles and high-tech tools at your disposal, you'll have to figure out the best way to get from Point A to B as you explore a harsh frontier. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5)Based on the hit movies, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a single-player horror game where you have to survive familial drama, inner fears, and nigh-unkillable space monsters that'll zero in on your location if you make a peep. Darkest Dungeon 2 (PS5, PS4)A combination of roguelike gameplay and road trip action set during apocalyptic times, Darkest Dungeon 2 tasks you with leading a team of flawed heroes into dungeons teeming with all manner of fresh horrors. Not only do you have to keep an eye on your party's physical condition, you also have to help them find redemption on their quest to save the day. The Exit 8 (PS5, PS4)A unique game released several years ago, The Exit 8 has a simple but deviously deceptive setup: stuck in a Japanese underground passageway, you have to look for anomalies as you walk toward the exit. Miss one, and it could spell your end in this game for fans of liminal spaces and unnerving horror.  Art of Rally (PS5, PS4)A rally good game inspired by the golden age of rallying, this stylish gem is an enjoyable romp through stylized environments. Just like the real-life motorsport, you'll compete for gold and glory across dozens of stages spread across the world while mastering each unique car in this top-down racer. A Little to the Left (PS5, PS4)If you enjoy stacking and organizing stuff, then you won't want to miss out on A Little to the Left. The game offers dozens of puzzles, ranging from organizing eggs to arranging batteries into a special compartment, but there's one furry wrinkle to the gameplay in the form of a mischievous cat that's hellbent on causing some chaos. Ridge Racer (PS5, PS4)PS Plus Premium subscription requiredIt's Riiiiiiiidge Raaaaacccceeeer! The first game in the legendary racing game series is coming to PS5 and PS4, and this PS1 classic has been upgraded with several quality-of-life features.     \n  \n                      "

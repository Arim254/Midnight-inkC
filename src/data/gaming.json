    "description": "We had the chance to mess around with the Baldur's Gate 3 voice cast! You've come to know and love their characters over the last few years, so we figured it was time to mix things up a bit: What if Gale tried to voice Lae'zel, or Astarion as Shadowheart, how about Wyll doing...Minsc?  It's as unhinged as it sounds!Big thanks to:Tim DownieDevora WildeNeil NewbonJennifer EnglishTheo Solomonfor having fun with us!",

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Baldur's Gate 3's cast has been widely acclaimed since the game's release, from Neil Newbon's award-winning role as Astarion to Tim Downie (of Paddington fame) as Gale. But how would the characters--no, not the actors--do if they were auditioning for a different role in the game? We thought that sounded like a great idea, so we got some of the fan-favorite cast together and, potentially under duress, had them audition for new roles.\"I'm Gale of Waterdeep, and I am going to be reading for the role of Lae … of Lae'zel,\" Downie said. \"I smell their blood on you, still! I smell your sweat!\"Given that Gale is quite polite and a cat dad, it's tough to imagine him ever having Lae'zel's bloodlust, not to mention her sexual forwardness. That being said, we would very much like an entire game where that is exactly what we get.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Astarion as Shadowheart? BG3 Cast Tries New Roles!\n      \nNeil Newbon's Astarion, meanwhile, read for the role of Shadowheart, with Jennifer English standing by his side and physically forcing him to kneel: Kneel Newbon. Astarion seemed less than thrilled with the situation.\"I am auditioning for the role of Shadowheart, under no duress … of my own free … free will,\" he said, while looking up at English to make sure he hadn't done something wrong.One of the best was Wyll actor Theo Solomon's turn as Minsc--a ranger who, if he were a cat, would definitely be orange.\"No, Boo! The druid did not beat Minsc at arm wrestling! It is not fair match!\" Solomon said. \"And he turned into an Owlbear midway through, and there was grease on the tree stump!\"Boo is, of course, Minsc's \"miniature giant space hamster\" who is definitely not just a regular hamster that gets swapped out every few years when the last one dies.Jennifer English's turn as Astarion and his meme-worthy \"full concentrated power of the sun\" line--which may have been a Megamind Easter egg--just might be our favorite line-reading. Shadowheart, who is not a vampire, also has much less to fear about the sun itself, so her recasting as Astarion might make the game a little easier!Baldur's Gate 3 was GameSpot's GOTY for 2023. Larian Studios has revealed it will not be making a sequel, but IP-owner Hasbro has big plans for future Dungeons & Dragons games.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

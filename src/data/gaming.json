    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                As 2025 winds down, the new biggest potential acquisitions of the year appear to be the $55 billion deal for EA by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and other investors and the more recent proposed $82 billion agreement for Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Studios. Now, a new report suggests that Netflix once considered buying EA and two other movie studios before the Warner Bros. negotiations came together.According to Bloomberg, Netflix executives previously debated whether the streamer should place bids for EA, Fox, and Disney. However, the management team reportedly couldn't agree on a deal and feared that its interest in those companies would hurt its standing with investors.The report doesn't include the details about when Netflix considered these acquisitions, especially since Disney is usually the company that buys other studios including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Disney purchased Fox's entertainment assets in 2019 following an extended approval process from government agencies around the world.Neither the Warner Bros. nor the EA deals are guaranteed to go forward, since both of them have to win regulatory approval after facing heavy scrutiny. Both, however, have major implications for the video game industry. If the EA deal is completed, Saudi Arabia's PIF will reportedly gain majority control of the company. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have raised their concerns about \"foreign influence\" on EA. In a regulatory filling last month, EA claimed it would retain creative control of the company.As for Netflix and Warner Bros., the deal would leave the former in charge of the Mortal Kombat, Batman, and Harry Potter video game franchises. The streamer demonstrated greater ambition for the gaming industry until 2024, when it shut down a AAA multiplayer shooter from a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten. In October, Boss Fight--the studio behind Netflix's Squid Game: Unleashed mobile game--was closed by the streamer.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise.\"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close,\" Harada wrote in an online post. \"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision.\"I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.My roots lie…  — Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) December 8, 2025              Harada added that he'd been gradually preparing the Tekken team for his departure, and he was grateful to have worked on the series and on several other games, such as Pokken Tournament and SoulCalibur. While Harada is leaving Bandai Namco, he mentioned he would share his next steps at a later date. In a separate post, Bandai Namco said it remains committed to future development and content for Tekken 8 and expressed gratitude to Harada for his decades of work.Despite a strong launch and 3 million sales in its first year, Tekken 8 has faced an uphill struggle throughout 2025. Longtime fans have received recent gameplay updates, and character changes have been poorly received. Many players have also criticized the game's microtransaction system.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

While it's still unclear what exactly the statue is promoting, CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski has confirmed that it's not Lords of the Fallen 2.When the statue was first revealed, the most popular guesses for what it was marketing included Diablo, a new God Of War title, Elder Scrolls 6, or Lords of the Fallen 2. Tyminski posted about the monolith on X to confirm that it was not the latter, saying he was \"flattered\" people thought the stunt might have come from CI Games, but his studio is not at that level just yet.Flattered so many think we’re behind that statue 😅 Can confirm it’s not us, we’re just as hyped as you are.

We'll find out either way when The Game Awards airs later this week.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

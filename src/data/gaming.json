    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 21, 2025 at 3:10PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Fortnite's collaboration with the Netflix series Stranger Things gets its biggest drop yet this weekend with five new skins in the item shop and a branded takeover of the Blitz Royale mode.Blitz Royale, which has quick, five-minute rounds of battle royale on a tiny island, got an entirely new map on November 21. The new island features four named locations based on the town of Hawkins, Indiana, as well as a border right down the middle separating the normal world from locations that have been corrupted by the Upside Down--essentially giving the map a pair of distinct biomes, something that Blitz hasn't done before since its map is already so little.The map and the new item shop skins based on Vecna and the original four boys are the entirety of this takeover--there aren't any new Stranger Things weapons added to the loot pool or anything like that. That's fine, because between the ongoing Simpsons season and the imminent launch of Chapter 7, we've already got plenty of new mechanics to worry about.Scroll on for looks at the full new map and each of the named locations.As you can see, the island is split in half between the regular part in the west and the Upside Down part in the east, with each half getting two of the major locations. While the Upside Down half is always dark and spooky, the normal half of the island has the usual day/night cycle.Gnarly FarmsStranger SuburbsLibrary LandingHawkins HeightsHawkins Heights includes this movie theater sign and marquee teasing the Chapter 6 finale event that's taking place on Saturday, November 29. Fun fact: Despite the sign indicating otherwise, there's no movie theater on this map.    \n  \n                      "

Catan first launched in 1995, with each new edition slightly tweaking its appearance and gameplay. The fifth edition in 2015 marked a big change for the brand, as it moved from “The Settlers of Catan” to simply “Catan.” This new sixth edition doesn’t do anything quite so radical, but it does offer a more inclusive adventure and an improved eco-friendly design.Here’s a look at everything that’s changed:Updated graphics: You’ll now find brighter artwork and modern designs that make the game easier to parse. This also includes new character illustrations with greater diversity.Premium, eco-friendly components: Components are crafted with less plastic and an eye for sustainability. You’ll also find new textured hex tiles and updated card trays that make it easier to stay organized.Smart storage: The 5-6 Player Extension Pack contents can now fit inside the base game box, so you can more easily transport all your pieces.Improved rulebook: While the rules are the same, the rulebook has been updated with clearer graphics and gameplay examples, helping new players learn the basics.If you own other Catan expansions, you should be able to use them with the new 6th Edition. The rules remain the same across all editions, but you’ll have to deal with conflicting art styles.

What was meant to be the definitive version of the game launched with numerous bugs and other issues that sparked a backlash against Fallout 4. Now, Bethesda is releasing an update for November and looking ahead to a December update as well.Bethesda shared the patch notes on social media. The message didn't directly address the negative response to Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, but it did thank players for their \"continued communication with us on your current Fallout 4 experience.\" The dev team notes that it's focused on DLC installation issues, occasional crashing, and general user experience in the patch.The team added that it still plans to add a mod storage expansion on Fallout 4's console versions. However, the devs state that more time is needed before that feature is ready to be released. Beyond that, the team promised to share details about the December patch in a few weeks.Additionally, the devs promised \"several free Fallout 4 Creations coming to players,\" including the first one, The Varmint Rifle. To get that one when it arrives next week, players will have to fall down a manhole before they discover the unique rifle, solve a series of puzzles, and fight their way out of enemy territory.The release date for Fallout 4's November patch hasn't been announced yet.

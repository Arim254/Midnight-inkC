    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Roguelite is one of the hottest subgenres in gaming right now. From Balatro to Drop Duchy, developers have integrated cyclical mechanics into all sorts of other genres. Independent studios eSolu and Team Mojo Games are adding another game to the subgenre with Odds Chronicles.Odds Chronicles combines grid-based combat, a roguelite run structure, and dice mechanics to create its overall package. Each roll of the dice will give your team different resources, including attributes like strength and magic.Dice-based roguelites and roguelikes, including standouts like Dicey Dungeons, have been around for some time, but new takes on rolling the dice are welcome. Bringing dice mechanics into a turn-based grid tactics game is a nice way to build off the SOCOM-like percentages that decide whether or not you'll land your attacks.          We don't have much to go on besides the reveal trailer, but the gameplay and visuals look polished enough to make Odds Chronicles stand out among a sea of other roguelites. The tactical roguelite will launch on Steam and Epic Games Store in 2026, with versions for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S arriving later.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                There are a lot of questions about the future of Xbox as a brand, when games like The Outer Worlds 2 and even its signature shooter, Halo, is coming to PlayStation 5. Microsoft is reportedly working on the next generation of Xbox, but the outlook doesn't look promising. However, Xbox's perceived decline doesn't mean that consoles are dead, according a prominent video game analyst.Rhys Elliott's Alinea Insight newsletter has shared the estimated sales for PlayStation 5 games in October 2025, and the two big winners were Battlefield 6, EA Sports FC 26, and Ghost of Yotei, with 3.2 million, 3 million, and 2.7 million in sales, respectively. The trio's nearly combined 9 million in sales led Elliott to remark, \"AAA games, live services, and single-player alike, are still thriving on console. The 'CoNsOlE iS DeAd' narrative is getting annoying. Xbox as a console is dying, yes. But let's not extrapolate that too far, eh?\"Publishing Xbox games on PlayStation 5 has already paid dividends for Microsoft. Several of Microsoft's formerly exclusive titles dominated the PlayStation sales charts earlier this year.Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto 5 both placed in the top 10, at fourth and seventh, respectively. That's thanks in part to a continuous flow of new content via Minecraft expansions and GTA Online. Additionally, EA Sports took three of the top 10 slots between FC 26, FC 25, and Madden NFL 26. Take-Two's NBA 2K26 took the fifth slot with 564,000 copies sold for the month.Alinea Insight's top 10 best-selling PS5 games for October 2025 and their estimated sales are reproduced below.Battlefield 6 - 3.2 millionEA Sports FC 26 - 3.0 millionGhost of Yotei - 2.7 millionMinecraft - 635,000NBA 2K26 - 564,000EA FC 25 - 350,000Grand Theft Auto 5 - 338,000EA Madden NFL 26 - 261,000Little Nightmares 3 - 245,000Digimon Story: Time Stranger - 241,000\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Billy Givens\n   on November 4, 2025 at 1:07PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Like many live-service games, Arc Raiders provides players with a battle pass to complete to obtain a variety of unique cosmetics, currencies, and one-time-use resources that can help with a raid. These are designed to be worked on over time and will take most players a few weeks to wrap up, with some being permanent and others only being available for a limited time.At launch, players can work on the Raider Deck AR/RD 001, which is focused on the Ryder and Voyager outfits. In addition to the outfits, unlockables include outfit variants, hairstyles, face styles, emotes, and more. You can even earn 500 Raider Tokens (premium currency) by completing the entire deck, which can be used to purchase cosmetics from the in-game shop.To unlock these rewards, you'll need to work on feats during your raids, which ask you to perform tasks while journeying throughout the topside. These include tasks like defeating a particular enemy type, dealing damage with certain ammo types, or finding particular loot. Note that feats are specific to decks and are therefore separate from the game's core quests.Completing a feat will reward you with 10 Creds to be used toward unlocking one of the deck items. While you can have three available feats at a time, you'll also get daily bonuses from completing a certain number of decks. These will reset every 24 hours, so you'll want to hop in and knock out at least five feats per day when possible to get the max amount of bonus Creds to use toward finishing the deck.Here's everything you can earn from Raider Deck AR/RD 001.Ryder (Outfit)Voyager (Outfit)Dirt Spray (Face Style)Mayhem PackRecorder x3Noise Maker x5Remote Raider Flare x5Smoke Grenade x3Blue Light Stick x3Green Light Stick x3Red Light Stick x3Scout PackBinoculars x3Tagging Grenade x5Zipline x3Yellow Light Stick x5Fuel Canister (Backpack Attachment)Raider Tokens x50Arc Hunter PackTactical Mk. 2 x1Lure Grenade x3Wolfpack x1Ryder (Outfit Variant)Ryder (Outfit Color)Voyager (Outfit Color)Improvisation PackFlame Spray x3Blaze Grenade Trap x3Gas Grenade Trap x3Herbal Bandage x5Raider Tokens x50Voyager (Outfit Variant)Ryder (Outfit Color)Voyager (Outfit Color)Bandaid Cheek (Face Style)Protection PackLooting Mk. 2 x2Door Blocker x5Noisemaker x5Explosive Mine x3Jolt Mine x5Ninja PackSnap Hook x1Li'l Smoke Grenade x5Scout Ahead (Emote)Raider Tokens x50Hiker (Backpack)Voyager (Outfit Variant)Medic PackTactical Mk. 3 (Healing) x1Defibrillator x3Vita Spray x3Surge Shield Recharger x3Receding (Hair)Voyager (Outfit Color)Raider Tokens x50Squat (Emote)Archeologist Backpack (Backpack)Ryder (Outfit Variant)Raider Tokens x50Mullet (Hair)Ryder (Outfit Color)Gas Canister (Backpack Attachment)Keyholder PackLooting Mk. 3 (Survivor) x2Raider Hatch Key x2Buried City Town Hall Key x1Dam Staff Room Key x1Spaceport Container Storage Key x1Raider Tokens x250    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Mark Delaney\n   on October 27, 2025 at 2:55PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Horror is my everything. You'll rarely catch me at a time in my life when I'm not reading, watching, or playing something in the genre. If you can relate, then you surely also love the Halloween season, because it's a time when so many others try to match your vibe, if only for a few weeks. Even for folks too scared to play horror games themselves, many like to watch others play them on Twitch. During the Halloween season, Twitch itself gets in on the action with its annual Fright Fest, which is back for 2025. You can read about everything going on in Twitch Fright Fest 2025 on the official website.With all that in mind, we've put together a list of the six best horror games to watch or stream on Twitch. Whether you are hosting the playthrough for your viewers or letting someone else do the dirty work of facing down the terrors that pursue them, below you'll find a half-dozen scary games that fit snugly in the Twitch world, for both creators and their audiences.For even more horror content, don't miss our lists of the best multiplayer horror games, the best gateway horror games (for genre newcomers), and, of course, the best horror games in general.Silent Hill FPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Silent Hill f is both the newest game on this list and part of the oldest series mentioned herein. Dating back to 1999, Silent Hill has been a household name in horror games for decades. The series once seemed unlikely to ever return, after going quiet following the cancellation of Silent Hills in 2014. But it has since roared back with an incredible remake of Silent Hill 2 last year, followed by this fresh take on the series that moves it out of small-town America to 1960s Japan, which really lets it explore new themes and aesthetics. This is a great streaming pick because the story actually takes multiple playthroughs to fully resolve, so playing this one takes on the vibe of appointment viewing for anyone in your chat looking to piece the tale together.The Outlast TrialsPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Fresh off a major update, The Outlast Trials remains one of my favorite multiplayer horror games. For nearly two years, this was a four-player co-op take on the traditional Outlast formula (running from massive, often naked, killers brandishing sharp objects). It did its duty quite well in that regard, but the recent Invasion update adds a PvP twist to the game, letting you invade the ongoing missions of other teams, turning it into a blood-soaked 4v4 game of deception and stalking. Plus, earlier this year, the team at Red Barrels graciously added a nudity filter to make the game more streamer-friendly. Now the only things you'll see swinging are axes and knives.Hunt: Showdown 1896Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5The way I've long described Hunt: Showdown 1896 is \"a game I love despite being bad at it.\" It's an extraction shooter set in a horror-western world with some of the best character and environmental artwork you'll find, whether you're comparing it to multiplayer games or horror games. It's a standout in either bucket. It can be intimidating, but if you're worried about being bad, don't sweat it. Watching good players play Hunt on stream has helped me immensely. Generally, I find this is always a helpful tip with multiplayer games you're trying to break into: Just watch the game's community tackle it live in front of you.PhasmophobiaPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Phasmophobia first exploded onto the scene in 2020 during the first Halloween in the COVID era. It was a great alternative for the many people who felt the effects of a stranger-than-usual Halloween that fall. But it has persisted as a major multiplayer horror hit since then, and today it remains one of the most beloved multiplayer horror games to stream or watch. Each round sends up to four players into a haunted house, school, prison, or other locale where one of 24 different types of ghosts have taken up residence. It's the players' job to identify the type of ghost and escape with everyone still alive in the end. The mix of laughter and terror in Phasmophobia is nearly unrivaled, and the game is moving through early access and adding new things all the time.REPOPlatforms: PC We say Phasmophobia is nearly unrivaled, because REPO sure does a great job of offering something a bit similar. More closely linked to Lethal Company in its gameplay loop, REPO sends four goofy little capsule-looking characters into haunted spaces, where they must remove valuables and turn them in for a profit. The game's physics system combines with a laundry list of different monsters with their own habits and abilities, which gives each round a level of unpredictability that makes REPO an obvious candidate for the best horror games on Twitch. This game went viral in early 2025 and with a big Halloween update just about to drop, you can expect another surge in players and viewers soon.Amnesia: The BunkerPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5 Each Amnesia game is at least quite good in its own right, but for streamers, The Bunker is the best of them. That's because its unscripted monster roams the dark corridors of a World War I bunker, hunting for you out while you're tucked into a cupboard or tiptoeing to the safe room, trying not to make a sound. Each time you play the game, vital quest items change their locations, so every run is different. That kind of variety makes for a great streaming candidate, which is only enhanced by just how scary and atmospheric it all is. Whether you're playing for a speedrun, a no-damage run, or maybe just trying to stir the monster into a frenzy, there are a lot of ways to approach this one for your next stream.    \n  \n                      "

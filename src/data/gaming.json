That's because it's the first of them to take place on a completely new and original island. While the other November mini-seasons took place on updated versions of old maps, and Star Wars season just added Star Wars places to the Battle Royale map, Simpsons season is introducing a totally new, cel-shaded island based on Springfield and various iconic locations from the series for us to fight over in November.At least one sacrifice was made to make this map happen. This island is a little bit smaller than the current Battle Royale map, and as a result, it uses a smaller player cap than usual at 80 players instead of 100. But that's not necessarily the worst thing, as the smaller island should mean faster and more exciting rounds, and also they might be able to keep it around as a Reload map after the season ends, which would make all this effort a little more worthwhile.The new island includes nine major, named locations, like the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and it's filled with gimmicks, like how each round will have one randomly activated event that players can race to complete for great loot. These are the new map spots:Springfield Nuclear Power PlantCletus' Corn HoleKamp KrustyBurns ManorSpringfield Town SquareMayor's MunchiesDonut DistrictEvergreen TerraceSpringfield SlurpworksAs you can see, Epic essentially broke Springfield up into several smaller pieces and spread them around. I shudder to think of how many Easter Eggs this map must be filled with. Scroll on for closer looks at some of the major locations and landmarks you'll find around the map. And before you ask--yes, these are all actual Fortnite screenshots.    \n  \n                      "

Finally, though, the time has come, and The Simpsons season is starting on the evening of Saturday, November 1. And it's one of the biggest Fortnite takeovers we've ever seen, with a Simpsons-themed battle pass, and entirely new cel-shaded map for Battle Royale, and a totally revamped loot pool--all for a season that lasts just a month.So, yeah, there's a lot going on here. Let's run through everything we know about so far--which is a lot, because Epic let a bunch of influencers play the new season and they've been sharing their content. Just keep in mind there's likely to be plenty of surprises in store as the season goes on.Fortnite x Simpsons battle passThis Simpsons-themed battle pass, which lasts for just a month, includes five skins. Three of them are Simpsons characters--Homer, Marge, and Ned Flanders--with the other two being Simpsons-fied versions of Fortnite characters Peely and Fishstick. Each of the skins has alternate styles, like Evil Homer and Witch Marge. The new Peely is the time-gated bonus skin--all the Simpsons characters are in the linear part of the pass. You can check out the full battle pass lineup here.While it's smaller than a normal battle pass, the Simpsons pass still costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and you can also unlock it by subscribing to Fortnite Crew.Fortnite x Simpsons new mapThe Chapter 6 island is gone, and it's been replaced with a slightly smaller map based on Springfield, the hometown of the Simpsons, which has a capacity of 80 players--down from the usual 100. The whole map is cel-shaded and full of well-known locations from the show, like Moe's Tavern, the Qwik-E-Mart, and the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. For some close-up looks at the new map, check out our gallery here.New Fortnite x Simpsons loot poolWith a couple of notable exceptions, the weapons making up this season's arsenal are existing Fortnite guns, while you take care of your health and shield needs with a pile of new Simpsons-themed items.The new Simpsons weapon is Mr. Blasty, a revolver with an exotic variant that attaches balloons to anyone you shoot with it. There's also the mythic Jebediah's Protective Helm, which protects you from a single headshot from any weapon.And there are a variety of healing items, some of which come with fun bonus effects--like how the Super Squishee makes you faster and gives you unlimited sprint, and eating a Blinky fish gives you temporary teleportation powers. There are more mundane healing items too, like Duff splashes and Krusty Burgers.Returning Fortnite weapons:Suppressed assault rifleStriker ARTactical ShotgunThunder ShotgunRanger ShotgunCompact SMGInfantry RifleSuppressed PistolShockwave GrenadesSidekicksStarting during the Simpsons season, you'll be able to buy little companions who will follow you around and emote sometimes. The first of these is Peels, a banana dog included in the Simpsons pass, and several others are slated to hit the item shop on November 7. No collab sidekicks have been announced yet, but some are surely on the way.But sidekicks have already inspired a lot of consternation amongst players, because you'll only be allowed to customize your sidekick's appearance once before locking it permanently. If you'd like to change, for example, your Raptor's scale color later, you'll have to buy it again. And judging by the rumored prices, doing so won't be cheap.Easter eggs and hidden gagsAs you'd expect from a season in which the map is made up entirely of Simpsons locations, there are easter eggs everywhere, like the funny messages on the battle bus, or how your whole squad can sit on the Simpson family couch together. Some of these gags come in the form of quests and events--like how the nuclear plant melts down when the storm closes on it, prompting you to try to fix it.Free stuffWe're starting Simpsons season with three new free items. The Kang and Kodos glider (pictured) is the new reward for linking your Epic Games and MyDisney accounts, replacing the First Order Stomtrooper they'd been giving away since May. If your accounts are already connected, the glider will be granted automatically without any action from you. The other item is the The Siiimpsooooons… wrap, which will be available as a Twitch drop for just the first two days of the season (November 1 and 2), after which it may be added to the item shop.Meanwhile, simply logging in during launch weekend will grant you the Fuel Rod and Tongs pickaxe. And, as you'd expect, there is also a free umbrella glider, the Safety Inspector 'Brella, which you can earn by winning a round of Battle Royale during Simpsons season.Fortnite-themed Simpsons episodesEach week of Simpsons season will add a new short Simpsons episode related to the game's ongoing storyline, in which Homer finds a piece of the Zero Point and uses it in stupid, irresponsible ways, like attaching it to his remote control. The first of these shorts was shown during the Season 4 finale event, and you can watch it here. Further shorts will drop on November 10, November 17, and November 24.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 1, 2025 at 12:55PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                A new season of Fortnite means it's time to refresh the loot pool, and the fact that this new season is Simpsons-flavored means we're getting more of an overhaul than usual. It's similar to the situation back in May when Star Wars season replaced all the Fortnite guns with Star Wars blasters, but since The Simpsons is a sitcom and not a movie franchise about wars, Epic is going about things a little differently, by replacing most of the health and shield items with Simpsons food and drinks, while unvaulting a bunch of Fortnite weapons that have not been in the Battle Royale loot pool in a while.But there are at least a couple of Simpsons-themed weapons, even so. To start the season, we'll have the Mr. Blasty revolver, with an exotic variant that drops from the roaming Krusty the Clown boss NPC. Later on, we're expecting to see some other wacky Simpsons weapons, including Moe's absurd combo gun, the Deodorant Applicator, and the Makeup Gun, though none of those are confirmed yet.As I previously teased, The Simpsons season also includes a number of health and shield consumables that are based on stuff from the Simpsons, like Super Squishees and Krusty Burgers. Scroll on to learn more about the new items in the Simpsons season loot pool, as well as a rundown on the Fortnite guns you'll have at your disposal this season.Super SquisheeThis frosty beverage increases your health and/or shields and gives you an improved Slap effect, which makes you run fast, gives you unlimited sprint, and makes you glow.Blinky FishThe Blinky Fish provides health and grants a dash ability for a short period of time after you eat one.Mr. BlastyWe'll start the season with the highly accurate Mr. Blasty revolver, which has impressive range for a snub-nosed pistol. There's also an exotic version, which attaches balloons to the people you shoot with it, that drops from the Krusty the Clown boss.Jebediah's Protective HelmYou can steal this item--which grants complete protection from a single headshot, after which it falls off your head--from the statue of Springfield's founder, Jebediah Springfield, which is found in the Springfield Town Square.Krusty BurgerThe most unhealthy burger in the world grants, ironically, both health and shield regeneration when eaten.Returning weaponsThe returning arsenal of Fortnite weapons is relatively small, with two assault rifles (including a modless version of the well-liked Striker AR from Chapter 5, pictured) three shotguns, two SMGs/auto pistols, and one scopeless sniper. Epic referred to this as a \"back-to-basics\" loot pool, which sounds about right. Though, of course, the loot pool will get a lot more complicated as they add goofy Simpsons weapons over the course of the season. Meanwhile, Shockwave Grenades will once again be this season's staple movement item. You can check out the rest of the existing Fortnite guns in the new loot pool below.Suppressed Assault RifleCompact SMGTactical ShotgunThunder ShotgunRanger ShotgunInfantry RifleSuppressed Pistol    \n  \n                      "

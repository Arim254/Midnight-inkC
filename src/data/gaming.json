Most notably, it has a thorough section on the ever-changing Chalice Dungeons to help you unlock some of the game's best weapons and loot. You can also use the guidebook as a reference manual, as it contains a full bestiary with in-depth analysis on the monsters who want to keep you in the nightmare.

This physical edition bundle is only releasing for PS5--which isn't surprising, given Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is currently only available on PS5 and PC--but it looks to be a convenient way to grab the first two entries in the planned remake trilogy on Sony's console. Preorders for the Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and Rebirth Twin Pack first went live at Square Enix's online store, but are now also available at Amazon.It's worth noting you can still find Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade for $40 and Rebirth for $50 at Amazon. Obviously, the Twin Pack is a much more affordable option, but buying the standalone versions is worth it if you can't wait any longer to dive in. The standalone version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth also comes with an Amazon-exclusive DualSense controller skin, featuring both Cloud and Sephiroth.While the dual pack is PS5-exclusive, Switch 2 and Xbox players will soon be able to kick off the trilogy when Final Fanasy VII Remake Intergrade finally launches on both platforms early next year. The physical Switch 2 edition launches January 22, 2026, and includes a bunch of early bird bonuses if you preorder, including a booster pack from the Final Fantasy-themed Magic: The Gathering set that released earlier this year (and has become much harder to track down). Check our preorder guide for more information. The digital Xbox Series X|S version also launches January 22, 2026, and Square Enix has confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and the still-untitled third game in the trilogy will also come with Switch 2 and Xbox in the future.Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade - Switch 2 Edition Preorders                                                                                                                                               Final Fantasy fans will also be glad to hear that the HD port of the original PS1 Final Fantasy is finally getting a physical Switch release in North America alongside Final Fantasy VIII Remastered and Final Fantasy IX. The Final Fantasy VII + Final Fantasy VIII Remastered Twin Pack and Final Fantasy IX HD Switch 1 editions both launch for $40 apiece on December 9, just a few days after the new PS5 FFVII Remake Twin Pack.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In side-by-side comparisons, PlayStation 5 games have tended to have an edge over their Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S counterparts. The Outer Worlds 2, however, flips that script by having a better performance on Xbox than either PS5 or PS5 Pro, according to Digital Foundry.          0n the surface, The Outer Worlds 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X look very similar, but a closer examination reveals that the former suffers from image breakup, lower resolution, frame rate drops, and screen tearing even in performance mode. Digital Foundry also noted small lighting downgrades in PS5.As for the PS5 Pro, the report states that it uses Sony's proprietary upscaler, PSSR, which doesn't interact well with The Outer Worlds 2's lumen lighting or RT lighting effects. The report concludes that PS5 Pro's \"frame rate dips and more intense encounters are common, and the general run of play is noticeably worse than Series X in the finished game.\" It goes on to speculate that The Outer Worlds 2 may have utilized some proprietary hardware features in Xbox Series X|S that neither the PS5 nor PS5 Pro have.Obsidian Entertainment recently introduced players to Outer Worlds 2's six companion characters who can't be romanced, before revealing that they can turn on the player if given a compelling reason to do so. The studio also unveiled a Moon Man plushie called a \"Couch-Panion,\" which is the prize for winning a contest running through November 16. Players don't have to rely on a contest to get a pair of limited-edition, customizable Outer Worlds 2 Xbox Wireless Controllers, though. However, both controllers are more expensive than the game's $70 price.GameSpot's review gave The Outer Worlds 2 an 8/10 score and said that it \"feels like the series [is] coming into its own, carried by flexible combat options and great role-playing progression.\"Per the game's launch times, early-access players will get to play The Outer Worlds 2 on October 24. Everyone else will have to wait until October 29 to play it on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. This title will also be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Anyone looking to return to the Olympic Exclusion Zone in the first Pacific Drive story DLC, Whispers in the Woods, are in for a surprise, as the expansion is out right now. In a surprise announcement, developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive revealed that Whispers in the Woods is now available, and the game has also been ported over to Xbox Series X|S consoles.The expansion features a brand-new story and content that Ironwood Studios says is roughly a third of the size of the base game, and it includes new anomalies and horrors to discover.          Players can also experiment with several new gameplay systems, such as the Whispering Tide. This is described as a \"mysterious force that grows more perilous\" the longer you linger in the Whispering Woods, and to survive, you'll need to equip specially attuned parts to your station wagon that can keep it at bay. Artifacts from Altars will also be found in the expansion, and these offer reality-warping powers that affect both the environment and you.Pacific Drive made a lasting impression when it debuted last year, as the Indie survival game blended a well-crafted layer of suspense with a surprisingly chill vibe as you explored a creepy patch of the Pacific Northwest from the relative safety of your station wagon.\"With its wonderful depth in both story and gameplay, Pacific Drive is an early hit in 2024,\" Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's Pacific Drive review. \"It sets out to create a world that fits comfortably in the New Weird genre but brings its own style and substance to it. Though the game can be especially hard to decipher, difficulty options help to counter some of its more overwhelming aspects. I'll stick to bikes in my day-to-day life through the actual northwest, but in Pacific Drive, I'm up for another joy ride through one hell of a winding road.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The newest update for the viral Steam game Escape from Duckov is out now, and it discourages players from eating poop.Up until now, players of the game made by five people that has sold more than 1 million copies could eat poop to restore energy and hydration values. Players can still do that after the new update, but it's less effective to do so. The patch notes state:\"Reduced the Energy and Hydration values provided by Poop.\"          As PC Gamer points out, some players resorted to downing dookie to revitalize their character. The fecal matter is found on the map and can be eaten to restore some energy and hydration levels, at the cost of somewhat poisoning yourself. Apparently this proved to be too successful a tactic, and developer Team Soda made some changes. Players can still craft poop to create a throwable weapon called, wait for it, a Poop Ball.You can see the full patch notes for the Duckov October 23 update below, as Team Soda shared on Steam. Escape from Duckov October 23 patch notesUpdatesOrange Headphones can now be dismantled.Added indicator display when the player is injured.Removed the footstep sound of dogs.Reduced the Energy and Hydration values provided by Poop.Added another construction site in the base to prevent players from getting stuck inside rooms.Slightly reduced the damage of Storm Creatures.In Motion Sickness-Friendly Mode, removed the camera movement when leaving the base.Mad Bombers now have a chance to drop other cellar keys.Reduced the durability consumption of Small Energy Bullets, Enhanced Small Energy Bullets, and Large Energy Bullets.Monster: Storm? now inflicts a “Shatter” effect.FixesFixed lag issues caused by mining machines.Fixed an issue where the Sniper Trial quest requirements do not match its description after the last update.Fixed a bug where the MCXspear blueprint incorrectly appeared in the Recipe Collection even when it was locked.Fixed an issue where the Standard Bullet (MAG) crafting recipe used a deprecated item.Fixed an abnormal amount of ornaments appearing in the sewers.Fixed an issue where weapon attachments were lost when disassembling guns.Guns with Armor Penetration will now display their Penetration Level.We're trying to fix the issue where reloading caused ammo to become “-1.”Analyst Daniel Ahmad reminded people that Duckov was made by a team of five people, which makes the game's success even more impressive. The game is a parody of Escape from Tarkov and published by BiliBili, a Chinese giant also behind titles like Magicraft, Core Keeper, and Warm Snow.Duckov is available now for $15.83 USD, but the price will go up 12% to $18 USD on October 30. It's putting up massive numbers on Steam, where it's reached more than 250,000 concurrent players. The game is also available on the Epic Games Store, but not console.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The South Korean band Stray Kids is coming to Roblox today, and they'll be unleashing the SKZOO from now and through the weekend while promoting their new album, Do It. As seen in the clips below, Stray Kids' anthropomorphic avatars will be performing their songs in-game as virtual concerts.Stray Kids-related items are also hidden in four different Roblox experiences, with two items per game. Players can collect all eight items and bring them to the Block to watch Stray Kids perform and receive additional free items from the band. However, this event will only run until 10 AM PT/1 PM ET on Monday, December 22.In other Roblox-related news, the platform has been banned in Russia and accused of negatively impacting children, and apparently considers the dissemination of LGBTQIA+ content to be a crime. But Russia isn't alone with its accusations that Roblox hasn't done enough to protect kids from child exploitation and grooming. A June 2024 Bloomberg investigation reported that the platform is rampant with predators. More recently, Florida and Texas have sued Roblox over that issue.Last month, Roblox revealed new initiatives to keep children from talking to strangers, and limit their interactions to kids roughly their own age. Roblox CEO David Baszucki has \"categorically rejected\" the lawsuits' depiction of the platform's safety measures. He also said that Roblox has done \"an incredible job at innovating\" and added that it's \"constantly getting better\" at protecting children's ability to chat with each other in-game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Available exclusively on Amazon, cinephiles--or shoppers looking to get something for their dad--can grab the Totally Awesome 80s 4K Blu-ray bundle. The collection, which launched just a few days ago on December 16, includes 4K Blu-ray editions of five acclaimed 1980s films, plus bonus materials and digital streaming copies of each movie. The Totally Awesome 80s bundle in stock and available for $55 at Amazon.

The 4K Blu-ray releases for each film support Dolby Vision, HDR10, and Dolby Atmos audio, and offer their own selection of bonus materials, including new behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, music videos, audio commentary tracks, and more.                      If you've never seen these films, then you've missed out on some of the most influential movies of all time. Top Gun was a blockbuster hit that cemented Tom Cruise's stardom, combining incredible aerial photography and action set against some of the era's chart-topping pop and rock songs. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, one of John Hughes' best films, follows Bueller (Mathew Broderick), his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara), and his best bud Cameron (Alan Ruck) as they take an unscheduled break from school. The Untouchables is a ruthless turn-of-the-century gangster movie with an all-star cast, while Trading Places saw John Landis put his own spin on Wall Street, and Beverly Hills Cop is a breakout action-comedy hit that made Eddie Murphy a household name.Lots more vintage movie Blu-rays are currently on sale, if you're hunting for easy stocking-stuffers.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Josh Broadwell\n   on December 19, 2025 at 9:56PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The need for the best Cyberpunk 2077 mods to fix some of the ambitious RPG's bigger issues has changed dramatically in the years since developer CD Projekt Red launched the game in a messy, buggy state. Cars handle less wildly, criminal activity is more tense and dangerous, and things generally just work the way they should.That doesn't mean they can't work even better, though. Cyberpunk 2077's mod scene is still vibrant, with imaginative creators putting out new CyberDecks, overhauling V's apartment, letting you actually unlock and use every perk, and giving extensive control over photo mode and the kinds of scenes you can create. We've rounded up 22 of the best ones, and we've noted which work with Phantom Liberty and are up-to-date with Cyberpunk 2077's latest version.Like with most mods, these only work for Cyberpunk 2077 on PC. If you're after some console fun instead, check out our picks for the best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X|S games to play in 2025.New Level CapCreator: DeepVisionDownload link: NexusModsCyberpunk 2077's existing level cap makes it impossible to learn every perk. The idea is to encourage specialization, as you build toward a specific playstyle, and you can just play again if you want to try others after using your once-per-character respec. That'd be fine--in a world with infinite free time. New Level Cap raises Cyberpunk 2077's cap from 60 to 80, which gives you enough points to unlock and master every perk in the game. There's also a feature that lets you customize stat caps for a more tailored experience.They Will RememberCreator: Eris404Download link: NexusModsNight City's a big place with lots of faces, but when someone makes as much of a ruckus (as V inevitably does wherever they go), you'd expect them to stick out a bit. Gangs whose territory V trespasses on always forget who they are, though. They Will Remember doesn't just fix that by letting gangs remember V and bear grudges. It adds an entire reputation system. Get on the Tyger Claws' bad side? Probably best to stay out of Japan Town for a while. They Will Remember adds a disguise system, where V can try to hide their face and other identifying attributes to avoid hostilities, and a relationship network where some factions become hostile based on how close they think you are with a rival.Night City AliveCreator: KataneDownload link: NexusModsThey Will Remember is already one of the best Cyberpunk 2077 mods for immersion, but Night City Alive makes it even better. It's a fantastic addition on its own as well. True to its name, this one makes Night City feel more alive by increasing how reactive everyone in it is. Gangs commit crimes in public and, if you have They Will Remember You installed, might track you down to pick a fight. The police are aware of your gang affiliations--though it doesn't add police chases--and members of the public are more reactive to what you do around them, so break the law at your own risk. You'll also see motorcycles in traffic more often, which, depending on your driving skills, may be a boon or a curse.Realistic MapCreator: SvenVHDownload link: NexusModsCyberpunk 2077's default map gets bonus points for how thematically fitting it is, with its high-tech, futuristic appearance. It's an absolute nightmare to navigate, though. Even for the more directionally gifted players, the map gives little indication for changes in elevation, nearby landmarks, or other factors that make identifying locations easy. Realistic Map replaces the standard one with a high-resolution scan of the city, the kind you'd expect from Google Satellite, and it makes understanding the layout of Night City and the surrounding area so much easier.There's a recent conflict between this mod and an update for 50xx series Nvidia cards. You may need to roll back your drivers to an earlier version if the mod doesn't work for you. It also conflicts with the Preem Map mod, so make sure the latter is turned off.Native Settings UI and Side Menu Add-OnCreator: anygoodnameDownload link: NexusModsNative Settings UI is an essential Cyberpunk 2077 mod if you use other mods. It adds sliders, toggles, and other settings-related adjustments to the in-game menu for your other mods under a new \"mods section,\" so you don't have to mess with the mod files to make any alterations. The Side Menu Add-On mod that creator anygoodname made to go with it does one even better. It adds a list of active mods on the menu's left side, which makes organizing and finding what you need much easier, and you can navigate to and adjust them at any time. You need Cyber Engine Tweaks and Archive-XL for the base mod to work, and, of course, you need the base mod for the Side Menu Add-On to function.Cyberpunk 2077 HD ReworkedCreator: Halk Hogan PLDownload link: NexusModsCyberpunk 2077 HD Reworked is the Cyberpunk version of The Witcher 3 Reworked and comes from the same modder. It enhances the game's textures, everything from blurry stonework to poorly defined graffiti and even puddle borders and tree bark. It does this mostly without placing excessive additional load requirements on your computer, too, though if you use the \"Ultra Quality\" version for 4K-capable devices, it may use more VRAM than the base game requires. Creator HalkHogan also published a \"Balanced\" version that uses less VRAM, though is also a slightly lower quality compared to the 4K version. They said anyone who can run the base game on their computer can also run the \"Balanced\" mod without any noticeable changes in performance. HD Reworked applies to the base game and Phantom Liberty.Preem ScopesCreator: CyanideXDownload link: NexusModsScoped weapons are a bit of a pain to deal with in Cyberpunk 2077, but this mod sands off most of the rough edges. Preem Scopes removes the green and gray tints from most scopes, so you can actually see what you're trying to aim at. It takes out scan lines, glitches, and other elements that impede your vision, and it deletes 3D HUD effects, making some of Cyberpunk's best weapons even better.Use Your Cybernetic EyesCreator: CDPR and meDownload link: NexusModsAnother useful Cyberpunk 2077 mod for aiming is Use Your Cybernetic Eyes. It lets V zoom in while aiming with any weapon, even one that just has iron sights. You get two stages of zoom, and the result is a much higher level of accuracy using unscoped weapons. It's a nice fit with Preem Scopes as well, since some handguns and smaller weapons have scopes that also suffer from excessive visual effects. Bear in mind that you need Kiroshi Optics for this ability to work.Virtual AtelierCreator: PacingsDownload link: NexusModsVirtual Atelier is a must-have for anyone who uses clothes mods. This one lets you download virtual store mods, then \"purchase\" from them or window shop at V's computer. Virtual Atelier comes with a preview feature that shows what an outfit looks like on your V before you buy it. Mod creators can create a virtual store showcasing their custom clothes for use with Virtual Atelier as well. Bear in mind that Virtual Atelier on its own does not add modded clothes to your wardrobe, nor does it add new items. It's a framework that makes displaying modded clothes easier for creators and seeing how they look easier for players. You just need to install those mods yourself.Drone CompanionsCreator: ScissorsDownload link: NexusModsDrone Companions is one of the few Cyberpunk 2077 mods that adds a new operating system--features such as V's Cyberdeck--and this one, as the name suggests, lets you build drones. It's called the TechDeck, and once you install the mod, you can find drone blueprint plans at most weapon vendors, along with a new crafting component called Drone Modules that non-organic enemies may drop. The TechDeck lets you create several drone types, including androids, smaller flying drones, and large mechs, and it comes with a set of hacks that buffs each drone. The different drone categories have separate sub-categories as well, such as the revolver-wielding \"Techie\" android or an android that specializes in sniper rifles and long-distance combat.Arasaka CyberarmsCreator: AanderzDownload link: NexusModsAt a glance, this mod seems like just a reskin for V's Cyberarms weapon, but there's more to it than that. Arasaka Cyberarms does, indeed, give V some fancy new, Arasaka-inspired Cyberarms that look much more distinct in combat. However, it also comes with a new set of looks for V's arms out of combat, including fingernail customization and even a toggle to remove nails completely. Despite having \"Arasaka\" in the name, there's also a set of Zetatech Cyberarms inspired by those in Phantom Liberty.Breach Protocol AutohackerCreator: JshDownload link: GitLabAutohacker is a perfect mod to install for a second playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077 or a first run if you're struggling with the hacking mini-game. It adds a list of configurations for hacking that ensures you get the right combination every time and walk away with the best rewards, making the best way to earn money in Cyberpunk even more effective. It's simple and effective, and it shaves quite a lot of time off your usual activities. Just make sure to download it from the GitLab link above. The NexusMods version is no longer up-to-date and won't work with Cyberpunk 2077 2.2.Appearance Menu ModCreator: MaximilliumMDownload link: NexusModsAppearance Menu Mod is easily one of the best Cyberpunk 2077 photo mods. The project started as a way to change NPC outfits and save their appearances in 2021, and now, you can spawn vehicles and characters for photo opportunities, pose all NPCs, change outfits and appearances, decorate your apartment, and customize vehicles. You can even alter companion attitudes if, for example, you wanted to create a scene where one of your normally-friendly followers looks like they're about to throw down with V. That's all in addition to a robust set of photo mode tools.Photo Mode UnlockerCreator: SilverEzredesDownload link: NexusModsHowever, if you want even more control over photo mode, Photo Mode Unlocker is an essential companion for Appearance Menu Mod. It removes all in-game restrictions on Cyberpunk 2077's photo mode and lets you do essentially whatever you want with it, and it adds several new, unique poses, all of which are up-to-date with the game's latest version.Proxima's Apartment EmporiumCreator: Proxima DustDownload link: NexusModsProxima's Apartment Emporium is a bundle of apartment mods that change how V's home looks. It comes with two dozen presets, all from mod maker Proxima Dust, and you can have multiple skins active at the same time. These range from designs inspired by Cyberpunk 2077's life paths to one created with the Edgerunners anime in mind. The Corpo apartment, for example, adds a suite of high-tech furniture, a much fancier TV than V normally has, and some swanky houseplants and wallpaper, all befitting a ruthless climber of the corporate ladder. The mod maker keeps these updated with every patch CD Projekt RED releases, so the bundle works with the most recent Cyberpunk update.Baby Driver 2.0Creator: yo soyDownload link: NexusModsMaybe you're good at driving in Cyberpunk 2077, but for the rest of us, there's Baby Driver 2.0. Even with all of CD Projekt Red's improvements to the driving system since Cyberpunk's launch, there's still a serious drift issue where it's far too easy to veer into a wall or oncoming traffic. Baby Driver 2.0 tweaks the way cars and bikes handle so they feel appropriately weighty and turn accordingly. Both vehicle types will still drift, but the mod gives you more control over how it works and when to initiate it.Live in Night CityCreator: FonWasHDownload link: NexusModsLive in Night City creates a completely different way to get through V's adventure by adding survival simulation elements. With this mod, you'll have to manage V's fatigue, thirst, and hunger, all of which have potentially negative effects on their stats if you let them deteriorate. Let V go hungry for too long, and their health drops to dangerously low levels. It's a helpful push toward engaging with other things such as food vendors as well, which you can often ignore without much penalty. Since you have to engage with them now, it's worth downloading something like Immersive Food Vendors that adds new little animations when interacting with a food stall vendor.Virtual Car DealerCreator: DJ_KovrikDownload link: NexusModsKeeping track of your vehicles in Cyberpunk 2077 can be slightly difficult, especially if you've downloaded vehicle mods in addition to owning some vanilla cars and motorcycles. If you want an easy way to log all of the vehicles you've modded into the game, download the Virtual Car Dealer mod. Using this mod, you can access any PC in Night City and view a shop that contains all of the available cars you have available in your garage. From here, all you have to do is find the vehicle you want to drive, and then use the shop to spawn it onto the map.Metro SystemCreator: keanuWheezeDownload link: NexusModsOne of the more notable forms of transportation in the base story of Cyberpunk 2077 is the flying train cars. You use these in several cutscenes throughout the story, but the train cars aren't available for recreational use. That is, until you download the Metro System mod, which adds 19 total metro stations and a fully functioning NCART system into Night City. Using these stations, you can board a train car that's situated on a rail and take it to any one of the other stations across the map. While you won't be manually flying across the map, you'll still take train cars high above Night City's various districts. However, if you want to do the flying yourself, you're in luck with a separate mod.Let There Be FlightCreator: Jack HumbertDownload link: NexusModsAt one point or another, most players in Cyberpunk 2077 have wished their vehicles could fly. We see flying cars all throughout Night City, but that form of transportation is not an option for any base vehicle in the game, including ones you can find randomly on the street. Fortunately, the Let There Be Flight mod takes care of that dilemma, giving every vehicle in Night City the ability to fly. They'll each be outfitted with thrusters and new sounds/animations that allow them to take flight.Better Loot MarkersCreator: rodikhDownload link: NexusModsDuring the heat of combat or after a firefight, it can be difficult to pick and choose what loot you want to take from a dead body. You have to scroll through a slew of items you don't want to see if there's anything you should take. To streamline the looting system, you can download the Better Loot Markers mod, which adds floating icons above every loot source in the game. These icons tell you the type and rarity of loot available, making it quick and easy to tell if a dead body is worth looting.V's Edgerunners MansionCreator: keanuWheezeDownload link: NexusModsIf you're a fan of the Netflix anime show Edgerunners, which is based on Cyberpunk 2077, or you're looking for a major upgrade to V's apartment in Night City, the V's Edgerunners Mansion mod will be of significant interest to you. This mod brings V's exact apartment from the Edgerunners show into Cyberpunk 2077, providing you with more space and amenities than what you have by default with V's apartment. The two-story mansion has an outdoor space with a pool and a massive balcony overlooking Night City, and a fully functioning bed, wardrobe, and armory. It's everything you've wanted in a Night City apartment, and best of all, there are no loading screens to enter or exit from the main world.Immersive First PersonCreator: BonanikiDownload link: NexusModsA couple of oddities are universal among first-person games. One of them is that, hands and forearms aside, you can't see anything below your shoulders. There's probably a good reason or two for that from a developer perspective, but it can still be a bit awkward. Immersive First-Person from Bonaniki fixes that, letting you see your upper torso all the way down to your premium Night City footwear, which is excellent for immersion generally and for actually being able to appreciate your fit without having to stop and activate a mirror. The other peculiarity is that looking around in first-person usually involves turning your entire body, making something normal like looking slightly to your left a bit more dramatic and unwieldy than it probably needs to be. If greater neck flexibility is on your Cyberpunk wishlist, this mod includes a \"free look\" feature that lets you scan the area around you without moving your body--handy if you just need a quick glance without moving where your gun is pointing.Preem ScannerCreator: CyanideXDownload link: NexusModsImagine a Night City where you can just scan things without having to put up with a green filter and potentially miss details thanks to the weird effects it often has on interior lighting. Well, thanks to CyanideX's brilliant little mod Preem Scanner, you don't have to imagine. Preem Scanner removes the filter and lets you use V's scanner as if they're just looking at the world normally--well, as normal as it can be for someone with more silicon than biological matter in their insides. You get all the same info from scanning and have the same access to your hacks. It just looks a lot nicer.Better Vehicle First PersonCreator: BonanikiDownload link: NexusModsIf you're one of those gifted souls who can drive around Night City in first-person without causing (unintentional) chaos and destruction, you'll probably get a lot of use out of Bonaniki's Better Vehicle First Person mod. This one adds several new perspectives in addition to the default first-person driving viewpoint, so you can tailor it more closely to your needs. And it includes settings to toggle as well, most notably a field-of-view slider to make seeing out the windshield and windows easier and a means of adjusting steering wheel sensitivity. It's a straightforward mod, but it makes a huge difference on the road.    \n  \n                      "

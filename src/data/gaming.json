The Cold Snap update brings multiple seasonal events, a new Snowfall map condition, and plenty more for fans to sink their teeth into. Among the fresh additions is the Goalie Raider Deck--the game's second battle pass--which contains a smorgasbord of cosmetics, gear, items, and even Raider Tokens that can be used toward premium purchases in the shop.The Goalie Deck is free for all players, so you won't need to purchase access to these rewards with premium currency. Instead, you'll simply need to work toward completing daily Feats that provide you with Creds, then use those to unlock your preferred items from the deck. This should prove fairly easy to do for most players, as you can complete up to three Feats per match, and you'll even get additional bonus Creds for the first five Feats you finish in a day.Perhaps the best news about the Goalie Deck, however, is that it's a permanent reward track. Unlike battle passes in other games, this deck will stick around forever, meaning you can unlock what you want from it whenever you'd like. With this in mind, you can skip any rewards that just don't matter much to you right now--though it's worth pointing out you will still need to purchase a certain number of items from the deck to unlock subsequent pages.If you're excited to dive into the Goalie Deck and start reaping its rewards--including the new hockey-themed outfit, which is pretty rad--we've got you covered ahead of time. Keep scrolling below for every reward from the Goalie Deck in Arc Raiders.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Everybody needs a friend, and that's especially the case in Satisfactory, where it's just you against all of nature and capitalism. Thankfully, the Lizard Doggo is there to keep you company. And even if you prefer your alone time, there's a good reason to keep a pen of Lizard Doggos around.Lizard Doggos are short, friend-sized lizards with dog-like features. They have a physique similar to that of a Beagle, but are scaled and have armor on their back. Untamed, Lizard Doggos are entirely harmless, and will quickly run when approached if done so carelessly.To tame a Lizard Doggo, you'll need a few Paleberries--the raspberry-like fruit found all over the map. If you already have Blade Runners by this point, unequip them before you try to tame one of these little guys, and toggle your movement speed to slow (Shift key). Find a Doggo and wait until it turns and starts staring at you. At this point, open your inventory and drop a Paleberry on the ground in front of you and wait. The Doggo will slowly approach you to eat the Paleberry. Make sure not to move during this process. Once the Doggo has completely eaten the Paleberry, slowly approach it. You should have a prompt to pet it (E). If you're able to pet it, you're golden--you have a new buddy.Make sure to name every single one of your Lizard Doggos.Lizard Doggos are slow, though, and they aren't very smart, either. You won't want to take these guys exploring, because they can't keep up with anything faster than a walking pace. They can be killed by poisonous gas or hostile creatures, too, though they're immune to radiation. They also have a tendency to take a walk off the nearest cliff.To protect them, you'll want to take them right home and build a pen for them. Make sure the pen has a foundation underneath, otherwise they can de-spawn. If you get creative with the builder, you can still give them grassy space to play in with a hidden foundation underneath to keep them from disappearing. They can't jump, and their maximum step height is one meter, so they can't climb very high, meaning that your pen walls can be pretty low.Now that you have a Doggo and a Doggo Park, you'll want to check back every so often. Each Doggo has a one-slot inventory, and will at random intervals generate one of a list of 46 potential items, ranging from Hog Remains to Power Slugs to Nuclear Waste. With a pen full of Doggos, you can generate quite a few items in short order, and some of them can be pretty rare. At the current time there's no way to farm those items automatically, or to breed Lizard Doggos, so this will still be a manual process, but a Purple Power Slug or a Nuke Nobelisk is nothing to sneeze at.Here's the full list at the time of this writing, with the resource linked above:OreS.A.M.Flora and FaunaHog RemainsSpitter RemainsBlue Power SlugYellow Power SlugPurple Power SlugHealing ItemsBeryl NutComponentsIron PlateIron RodWireCableConcreteScrewReinforced Iron PlateRotorCopper SheetModular FrameSteel BeamSteel PipeEncased Industrial BeamStatorMotorPlasticRubberCircuit BoardHeavy Modular FrameComputerQuickwireAlclad Aluminum SheetAluminum CasingCrystal OscillatorSilicaQuartz CrystalElectromagnetic Control RodHeat SinkCooling SystemFused Modular FrameHigh-Speed ConnectorTurbo MotorFuelSolid BiofuelBiomass (Generic)AmmoNuke NobeliskPulse NobeliskNobeliskRifle AmmoIron Rebar\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The holy grail of Satisfactory is having a perfectly balanced factory, where everything made is used, with your storage emptying at the same rate it's being depleted. But that's not going to happen--you'll have extras. That's what the Awesome Sink is for.What is the Awesome Sink?The Awesome Sink (with Moody Lighting)The Awesome Sink is a building that exists to get rid of all of your extra stuff, rewarding you with tickets based on the complexity of the items. This building is entirely optional, but those tickets can be used in the Awesome Shop to buy things like new cosmetic building parts, walkways, vehicles, and more. There's some really useful stuff in there, so you'd be a fool not to put one up. See the official Satisfactory wiki page on the Awesome Shop for a complete list of available items and ticket values.How does the Awesome Sink Work?You can dump items into the Awesome Sink as quickly as conveyor belts can supply them, so if you have a production line that's pumping out materials at ultra-high volume just for this purpose, the Awesome Sink is ready. You can build multiple Awesome Sinks around your factory, the points they generate are universal to all Sinks, and you can print out your tickets from any Sink at any time. So it's smart to have a Sink in various areas of your megafactory, taking in extra items and turning them for profit. The higher complexity the item, the more points it will generate toward your next ticket. Further, tickets become more expensive with each one generatedFor example, an Iron Ingot generates just two points, while a Crystal Oscillator generates 3,072. A Thermal Propulsion Rocket will generate over 370,000 points.Inside the Awesome ShopHow to get the most out of your Awesome SinkOnce you can get higher-speed conveyor belts attached to your Awesome Sink, it becomes a matter of finding the right ratio of highest points to lowest complexity. For example, Silica and Quickwire are two low-complexity options that can yield a lot of output fast. Later on, you'll need that Silica for manufacturing, so you'll need to shift to some of those higher-complexity items as you continue to progress.There are certain items the Awesome Sink won't accept, such as consumables or radioactive materials, but almost anything else you can produce can go in.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

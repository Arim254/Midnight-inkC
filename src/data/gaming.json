    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Hot off the heels of its introductory set Origins, Riot Games is already expanding on their popular League of Legends trading card game Riftbound with a new set. The set, titled Spiritforged, is set to expand the mechanics of the approachable yet deep card game in new and exciting ways.Glorious Executioner and Spinning Axe cards.First up, are the new Equipment cards. These are a new subtype that can be attached to units to make them even more powerful. The best part about Equipment? Even if your unit is killed in battle, they stay in play for you to equip another unit providing a great deal of value.One of the most exciting new pieces of Equipment is Draven’s signature Spinning Axe. This piece of equipment can be played as a Reaction instantly, and provides a +3 bonus that’s sure to catch opponents off guard. Combine this with Draven, Glorious Executioner's effect to draw a card every time he wins a combat and your opponents won't know what hit them.Gold card.Next up is Gold, a token gear that can be generated through numerous card effects. A player can choose to kill their gold to have it substitute a rune recycling cost. Gold can give players access to even more runes faster than they normally would, providing a healthy dose of ramping in an already fast-paced game. New Legends, such as Renata Glasc, Chem Baroness, can generate Gold when exhausted and make Gold more powerful by having it cover two rune costs in the late game. Using Renata's effect in the most optimal way can make huge spells like Time Warp far easier to cast earlier, leading to a quick victory.Finally, Riot is adding Repeat spells. These can be doubled if their cost is paid a second time. With how optimal Riftbound’s rune system is, players should have no issue paying repeat costs. Combine the mechanic with gold generation and there’s no telling how many spells you can fire off in a single turn. With Spiritforged, Riot Games is already making an exciting trading card game even more fast paced and synergistic.With months to go, there’s not telling what we’ll see next before Spiritforged launches on February 13th, 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In June, Hypixel and its parent company, Riot Games, announced that the Minecraft-inspired adventure game Hytale was canceled after 10 years of development. At that time, Hypixel was set to be shuttered as well. But now, the founders of Hypixel have rescued the studio with plans to finally bring Hytale into early access.Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced the news on social media that his studio has repurchased the rights for Hytale from Riot Games and plans to release it as soon as possible. However, he cautioned fans to temper their expectations as the game remains unpolished. While Collins-Laflamme acknowledged that \"there's a lot of work to be done,\" he added that there will be, \"No more waiting. You'll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won't be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we'll shape it into something truly special.\"We did it. Hytale is saved. We have acquired Hytale from Riot Games.  — Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) November 17, 2025              In a lengthy post on Hytale's official site, Collins-Laflamme noted that he and his Hypixel co-founder Philippe Touchette are co-funding the resurrected Hytale, with Kevin Carstens as the technical lead and Patrick Derbic as the management lead. They also announced that 30 developers who previously worked on Hytale have been hired to return.Collins-Laflamme also revealed that the team is dropping the current Cross-platform Engine build of Hytale because it \"is significantly behind in terms of gameplay\" and it would take years to reach early access. Instead, the team is reverting back to The Legacy Engine build, which is four-years old and significantly further along.Early access is expected to \"last at least a few years,\" as the team doesn't want to rush it through development. Exploration Mode, Creative Mode, and modding will be available at the launch of early access. However, minigames and Adventure Mode will be saved for a later date. The Hypixel founders added that they are committed to funding this project for 10 years, and they are fully independent with no outside investors or publishers. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

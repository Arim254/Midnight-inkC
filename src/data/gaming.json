    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nConflict and broken alliances set a path for war.By \n    Reyna Cervantes\n   on January 2, 2026 at 7:33AM PST\n              \n                Spoilers for this week's episode of Fallout to follow.This week’s Fallout episode gave audiences a look into the status quo of the factions fighting for control of the Mojave Wasteland. While gamers might have an idea of where they ended up after finishing Fallout: New Vegas, it seems that a lot has changed in the wasteland in the 15 years since. While the meter didn’t move too much on individual stories, it was great to see what some of these fan favorite factions are currently up to.The episode opens up in a bottling plant for the infamous Sunset Sarsaparilla, the Mojave’s favorite drink. The plant is being operated under the watchful eye of none other than former Brotherhood of Steel Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton), who’s taking on a far more ghoulish look than when we last saw him. After consoling a young girl who was bullied, he reminds the children to get back to work and that normally they’d “be dead by now.”Jumping over to Lucy (Ella Purnell), the last time we saw her she encountered the Legion. It turns out that the tunic woman she was returning was one of their slaves that lost their legionary; as punishment, she’s quickly executed and her head put onto a spike. Lucy is then given an audience with the current Caesar and his second in command Legate (Macaulay Culkin). They inform her that America’s ways have failed and it's up to them to bring order and honor to the Mojave.Before they take her as prisoner, Lucy notices that the Legion is split into two separate camps. The Legate informs her that the Legion has been fractured for the last decade over arguments who the original Caesar’s true successor is. He wrote the true successor’s name on a note that’s with his corpse in the rival camp and no one knows who is truly right. Being the problem solver she is, Lucy offers to help settle their differences before she’s swiftly denied and put onto a cross.Elsewhere back at the abandoned hospital, Cooper (Walton Goggins) wakes up and drags himself to an opening. With CX-404 by his side, he cuts open his leg and pulls out the radscopion stinger that’s paralyzing him.Jumping back to the Pre-War era, Cooper and his wife are struggling to get along. Despite her secrets and his mission from Moldaver, she attempts to pack for the Vault through her tears. We then see Cooper attend a ceremony at the local VFW where he uses this as an opportunity to ask around about Robert House before he heads to Las Vegas to assassinate him. While in the restroom, Cooper is confronted by The Mysterious Stranger (Justin Theroux) who offers him a cryptic warning about things to come and the powers that are at play.At Area 51, the other factions of the Brotherhood of Steel begin to pull out of their alliance with Maximus’ (Aaron Moten) chapter. They fear that Paladin Xander’s (Kumail Nanjiani) arrival suggests The Commonwealth’s chapter is launching a retaliation. With no other options, the other chapters suggest giving The Commonwealth the cold fusion relic in order to make them back down. Maximus offers to kill Xander to stop the conflict dead in its tracks, but he’s denied for fear of causing a full blown conflict. With no alliance, the Brotherhood would easily fall to The Commonwealth.As Maximus leaves the compound he’s stopped by Xander, who lets him know how different his chapter of the Brotherhood is. He tells him how they’re led more by actual soldiers and not religious zealots. Xander warns that the Elder Cleric’s choices have the potential to plunge the Brotherhood into a period of chaos and darkness.Cooper follows Lucy’s tracks and comes across the Legion’s camps. He realizes that the Legion are embroiled in a civil war of their own and plots to save Lucy, as he needs her to confront Hank Maclean (Kyle Maclaclan) if he wants to find his family. Realizing he needs back up, he heads to a nearby NCR outpost that is shockingly abandoned. While there he reconnects with Victor, the sheriff securitron from Fallout: New Vegas. Victor informs him that the NCR have abandoned the outpost and that Robert House is dead. Cooper doesn’t believe for a second that House would die and not have a plan set into motion to carry out his motives. He heads out to find the remaining NCR rangers.Maximus and Xander take a vertibird out for a joyride through the Mojave. Xander tells him about the Brotherhood back home and suggests that they give the cold fusion to them because of a losing war back home. The Commonwealth chapter is at risk of losing the area to chaos and the power that the cold fusion provides could turn the tides of war.Heading into the hills near the outskirts of Primm, Cooper encounters two members of the NCR. After a brief scuffle they recognize him and he asks for reinforcements to take on the Legion camps. They inform him that they’re the last remnant of the NCR in the area and they’re cut off from supplies and reinforcements. Cooper suggests that they have fully lost control and power in the Mojave with the fall of Shady Sands. They ask for help in reconnecting with an NCR base, but he refuses to help them before storming off.After Xander and Maximus detect robot activity in an abandoned facility they land the vertibird and suit up in their power armor. While exploring the facility they encounter a rogue securitron that attempts to kill them but is instead destroyed by a super sledge as the two celebrate.Cooper heads into the Legion camp that’s holding Lucy prisoner and demands they let her go. The Legate asks when and Cooper offers up information on the NCR remnant’s whereabouts so that the Legion can fully wipe them out. They take her down off the cross and she leaves with Cooper, who notices a dynamite stash. Once they’re outside the camp, the stash explodes and Cooper reveals it was him that rigged it to explode. He debates if what he did was a good choice, or a very stupid one.Maximus and Xander explore the facility more and discover a ghoul child that is hiding from them. It’s revealed they’re in the bottling facility from the beginning of the episode. Xander is convinced more are hiding and demands all the kids come out of hiding. With a mix of normal and ghoul children, he separates them into groups. He attempts to kill the ghoul children before Thaddeus appears and pleads with him not to kill the kids. Ignoring all the cries, Xander fires up his weapon before Maximus slams the super sledge into his head, killing him and saving the ghoul children. Thaddeus and Maximus reconnect as Maximus realizes he might have just started a war.This week’s episode of Fallout traded in personal stories in favor of some excellent world building. One of the best aspects of Fallout: New Vegas is the unique faction systems and the colorful characters that inhabit the Mojave Wasteland. This season also reveals the fates of these beloved factions long after the game has ended. With the stage set for full blown conflict, it’ll be interesting to see how alliances and rivalries play out later on this season.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nThe final chapter of DK's latest adventure is a bonanza of nostalgic delight.By \n    Jason Fanelli\n   on January 3, 2026 at 9:00AM PST\n              \n                Note: MASSIVE spoilers for the final section of Donkey Kong Bananza. Read on at your own risk!All throughout Donkey Kong Bananza, DK and Pauline are battling Void Company and its leader Void Kong. However, with each new level, there's a reptilian presence permeating the experience.Some enemies bear a striking resemblance to the Kremlings of DK adventures past, hidden treasure chests are green and bear what look like crocodile teeth, even the Banandium Root--Void Company's main goal in digging through the planet--has a certain familiarity to it I just can't put my finger on.In the moment, they feel like simple winks and nods to the older players (like me) who have adventured with DK before. Then, I reach Chapter 15, and the climactic confrontation with Void Kong.After a tough battle worthy of a final boss encounter, we see what certainly feels like part of the final cutscene. Pauline saves DK just as he saved her in the beginning of the game, completing her journey from stage-frightened child to confident performer, and the two stand smiling at one another, the Banandium Root just out of view. I'm expecting a fade to black… but then Void Kong charges the Root…… he dives toward his prize in order to claim the wish legend says it grants …… the music swells, the screen fades to white …The eye-opening reveal…and then, an eye opens. A massive, vein-ridden, green eyeball fills the screen. Void Kong is punched into oblivion by a scaly green first. The screen shifts to a pair of giant green feet and slowly pans upward, past the massive golden belly that used to be called the Banandium Root, and we see his face, standing in opposition to Donkey Kong, for the first time in 18 years.King K. Rool has returned.He thanks DK for freeing him, and explains that he and his crew had been trapped down there after trying to claim the real Banandium Root for themselves. Now that he's free, he can continue his quest to claim the root. The big croc then jumps one level further into the planet, to its actual core, and the endgame of Donkey Kong Bananza begins.Have you ever seen that old WWE clip of Stone Cold Steve Austin returning to help Mankind in 1999? Substitute the sound of glass breaking with the sight of K. Rool's eye opening, and that wild crowd cheer is what played through my head at that moment.The setup is fantastic, as the game slowly and routinely plants a seed of memory in your head with the previously mentioned casual references. The approach to Void Kong in Chapter 15, as well as the boss fight itself, feels like a fitting climax to Bananza's story. In the blink of an eye, what seemed like an epilogue turned into one final prologue, and I'm still smiling like an idiot thinking about it as I write this, a full five months after seeing it for the first time.The nostalgia pops don't end there, however. The surprise 16th layer of the planet is a gauntlet of classic Kremling enemies, each with their original sound effect from the Super Nintendo Donkey Kong Country games. Kremlings make that \"awh\" sound when you punch them, just as they did when you jumped on them in 1994. The massive bees called Zingers still buzz that staticy buzz, and they still hurt DK if he touches them. The buzzards known as Neckys make the exact same squawking noise when they charge you, which sent me warping back to my childhood like Anton Ego tasting Remy's ratatouille.However, in another clever twist, the Kremling grunts found here attack DK and Pauline just as they had in previous layers, when they were the rock monsters hiding gilded skeletons that bore resemblance to the Kremlings of old. With the facade now lifted, it's even more apparent how much of Bananza was telegraphing the Kremling twist right in front of my eyes, and yet I barely gave the hints a second thought.The returned King K. RoolThis is all before you actually get to K. Rool himself, who battles you with his blunderbuss in a fun matchup that, honestly, ends rather quickly. You claim the Root, a massive pile of bananas emerges to take DK and Pauline back to the surface (just go with it), and the credits start to roll. However, in another callback to Donkey Kongs past, these are fake credits with the names of Kremlings instead of developers, and K. Rool rises and gives chase. Chef's kiss.The next phase of the battle then begins, as DK fends off a jetpack-piloting K. Rool on his way to the surface. This part is backed by a hard rock version of Gangplank Galleon, K. Rool's original boss battle music from Donkey Kong Country, and this version has dethroned the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate version for the title of \"Best Gangplank Galleon rendition of all time\" in my humble opinion.Once DK and Pauline reach the surface, they emerge in New Donk City from Super Mario Odyssey, adding a second and more recent flavor of nostalgia. K. Rool claims the Banandium Root, floods the city with rotten, mushy bananas, and DK must battle through Kremlings and surging banana mush to confront the conniving croc one last time.K. Rool, King of RotFor the final battle, K. Rool uses the power of the Root to transform into a massive, banana-fueled version of himself called K. Rool, King of Rot--which sounds as if K. Rool was researching the works of one Hidetaka Miyazaki in his prolonged absence. Once this version of the rotten reptile is defeated, the adventure finally comes to an end, marked by the actual credits this time.All of this is a master class of mixing nostalgia with new, and creates an experience that will stick with me for a while. Despite the reptilian references sprinkled in every layer of the game, Void Kong is presented as the big bad of the story. He's a constant presence in cutscenes, barking insults at DK while also barking orders at his subjects … much in the same way K. Rool used to do.Then, once Void is defeated, the mask slips off as K. Rool returns, and suddenly it's a trip down memory lane. The previously-mentioned enemies are obvious callbacks, but the different sections of Layer 16 are connected by mine cart rides, while the surrounding golden glow of the Banandium Root's influence has a similar feel to that of running into Kong's Banana Hoard in the original Donkey Kong Country. Seeing K. Rool return in such a wonderfully executed way, and then having that moment enhanced by all of the other callbacks that appear while trying to thwart the returned ruler, is the kind of pure gaming happiness that Nintendo has delivered since the days of my youth.Welcome back, King K. Rool. I look forward to our next encounter, whenever that may be. Hopefully, you'll be around for more than just the final challenge.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

These buttons have RGB lighting rings with six customizable effects modes. It also has four bean-shaped buttons. Two of these are for right and left stick clicks (RSB/LSB), while the other two are extra remappable buttons (P1/P2).All of the button use low-profile Kailh Wizard mechanical switches. Like 8BitDo's original Arcade Stick, the Arcade Controller has a hot-swappable design. Button caps can easily be removed to clean the switches or swap in new caps. The Arcade Controller comes with four locking caps for RSB/LSB and P1/P2, in case you want to disable them to avoid accidental presses.As an officially licensed controller, it has the normal settings buttons found on the Xbox Wireless Controller on the top row: Xbox, View, Menu, and Share. You can adjust light ring brightness and switch between lighting modes with the RGB button. The P1/P2 buttons can be remapped on the fly with the Star button, and you can cycle through custom control layouts with the Profile button. The two dials on the top left enable/disable tournament mode and adjust the sound volume when using a wired headset. The Xbox version of the All-Button Controller has a 3.5mm audio jack.With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software X for Xbox and PC, you can remap all inputs, customize RGB lighting effects, and choose your SOCD priority mode.The Arcade Controller has a compact form factor and is only 1.6cm thick. The control panel has a smudge-resistant, tempered glass faceplate, and the silicone mat on the bottom is designed to prevent movement while playing. Foldable magnetic feet can be flipped down to adjust the angle.You can sync wirelessly to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, or PC with the included 2.4GHz adapter, which is stored in a magnetic compartment on the bottom of the fight pad. The USB-C charging cable can also be used for wired mode. With the RGB lighting rings on and headphones plugged in, the battery is likely to drain in roughly 20 hours. If you turn the RGB lighting rings off and don't use a wired headset, you can get up to 40 hours of play time between charges.                                                                                                                            8BitDo All-Button Wireless Arcade Controller (Switch/Switch 2/PC)                                                                $70.68 (was $90) | All-time low price                                                                                                                                                                                    The Nintendo Switch 1/2 version has the retro-inspired red/black/gray NES color scheme seen on a number of 8BitDo controllers. The overall design matches the Xbox version, but there are a few differences.This edition supports Bluetooth on Switch and Switch 2, 2.4GHz Wireless on PC, and wired for both consoles and PC. You can get up to 20 hours of play time on a full charge.The Switch version has eight red circular buttons and four black directional inputs. One cool feature is that when you toggle the dial from S-Input to X-Input, the faceplate's button labels change from Switch to Xbox layout.Instead of RSB/LSB buttons, the Switch version has two extra programmable buttons (P3/P4). It still comes with locking caps for the programmable buttons, though. Right and left stick clicks are found on the top row as L3 and R3, in the same spot where the RGB button is on the Xbox edition. The Switch version does not have lighting rings or a 3.5mm audio jack.The input mode dial replaces the volume control, but the other dial still locks/unlocks tournament mode. Instead of the Xbox button, the Switch version has a Bluetooth pairing button. Star and Profile buttons allow you to remap the four programmable buttons on the fly and switch through control presets. These buttons match the colors of the Super Famicom controller.With 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2, you can change SOCD modes, remap all of the buttons, and create macros.

During the event, there are tons of skins that are going to be available for purchase, along with a couple of free skins, like one for Jeff the Land Shark. There are a handful of skins available at the start of the event, with more teased for the coming weeks.Available right now, you can grab Gummy Surprise Venom and Restful Recovery Blade from the shop. The Venom bundle is 2,200 Units and the Blade bundle is 1,600 Units, or you can get them together in a mega bundle for 2,800 Units. Each bundle includes the skin, MVP highlight, emote, spray, and nameplate. Both skins are temporary additions to the shop, leaving shortly after the event ends in late December.As part of the Jeff's Break Time event pass, you can get the legendary Business Shark skin for Jeff for free by completing matches. This skin has customizable parts, like ties, glasses, and even his suit design. If you get the premium version of the pass, it also includes the Dad-tastic Reed Mister Fantastic skin and Disappearing Dessert Invisible Woman skin. There's also a new look for Galacta, which can be seen in the battle pass menu. Jeff's Break Time ends at the same time as the anniversary event, although purchasing the premium version will allow you to unlock rewards past the event's scheduled end.While there are certainly a few surprises coming, we do know that there are two more Legendary skins coming. On December 5, Van Dyne's shop opens, containing the legendary Daring Daifuku Psylocke skin. On the same day, a legendary Luna Snow skin will also be released, although it's unclear if that will be in the typical shop or tied to a specific event. Below you can see every skin released for Marvel Rivals anniversary event so far.Business Shark - Jeff the Land SharkDad-tastic Reed - Mister FantasticDisappearing Desserts - Invisible WomanGummy Surprise - VenomRestful Recovery - Blade    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                After being announced earlier this year, ModRetro has officially revealed what its modern-day tribute to the Nintendo 64 console and controller will look like. Unsurprisingly, the M64 looks very similar to the N64 at first glance, but with several design changes to help distinguish.The most striking feature here is an entirely translucent plastic shell that allows you to peek into the inner workings of the machine, but like its primary source of inspiration, it features four controller ports in the front, a large power button, what appears to be a dial for the menu function, and a slot to insert original N64 cartridges.The controller for the M64 is also very similar to the one that came with the N64, featuring a trident-shaped design, an array of face buttons, a D-pad, and a thumbstick in the center. Like the console, the controller's shell is also made of translucent plastic on the top half, with a solid grey bottom half.This is a similar approach to the one ModRetro took with its Game Boy successor, the ModRetro Chromatic. Like the updated handheld, the M64 aims to offer an authentic gaming experience alongside modern experiences. The system uses an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) to authentically replicate the N64's performance, which is considered by enthusiasts to be the best option for playing retro games in HD via HDMI on a modern television.The M64 is arriving after the launch of the Analogue 3D. Analogue's modernized N64 has reopened preorders, but prices have increased due to tariffs. Increasing from $250 to $270, the updated price applies only to new console orders. In comparison, the M64 will have a $200 price tag when preorders open."

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Marvel Rivals is rapidly approaching its one year anniversary in early December, but the in-game event has already kicked off. The Anniversary event is putting up tons of free and paid rewards for you to grab, including a free Legendary Jeff the Land Shark skin. There are also tons of free Units up for grabs, with a catch.How to get the Jeff the Land Shark Business Shark skinThe free Business Shark skin for Jeff comes in a limited-time reward event called Jeff's Break Time. As you earn match XP, you'll get coins to redeem items inside a virtual vending machine. There are free coins and paid coins, each unlocking items from different parts of the vending machine. Jeff's skin is in the free section, as are a new element to Rivals skins: customizable parts. Earning match XP will earn you coins, which can redeem items in the vending machine.Jeff's Break Time is a 20-day event, but like all event passes, if you purchase the premium version it becomes permanently available to you, allowing you to earn the rewards at your own pace. The premium version costs 990 Lattice ($10), and includes the Dad-tastic Reed Mister Fantastic and Disappearing Dessert Invisible Woman skins, as well.Free Units, with a catchUnits, the free in-game currency that can be used to buy skins in the store, are also being given away for the anniversary event... sort of. During the event, there are seven days' worth of log-in rewards, for a total of 1,500 Units. These Units are \"Time-Limited\" and expire at the end of the event, around December 18. If you don't use them before that point, they will expire and be removed from your account.You can earn 1,500 temporary units, which expire at the end of the event.This is the first time Marvel Rivals has introduced a time-limited version of one of its main currencies. It's an odd choice, but between the Van Dyne shop opening on December 3 with the Darling Daifuku Psylocke skin and more anniversary shop skins coming, you probably won't have a hard time spending those Units. The Black Friday sale in the Marvel Rivals shops also runs through December 3, offering discounts on older skins. While you can't get all the log-in rewards by then, you could spend some of those temporary Units on the sale.There's an additional 600 normal Units up for grabs via the Rivals Assemble part of the event, where you can add friends to your team with a special code, allowing both of you to complete missions and earn points for the other person. These rewards are only unlockable if you use the code to add friends. There are also some Units and an exclusive title that can be grabbed by participating in the December 6 Midnight countdown event. You can use the in-game countdown to determine when exactly that is occurring in your timezone. Marvel Rivals' anniversary event is running for the next three weeks, with more cosmetics being added over time. Marvel Rivals Season 5 recently kicked off, adding Gambit to the roster.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

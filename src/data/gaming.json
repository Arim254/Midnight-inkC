    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on November 11, 2025 at 1:48AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Farming is a task that every Minecraft player eventually has to undertake, and over the years, designs for various farms have sprouted up all over the community. Whether it's traditional farming for crops or using clever methods to farm specific resources, you'll want to take advantage of this process in Minecraft at some point or another.The entire world of Minecraft can be harvested for resources, all of which allow you to upgrade and customize your character, gear, base, and everything in between. However, slowly collecting all the resources you need to build everything you've brainstormed can be painstaking work, especially if you're not optimizing the way you loot items.To help you with that, we have five farm designs that are intended to provide you with fast and efficient ways of farming various resources in Minecraft. You can also expand upon these design ideas to make your farms unique to your world.Automatic Multi-Level FarmReference: YouTubeFirst up on our list is a multi-level crop farm that also features an automatic harvesting method so you don't have to go around and loot every single crop one piece at a time. Not only does this farm look fantastic, featuring clear windows so you can see your crops from the outside, but it serves an impactful purpose.You can use this farm design for a single crop that you need a lot of, or space out different crops on each level. If you wanted even more crops, you're able to keep expanding the height of the farm as well. Overall, this is a fantastic way to move away from the basic farm design that usually looks out of place off to the side of your base.Mob FarmReference: YouTubeMobs are the lifeblood of Minecraft, and you need the resources from the dozens of mobs in order to craft a wide variety of different items. The specific mob farm we're showcasing is designed to trap the dangerous mobs in Minecraft, such as zombies. However, you can also apply the idea to docile mobs, like cows and horses.This mob farm is built in the middle of the water and intends to trap the mobs inside a dark enclosure inside the structure. Since mobs tend to spawn in dark and damp locations, you'll get dozens of them spawning within minutes. The farm is then set up to eliminate the mobs and deposit their loot into chests, essentially doing all the work for you.Iron FarmReference: YouTubeIron is one of the most valuable resources in Minecraft, and, like any ore, it's extremely tedious to find in the world. You have to go out with your pickaxe and hope you find a vein of iron ore to mine, and even then, it's usually never enough. Fortunately, you never have to worry about iron again with this clever farm.While an iron farm does utilize a slew of resources, it's worth it to never mine an iron ore block again. The way the farm works is by using Iron Golems, which are then killed to drop the iron. You need to position villagers and beds in very specific ways to spawn the golems, but once that's down, it's smooth sailing.Greenhouse FarmReference: YouTubeA greenhouse has been an extremely common way to design a farm in Minecraft since the game's inception. However, you can expand the basic idea of a greenhouse into several different farming avenues. You can design a greenhouse to store basic crops, and you can also use it as an extension of your base. Perhaps the most clever way to utilize a greenhouse, though, is by storing honeybees inside.The bees are protected in the greenhouse, and they'll also pollinate your crops for you. This is also an easy way to start a honeybee farm, as you can build a small house for the bees that they can use to spawn even more of their species. Whichever way you decide to go with your greenhouse, it's a tried and true way to farm that also looks amazing when built correctly.Wool FarmReference: YouTubeWhile wool is most famously used in the creation of beds in Minecraft, it's also an extremely common resource when crafting banners and other decorations. Heading out to find the amount of sheep you need for wool is never fun, so why not build an elegant farm for the furry creatures?The wool farm we're showcasing houses a dozen or more sheep inside a small stone and glass enclosure. The farm then shears the sheep after their wool grows back, effectively giving you an infinite supply of wool. The main issue with this farm is that you have to wait for all the sheep's wool to grow back, but that's going to be a problem no matter how you set up a farm like this. In the end, you're getting around a dozen wool at the same time. And a sheep's wool grows back in around two minutes, so you're really not waiting that long if you need more of the resource.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on November 11, 2025 at 1:47AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Some structures in Minecraft are built purely for show, while others need to be built of necessity for your survival. However, certain structures accomplish both of those goals, and a bridge definitely falls within that category. Bridges usually aren’t an essential construction, depending on your seed and base design, but if you want to cross water without needing a boat or quickly get from one mountainside to the other, you'll need to start designing a bridge.While you can always just get some basic wood planks or stone blocks and place them in a line to form a bridge, where's the fun in that? If you're truly looking to test your skills as a builder or add some extra spice to your world, you'll want to check below for five of the best bridge designs in Minecraft.Nether BridgeReference: RedditThe Nether is one of the most iconic biomes in all of Minecraft, but getting around to different areas within the twisted dimension can be difficult. After all, you have to contend with lava streams, dangerous mobs, and treacherous terrain at every turn. To help make your life simpler while roaming the Nether, you can build a bridge that either goes across a large gap or a stream of lava. The bridge we've referenced is a simple but sturdy design that utilizes some of the Nether's natural resources to complete it.Skellige BridgeReference: YouTubeIf you're a fan of The Witcher video game series, TV show, or even the books, then you likely know of the island town \"Skellige.\" Skellige is famously portrayed during the middle part of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, as you get to fully explore the island and all of its glory. One of the most recognizable landmarks in Skellige is a towering bridge that connects the mountainside to the town's main castle. This bridge is made of stone, stands hundreds of feet above the ground, and makes you feel queasy just walking over it.In Minecraft, you can recreate the Skellige bridge with a simple stone design that goes over a large gap between two mountains. The YouTube video we referenced doesn't include a castle on one end of the bridge, but the bridge itself looks very similar to one featured in Skellige.Hogwarts BridgeReference: RedditHogwarts Castle is one of the most well-known locations in all of entertainment. Throughout the movies, books, and even the game Hogwarts Legacy, one particularly beautiful spot on the castle grounds is the covered bridge. This bridge runs from the castle to the outer grounds, and it's a central location for several events in Hogwarts' history.While the bridge we see in Hogwarts Legacy and Harry Potter is somewhat tattered and rickety, you can correct those mistakes with a gorgeous bridge design from a user on Reddit. This player's bridge features the same covered middle and lower beam design as the Hogwarts bridge, but it adds some extra flair with the two towers on either end. It's a fantastic reimagining of the Hogwarts bridge that you can continue to tweak to your liking.Mossy BridgeReference: YouTubeWhen it comes to a bridge in Minecraft, it doesn't need to be an overly extravagant structure that's meant to get you across a massive mountain range. Sometimes, a bridge can be small and quaint with the sole goal of allowing you to cross some peaceful water or a small gap between some rocks. This mossy bridge design isn't anything spectacular from a design standpoint, but it doesn't need to be. This kind of bridge fits in perfectly with a cozy base or as a simple way to get across a pond, river, or lake. You can also add more flair with different grassy blocks, more lighting, or a raised platform if you'd like.Fantasy BridgeReference: YouTubeSometimes, you need to go all out with your design in Minecraft. If you're looking to make one of the flashiest and most jaw-dropping bridges for your world, look no further than the \"Bridge of Lords.\" This bridge features a medieval design with several layers of different blocks, plenty of lighting, and even has the potential to be a pitstop kind of base with how much room there is in the foundation. The goal of this bridge is to dwarf any mountainside that you build it on, and you'll ideally want to build it high in the air to get the full intended effect.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Sony has shared its latest update for investors, and it's largely good news for PlayStation 5. According to Sony, an additional 3.9 million PS5 consoles were sold in the last quarter, bringing its lifetime total to 84.2 million consoles sold since the system launched in 2020. That puts the PS5 into a virtual dead heat with its predecessor, PlayStation 4, at the same point in its life cycle.The complete breakdown of Sony's latest fiscal quarter is now online, and its sales chart shows the remarkably similar trajectory of the PS4 and PS5 sales. However, Sony noted that it only projects 15 million additional PS5 console sales during its current fiscal year, which runs through March 31, 2025. If so, that would potentially allow PS4 to retain its crown as Sony's second best-selling console, because it sold 17.8 million systems at that point in its life.Regardless, Sony CFO Lin Tao suggested that the PS5 may have a longer lifespan than the traditional seven-year cycle.Sony CFO Lin Tao says the PS5 is only in the middle of its lifecycle and they want to expand the lifecycle even further!\"Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles. Looking at the PS4 lifecycle it seems to be getting longer and longer. Especially the PS4,… pic.twitter.com/ecrsI3X9xV  — Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) November 11, 2025              Kantan Games CEO Dr Serkan Toto told Video Games Chronicle that Sony's success is at least in part due to the struggles of Microsoft's gaming division and the migration of formerly Xbox-exclusive titles to PS5.\"Life is good if you have a competitor that is not really focusing on hardware anymore and has given up on exclusive games to start selling them on your platform,\" said Toto. \"Sony is now clearly dominating the high fidelity console gaming space, and just watch what happens to their numbers once GTA 6 is out.\"Sony's report also revealed that Ghost of Yotei has sold 3.3 million copies since its debut just over a month ago. Unfortunately, the latest word from Sony about Bungie and Destiny isn't as good. Sony is claiming a loss of $204 million because Destiny 2 didn't reach its sales goals. For now, Sony is hopeful that Destiny 2's next expansion, Renegades, may revive interest in the shooter when it launches on December 2.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

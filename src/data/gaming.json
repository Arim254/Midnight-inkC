    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was going to embrace games-as-a-service before it shifted to become XDefiant, a game that the publisher shut down not long after release. This is according to Nick Herman, a developer who worked on the game before leaving to start AdHoc Studios, the team that just launched the episodic game Dispatch to great success. Following the publication of this report, XDefiant director Mark Rubin spoke out to react to the report and share his side of the story.\"I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while,\" Herman said told Bloomberg. \"And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.\"The game was in development \"for a few months,\" Bloomberg reported, and Herman confirmed that Ubisoft wanted to have it feature games-as-a-service elements.\"We tried,\" Herman said. \"Let's make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.\"The report said \"Ubisoft had lost interest\" in this Splinter Cell game and shifted to pursue a project that could attempt to compete with Call of Duty. This became XDefiant, a game directed by former Call of Duty boss Mark Rubin. The game shut down after a year and developers were laid off. \"We thought we were going to be able to make something really great,\" Herman said. \"And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don't anymore. It's a common thing in games.\"Rubin, who directed XDefiant and is no longer with Ubisoft, shared his side of the story. He said it is \"not true\" that Ubisoft was working on a Splinter Cell game before switching to XDefiant. \"When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter Cell game. I then canceled that one and let the team pitch any game ideas they wanted,\" he said. \"There were some cool ones but I felt the scope/difficulty was too hard on some ideas so we stuck with an arena shooter and we found the fun quickly. So no we didn't pivot off Splinter Cell to make XDefiant. Now maybe they were thinking about working on Splinter Cell before I got there but it was never a thing while I was there. My experience with Ubisoft was they are very open to whatever the studio wants to do which is great but I do wish we could have used external engines.\"Saw the rumor from Bloomberg that we were working on Splinter Cell game before switching to Xdefiant. I can say that is not true. When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter…  — Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) November 15, 2025\n  While that Splinter Cell game is not coming to market, a Splinter Cell remake is now in the works. Outside of games, the Splinter Cell TV show Deathwatch debuted in October on Netflix and has already been renewed for a second season. A live-action movie was in the works, but apparently no longer is.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

That's especially true for the Hotel Collection, as right now you can save 50% on select Star Wars scents, candles, and diffusers. This includes everything from premium candles with a burn time of up to 300 hours and tiny diffusers built to keep your car smelling fresh.Many of these scents have names like Rebel Spirit and The Dark Side, but rest assured, they won't smell like the inside of Darth Vader's helmet or the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. Each fragrance was crafted from a blend of ingredients, including Valencia Orange and Bergamot. Many of the scents are shared across product categories, so if you already know how you want your home (or car) to smell, here's a quick rundown of each fragrance in the Star Wars roster.Hotel Collection: Star Wars FragrancesThe Empire: Toasted vanilla, shadow clove, black amberJedi: Bergamot, damask rose, Chinese black teaThe Dark Side: Sinister sage, patchouli, saffronRebel Spirit: Bergamot, amber, Valencia orangeGalactic Hope: Smooth resin, seductive amber, vintage woodThe Force: Bright neroli, oud wood, cardamomSith: Cashmere amber, shadowy violet, bitter orangeThe Duel: Santal, dim amber, muskHere's a look at all the Star Wars fragrances and diffusers that are on sale snow. Many are up to 50% off. If you know you'll be using the scents for a long time, consider picking up a diffuser--it could save you money in the long run. Otherwise, a premium candle is a nice, affordable alternative. Please note that many discounts are only applicable when signing up for monthly subscriptions (not one-time purchases).Once you've browsed all the deals, be sure to check out GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for even more early discounts--and don't forget to check back throughout the month to see the latest price cuts on video games, figures, and beyond.Studio Pro Scent Diffuser (Home Diffuser)Before you can use any of the fragrance oils, you'll need to pick up a diffuser. These come in three different designs, though each one covers up to 600 square feet. They don't use heat or water, making them safe for kids and pets, and you won't find any residue left behind as the scents waft through your room. Their original price of $100 is a bit steep, but since you can snag a cool Star Wars one for just $50 right now, they're definitely worth a closer look.Darth Vader -- $50 ($100)Storm Trooper -- $50 ($100)C-3PO -- $50 ($100)Home Diffuser Fragrance OilA whole lot of fragrance oil for the Home Diffuser lineup is on sale at the Hotel Collection. These come in two styles--Pro and Regular. The Pro Pods are compatible with the Studio Pro Scent Diffusers (including the Star Wars models above). The Regular Pods are compatible with the older Studio Scent Diffuser. We've listed the Pro Pods below, but you'll find Regular variants on each store page if you're working with the older diffuser.The Empire -- $27.48 ($55)Jedi -- $38.46 ($55)The Dark Side -- $27.48 ($55)Rebel Spirit -- $27.48 ($55)Galactic Hope -- $38.46 ($55)Chauffeur Car Diffuser + Fragrance OilRoom SprayJust need a periodic scent refresh? These room sprays work a bit like cologne or perfume. Just give your space a few sprays, and the fragrance should linger around for a while.

However, it has also introduced the first event in the game, known as Breaking New Ground. While the first part of this event asked the community to come together and commit resources to unlocking the Stella Montis map, the second portion--Staking Our Claim--has a free mini-battle pass of sorts with plenty of rewards to earn by simply playing the game.To unlock rewards during the Staking Our Claim event, you'll need to earn XP in matches. For every 100 XP earned, you are granted 1 Merit. You'll need a total of 3,600 Merits to collect everything in the event--and though this may sound like a major undertaking, XP comes pretty quickly when looting and killing enemies in raids, so it's likely to take you less time than you think.Additionally, if you participated in the first half of the event by giving resources to the tunnel efforts, you'll have already reached up to 900 Merits toward the reward track right out of the gate. This will give you a considerable head start on getting every reward, so here's to hoping you contributed! Rewards are automatically unlocked and granted every 150 Merits, ensuring you're regularly getting something for your hard work while exploring topside.Below is every reward in the Staking Our Claim event and how many Merits you'll need to unlock them. All rewards are free, so there's nothing optional to purchase and you'll not miss out on anything by simply playing and earning XP. The event ends on December 7, so you have a little over three weeks from the start to earn all free rewards.Hiker Backpack150 MeritsRaider Tokens x100300 MeritsDoor Blocker x3450 MeritsCombat Mk. 2600 MeritsIl Toro750 MeritsStriker (Outfit)900 MeritsSeeker Grenade x31050 MeritsBag (Striker Variant)1200 MeritsTrailblazer x2 1350 MeritsBucket (Backpack Attachment)1500 MeritsDeadline1650 MeritsCan't Hear You (Emote)1800 MeritsRaider Tokens x1001950 MeritsDirt Full (Face Style)2100 MeritsExtended Barrel2250 MeritsOrange (Striker Color)2400 MeritsRaider Tokens x1002550 MeritsPadding (Striker Variant)2700 MeritsSnap Hook2850 MeritsRed (Striker Color)3000 MeritsRaider Tokens x1003150 MeritsHelmet (Striker Variant)3300 MeritsRaider Tokens x1003450 MeritsGas Mask (Striker Variant)3600 Merits    \n  \n                      "

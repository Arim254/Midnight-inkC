Especially given the new biome that just appeared on the island.While the season changeovers in Chapter 1 didn't usually come with major renovations the way new seasons do these days. But that changed in Season 7, when a huge iceberg crashed into the southwestern corner of the island and made the island significantly larger, while adding a frigid snow biome in the process.The result is the addition of three entirely new named locations, the destruction of two existing ones, and snowy makeovers for several of the spots in that part of the map that stuck around. Not everything that was added in the original Season 7 came back in exactly the same way, though. The Block, which was an empty space that showcased buildings that were made by players in Fortnite Creative, fell off the side of a cliff at the edge of the island and won't be active during OG season.Scroll on for better looks at the new areas and changes."

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on December 11, 2025 at 7:41AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Fortnite's new Ninjago-themed Lego Pass is now live, and it's a landmark for Fortnite's Lego modes. Before now, every Lego figure in Fortnite was a Fortnite skin that was adapted into Lego form--but this pass includes the first character who started as a Lego figure to be adapted into a Fortnite-style human skin, with Fire Master Kai. Three other Ninjago characters--Ice Master Zane, Earth Master Cole, and Lightning Master Jay--are available in a bundle from the item shop.Fire Master Kai is unlocked instantly when you purchase the Ninjago Lego Pass, which costs 1,400 V-Bucks, and is available through Fortnite Crew. From there, you can unlock a variety of Ninjago-themed builds and decor items, as well as a new emote and a couple of loading screens. You can unlock one item for every two account levels you earn, meaning it will take 60 levels to get everything included in the Ninjago Lego Pass. When it comes to Lego builds, these Lego passes have become essential. In all of 2025, Fortnite only released one new Lego build in the item shop--the Daft Punk Pyramid. Which means nearly every new Lego build added to the game in the past year was earned through quests or the passes. So if you play the Lego modes regularly and plan to continue doing so, the Lego Pass is worth, at the very least, a hard look.

The original Sonic design was a strange mix of blue fur and too many teeth, but the redesign of Sonic that followed was far more faithful to the video games. A26, a group of renegade Sonic fans, isn't satisfied with it. They're busy putting Ugly Sonic back into the movie, with a project called Sonic the Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut, and a trailer for it is set to be released on December 24.A26 originally intended to have the trailer out this week, but they weren't satisfied with the result and pushed the date back a few weeks. \"We wanted Sonic’s animation to feel as fluid as possible, and to be honest, it would have gotten some negative reviews if we’d released it today,\" A26 wrote in a social media post. \"We promise it will be totally worth it, paying tribute to the original design as it always should have been.\"To give you an idea of what you can expect, A26 releases a short GIF of Ugly Sonic jogging inside a washing machine. The project is expected to be released online in 2026. While it's going to be a long wait to see the 2019 cut of Sonic the Hedgehog, you can see the infamous character--voiced by I Think You Should Leave's Tim Robinson--save the day in 2022's Chip 'n Dale movie.A fourth Sonic the Hedgehog movie is also in development and scheduled for release in March 2027, followed by a \"Sonic universe feature\" that will hit theaters on December 22, 2028.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

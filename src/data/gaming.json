    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nBy \n    Eddie Makuch\n   on January 5, 2026 at 12:19PM PST\n              \n          \n                In 2025, Microsoft canceled an upcoming title at The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios, and it has now come to light that studio boss Matt Firor resigned because of this.He said in a post on LinkedIn that when it comes to him leaving the studio, \"the most obvious explanation is the correct one.\"The game, which was in the works under the working title Project Blackbird, was \"the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation,\" he said.\"My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry,\" he said.Firor did not elaborate any further on Project Blackbird. A report said it had been in some stage of development since 2018 and that it might have been a cross between Cyberpunk 2077 and Destiny.Following the game's cancellation and layoffs at the studio, some affected workers started new studios, including the employee-owned Sackbird Studios.\"After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets,\" CEO Lee Ridout said about the formation of the new studio.After working at ZeniMax for 18+ years, Firor is now \"advising some projects and start-ups,\" he wrote on LinkedIn. He also said he has \"made some investments in small teams....\" Some have wondered if Firor may start a new studio, but he said he has \"not yet seriously contemplated\" this.The cancellation of Project Blackbird came as part of wider cuts at Xbox. Rare's Everwild was also canceled, as was the new Perfect Dark from The Initiative--the studio was also closed.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Expedition 33 had previously won both awards, but it was stripped of its Indie Game Awards over AI concerns.Expedition 33 didn't walk away from the Steam Awards empty handed. Voters gave it the Best Soundtrack Award for 2025. Among this year's 11 game categories, Silksong was the only title that won more than just a single award.Beyond that, Steam voters spread the wealth to include fan-favorites Dispatch, Hades 2, Silent Hill f, Peak, ARC Raiders and more. Baldur's Gate 3 even got another award for its post-game updates and bug fixes.The complete list of winners for the 2025 Steam Awards is included below.Game of the Year Award -- Hollow Knight: SilksongDeveloper: Team CherryPublisher: Team CherryRunners-up:ARC RaidersClair Obscur: Expedition 33DispatchKingdom Come: Deliverance 2VR Game of the Year Award -- The Midnight WalkDeveloper: MoonHoodPublisher: Fast Travel GamesRunners-up:PavlovEmissary ZeroF1 25Le Mans UltimateLabor of Love Award -- Baldur's Gate 3Developer: Larian StudiosPublisher: Larian StudiosRunners-up:Helldivers 2No Man's SkyRustDOTA 2Best Game on Steam Deck Award -- Hades 2Developer: Supergiant GamesPublisher: Supergiant GamesRunners-up:Digimon Story Time StrangerBall X PitCloverPitDeep Rock Galactic: SurvivorHades 2Better With Friends Award -- PeakDeveloper: Aggro Crab and LandfallPublisher: Aggro Crab and LandfallRunners-up:Split FictionR.E.P.O.Schedule 1Battlefield 6Outstanding Visual Style Award -- Silent Hill fDeveloper: NeoBards EntertainmentPublisher: KonamiRunners-up: My Little PuppyFinal Fantasy 7 RebirthENA: Dream BBQDoom: The Dark AgesMost Innovative Gameplay Award -- ARC RaidersDeveloper: Embark StudiosPublisher: Embark StudiosRunners-up:Europa Universalis VMage ArenaEscape From DuckovBlue PrinceBest Game You Suck At Award -- Hollow Knight: SilksongDeveloper: Team CherryPublisher: Team CherryRunners-up:Where Winds MeetPath of Exile: The Last of the DruidsElden Ring: Night ReignMarvel RivalsBest Soundtrack Award -- Clair Obscur: Expedition 33Developer: Sandfall InteractivePublisher: Kepler InteractiveRunners-up:DeltaruneRift of the NecrodancerSpider-Man 2Tokyo Xtreme RacerOutstanding Story-Rich Game Award -- DispatchDeveloper: AdHoc StudioPublisher: AdHoc StudioRunners-up:The Last of Us Part 2 RemasteredDying Light: The BeastKingdom Come: Deliverance 2No, I'm Not a HumanSit Back and Relax Award -- RV There Yet?Developer: Nuggets EntertainmentPublisher: Nuggets EntertainmentRunners-up:MegabonkChill with You: Lo-Fi StorySlime Ranchers 2Power Wash Simulator 2    \n  \n                      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Microsoft has announced a new partnership to Hisense to bring the Xbox app to TVs that run on the company's TV operating system, V (formerly known as VIDAA).In essence, the big takeaway here is that people will soon be able to play Xbox games in yet another place, without needing to own an actual physical Xbox. This is possible through Xbox Cloud Gaming, which is included with Game Pass Essential, Premium, and Ultimate.Your Hisense TV will soon be an Xbox.\"Our vision is to make sure your games, your community, and your achievements are always within reach. Bringing the Xbox app to select Hisense and V homeOS-powered TVs is another step toward making gaming available across a broad range of devices, to meeting you wherever you want to play,\" Microsoft said.Playing Xbox on a Hisense TV won't be here tomorrow, or next week. Microsoft said it will share more details on how this all works \"in the coming months,\" so keep checking back for more.Hisense TVs are just the latest to welcome the Xbox app, as Samsung welcomed the Xbox app all the way back in 2022 to allow people to stream games to their TVs.All of this is part of Microsoft's push to expand the Xbox audience beyond consoles. The company is messaging this with the tagline \"This is an Xbox.\"In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox, but \"playing on Xbox\" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. \"It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it,\" he said.Game consoles usually do not make much money, and if they do, it's not a lot compared to the much more lucrative games and services. This is why Microsoft is pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard. Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

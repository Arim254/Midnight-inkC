Most notably, the 691-piece Supply Llama model is on sale for only $26 (was $40). For an even cheaper Fortnite Lego set, check out the 193-piece Durrr Burger for only $8.79 (was $15). The Durrr Burger is one of two Fortnite sets from last year's launch lineup that Lego is retiring soon. The other one is Peely Bone, which is selling for full price at the moment. The other two Fortnite Lego deals are on playsets that launched in June. The 546-piece Durrr Burger Restaurant is down to only $52 (was $65), while the 250-piece Peely and Sparkplug's Camp is up for grabs for $18.39 (was $23.Lego Fortnite Deals at AmazonSupply Llama (691 pieces) -- $26 ($40)Durrr Burger (193 pieces) -- $8.79 ($15) | Retiring soonDurrr Burger Restaurant (546 pieces) -- $52 ($65)Peely & Sparkplug’s Camp (250 pieces) -- $18.39 ($23)The four largest Fortnite Lego sets are selling for full price at Amazon, including the recently released 2,503-piece Mecha Team Leader robot. That said, if you're interested in both the Supply Llama and the 954-piece Battle Bus, Walmart has restocked an exclusive Lego Fortnite 2-in-1 Bundle for $110 (was $140). Since the Battle Bus retails for $100, you're essentially paying $10 for the Supply Llama.                                                                                                                                               Lego Fortnite: All Building Sets & DealsAmazon | Walmart | Lego Store | Target | Best BuyLego Fortnite Building SetsHere's the full Lego Fortnite series as of October 2025. We included a detailed breakdown for all eight Fortnite Lego sets available at major retailers below, and we'll continue to add to this roundup as more playsets and display models are revealed.Supply Llama - 691 pieces (77071) -- $26 ($40)Durrr Burger - 193 pieces (77070) -- $8.79 ($15)Durrr Burger Restaurant - 546 pieces (77076) -- $52 ($65)Peely & Sparkplug’s Camp - 250 pieces (77075) -- $18.39 ($23)Mecha Team Leader - 2,503 pieces (77078) -- $250Peely Bone - 1,414 pieces (77072) -- $92 ($100)Battle Bus - 954 pieces (77073) -- $100Klombo - 1,084 pieces (77077) -- $110Drift & Raven BrickHeadz Figures - 280 pieces (40884) -- $20With the exception of the Lego Store-exclusive BrickHeadz figures, all Lego Fortnite sets include a QR code on the instruction manual to redeem a free cosmetic for Lego Fortnite the video game. The four launch sets come with the same bonus--Operation Brite Starter Pack--but each of the four sets released this year includes a bonus that is unique to that product.If you also like Minecraft, you should check out Amazon's deals on popular Lego Minecraft sets, including the first-ever discount on The Creeper and the biggest discount yet on The Crafting Table diorama. The latter is the only Minecraft set designed for adults, and it's scheduled to retire soon.                                                                                                      Lego Fortnite Supply Llama (691 Pieces)                                                                $26 (was $40)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Supply Llama has been Fortnite's main mascot since launch, and this set lets you piece together your own Llama Piñata out of Lego bricks. You probably don't want to smack it with a baseball bat or stick, though.The 691-piece Supply Llama Lego set is 9.5 x 3 x 6 inches and has a saddle compartment to store seven accessories: Grappler, Slurp Juice, Rough Ruby, Good Luck Charm, Slap Juice (two bottles), Dynamite, and Back Pack. The Supply Llama's mouth can move, too.The Supply Llama was a launch set, so you'll get the Operation Brite Starter Pack bonus.Even at its full $40 price, the Supply Llama is cheaper than many licensed sets with around 700 pieces. The current $26 deal price makes it an absolute bargain.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite: Durrr Burger Restaurant (546 pieces)                                                                $52 (was $65)                                                                                                                                                                                    The 546-piece Durrr Burger Restaurant launched in June as the first building from the world of Fortnite to be turned into a Lego set. The completed restaurant--well, it's more like a half-restaurant--measures 10.5 inches tall thanks to the buildable Durrr Burger attached to the restaurant's sign. It's 7 inches wide and 3.5 inches deep.Inside the restaurant, you'll build a cash register, soda machine, and condiment station for your minifigures. The two-story build has an attic with a storage container for accessories like a shovel and dynamite. The build is modular, so you can remove the attic and rearrange/combine with other Fortnite Lego sets. On the outside, there's a drive-thru menu and a decorative spicy pepper plant.Durrr Burger Restaurant includes four minifigures:Beach BomberBeef BossGrimeySkeletonThe bonus in-game item for this set is a Beef Boss Outfit.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite Durrr Burger (193 Pieces)                                                                $8.79 (was $15) | Retiring Soon                                                                                                                                                                                    This 193-piece build recreates the mascot from the in-game fast food restaurant. The Durrr Burger Lego set is 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 inches, so it's substantially smaller than most of the building sets in the Lego Fortnite lineup. That said, it's on sale for only $8.79 and includes Operation Brite Starter Pack. The Durrr Burger is one of two Fortnite Lego sets scheduled to retire soon.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite: Peely & Sparkplug’s Camp (250 pieces)                                                                $18.39 (was $23)                                                                                                                                                                                    Peely & Sparkplug's Camp is a 250-piece set with a buildable workbench and campfire in the remnants of a destroyed structure. The main draw of this budget-friendly playset are the characters. It has a buildable wolf with posable legs, a small Supply Llama, and three minifigures with accessories: Peely with a sword, Skeleton with a pickaxe, and Sparkplug with a torch.The budget-friendly playset includes the Sparkplug rare outfit as a bonus in-game item.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite: Mecha Team Leader (2,503 pieces)                                                                $250                                                                                                                                                                                    Mecha Team Leader is the most complex and detailed build in the Lego Fortnite lineup. The completed 2,503-piece figure is 17.5 inches tall and is chock-full of references to other characters and places in Fortnite. Just like in the game, the formidable robot is an amalgamation of five different styles. The robot's blue left leg features a Durrr Burger foot, while the right leg is inspired by Uncle Pete's Pizza Pit and ends with a Tomatohead foot.Mecha Team Leader's right arm is even more chaotic, as the Rex inspiration makes it look like a dinosaur is wielding the Sword of Singularity with its teeth. The left arm is modeled after the legendary fox Drift. The beautiful absurdity of the design is rounded out by the Cuddle Team Leader-inspired head and chest armor. Mecha Team Leader is basically a killer robot teddy bear. Sid from Toy Story would be impressed.The Lego version of Mecha Team Leader has articulated hips, arms, feet, and a rotating head. A hatch on the robot's chest opens to reveal a cockpit for the included Cuddle Team Leader minifigure. The figure can also be displayed next to the buildable name placard.The set includes two bonus outfits for Lego Fortnite the video game: Mecha Team Leader and Mecha Team Shadow.Despite Mecha Team Leader's many callbacks to Fortnite lore, this set probably has the broadest appeal of any in the lineup. It would probably look cool on a display shelf next to Lego's Optimus Prime Transformers build. Ironically, Mecha Team Leader launched the same day as Soundwave, the latest addition to the Lego Icons: Transformers lineup.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite Peely Bone (1,414 Pieces)                                                                $100 | Retiring Soon                                                                                                                                                                                    Prior to Mecha Team Leader, the Peely Bone buildable statue was the elaborate build in the series. The 1,414-piece display model was one of the four building sets that launched the Lego Fortnite series last fall. Like Mecha Team Leader, Peely Bone is packaged in a black box, which means it's geared toward adult collectors and experienced builders.When fully pieced together and connected to the buildable stand, Peely Bone is over 14 inches tall and wields the Peely Pick Pickaxe and Paint Launcher. A Banana Bag Back Bling attaches to his back.The included stand with a placard on the front may make Peely seem statuesque, but you can move the figures arms and bend the wrists to create different poses.Peely Bone's half-skeleton, half-banana has a practical benefit here for those who enjoy dynamic builds, as you're working with entirely different pieces on each side. Plus, Peely Bone simply looks awesome, and the Lego replica is quite clever from a design perspective.Peely Bone, like all of the Lego Fortnite launch sets, includes the in-game Operation Brite Starter Pack bonus.At 1,414 pieces, the $100 build offers pretty great value, but as mentioned, Peely Bone is retiring soon.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite Battle Bus (954 Pieces)                                                                $100                                                                                                                                                                                    The Battle Bus is a 954-piece set that recreates the game's signature balloon-propelled flying bus. The detailed model of the Battle Bus is 11 x 11 x 5 inches. It wouldn't be the Battle Bus without players to drop on the battlefield, so the playset comes with nine Fortnite minifigures, each of which is armed with a weapon and can be seated in the bus:Adventure PeelyBattalion BrawlerBrite BomberCuddle Team LeaderCube AssassinMeowsclesRavenTrespasser EliteDriftThe cleverly designed balloon is actually an attachment that, along with the roof, can be removed from the bus when you want to access the interior seating. Accessories include Slap Juice, the Grappler, Slurp Juice, and several Pickaxes. The wheels turn, so the Battle Bus  could join your next Lego Mario Kart or F1 race.The Battle Bus comes with the Lego Fortnite Operation Brite Starter Pack to redeem in the video game.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite: Klombo (1,084 pieces)                                                                $110                                                                                                                                                                                    Klombo is the largest Lego Fortnite playset so far at 1,084 pieces. Nearly all of the pieces in the box are used to build the six-legged creature that is essentially a dinosaur. It has an impressive number of interactive components. He's essentially an action figure, as he has the following posable features:Mouth opens/closesTurnable headArticulated legs (all six)Adjustable spikes/hairRotating tailKlombo is accompanied by two minifigures, Adventure Peely and Oro. You can connect the figures to Klombo's back, or they can feed the dino with the included Klomberry bush accessory with removable berries.The set includes the Island Adventure Peely in-game outfit as a bonus.

This update includes some decent gun buffs, and the new Dresden 9mm submachine gun and Merrick 556 assault rifle are both worth leveling up and using. In this guide, we'll provide some recommended loadout recommendations for Season 6 of Warzone.Season 6 is themed around Call of Duty's annual The Haunting event for Halloween. The update launched with a brand-new battle pass, which added spooky cosmetics and The Predator as a playable operator. Black Ops 6 multiplayer has new maps and modes, including a slasher-themed mode that gives you the opportunity to play as Jason Voorhees or Chucky. Make sure to check out all the highlights for Season 6 of Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Additionally, the Season 6 patch notes can be viewed here.All our recommended Warzone loadouts can be viewed below, and we also have suggested Season 6 multiplayer loadouts.Kilo 141The Kilo 141 remains one of the most popular and easy-to-use assault rifles in the game. This gun is a great pick for both standard battle royale and Resurgence modes. The recommended attachments will help improve the gun's damage range and bullet velocity, as well as boost the ammo count.Recommended Kilo 141 attachments:Optic: Willis 3xMuzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: Reinforced BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripMagazine: Extended Mag IIMerrick 556Season 6's Merrick 556 assault rifle is unlocked in the free version of the battle pass, and this is a solid pick for mid-range fights in Warzone. It definitely has a bit more recoil than the Kilo 141, but the recommended attachments will make this recoil manageable.Recommended Merrick 556 attachments:Optic: Willis 3xMuzzle: CompensatorBarrel: Gain-Twist BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripMagazine: Extended Mag IIABR A1The ABR A1 assault rifle is another option for Season 6. This three-round burst rifle packs a punch, and it has a built-in scope, so you don't have to waste an attachment on an optic. This is a solid pick for long-to-medium range combat, especially when playing big map matches on Verdansk.Additionally, if you don't like the built-in scope on the ABR A1, you can swap the recommended muzzle attachment for a different optic like the Willis 3x.Recommended ABR A1 attachments:Muzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: Reinforced BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripMagazine: Extended Mag IStock: Infiltrator PadFFAR 1The FFAR1 assault rifle offers a very fast time-to-kill, and it makes a solid pick for a sniper support gun to pair with the HDR or whichever sniper rifle you prefer. The recommended attachments will help manage recoil, boost the ammo count, and increase the damage range and bullet velocity.Recommended FFAR1 attachments:Optic: Kepler MicroflexMuzzle: CompensatorBarrel: Reinforced BarrelUnderbarrel: G-GripMagazine: Extended Mag IDresden 9mmSeason 6's new Dresden 9mm is basically the iconic MP40 submachine gun renamed for Black Ops 6. This submachine gun is powerful and feels great to use in close-quarters combat. The recommended attachments will help boost the damage range and bullet velocity, as well as reduce some of the weapon's recoil.Recommended Dresden 9mm attachments:Muzzle: CompensatorBarrel: Long BarrelMagazine: Extended Mag IRear grip: Quickdraw gripStock: Infiltrator StockC9The C9 is another strong choice for close-range weapons in Season 6 of Warzone. The recommended attachments will help increase the damage range and decrease the gun's recoil.Recommended C9 attachments:Barrel: Long BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripMagazine: Extended Mag IIRear Grip: Ergonomic GripStock: Balanced StockHDRThe HDR is still the most powerful and most popular pick for Warzone in Season 6. The recommended attachments are mostly the same for a standard build of the gun, but Season 6 does feature night maps for Verdansk and Rebirth Island, making thermal scopes much more viable to use.If you want to try a thermal scope, swap the rear grip for either the Otero Thermal 2x or the Thermal 6x. They both offer different visuals, and while the 6x is preferred for the long-range fights on Verdansk, either can be beneficial on the night maps.Recommended HDR attachments:Muzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: Gain-Twist BarrelUnderbarrel: Lightweight BipodRear Grip: Quickdraw GripFire Mod: 108MM Overpressured    \n  \n                      "

Daredevil joins the roster, adding to the massive selection of Duelists on the Marvel Rivals roster. While he might not have the same explosiveness as Black Panther or Magik, Daredevil is a dive powerhouse in his own right, and his radar sense can keep your team from getting flanked.Daredevil overviewDaredevil is on the beefier end of Duelists, with a base HP of 300, allowing him to take some hits as he closes the distance on opponents. While playing Daredevil, you will have to deal with a pinkish outline of the map and enemies, with the \"normal\" vision limited to relatively close. Daredevil can see enemies that are moving through walls within a certain distance, whom he can tag with his Sonic Pursuit ability. This gives Daredevil a speed boost when closing in on the target and allows for a dash once they are within range that blinds.As for attacks, Daredevil wields his Billy Clubs, which have a close-range attack pattern and build Fury upon attacking enemies. Daredevil also has the Devil's Latch, which is another movement ability, grappling Daredevil towards either his target or whatever part of the environment he hits, also building Fury. Fury can be used to activate his Infernal Fury, which lets you either use the Devil's Chain, a close-range attack that grants bonus health based on damage dealt, or Devil's Throw, a ranged ability that can ricochet and slow hit enemies. His ultimate, which creates a large AoE, damages enemies within Daredevil's sight and blinds them, while constantly building Daredevil's Fury meter.Daredevil abilities and team-upsJustice Jab (primary): Swing Billy Clubs forward. Gain Fury on hit.Righteous Cross: Cross your Billy Clubs and surge forward. Gain Fury on hit.Objection!: Whirl Billy clubs in a tight guard to block frontal damage and reflect projectiles, becoming immune to all incoming harm during this stance and gain Fury.Devil's Latch: Fire a grappling line that reels Daredevil and his target toward each other. On completion, gain Fury and temporarily enable Cross Interrogation.Infernal Fury: Expend Fury to unleash Devil's Chain or Devil's Throw. Devil's Chain converts damage into Bonus Health, while Devil's Throw Slows enemies on hit and temporarily enables Cross Interrogation.Sonic Pursuit: Locks onto a target, gaining increased Speed and Damage Reduction when attacked. While in range, dash to the target, Blinding them and restore Fury.Radar Sense (passive): Detect enemy movements within a set radius.Blind Ascent: Run along walls and spring off them to reposition.Let The Devil Out (ultimate): Embrace the Beast within. Enemies in Daredevil's line of sight take damage and suffer a ramping Blind effect. Continually gain Fury while active.Blind Verdict (team-up): Daredevil shares the location of his Sonic Pursuit target with The Punisher. At the same time, The Punisher can launch a devil-infused shock grenade to damage and blind enemies.Hand-to-hand combatOutside of Daredevil's ultimate and the occasional favorable ricochet from Devil's Throw, he excels in one-on-one combat the best. The attack combo follows a relatively simple flow. Start with the Sonic Pursuit, use the dash to get in close, and start wailing on them with Infernal Fury into Devil's Chain. In between uses, you'll need to rebuild Fury with basic attacks, but continually using Devil's Chain will give you bonus health, which should make it easy to win a one-on-one fight against most non-Vanguard enemies. If an enemy starts to run, close the distance with Devil's Latch or finish them off with a Devil's throw.A master of defenseDespite being designed with a dive playstyle in mind, Daredevil works well as a defensive counter to a dive-heavy opponent. Because Daredevil can see nearby enemies through walls--as long as they are moving--he can play defense for your Strategists on the backline, intercepting incoming attackers before they have a chance to take out your supports. While he won't replace anti-dive Duelists like Namor fully, he can run enough interference to keep your team moving forward on offense.Let the devil outDaredevil's ultimate ability, Let The Devil Out, is as much about crowd control as it is about finishing off opponents. It does a low amount of damage continuously to enemies within his vision, so it can be used to take out escaping opponents or to take out a bunch of enemies that are low. Since it has a large AoE effect that is visible to opponents, most people will try to flee out of range once you use it, which can be used to push enemies back or to get them off an objective. The damage by itself isn't going to take out enemies by itself, so you will need to keep beating down with your Billy Clubs, but it's enough damage to throw your opponents off temporarily.    \n  \n                      "

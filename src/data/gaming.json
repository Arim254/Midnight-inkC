Stasis, the award-winning sci-fi horror adventure from The Brotherhood, is free to claim until Monday morning over at GOG. The game combines a gruesome, story-driven narrative with classic point-and-click gameplay, inviting players to explore, combine items, and solve puzzles in a chilling, retro-inspired setting.Set in the distant future aboard the derelict spaceship Groomlake, Stasis follows John Maracheck as he awakens from cryogenic sleep in excruciating pain, separated from his wife and daughter. With time running out and the ship sinking into Neptune's dense methane clouds, John must uncover the horrifying truth behind the facilityâ€™s experiments. The game's isometric perspective and richly detailed 2D environments create an immersive sense of dread and isolation.          Stasis features a cinematic score by Mark Morgan (most notably known for his work on Fallout and Fallout 2), a slew of characters to interact with, and a range of realistic and challenging puzzles. Originally released in 2015, it won the Aggie Award for Best Adventure Game. For a limited time, players can experience the game for free, making it an ideal choice for Halloween-themed gaming.If you're looking for more to play, check out our list of the best free horror games, which features everything from puzzles to creepy farm sims\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                After 82 straight days of near-constant play, one Fortnite player has done something no one else has claimed before, as far as they know: reaching level 7,000 without cheating. The player, known as Terns on X and Canada in-game, documented the climb throughout the season, posting the milestone on social media this week.The achievement, however, doesnâ€™t mean much tangible at all. Fortnite caps meaningful rewards around level 200, and higher levels donâ€™t grant extra items, bonuses, or skill advantages. The main payoff is appearing on a leaderboard and having something to brag about--though even that isnâ€™t respectable. Terns also admitted that most of their progress came from playing against bots rather than real players.22+ hours a day82 days7,000 levelsAfter a LOT of grinding, I've finally reached my goal and if I'm correct, the only grinder to ever reach level 7,000 legitimately without glitches or account sharing. Thank you for all your support. ðŸ§¡ pic.twitter.com/Ap7qoiT1R1  â€” Terns (@TernsCheese) October 28, 2025              \"I mostly played Reload this season to get my levels,\" they told GameSpot. \"I used 'bot lobbies,' which are an Epic-supported thing, where every enemy in your game is an AI player and it is easier to kill.\"Ternsâ€™ post was met with ridicule across social media, with many users questioning how anyone could dedicate that much time to anything, let alone a single season of Fortnite.\"Thatâ€™s honestly pathetic,\" one commenter wrote. \"Playing nearly three months with no sleep just to say no one has played as much Fortnite as you ... this is just grinding the same thing for weeks making your brain go numb so a bunch of 12-year-olds can go 'woah.'\"According to Terns, the upper ranks of Fortniteâ€™s leveling leaderboards are often dominated by players who use exploits to boost their stats.These levels will reset at the end of the season.\"Others are cheating to grind, and itâ€™s mostly the same few people every time,\" they said. \"There are teams and clans of glitchers who cheat and try to ruin leaderboards and the integrity of grinding every season.\"Epic Games occasionally patches these exploits, but Terns says cheaters quickly adapt. Their drive came from a small Discord community of like-minded players who talk about leveling up for hours on end.\"Iâ€™m mainly motivated by talking to other grinders in my own Discord server,\" they said. \"We often sit in voice chats together, laughing and discussing XP all day.\"We're fastly approaching the 10-year anniversary of the launch of Fortnite battle royale and Epic's creation is still gripping players like Terns. It helps that the gaming supergiant continues to update the game with content like a new Simpsons-themed season.Terns has been playing Fortnite since Chapter 1 Season 9 and has spent years grinding for levels. After hundreds of hours and nearly sleepless nights, they've reached a level that few players--or anyone else--should pursue again.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Themed around the Movember mustache movement--an annual event encouraging the growth of moustaches in an effort to raise awareness around men's health issues--this bundle offers a curated selection of PC games for $20. Proceeds will go to charity, and each game in this bundle will be delivered as a Steam key that can be redeemed on your account.As for the games, the selection includes titles like Schedule I, Mon Bazou, Gloomwood, and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition. Schedule I has been a sleeper hit this year--and one of our favorite co-op games--even if it does revolve around acts that would be illegal in real life. As a small-time drug dealer, it's up to you to build a drug empire and deal with threats to your organization like rival cartels and law enforcement. The game usually costs $20 on its own, so this bundle deal works out to be pretty good value for money, in case you've been thinking of purchasing Schedule I.Anyone looking to revisit the era of old-school shooters will want to check out Dusk, which plays like Quake 2 with a metal soundtrack and horror vibes. The game features three campaigns to blast your way through, and has become a cult-classic over the years with its polished action. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous can consume dozens of your waking hours with its fantasy gameplay, Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story is a charming RPG, and The Corridor is a game about walking down a corridor--no, really.Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle (2025)Schedule IMon BazouGloomwood (Steam Deck Playable)Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition (Steam Deck Playable)Instruments of Destruction (Steam Deck Playable)Men of War 2Hello Neighbor 2 (Steam Deck Playable)Chivalry 2 (Steam Deck Playable)American Truck Simulator (Steam Deck Verified)Dusk (Steam Deck verified)Agent InterceptProdigalWarhammer 40,000: Battlesector (Steam Deck Verified)Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story (Steam Deck Playable)The Corridor (Steam Deck Playable)For another bundle deal, you can also check out Fanatical's Build Your Own Shooter Bundle deal.

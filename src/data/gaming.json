    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Shadow of the Colossus is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, October 18, 2025. Below, we examine the moral complexity of its narrative as told through its silent protagonist.Does a silent protagonist equal a self-insert? The logic of many video games dictates yes. Heroes like Gordon Freeman and Link have been forever silent, only grunting or shouting. Even Master Chief, who does have a voice, obscures his face. Under his mask, there could be anyone there.Despite this common logic, silence is often alienating. Few games embody this better than the works of Fumido Ueda. The protagonists of Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, and The Last Guardian are taciturn, often silent or speaking only a fantastical language, which is either subtitled or not immediately understood. Moments of speech, or even of action outside of player input, are profound and rare.Under the logic of silent identification, these protagonists would be simple, iconographic player stand-ins. Yet Ueda's curated gaps create an empathetic distance from his games' heroes. Over the 20 years since Shadow of the Colossus' release, it has proven its profundity as a moral fable because of its distance from the player.

This video has an invalid file format.     00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!This is not to say that Shadow of the Colossus is uninterested in the video game form. Protagonist Wander's quest is grounded in games past. He seeks to rescue his love from death. To do so, he must slay the titular colossi: massive foes strewn across a forbidden land. The entity spurring Wander on, Dormin, is a voice from the heavens haloed in light. Wander wields a legendary sword--one whose connection with the sun guides him on his quest. In every superficial sense, he is the epitome of a hero. He has a noble quest, a holy tool, and monstrous foes meant for killing.Yet, Wander is the aggressor. For many of the colossi, he must fire his bow and arrow at them to even gain their attention. It is only when he intrudes on their space, and often not until he attacks them, that they will attack him. The colossi bleed black. It spurts from them as Wander stabs them. They moan, flail, weep, and scream as he climbs over and on them. Each colossus has an animal nobility, which Wander murders. Each element is a part of Shadow of the Colossus' rhetoric. Collectly, they change the usual aspects of heroic fantasy into something horrifying.Yet, Wander is not a cypher or a stand-in. Often, games with silent protagonists start from a position of relative normalcy. Think of Gordon Freeman's long train ride to the office in Half-Life, or Link's childhood stomping ground of Kokiri Forest in Ocarina of Time. In Shadow of the Colossus, we start midway through Wander's journey as he travels on horseback over the land. When he arrives and places his love Mono on an altar, we learn only a few things about him. One, he carries an \"ancient sword,\" as Dormin calls it. Two, he is attempting to free his love from death and some curse. Three, his horse Agro is a loyal and courageous companion. There is the suggestion of a life lived outside the bounds of the games. There are things that matter that the player cannot yet see or know about.Furthermore, Wander's exact motivations are shadowy. His relationship with Mono is never depicted. Instead we see how he acts without her. His journey to kill the colossi is strenuous and dangerous both, yet he continues with almost unfailing motivation. The player can direct him to stand over Mono's body on the altar. The camera zooms in, intimate in a way the game rarely is otherwise. Wander's love is profound, and perhaps selfish given how much he will destroy to see it restored, yet we do not witness it, and thus struggle to identify with it directly. Shadow of the Colossus builds this understanding through gestures that accumulate into cascading meaning.Through these gestures, the game takes on a theatrical quality. The player inhabits Wander as an actor might play a role. The player makes some choices, like how often he visits Mono between besting colossi or whether their own skill will define him as a dexterous warrior or a clumsy, though strong-willed, commoner. Yet, the form is set. Wander has made his choices. The player can only interpret them.This is a massive contrast with many other games, which are often concerned with the main character's morality. BioShock and Spec Ops: The Line, for example, use the main character as a player surrogate. BioShock's plot twist emphasizes how little agency the player actually has in the story, turning its hero into a hapless stooge. In Spec Ops: The Line, the player's will to finish the game and protagonist Walker's belief in the importance of his mission are equivocated. As Walker's determination damns him, it implicates the player too. In loading screens and monologues, Spec Ops admonishes the player to stop playing.Shadow of the Colossus (2018)Both these games have a little more under the hood than mere player condemnation, yet there is something shallow about their approach to protagonist morality. The developers themselves are curiously absent from this logic, for example. BioShock's twist has dramatic force, but little emotional heft. The protagonist isn't anyone; he is only a tool. The twist relies on player identification that comes only from absence. Spec Ops: The Line fairs better in this regard. Walker is a character of at least two dimensions. Yet, if he is a character who acts on his own terms, why all this discussion of player complicity? The moral swing cannot quite implicate the player in any real way.Shadow of the Colossus is also interested in agency, but not that of the player--, rather, of Wander himself. BioShock and Spec Ops are both loud. Antagonists Andrew Ryan and John Konrad explain tell the themes to the player in direct terms. Shadow of the Colossus is quiet. Its world is full of empty spaces and empty time. That emptiness leads to an empathetic, though still distant, stance. Through the process of play, the player comes to understand Wander. That process of embodiment is fuzzy, mythical, not simple or reducible. Shadow of the Colossus doesn’t treat the player as a hapless stooge, unable to really understand the situation at hand until the game’s writers offer their magnanimous help. Wander’s wrongdoing is not a twist. That fact allows the player to sit with it, even to embody it for a time.Condemnation is cheap; it is understanding that is hard won and difficult. Though Walker has more voice lines and more writing, Wander still feels more real because his personhood is not attached to the player. Instead, there is a sense of an exchange. We feel for Wander and mourn for him. That relationship has a deeper and more profound bearing on our own morality than simple condemnation. If we ask whether we are guilty, Shadow of the Colossus will always be silent.At the game's end, after a fellowship sworn to stop Wander arrives and seals him within the forbidden land, Wander goes where the player cannot follow. The sealing process has turned him into a child, which the successfully resurrected Mono seems to want to raise. All of Wander's heroics and strength have been sapped out of him. He is now a creature incapable of holding a controller.That ambiguous end is part of what gives Shadow of the Colossus its lasting power. We were Wander's companions for a time. We walked with him. But his fate is his own. So too, is ours.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Aron Garst\n   on October 17, 2025 at 11:40AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                While exploring a spooky house or escaping a killer can be fun on your own, there's nothing quite like playing the best multiplayer horror games and facing off against demons with a few friends by your side. Sometimes screams will be replaced with laughter as you bond over a friend's death or near-death experience. Oftentimes, the fear comes rushing back as soon as you're the last one standing and everyone's survival rests on your shoulders.Quality multiplayer horror games aren't as common as you'd think, though. It's quite difficult to find the right balance between creating fun gameplay and enough scary moments to keep people coming back. Luckily, there are more than enough to keep you entertained during the 2025 spooky season that's taking place right now. Horror is a diverse genre, so be sure to check out the best overall horror games in 2025 and the best horror games on Steam.From gathering evidence to identify ghost types in Phasmophobia, to fighting off hordes of the undead in Left 4 Dead 2, we've compiled a list of the best multiplayer horror games that you can jump into with your friends right now. We're highlighting several cross-play enabled games in this list as well, so you can play with your friends across PC, consoles, and other platforms.PhasmophobiaPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: YesRemember Ghostbusters? Phasmophobia puts you in control of the prep team that goes into haunted locales first. This co-op ghost-hunting simulator tasks players with identifying spirits in haunted locations using a variety of tools. Tension builds as ghosts stalk the team, creating heart-pounding moments. Voice chat integration makes the scares even more immersive, turning every creak and whisper into potential doom.A sensation after its launch in 2020, Kinetic Games' cooperative horror game has received regular updates introducing new maps, ghosts, and items over the past five years. You'll explore haunted lighthouses, high schools, prisons, and even an abandoned psychiatric hospital that made use of some questionable treatments when it was operational. It's no wonder some angry spirits got left behind.Special events bring cosmetics, community-wide scavenger hunts, and decorations throughout the year, and the celebrations include Halloween. Make sure to jump in to see how the haunts are different for the spookiest time of year.Lethal CompanyPlatform: PCOriginally developed in Roblox by solo creator Zeekerss, Lethal Company blends survival horror with chaotic gameplay. Players navigate unpredictable hazards while managing tense objectives, resulting in a mix of panic, strategy, and dark humor. Its multiplayer antics make the scares as entertaining as they are frightening.You are placed under the supervision of The Company, where you're tasked with collecting as much loot as possible from a variety of dangerous planets. You'll land a safe distance away from facilities crawling with creatures of all shapes, sizes, and temperaments--many of which will kill you at a moment's notice. Work together, gather and return loot, upgrade your equipment, and do it all again.Lethal Company, which originally launched in 2023, has seen a handful of updates that have given company employees access to new tools like trucks and teleporters. Those updates have also brought new creatures into the fray, like mischievous kidnapper foxes and protective mother birds.REPOPlatform: PCREPO is all about surviving while collecting. Similar to Lethal Company, players must move quickly to meet quotas while avoiding deadly threats, making every decision crucial. Multiplayer adds an extra layer of intensity, as coordination and quick thinking can mean the difference between life and death.You'll play as one member of a team as you scour different locales for valuable loot. REPO adds another layer of comedy with an even more ridiculous physics system. Much of your cooperative efforts will be figuring out how to lift gigantic statues and carefully navigate them down hallways so they aren't damaged and lose value. The majority of the time you'll probably end up dead while trying, though.Dead by DaylightPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo SwitchCross-play: YesA modern horror classic, Dead by Daylight pits one killer against four survivors in tense, asymmetrical gameplay. A gigantic roster of licensed killers and victims, including everyone from Nicolas Cage (playing himself) to the demogorgon from Stranger Things, will help you live out your wildest horror fantasies--or die trying.Dead by Daylight may not be the first asymmetrical horror game, but it is one that undoubtedly catapulted the popularity of the genre to heights we've never seen before in multiplayer horror. Released in 2016, Behaviour Interactive's creation still boasts tens of thousands of active players at any given moment on Steam. It's proven to be a horror experience with a ton of staying power.The Texas Chain Saw MassacrePlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: YesIn this multiplayer adaptation of the iconic franchise, three players control Leatherface and his family while four others try to escape from various maps with all of their limbs intact. The game balances tense chases with destructible environments, creating a brutally immersive horror experience that captures the film's intensity. It's a memorable spin on asymmetrical horror gameplay, especially as it added to the lore of the films by fleshing out the iconic Sawyer family with new characters from the mind of the original film's writer, Kim Henkel.While no longer receiving regular updates, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre still has a hefty playerbase that can support solo queueing. It's still best to get together with friends and play to enjoy everything the experience has to offer, though.Left 4 Dead 2Platforms: PC, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: NoThis co-op zombie shooter remains a benchmark for multiplayer horror, even 17 years after its predecessor set the standard. It's often been imitated, but never duplicated. Players must work together to survive hordes of infected across sprawling levels. The AI Director dynamically adjusts the game's difficulty, ensuring that every run feels tense and unpredictable. In Versus mode, players can even become the Special Infected themselves, giving the co-op game a PvP twist.While it may lack the slower, quieter moments often found in traditional horror, few experiences match how engaging, adrenaline-inducing, and chaotic Left 4 Dead 2's multiplayer gameplay can be with a team of friends.Aliens: Fireteam ElitePlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo SwitchCross-play: YesAliens: Fireteam Elite pits squads of Colonial Marines against relentless Xenomorph attacks. Teamwork is critical for surviving waves of enemies, with coordinated strategy and positioning often deciding who lives or dies. The game's intense sci-fi atmosphere amplifies the horror. Built in the vein of something like Left 4 Dead, Aliens: Fireteam Elite pits three players against waves of the iconic aliens across various missions and modes, with plenty of new guns and cosmetics to unlock--should you survive.One thing the game absolutely gets right is capturing the look and sound of the Alien universe. From shadowy industrial corridors to sprawling, hive-like chambers, every level feels true to the franchise.Back 4 BloodPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: YesAfter a less-than-stellar launch, this take on Left 4 Dead zombie horde action has steadily transformed into something truly memorable. Turtle Rock Studios, which includes some of the creators of the original Left 4 Dead, has shaped Back 4 Blood into a cooperative experience that trades in the same anxiety-inducing moments that Left 4 Dead created in players nearly 20 years ago.Back 4 Blood is a strong option for multiplayer horror fans who don’t want to return to something as old as Left 4 Dead. It builds on the cooperative zombie-slaying formula with modern systems and a faster pace. Players choose from a diverse cast of “Cleaners,” each with unique abilities that can change the flow of a match, and use a wide arsenal of weapons that range from brutal melee tools to rifles. The game’s card-based system adds a layer of strategy, letting players customize their playstyle with upgrades and modifiers that affect everything from stamina to ammo capacity.Little Nightmares IIIPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Nintendo SwitchWhile the series is best known as a single-player puzzle platformer, Little Nightmares 3 introduces cooperative elements that don't lose the series' touch for dread-inducing encounters with grotesque monsters.. Players must work together to solve puzzles and navigate its dark, atmospheric world, heightening every suspenseful moment.Little Nightmares 3 is relatively short. Most playthroughs will take around five hours to finish. It's especially good for those who haven't played the first two games, because for seasoned players, it may feel a bit samey, but for those who haven't tried a Little Nightmares before, it makes a great introduction to its mysterious world without relying on any prior knowledge of the storyline.Check out our Little Nightmares III review.DemonologistPlatforms: PCSimilar to Phasmophobia, Demonologist turns players into paranormal investigators confronting supernatural threats. Multiplayer intensifies the suspense, as success depends on coordination, quick thinking, and sharing crucial information while confronting increasingly powerful spirits.Rather than have ghosts live in sandbox environments like Phasmaphobia, Demonologist developer Clock Wizard Games has curated an experience where scares are somewhat telegraphed in more detailed environments that elicit plenty of scares. It's not as well-suited for repeated playthroughs, but still a worthy entry in the growing Phasmophobia-like genre.The Outlast TrialsPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: YesSet in the universe of the single-player Outlast games, Outlast Trials lets players experience survival horror in a cooperative multiplayer setting. Teams must navigate a series of deadly experiments, solve environmental puzzles, and avoid horrifying enemies that can strike at any moment, making communication and coordination essential for survival. You can't fight back. All you can do is run.This multiplayer approach amplifies the already nerve-wracking tension of the series, as players not only contend with the game's terrifying threats but also rely on one another to make it through each harrowing trial. The combination of unpredictable scares, claustrophobic environments, and high-stakes teamwork creates an intense horror experience that keeps players on edge.Even though it's been over two years since release, The Outlast Trials is still getting new content. A PvP mode is being added to the game in October 2025.    \n  \n                      "

This item is a series staple, as it allows you to catch any creature without fail. Of course, getting it requires quite a bit of effort.Table of Contents [hide]How to get the Master Ball in Pokemon Legends: Z-AMable's Research rank and Master Ball rewardMable's Research requests and talliesWhich Pokemon requires the Master Ball just to get captured?The Master Ball comes from Mable's Research. The NPC herself can be found in the Pokemon Research Center in the southern part of the map. You can't miss it since a main quest takes you there fairly early in the campaign.Mable's Research rank and Master Ball rewardThe Pokemon Legends: Z-A Master Ball can be yours upon reaching Rank 49 in the Mable's Research tab. You don't actually need to revisit Mable every time. You can just open the menu and press the X button to obtain rewards as you level up.You need to reach Mable's Research level 49 just to receive the Master Ball.Mable's Research requests and talliesHitting level 49 to get the Pokemon Legends: Z-A Master Ball is no small feat, as it's going to take you dozens of hours. That's because the points themselves come from requests/tallies. Here's what you can expect:You need to complete your Pokedex by catching unique species--i.e. one of each type. We've got you covered in our Pokedex/Pokemon locations guide.The above goes hand-in-hand with surveying Wild Zones--i.e. catching all the Pokemon in each habitat.The \"Catching X-type\" tallies grant points as you capture Pokemon that belong to a particular type/element. A good idea is to buy a lot of cheap Poke Balls so you can catch low-level critters like Pidgey (Normal/Flying) and Budews (Grass/Poison) to fulfill multiple tallies.You also have to unlock dozens of Mega Evolutions.Other objectives and actions, such as resting on benches, winning battles, and smashing Mega Crystals also help boost your rank.And, yes, you might want to find a buddy who wants to do a Link Trade for the extra points.Wild Zone 20, which becomes available after beating the main story, has various starter Pokemon that you didn't pick earlier in the campaign.Which Pokemon requires the Master Ball just to get captured?Since the Master Ball guarantees as 100% capture rate, it's usually reserved for Pokemon that are extremely hard to catch. A good example is Mewtwo from the classic Gen 1 titles.In this game, however, you really don't need it for Legendary Pokemon. Ultra Balls are enough, and even if you fail, you replay the encounter without issues. So, for the most part, you could use the Master Ball if you discovered a Shiny variant of a Pokemon that you really like. Alternatively, you could just keep it in your inventory forever.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on November 27, 2025 at 6:05AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                When it comes to type popularity in Pokémon, Fire is always one of, if not the most popular, types in the community. Whether players love the Fire type starters, the classic Fire types from the early generations, or the new additions that come with every main line game, you can always bet on most players having a Fire type on their team. However, with so many great Fire Pokémon to choose from, which are considered the best in the franchise?Today, we'll be ranking our picks for the best Fire Pokémon to use during a basic playthrough of the main line games. This means that we'll be excluding legendaries, mythicals, and Ultra Beasts from the list; otherwise, they would dominate most of the entries. We'll also be taking into account unique dual typings, where Fire Pokémon originated from, and the abilities they have, among other factors.This list is in rank order from least to most recommended Fire types, but all are solid choices.TalonflameOriginal game: X and YType: Fire and FlyingTalonflame kicks off our list, and it's hard not to have a soft spot for this fiery bird. Its first-stage evolution, Fletchling, is one of the first Pokémon you encounter in the Kalos region, and it can carry you through a majority of X and Y. While Talonflame doesn't have the best base stat total, coming in at 499, it's hugely enjoyable to use, has a decent move pool, and has tremendous speed that comes in handy during any playthrough.ChandelureOriginal game: Black and WhiteType: Fire and GhostNext up is Chandelure, which was the first Fire/Ghost dual type in all of Pokémon when it was introduced in Black and White. Thanks to its Ghost typing, Chandelure has access to moves that most Fire types can never learn. Chandelure also has a massive 145 special attack stat, with a 520 base stat total, which makes it hugely powerful with the right attacks. However, Chandelure does have low HP, so it's a bit of a glass cannon. Regardless of that, though, this is a fantastic and unique Fire type Pokémon.HoundoomOriginal game: Gold and SilverType: Fire and DarkHoundoom is a beloved Generation 2 Pokémon that was the first-ever Fire/Dark dual type in the franchise. It only has a 500 base stat total, but those stats are relatively balanced, allowing Houndoom to excel in a majority of situations. The Dark typing was very powerful in the Gen 2 games thanks to how strong Psychic types were, but Houndoom is a terrific Pokémon no matter what generation you're playing. Of course, if you're playing a game with Mega Evolution, Houndoom has an outstanding Mega form with a 600 base stat total and some devastating moves.Hisuian TyphlosionOriginal game: Pokémon Legends: ArceusType: Fire and GhostWe just talked about Chandelure, the first Fire/Ghost dual type, but now let's cover Hisuian Typhlosion. Cyndaquil is one of the three starter choices in Legends: Arceus, and if you evolve it, you'll gain access to the Hisuian form of Typlosion, which gets the Ghost type at level 36. It has the same base stat total as regular Typhlosion, but its move pool significantly changes. You'll have to deal with a few new weaknesses, but this is a much-improved version over the original Typhlosion. Of course, Gen 2's Typhlosion is pretty strong as well.MagmortarOriginal game: PlatinumType: FireMagmortar was one of the Pokémon that was added in the Platinum Pokédex as a new stage evolution to Magmar. This significantly buffed the Magby line, as Magmortar is a beast of a Pokémon that features a 540 base stat total and an extremely wide move pool in Generation 4 and onward. Magmortar can learn Grass, Electric, Rock, Ground, and Dark type moves, giving it fantastic coverage against all of the weaknesses for a pure Fire typeArmarouge/CeruledgeOriginal game: Scarlet and VioletType: Fire and Psychic/GhostArmarouge and Ceruledge are some of the most unique Pokémon in the entire franchise. You can evolve either one from a Charcadet if you use a specific evolution method involving using a specific kind of armor item. Both Pokémon have the same base stat total, but Armarouge is more of a special attacker while Ceruledge is a tad faster and has better base attack. For a playthrough of Scarlet and Violet, Armarouge is usually going to serve you better thanks to the advantages its Psychic type offers with its high special attack stat, but you can't go wrong with either of the Pokémon.CinderaceOriginal game: Sword and ShieldType: FireCinderace is yet another Fire starter Pokémon, this time from Sword and Shield, and while we could have put Blaziken, Infernape, or Emboar in this spot, Cinderace gets the nod thanks to its prowess in the competitive scene as well as being very useful for a Galar playthrough. While there's a common misconception that Cinderace has the Fighting dual typing, it's a pure Fire type that can simply learn a handful of Fighting moves. Cinderace's biggest strength is its speed, boasting a 119 stat, but it also has great physical attack and passable defense. It's arguably the best starter in Galar, and one of the strongest starters we've had in recent games.ArcanineOriginal game: Red and BlueType: FireArcanine was many Pokémon fans' first love when it comes to the Fire type. It was originally thought that Arcanine was a legendary Pokémon, and there's even evidence that it was supposed to be one, but instead, it's just a stupidly strong regular Pokémon that can be found fairly early on in a Kanto playthrough. Arcanine has a massive 550 base stat total, access to a slew of coverage moves in later generations, and balanced stats across the board.VolcaronaOriginal game: Black and WhiteType: Fire and BugOn the surface, the Fire/Bug dual typing doesn't seem like it would work. There's an extra weakness to Flying, it's four times weak to Rock, and the two types just don't appear like they would mesh well together. However, when Volcarona came onto the scene in Generation 5, all of those preconceptions were tossed out the window. Volcarona is a borderline legendary Pokémon, evolving from Larvesta at level 59, and has amazing special attack, special defense, and speed stats. This makes it nearly unstoppable with the right move combination and opponent.CharizardOriginal game: Red and BlueType: Fire and FlyingWas there really any other choice? While Charizard might not even technically be the most optimal starter choice in Red and Blue (thanks to Venusaur), all of the attention it’s received since those games makes it easily the best Fire type in any Pokémon game. You have access to Charizard's base form, which has a 534 base stat total, along with Mega Charizard X and Y. Mega Charizard X is by far the more popular of the two, as it turns the Pokémon into a blue beast with the Fire/Dragon dual typing. That dual type is extremely rare, and it makes most battles in games with Mega Evolution trivial at best. Charizard is the most popular Fire type and, by all accounts, the best option to use.    \n  \n                      "

It's discounted to just $25 (was $30), so if you haven't yet played the iconic game, this is a great chance to dive in (or snag it as an affordable gift for a friend or family member). The discount doesn't seem like much, but it comes bundled with 3,500 Tokens, which typically cost $20. This version of Minecraft doesn't see many discounts. It briefly dropped its price by a few bucks during the summer, but this Black Friday deal is the best we've seen. If you're looking for a holiday gift for a younger gamer in your life, this is likely a good choice--just keep in mind this discount only applies to the physical PS5 version.                                 Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5)                                                                $25 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    While you'll find Minecraft for $20 at most digital storefronts, this physical edition deal is actually the better offer. Not only do you get a few in-game goodies, but you're getting an additional value of $20 from the 3,500 Tokens. That's a total value of $40 for just $25--and if you know you'll be buying stuff from the in-game store, this is certainly the edition to get. It gets you a physical copy of Minecraft, 3,500 Tokens, and two in-game items: the Popcorn Bucket Hat and Butter Shirt.                      Minecraft has seen massive success over the years, so it should come as no surprise that it's built up an impressive list of accompanying merchandise. And ahead of Black Friday, several Lego Minecraft sets are on sale. These include the 555-piece Ghast Balloon village Attack set, which is down to $56 (was $70), while the Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring is discounted to $41.49 (was $50), and the Trial Chamber is on sale for $32 (was $40).

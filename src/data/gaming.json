The press release described the family as \"three friends chasing big dreams, big style, and a little bit of drama.\" The gallery will also feature a new room to place named the \"In The Bag room,\" which appears to be a large walk-in closet that will allow Sims to show off their luxury handbags in style.In other The Sims news, developer Maxis recently released a statement assuring players that its \"values are unchanged\" following news that parent company EA is looking to sell itself to the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

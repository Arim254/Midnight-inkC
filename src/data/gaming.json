It's also the 25th anniversary of Halo, and to celebrate the occasion, Microsoft is releasing Halo: Campaign Evolved for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.Some are expecting Microsoft to also divulge new information about the company's new console in 2026, but that remains to be seen. In other Xbox news, one of the company's console exclusives, South of Midnight, is coming to PS5 and Switch 2 in 2026. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                A movie based on Activision's Call of Duty series is in the works now at Paramount, which is now led by billionaire and Call of Duty superfan David Ellison. Prolific writer and director Taylor Sheridan is writing the script for the film, with Lone Survivor director Peter Berg attached to direct.Activision had been trying to make Call of Duty movies for years, so why is it finally happening now? Xbox boss Matt Booty told Variety that \"a relationship came about\" between people at Paramount and senior executives working on Call of Duty. \"They felt like they found a partner who understands the game, people who play the game, and shared a vision of what it could be to bring that forward,\" Booty said.Activision originally announced it would make Call of Duty movies through its Activision Blizzard Studios label that was formed in 2015, led by Hollywood producers Stacey Sher and Nick van Dyk, and charged with adapting Activision Blizzard's franchises for film and TV. A Call of Duty movie universe was planned at one point, but, as often happens in Hollywood, nothing ever happened.Also in the interview, Booty stressed that the proposal to make a Call of Duty movie came from \"the game team\" and not as part of an \"abstract\" and \"detached\" process.There isn't much we know about the plot for the Call of Duty movie as of yet, but Booty said he feels confident that Sheridan--one of the best-known, most profilic writers in all of Hollywood--will find a good story to tell.\"I think that the team feels that he's got a good approach to characters and a good approach to story that'll match up with their vision of what a Call of Duty movie [is],\" Booty said.The Call of Duty franchise has been around for 20 years, and the series tells all kinds of different stories throughout its different sub-brands, including Modern Warfare and Black Ops. This is a challenge, but also an opportunity, Booty said.\"There's two decades of Call of Duty--where do you start? Which character do you pick from which branch of the franchise? And so the team has got a vision where they want to go, and I think Taylor Sheridan will be a good match for what they've got in mind,\" Booty said.Recently, Activision sent out a survey asking fans to rank what they want the Call of Duty film to be inspired by. The choices include Black Ops, Modern Warfare, Zombies, or something other than Black Ops or Modern Warfare. Alternatively, Activision wants to know if people would instead want a totally new Call of Duty story to serve as the inspiration for the movie.It's still early days for the Call of Duty movie, and there is no word yet on a cast or release date. The newest entry in the series is Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, a game that failed to match the sales success of Black Ops 6 in some regards, prompting Activision to announce a major shift for the series.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                One of the biggest pieces of news in gaming this year was EA's announcement that it was selling itself for $55 billion to investors including Saudi Arabia. The announcement of the deal has sent shockwaves through the gaming world, and now Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty has commented on the deal, saying the price tag reflects how big video games have come in the global media landscape.\"Games have really become a foundational part of entertainment,\" Booty told Variety. \"And as such, I think we're seeing these valuations and transactions that really reflect their place in modern entertainment.\"The price of the sale \"reflects the value that exists in all of\" the gaming IP that EA owns, including Madden, FC, and The Sims, Booty said.\"I'm certainly not [a mergers and acquisition] expert, but I would look at the value of the transaction really being about the forward-looking value of the IP and the stories and what they've created, even more so than necessarily, the static or rearward-looking value,\" he said.Microsoft is no stranger to big buyouts, as the company purchased Mojang and Minecraft for $2.5 billion, ZeniMax for $7.5 billion, and Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion.The $55 billion would take EA private as part of the biggest Leveraged Buyout (LBO) in history. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would take more than 93% ownership of EA if the deal closes, with Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners and Silver Lake taking the rest.EA would also be responsible for coming up with $20 billion in the deal, and this has prompted concerns that EA will look to cut costs with layoffs, studio closures, and by selling off assets.EA's sale has not been completed, but it's expected to close in 2026, pending regulatory approval and other closing conditions. A group of EA workers has criticized the sale, saying it's unnecessary and harmful to workers. People have expressed concerns that the PIF will seek to avoid \"the gay stuff\" and politics if the deal materializes. For its part, EA has acknowledged that its ability to attract, retain, and motivate developers may be negatively affected by the pending sale.For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the EA franchises that would be sold if the deal closes.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

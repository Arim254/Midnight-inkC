    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In April 2022, developer and publisher Sharkmob officially launched Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt, a battle royale set in White Wolf Publishing's World of Darkness. Players took control of vampires in Prague as they joined rival sects and battled each other with their supernatural abilities and conventional weapons. However, new updates for the game ceased in 2023, and now Bloodhunt's servers are going offline in 2026.Sharkmob announced the news on its site that Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt will have its final death on April 28, 2026. Once the game's servers go offline, the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of this title will no longer be playable.In a message addressed to the Bloodhunt community, Sharkmob shared its gratitude for the game's four-year run.\"When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did,\" reads the statement. \"From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, Bloodhunt has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways. During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to Bloodhunt ... However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable. This has led us to make the difficult decision to take Bloodhunt offline.\"Token purchases have already been disabled, but the in-game store will remain open so players can use the tokens they already have before the game goes offline.Earlier this month, the action-RPG Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 hit PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. There was a 21-year gap between this game and its predecessor, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Famous--or infamous, depending on your point of view--English game designer Peter Molyneux has opened up about his forthcoming and reportedly last game ever, Masters of Albion, calling it a \"redemption title\" for all the years that he overpromised and underdelivered.In an Edge interview (via VGC), Molyneux said that promising his games will do A, B, and C has always led him into trouble when those promises never came to fruition, citing his previous projects like the God game Black & White and the RTS Dungeon Keeper.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Masters of Albion Reveal Trailer\n      \n\"I think that line in Fable--'For every choice, a consequence'--wasn't delivered on well enough,\" Molyneux explained. \"I think the possession mechanic that we had in Dungeon Keeper wasn't delivered on enough. The open-world freedom that we had in Black & White, I think it was good at the start, but it didn't deliver enough at the end. And Masters of Albion is an opportunity to mix all those together. Even though one is an RTS, one is a god game, and one is a role-playing game, why the f**k can't we mix them all together?\"He went on to say that, because Masters of Albion is his last game (primarily due to his drinking and smoking habits), the city-building God game is all about course-correcting for his decades of misleading fans.\"And I don't know if it's going to work,\" Molyneux continued. \"It's so important to me, this game, because to a certain extent it's about redemption. I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn't have said about Curiosity. But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time. And so Masters Of Albion is a redemption title for me. But also, it's my last game. It just is.\"With it being his last game, Molyneux kind of dipped back into his familiar bag again. Although he didn't explicitly say that Masters of Albion will do A, B, and/or C as he's done with his previous games, he did claim that the forthcoming strategy sim is \"nothing you've ever played before.\" Not necessarily a promise, but an indication that Masters of Albion is something special. He went long, calling the game\" significant\" for him:“For me, it's the most significant title that I've ever done, for sure. And I'll tell you the amazing thing--it’s going to f**king work. It really is. It's like nothing you've ever played before, but it's still unbelievably familiar. It is Black & White, it is Dungeon Keeper, and it is Fable, but it's a completely new genre. And it shouldn't really work, but it does. I can't call this a great game. That's the wrong thing for me to say, because if I say in the press, 'Masters Of Albion is going to be a great game,' that's a promise. So I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is, it's a unique experience, which is unbelievably intimate and familiar to any person who played Fable, Black & White, and Dungeon Keeper. If I turn around and say, 'This is going to be my greatest game,' that's when I get in trouble.\"Speaking of getting in trouble, do you remember Bryan Henderson? It's OK if you don't, but the name should ring a bell because he won and never received a \"life-changing\" prize for conquering Molyneux's experimental iOS game Curiosity in 2013. In development for at least three years, Masters of Albion was revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live in August 2024. You build up a town by day with money and resources, and you defend your settlement at night from all manner of creatures, from ghouls to zombies. It doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PC.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Aside from its massive success with Steam, Valve has also benefited from the longevity of Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike 2, which fueled massive in-game marketplaces. However, Dean Hall--the creator of DayZ and Icarus--believes that Valve should be taken to task for using gambling mechanics like loot boxes to monetize Counter-Strike 2.\"It's something I think Valve does not get anywhere near enough criticism about,\" Hall told Eurogamer. \"I'm honestly disgusted with gambling mechanics in video games at all--they have absolutely no place. My challenge to game developers is that if they think these things are not a problem, they make the data available to universities who are crying out to study this stuff.\"Loot boxes have largely fallen out of favor in the industry, especially after many attempts to legislate or ban them entirely. In Counter-Strike 2, loot boxes can contain desirable objects like weapon or armor skins that can be traded or resold for real money. But there is often no guarantee that the loot boxes contain the items players want. If players are spending real money to purchase loot boxes over and over again to find what they're looking for, it could be considered a form of gambling.Earlier this year, Activision's Overwatch 2 restored loot boxes to the franchise, but with changes to increase transparency of how the loot boxes work, as well as offering a guarantee that an item of Rare or better quality can be found in every loot box. Activision's Heathstone helped usher in the age of loot boxes in 2014, and suffered a backlash because of it.Last week, Valve updated the original Counter-Strike, which tanked the in-game re-seller market for weapons, and reportedly wiped out roughly $1.75 billion in value from sellers. Outside of the game, a planned fan-remake of Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike: Legacy, has reportedly run into some trouble with Valve, and may be shut down.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

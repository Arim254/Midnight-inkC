    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The holy grail of Satisfactory is having a perfectly balanced factory, where everything made is used, with your storage emptying at the same rate it's being depleted. But that's not going to happen--you'll have extras. That's what the Awesome Sink is for.What is the Awesome Sink?The Awesome Sink (with Moody Lighting)The Awesome Sink is a building that exists to get rid of all of your extra stuff, rewarding you with tickets based on the complexity of the items. This building is entirely optional, but those tickets can be used in the Awesome Shop to buy things like new cosmetic building parts, walkways, vehicles, and more. There's some really useful stuff in there, so you'd be a fool not to put one up. See the official Satisfactory wiki page on the Awesome Shop for a complete list of available items and ticket values.How does the Awesome Sink Work?You can dump items into the Awesome Sink as quickly as conveyor belts can supply them, so if you have a production line that's pumping out materials at ultra-high volume just for this purpose, the Awesome Sink is ready. You can build multiple Awesome Sinks around your factory, the points they generate are universal to all Sinks, and you can print out your tickets from any Sink at any time. So it's smart to have a Sink in various areas of your megafactory, taking in extra items and turning them for profit. The higher complexity the item, the more points it will generate toward your next ticket. Further, tickets become more expensive with each one generatedFor example, an Iron Ingot generates just two points, while a Crystal Oscillator generates 3,072. A Thermal Propulsion Rocket will generate over 370,000 points.Inside the Awesome ShopHow to get the most out of your Awesome SinkOnce you can get higher-speed conveyor belts attached to your Awesome Sink, it becomes a matter of finding the right ratio of highest points to lowest complexity. For example, Silica and Quickwire are two low-complexity options that can yield a lot of output fast. Later on, you'll need that Silica for manufacturing, so you'll need to shift to some of those higher-complexity items as you continue to progress.There are certain items the Awesome Sink won't accept, such as consumables or radioactive materials, but almost anything else you can produce can go in.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nThis week’s episode moved forward while looking back.By \n    Reyna Cervantes\n   on December 24, 2025 at 12:00AM PST\n              \n                Spoilers for this week’s episode of Fallout ahead.Another week, another episode of Fallout. This week saw lots of use of Lucy’s (Ella Purnell) “Golden Rule” and a look into the politics of the Brotherhood of Steel. In many ways this episode felt like a significant step forward for the series, but it also took its time to honor Fallout’s past. From iconic locations to lore deep cuts , there was no shortage of callbacks. Let's take a look at what “The Golden Rule” had to offer.A Familiar and Friendly PlaceThis week’s episode showed us a flashback of Shady Sands in its prime. While we saw the bombed city in the first season, this season gave us a look at what life was like in the New California Republic settlement before it was destroyed. Longtime fans will recognize Shady Sands as one of the first locations you can visit from the original 1997 Fallout game. Since the series is canon to the video games, its destruction is the city’s eventual fate.Monotony Builds CharacterTypical NCR Combat PatrolShady Sands meets its fate when a mind controlled stranger enters the city with an armed atom bomb. When confronted by Maximus’ father, the stranger keeps muttering a single phrase over and over: “Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.” Fans of Fallout: New Vegas will recognize this line as one used by New California Republic NPCs that didn’t have meaningful dialogue. It’s in-game use is also used to represent their mundane duties and boring patrols, which has led to the phrase being meme’d into oblivion online.Area 51I want to believeMaximus (Aaron Moten) and his Brotherhood of Steel chapter gained a new base of operations this week in the form of Area 51. Though this base hides numerous old world artifacts for the Brotherhood to use , chief among them is an icebox housing an alien corpse. The alien is specifically a Zetan, whose most notable appearance is in the Fallout 3 DLC “Mothership Zeta.” Did you know that you can also encounter them in the Mojave Wasteland in Fallout: New Vegas, too? If you have the Wild Wasteland trait selected, there’s a possibility that a spacecraft with two Zetan’s aboard will spawn. , If not, you’re left wanting to believe.Reclamation DayVault 76's Reclamation Day partyWhen Norm (Moisés Arias) wakes up all of the Vault-Tec Junior Executives in Vault 31, he convinces them that it's Reclamation Day to get all of them to follow him. Reclamation Day, in Fallout lore ,is the designated day when the Vaults open up, permitting all their inhabitants to return to the surface to reestablish society. This is most notable in the game Fallout 76, where players create a resident from Vault 76, the first vault to open up after The Great War and whose inhabitants explored and settled in Appalachia.Power Leads to MadnessLiberty Prime in Magic: The GatheringThroughout the episode, various chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel conspire to stand together against the chapter from The Commonwealth, despite it potentially causing a civil war. Fallout 4 fans will recognize The Commonwealth as the Boston-inspired setting of that entry. The Brotherhood of Steel chapter of that game was led by Elder Arthur Maxson, who was driven mad with power and sought to bring conflict and destruction to The Commonwealth by using the Brotherhood’s freedom enforcing robot, Liberty Prime.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

All box office figures are pulled from Amazon's BoxOfficeMojo.1: The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)Following 1993's poorly received live-action Super Mario Bros. Movie starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, many wondered if Nintendo would ever again attempt to make a Mario movie. Well, 30 years later, the company partnered with Minions studio Illumination to do just that--and the movie is off to a fantastic start. Released on April 5, 2023 the movie quickly earned $377 million worldwide over its first five days and rapidly cleared more than $500 million. It's now earned more than $1.3 billion. The movie features the voice of Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, and Jack Black as Bowser.

Bill Nighy also starred in the film, which featured incredible CGI pocket monsters and some epic fight scenes, including a showdown with Mewtwo.Domestic – $144,174,568International – $289,303,033Worldwide – $449,762,6385: Warcraft (2016)Legendary and Blizzard teamed up to make a Warcraft movie back in 2016, but development began much earlier and went through several changes before it was released.

The Nintendo Store app release comes on the heels of the company's latest financial report. The biggest news from the briefing is that Switch 2 has already sold 10 million hardware units as of September 30. That means the Switch 2 bundle with Pokemon Legends: Z-A isn't included in the data, which obviously should push that number even higher.Other info shared by Nintendo this week is a focus on steadily releasing new movies on the company's game properties. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is set to premiere on April 3, while the live-action Legend of Zelda movie is slated to hit theaters in 2027.In the nearer future, Nintendo has started ramping up marketing for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.

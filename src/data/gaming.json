    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim Need For Speed Unbound, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper starting January 6 and they will remain available until Monday, February 2.NFS Unbound promo art.The most recent Need for Speed game, NFS Unbound, has single-player and multiplayer campaigns set in Lakeshore City, which greatly resembles Chicago. Street racing is a key part of the experience, but so is outrunning the cops. As your \"Heat\" index rises after each race, the police will pursue players with greater intensity as they establish their rep outside of the law. Between races, players can customize their rides and compete in weekly qualifiers to get into the ultimate street racing contest: The Grand.Mickey unleashes his paint brush in promo art for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed.Epic Mickey was a Wii exclusive upon its 2010 debut until THQ Nordic's 2024 remaster, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, brought the game to modern consoles. The visuals and gameplay have been noticeably improved as Mickey Mouse is sucked into the Wasteland where forgotten characters and concepts have languished for decades. This game is one of the reasons why Disney made a deal to gain the rights to Walt Disney's previous creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. And for the first time, Mickey has to come face-to-face with his brother, Oswald, and reconcile with him if he wants any chance of escaping the Wasteland.Promo art for Core Keeper.Core Keeper is kind of a blend of cozy and survival games that allows players to explore a vast cavern that has hidden treasures and \"untold secrets.\" Players can dig for the relics and resources they need to craft tools, build bases, and dive even further into the cavern. To defeat the Titans, players will have to upgrade their skills while tending to their animals, growing their own food, fishing, and even cooking in their spare time. If you haven't claimed December's PlayStation Plus free games yet, make sure to do so before Monday, January 5. December's games include Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Video games offer their own ways to celebrate, from dazzling fireworks to high-speed races and creative parties with friends. Sometimes, getting together virtually is the only way everyone can be together.In Animal Crossing, you can ring in the new year with a sky full of fireworks over your island. Fortnite Creative lets you throw your own custom parties with friends, complete with music, games, and chaos. Mario Kart brings the celebration to the tracks, where fireworks light up the sky as you race across Rainbow Road as the clock towards the new year ticks down.No matter your style, these games turn the countdown into an interactive, unforgettable experience that's perfect for friends and families who can't be together to ring in the new year.Animal Crossing: New HorizonsPlatform: Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: March 20, 2020Playercount: Up to 8 players onlineCross-platform: NoAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the few games that fully commits to New Year’s Eve as an in-game event. On December 31, the plaza transforms with decorations, party favors, sparklers, and a real-time countdown that syncs with the player’s system clock. Isabelle and villagers gather in the square, music ramps up as midnight approaches, and fireworks cap off the celebration.Because islands are persistent social spaces, players can invite friends over to experience the countdown together. Everyone can dress for the occasion, emote, exchange gifts, and wander the island after midnight. It feels less like a mini game and more like a shared holiday ritual, which is why it remains the gold standard for virtual New Year’s parties.Mario Kart WorldPlatform: Nintendo Switch 2Release Date: June 5, 2025Playercount: Up to 24 players onlineCross-platform: NoWe have Mario Kart World listed here, but nearly any Mario Kart game will work. The series is known for gorgeous tracks that feature stunning visual effects, many of which are fireworks that would fit in on any New Year's Eve parade or celebration.Hop online, hit up a few tracks, and if you're up for it--setup a race along one of those courses that feature fireworks just as the countdown triggers. We're talking Crown City or several iterations of Rainbow Road, among others.Mario Kart World does offer custom lobbies that make it easy to connect with friends, but you can also tout Mario Kart out as part of any in-person New Year's Eve party too!Lunar New Year is just a different type of party!FortnitePlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, mobileRelease Date: July 25, 2017Playercount: Up to four players per squad, bigger lobbies in Fortnite CreativeCross-platform: YesWhile Epic Games has been known to feature fireworks in live battle royale lobbies near the end of the year, the real party kicks off in Fortnite Creative. Here you can find player-made game modes that let you play your own way--including custom trivia night mods, prop hunt, and party royale-like modes.Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with hopping from the battle bus together as the remaining hours in the year grow fewer and fewer. WinterFest takes place in Fortnite around the end of December each year, giving the island a snowy backdrop as you fight for your life.Call of Duty: WarzonePlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: March 10, 2020Playercount: Up to 4 in a squadCross-platform: YesWarzone doesn't have the flexibility of something like Fortnite Creative, but its high-octane action makes for some scenes that feel like a New Year's Eve fireworks show. Blowing up helicopters out of the sky or sending trucks off the ground with explosives are little milestones on the way to battle royale victory.Warzone has become more popular than traditional Call of Duty--and for good reason. Battle royale brings the survival element of war that no other Call of Duty has before. Doing so, with friends, at the end of the year is a blast.Final Fantasy XIVPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: August 27, 2013Cross-platform: YesFinal Fantasy XIV excels at player-driven celebrations. Housing districts, Free Company estates, and public hubs often host New Year’s countdowns organized by the community. Players dress up, set off fireworks, and gather around stages while DJs stream music externally.The game’s strength is how social it feels even without official events. Emotes, glamour, and roleplay-friendly systems allow players to turn the night into a true virtual party. It feels communal, intentional, and uniquely festive.GTA OnlinePlatform: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: October 1, 2013Playercount: Up to 32 players per sessionCross-platform: NoGTA Online offers endless locations for hosting a New Year’s party, from penthouses and yachts to nightclubs and rooftops. Fireworks launchers, champagne animations, and curated music help sell the celebration without much effort.Private sessions make it easy to turn chaos into a controlled party environment. Friends can dress up, take screenshots, and roam Los Santos together at midnight, blending sandbox freedom with a party atmosphere.MinecraftPlatform: PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, mobileRelease Date: May 17, 2009Playercount: Depends on server or RealmCross-platform: YesMinecraft is a blank canvas for New Year’s parties. Players can build stages, countdown clocks, and massive firework rigs, then invite friends to explore and celebrate together. Redstone allows for surprisingly elaborate countdown mechanics.Because it is player-driven, each party feels personal. Whether it is a cozy survival world or a creative server spectacle, Minecraft lets groups define what celebration looks like.RobloxPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobileRelease Date: September 1, 2006Cross-platform: YesRoblox thrives on social experiences, many of which are designed specifically for events. Player-creators and professionals regularly create countdown rooms, concert spaces, and dance clubs perfect for New Year’s Eve gatherings.Its accessibility makes it easy to invite large groups, even casual players. Jumping between games keeps the party moving, while social hubs provide a place to gather at midnight.Fall GuysPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, MobileRelease Date: August 4, 2020Playercount: Up to 4 players per squadCross-platform: YesFall Guys feels like a party game by design, with colorful characters and short, high-energy rounds. Friends can queue together and treat matches as playful chaos while chatting through the countdown. The lack of downtime makes it ideal for New Year’s Eve. It keeps energy high without demanding focus, letting players celebrate and laugh together.Some minigames offer the perfect backdrop for a New Year's Eve gathering, including Short Circuit and Hex-A-Terrestrial, complete with a night sky and bright lights to get you in the festive mood.No Man’s SkyPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: August 12, 2016Playercount: Four players per partyCross-platform: YesNo Man’s Sky offers a surprisingly calm party atmosphere. The Nexus serves as a shared social hub, while player-built bases can become private celebration spaces complete with fireworks and emotes. The game works well for laid-back New Year’s parties. Players can explore, take group photos, and ring in the new year against alien skies.Sea of ThievesPlatform: Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: March 20, 2018Playercount: Up to 4 per crewCross-platform: YesSea of Thieves turns New Year’s Eve into a pirate celebration. Crews can sail together, play shanties, drink grog, and fire cannons into the sky at midnight. The trick shots people have been able to pull off by launching themselves out of cannons, across the sea, and onto other ships are nothing short of incredible. Drunken-madness induced incredible, though.Sea of Thieves adventures are less about competition or loot and more about the shared memorable moments created. Even just sailing under the stars can make for a wonderful way to ring in the new year.Deep Rock GalacticPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: May 13, 2020Playercount: Up to 4 playersCross-platform: PartialDeep Rock Galactic leans into rowdy celebration through its Space Rig hub. Players can dance, drink at the bar, and trigger music before or after missions, making it a natural gathering spot. Honestly, the Overwatch-like mining adventure is a blast, but sometimes you don't even need to jump into the action to have a good time.A New Year’s party here feels communal and silly. It is perfect for smaller groups that want something social without leaving co-op gameplay behind.    \n  \n                      "

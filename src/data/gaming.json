    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on December 1, 2025 at 3:07AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                During the construction of any building or structure in Minecraft, your walls are often the first thing you decide to build. While a starting base or simple building might feature a wooden plank wall design, you can create some truly unique walls using the dozens of resources at your disposal in Minecraft. Of course, putting a few blocks on top of each other can qualify as a wall, but to make it stand out, you need to use specific designs to make everything flow together in harmony.Today, we've compiled a list of the best Minecraft wall designs that the community has created. These walls feature different blocks, shapes, and ideas that fit a wide majority of environments, so you can fill out multiple buildings in your base with unique walls found on this list.Blackstone WallReference: RedditBlackstone has continued to be one of the most underrated blocks in all of Minecraft. Its dark gray color scheme matches well with a variety of other blocks that you might have in your base or another building. However, if you use the wall design you see in the image above, you likely won't even notice other aspects of a room.The intimidating yet simplistic wall design fully utilizes the blackstone block and implements some different styles of the block to create a multi-layered wall. This wall can be used throughout your base, but it would look fantastic in a dungeon or as the basis for a mob farm building in Minecraft.Fantasy Castle WallReference: RedditJust because most walls make up a building of some sort, doesn't mean that all walls have that job. Sometimes, you need a wall to enclose your base or separate two areas from one another. If you have that need in your Minecraft world, consider using this fantasy castle wall design. It utilizes different stone blocks to make up a massive gate with a central entrance. There are also grass blocks placed all around the wall's exterior, making it look ancient and one with the environment.Of course, you could trim down the wall design and instead use it as the basis for a building's exterior. If you do that, you'll want to keep the grassy or mossy blocks on the wall, as without them, it just looks like a stone wall.Reference: RedditUtilizing lava inside of your base isn't a new idea, but making an entire wall out of the orange substance is something you certainly don't see in every world. This design places a massive amount of lava inside a glass enclosure and serves as an entire wall in a dining room area of a base. Not only does this make for a fantastic backdrop, but you can also pair it with a unique floor design that we've showcased as well.While this specific design only uses the lava for a single wall, you can easily expand it to an entire room. You don't want to go too overboard, though, as one misclick and your entire base could be destroyed in the blink of an eye.Nether WallReference: RedditWhether you decide to build a base in the Nether or just bring its resources back to the overworld, Nether blocks have a ton of use in construction. A prime example is this wall design, which utilizes unique Nether blocks and even some lava to make a dangerous-looking wall. You can choose to use or omit the lava, but the base of this design is how the Nether blocks are arranged. The small blocks on top and the jutting in and out with the blocks in the center make the entire wall come together.While this design will, of course, look great in the Nether, the dark reds also provide a terrific contrast in the overworld. Using this wall design in your base will make everything around it stand out even more than it already would.Aquarium WallReference: YouTubeOur last wall design is a classic. The idea of building an aquarium inside your base or even using water features isn't new, but it looks fantastic every time you see a new design with those elements. This specific aquarium wall is relatively small, just taking a single block across a wall's corner, but you can easily expand it across any distance you want.The tutorial we've linked shows you the basics of designing this kind of wall. You'll even see how to properly place the plants and fish inside the aquarium, giving you all the tools necessary to take the design and run with it in any direction you wish.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on December 1, 2025 at 3:07AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                When it comes to building a base or one-off structures in Minecraft, you generally don't put too much effort into the floor design. Most players will lay down some stone or wood planks and call it a day, opting to focus more on the framing and exterior design of the structure, as that's what you see more of. However, floors have the potential to completely transform the look and feel of a building, especially when they're done right and with a unique flair.If you can't get the wood plank design for floors out of your head, allow us to help you. We have compiled a list of some well-designed floors that any player can take advantage of in their Minecraft world. The floors are also all drastically different from one another, giving you multiple options for your base and other structures.Built-In FloorsReference: PinterestStarting the list off is a simple yet elegant floor design that features a built-in crafting table surrounded by glass and plants. While the floor we've showcased is situated in a small room, you can expand this design to cover as much space as you need. The idea of building a crafting table, chest, or other bulky object into your floor isn't anything new, but it's also easy to forget.The floor design you see above has decided to go with glass around the crafting table and some other blocks in addition to the wood planks that make up the majority of the floor. However, you can utilize other blocks or designs for the floor itself and the built-in space for your crafting table, chest, or any other interactable object.Cherry and TerracottaReference: RedditSometimes, there are two or three blocks that simply look outstanding when placed together. The floor you see above is made with Cherry Logs, Purple Terracotta, and Muddy Mangrove Roots for the majority of the design. The middle and end blocks are made with End Stone, Chorus Flower, and String. The result of the entire floor is an alluring design that can be utilized in any kind of structure in Minecraft.However, with how dark and mysterious the floor looks, it's perfect for a basement lair or perhaps some kind of potion-brewing room. The floor would also look great in an outdoor setting, especially with some additional lighting.CheckerboardReference: RedditWith how Minecraft's blocks work, a checkerboard design for your floors or even walls is a tried and true choice for many players. However, there are ways to spice up the basic design, and the one we're showcasing certainly takes the checkerboard design to a new level. The floor utilizes a slew of dark wood and terracotta blocks, making for a cozy design that doesn't go too overboard.Of course, you can take the basic checkerboard design and use whatever blocks you want to complete your floor. Make it an RGB floor with different colors of wool or go with a stone checkerboard that looks like something out of a fantasy world.Water FloorsReference: RedditAny kind of water feature is going to be a foundational piece of your structure, but a water floor is something that you don't see too often. The water floor design we're showcasing is implementing some mods in Minecraft, mainly ones that allow you to trim blocks down to single or double strips, but the core idea can still be done in the vanilla version.The design also utilizes a waterfall to continuously fill up the room with water, but you can simply fill the floor with enough water so that it stays still. Either way, having water coursing throughout your floor is one of the most jaw-dropping ways to make your base or structure stand out.Stained GlassReference: RedditFinally, we arrive at possibly one of the coolest and most unique floor and hallway designs you can have in Minecraft. This hallway utilizes an orange-colored stained glass to line the floor and then features lava encased in a unique stone design that reflects off the floor to make it seem like you're walking on lava. Some users on Reddit pointed out that this looks like the lava hallway from the movie The Incredibles, and they're certainly not wrong.You don't have to utilize the lava idea, as using differently-colored stained glass for your floor is more than enough to make it pop. However, if you did go down the lava route, this is the best design to copy, bar none.    \n  \n                      "

But these NPCs aren't necessarily smarter because they're AI. In fact, players have discovered some easy-to-exploit loopholes in the chat model that convinces NPCs to hand over their side-quest loot or money even when you haven't done anything at all.Players on Reddit noticed that the AI-powered chatbot NPCs often put their emotional responses and actions in parentheses. That led to the discovery that telling an NPC that you did something to fulfill their quest inside of a parentheses will cause the NPC to believe you've already done it. And the game rewards players for that deception by having the NPC hand over whatever item they promised the player for their help.At first, I tried to speak normally to the chatbots, but then I realized you have the power of (divine truth) byu/Proximis inWhereWindsMeetWhile Everstone may eventually fix that workaround, it's not the only way to mislead the NPCs. Another user on Reddit found that repeating the NPC's last statement as a question can eventually wear it down until it hands over the item. The user called it, \"the Metal Gear method.\"While the AI chatbots may be technically superior to standard NPC behavior, traditional NPCs wouldn't fall for the same tricks due to their programing. They simply don't have the option to do or say anything outside of their scripted dialogue and actions. The NPCs of Where Winds Fall currently lack those limitations that would have protected them from this exploit.Where Winds Meet had its official launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile earlier this month.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

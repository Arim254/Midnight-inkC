    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                For years, Netflix has told investors that it's serious about investing in the video game industry. But the streamer's ambitions may need to be re-calibrated again. Boss Fight--the studio behind Netflix's Squid Game: Unleashed mobile game--has been shut down.David Rippy, the CEO and co-founder of Boss Fight, shared the news on his LinkedIn page, and shared his gratitude for the experience:\"Thanks, everyone who reached out today,\" wrote Rippy. \"Rough news, for sure, but I'm very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I'm very proud of, including Squid Game Unleashed, which hit #1 in 26 countries. You'll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles--they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me--we're going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there's anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.\"Last summer, Netflix co-CEO, president, and director Greg Peter indicated that the streamer was going to \"ramp up\" its investment in gaming in part to explore new monetization options. Earlier this month, Netflix added five new games--Lego Party, Boggle Party, Pictionary: Game Night, Tetris Time Warp, and Party Crashers--that can be played on televisions with your phone as the controller.Previously, Netflix had even bigger plans for a AAA multiplayer shooter from a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten. However, that game and the studio behind it were closed in 2024. Netflix gaming executive Alain Tascan later told Bloomberg why the streamer pulled the plug on that project.\"I don't want this move to be seen as, 'We're not going to do big ambitious games,'\" said Tascan. \"It was just the genre of the game... I don't think was matching the platform. This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arguably the Microsoft crown jewel franchise, Halo, is coming to PlayStation for the first time. It's true that the sci-fi series has seen better days and may no longer be Microsoft's top-performing franchise, but Halo is basically synonymous with Xbox, and now it's making the jump to PlayStation in a development that would have shocked anyone reading this years ago.Halo will come to PS5 via Halo: Campaign Evolved, the just-announced remake of the 2001 original. It's slated for release in 2026 on PS5, as well as Xbox and PC, featuring brand-new prequel missions, split-screen co-op, new weapons, visual and audio updates, and more. You can read more about Halo: Campaign Evolved in GameSpot's news post.          Halo is not the first Microsoft series to make the jump to a rival platform, as Gears of War--another iconic Xbox franchise--landed on PlayStation via Gears of War: Reloaded in August. Forza Horizon 5 also came to PlayStation this year, while Microsoft Flight Simulator 24 is headed to PS5 this December.Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a new business strategy to launch its own franchises on competitor consoles as opposed to keeping them locked to Xbox as was the tradition for years. The move, it seems, is part Microsoft's reported mandate that Xbox needs to improve profits.Microsoft's releases for PlayStation consoles have been successful thus far, with Xbox games regularly populating the PlayStation sales charts. Xbox president Sarah Bond recently made headlines when she said the idea of exclusive games in 2025 is \"antiquated\" because these days, she said, people expect big games to be available on all devices.Microsoft may be backing away from full exclusivity for its own games, but the company still does give Xbox users preferential treatment for launch timing in some situations. For example, Forza Horizon 6 will launch as a timed-exclusive for Xbox consoles in 2026 before landing on PlayStation sometime later. The announcement of Halo for PS5 is no big surprise, as it's been one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming and had been the subject of leaks and reports for many months.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

These items have a purple glow and they tend to be visible from afar. The goal is to amass a bunch of them so you can obtain Canari Plushies that grant permanent buffs.Where to find all Colorful Screws in Pokemon Legends: Z-AAlmost all Colorful Screws in the game can be found on rooftops or scaffolding/construction sites in Lumiose City. In most cases, they're grouped into clusters--i.e. two or more in the same general location.Do take note that you're going to see these items as you explore the city. However, we suggest progressing further into the campaign until you hit Rank E in the Z-A Royale. This is when Urbain unlocks your Roto-Glide ability. If you press and hold the A button while falling, you'll gain an upward boost, allowing you to reach higher ledges and platforms.Canari Plushie rewards from Colorful ScrewsBefore we discuss the locations of Colorful Screws in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, let's talk about the rewards that are up for grabs: Canari Plushies. The items you collect can be exchanged with an NPC in front of the Racine Construction building at the southeastern corner of the map.The five Canari Plushies have unique effects that are permanent. Their effects can also be improved by purchasing the successive upgrades, which cost more Colorful Screws:Red Canari Plush - Increases the amount of XP earned by your Pokemon. Note that the first tier is automatically granted by an NPC named Tarragon early in the campaign.Gold Canari Plush - Increases the amount of prize money you earn from the Battle Zone.Pink Canari Plush - Increases the amount of Mega Shards you acquire from smashing pink crystals. This currency is used to purchase various Mega Evolution keystones.Green Canari Plush - Makes you less likely to black out--i.e. increases the amount of times you can take successive hits.Blue Canari Plush - Improves your success rate when attempting to catch Pokemon.Colorful Screw locations in southern Lumiose CityThe map above shows the locations of Colorful Screws in the southern part of Lumiose City. We've numbered each cluster accordingly:Location #1: On a scaffolding near the Racine Construction building. There's also another one inside the building itself, which appears once you've beaten Canari as part of your main mission.Location #2: On a scaffolding and the rooftop due west of the Pokemon Research Center.Locations #3 and 4: Several are found on scaffolding and rooftops at the western side of the row of buildings.Location #5 and 6: The first one is directly across a bridge. The second item is off to the side of a garden, but you need to blast an frozen platform with a Fire ability.Location #7: At the top of a construction area in a garden north of Hotel Z.Location #8: On a roof directly west of Wild Zone 2. Location #9: At the top of a construction area north of Wild Zone 2.Colorful Screw locations in northern Lumiose CityThere are several Colorful Screws in the northern section of Lumiose City. As usual, you need to climb higher to reach these areas:Location #1: Due south of Wild Zone 14. Location #2: At the top of the steps across a rooftop cafe.Location #3: On the glass roof of the outlet shops.Location #4: There are three on the scaffolding east of Wild Zone 4. You need to drop down and activate your Roto-Glide to maneuver between the spaces.Location #5: Keep climbing up the scaffolding and roofs west of Wild Zone 8--i.e. the Jaune sectors.Location #6: Several of these items are fairly close to each other. Once you reach the top of the scaffolding, you'll see a glowing item to the left, and another one below the patio. One more item is on the roof of the city hall, but you need to be careful with your Roto-Glide due to the gap.That does it for our guide on where to find Colorful Screws in Pokemon Legends: Z-A.

The latest entry in Nintendo's long-running franchise promises more thrills as you duke it out against rival trainers, all while catching numerous creatures. Of course, given that this is a spinoff/sub-series, you probably want to compare it to mainline titles, too. In any case, our guide has all the details, but please note that there are also minor spoilers ahead.On the average, it should take you roughly 22 to 25 hours to beat Pokemon Legends: Z-A if you're just focusing on the main story. This is par for the course when compared to the previous title, Pokemon Legends: Arceus. However, this estimate is still significantly shorter compared to mainline entries--i.e. the ones that take you across multiple zones/regions--as those can take anywhere from 30 to 40 hours to complete.However, the number skyrockets to roughly 70 to 80 hours for completionists. This includes tackling all side quests, filling up your Pokedex, and unlocking all Mega Evolutions.Note: A speedy completion depends on your team setup. If you have a powerful Pokemon companion, then the rest of your squad can just earn XP passively, and you can use them later when they're more effective against certain opponents.

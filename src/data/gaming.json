    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 30, 2025 at 2:02AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Every new season of Fortnite brings significant changes to the loot pool, but the start of a new chapter is an even more special occasion--each Season 1 brings us a totally new set of weapons and other items. While we usually get to keep the basic stuff--like shield pots and med packs and shockwave grenades--the loot pool is typically pretty unfamiliar. And Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is no different in that regard.In Season 1, we've got a couple weapons we've used before, but the majority of the toys you'll be playing with this season are completely new, and they feel pretty different compared with the guns we've used in the past few seasons.These are the returning items in the loot pool in Chapter 7 Season 1:Tactical PistolEnforcer ARDual Micro SMGsDynamiteGrenadesBeyond those guns and items, you'll be looking at a bunch of totally new stuff. Scroll on to find out more about the new weapons.Forsaken Vow BladeObtained by visiting a training rift and being granted one by Beatrix Kiddo herself, the Forsaken Vow Blade combines elements of both of Fortnite's past katanas, the Typhoon Blade and the Kinetic Blade, with a dash attack that makes it an effective movement item.Arc Lightning GunInstead of bullets, this mini-gun fires off a stream of electrical current that melts anyone at close range. Vengeful SniperSeason 1's only sniper rifle carries three rounds per magazine, and since it's the only gun in the loot pool that isn't hitscan, it features some pretty heavy bullet drop that you'll need to account for.Holo Rush SMGThe Holo Rush is, as the name implies, a scoped SMG with pretty decent range--it can shoot further than the Arc Lightning Gun, for one thing.Deadeye Assault RifleThis scoped assault rifle is best at mid-to-long ranges, though it can hit pretty hard if you need to spray it in an emergency. This one shoots like if Fortnite's old Heavy AR had a scope on it, which makes it very deadly indeed.Twin HammersThese dual pumps actually combine for a fairly healthy fire rate, so you can treat the pair more or less the same way you would a single auto shotgun. Iron Pump ShotgunThis season's pump shotgun handles very smoothly, does solid damage without being overpowered, and it's got a little bit of range. So it may be every sweaty gamer's best friend by the end of the season. WingsuitThis season's new movement gimmick is essentially a weaker version of Iron Man's Flight Kit--it has the same vertical takeoff, but once you're up in the air you'll actually glide back down to the ground instead of being able to fly around willy nilly. Just be warned you trail smoke when you use a wingsuit, and so you'll be visible from pretty far away.Boss kitsInstead of medallions, boss NPCs now drop boss kits that allow you to wear their skin and use their combat gimmick. Just be warned that once you pick one of these up, you're stuck with it until you die or the match ends. And, yes, it does use one of your inventory slots.     \n  \n                      "

The Fortnite-original Melodie Mars skin is unlocked instantly when you purchase the pass, and the Rockstar Lisa skin is the final reward in the pass, she's got a reactive back bling on the pass as well.Those Icon emotes are a pretty surprising inclusion, as there have only been three total Icon emotes included in the previous 11`music passes. To have two of them on one music pass is very unusual. It would be cooler, however, if the emotes actually featured songs that were well known.One of them is called Latata, which is also the name of a well known Kpop song released in 2018--but this emote uses a different, unrelated song called Latata that is not even slightly popular. The other, which uses Can't Get Enough by Krysta Youngs and NiiWHA, is only slightly less obscure. These two tracks have fewer than 5,000 total listens combined on YouTube Music as of November 29.Of the eight jam tracks included in the Starlux pass, four are licensed and four are Epic-produced tracks. These are the licensed tracks.Get Jiggy by B Jack$, Zeddy WillDashstar* VIP by Knock2Sorry by Justin BieberF*** Up the World (Vixi Solo Version) by LisaIn all, the Starlux music pass includes 30 items, including eight that don't require buying anything, with one reward unlocking each two account levels you earn in any Fortnite experience.

The 2TB Seagate Expansion Card is discounted to $184.76 (was $260), and the 4TB model is down to $380 (was $500).

This one isn't an official Cyber Monday deal, but it is discounted to $121.19 (was $160).1TB -- $121.19 ($160)2TB -- $184.76 ($260)4TB -- $380 ($500)Seagate's Expansion Card is one of two officially licensed storage upgrade options for Xbox Series X|S. Western Digital makes the other one, but the WD Black C50 isn't available for as low of prices right now. The C50 512GB is $80, the 1TB is $135 (was $150), and the 2TB is $216.19 (was $230). The 1TB model was $100 during Amazon's early Black Friday sale.If you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, you've probably noticed how fast those hundreds of usable gigabytes can be claimed by games. and updates. This is especially true if you download AAA games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, The Outer Worlds 2, and Ninja Gaiden 4, to name a few recent releases.                      Seagate's Expansion Cards used to be incredibly expensive, but the arrival of the C50 led to price drops.Seagate and Western Digital Xbox Expansion Cards offer the same functionality. You simply insert the proprietary storage card into the expansion slot on the back of your console. Your Xbox will recognize the card and allow you to choose if you want to use internal storage or expansion storage as your primary install location. That's the whole installation process; these truly are plug-and-play storage solutions.Regular external hard drives can store Xbox Series X|S games, but you need to transfer them back to the console's internal drive to actually play them. Xbox Expansion Cards, on the other hand, can store and load games; these nifty accessories act as an extension of your SSD.Xbox and PC players can also save big on official Xbox Wireless Controllers for Cyber Monday. Microsoft's controllers are on sale for as low as $40, and you can even get deals on colorful Special Edition designs. The Xbox Elite Series 2 is also on sale right now; Microsoft's stellar customizable controller is discounted to $140 (was $200).                                                                                                                                               It's not a Cyber Monday deal, but Game Pass subscribers should consider switching to prepaid cards to avoid paying $30/month for Game Pass Ultimate. Prepaid codes from major retailers haven't received price increases yet. You can get three months of Game Pass Ultimate for $57 at Amazon ($19/month). Microsoft lets subscribers stack up to 36 months of prepaid codes.If you also own a Nintendo Switch 2, check out the Cyber Monday deal on the officially licensed Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card before it's gone.

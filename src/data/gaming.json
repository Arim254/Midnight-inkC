These effects pop up from time to time as you go through the campaign. They tend to be helpful, though they always come with a caveat in the form of a penalty, too. It's up to you to choose the ones that you really need, but be forewarned that they can no longer be removed once selected.Which flaws should you choose in The Outer Worlds 2There are over a dozen flaws that can appear as you're playing the game. Upon meeting the conditions for their hidden triggers, a pop-up will appear on your screen, prompting you to choose or reject the flaw.We've formatted our guide to focus primarily on those with manageable effects, and we've even included tips in case you want to select these flaws. A bit later in our article, we list the options that have more drastic effects, such as randomized occurrences that can be a hassle for your first playthrough.ConsumerismUnlock: Purchase the Premium Edition of the game.Positive effect: -15% vendor prices when buying.Negative effect: -10% selling prices.Keep or discard? Keep - Vendors items tend to have exorbitant prices, which makes this flaw in The Outer Worlds 2 quite viable. While you won't earn as much when selling junk, you can still earn a lot of cash from quests and loot.Easily DistractedUnlock: Allocate your points into different kinds of skills--i.e. at least four or five different specialties.Positive effect: +1 skill point gained per level.Negative effect: While leveling, you can only add skill points to your lowest non-zero skill or any skill you have no points in already.Keep or discard? Discard - Having no choice but to spend points on options that you don't necessarily need at that given time can be a huge problem, especially if you're trying to raise certain skills just to unlock new perks.OverpreparedUnlock: Reload your guns regularly, even if they still have ammo.Positive effect: +50% magazine size.Negative effect: -40% damage for eight seconds after a weapon's magazine is empty.Keep or discard? Keep - This flaw in The Outer Worlds 2 might seem like a bad choice at first. That said, if you're mindful of your weapon's current ammo count, then you won't have too many issues with the debuff.DependentUnlock: Have companions with you often when you get in combat.Positive effect: +25% damage to enemies recently damaged by companions.Negative effect: -10% damage.Keep or discard? It depends - There are some caveats if you select this flaw. It's pretty much dependent on the recruitable companions that you currently have in your squad. Ideally, you should have characters that can deal area-of-effect damage or damage-over-time, just so you can retain the +25% boost more consistently. This is further bolstered by unlocking each companion's mod kit to improve their capabilities in combat.TreacherousUnlock: Repeatedly do sneak attacks to take out enemies.Positive effect: +50% enemy awareness depletion rate; +100% sneak attack damage.Negative effect: -25% base health.Keep or discard? It depends - It's really up to you if you want to keep this flaw, as it's primarily for players who've invested a lot into the Sneak skill and related perks. The main downside is that you still won't be able to instantly kill enemies with sneak attacks if they're at a significantly higher level.TeetotalerUnlock: Regularly avoid toxicity by not using inhalers that often, or by staying away from Zyranium gas.Positive effect: +25% health restored by medical inhalers.Negative effect: +25% toxicity from medical inhalers.Keep or discard? It depends - Get this if you have access to unique armor or unique helmets that grant toxicity reduction. Alternatively, if you often bring support characters like Valerie or Inez, then you can rely more on their healing abilities instead of your inhalers.LudditeUnlock: We're still uncertain as to how we unlocked the Luddite flaw in The Outer Worlds 2. We surmise that it might be due to avoiding the use of gadgets for a prolonged period while playing.Positive effect: +10% damage resistance as long as your gadget energy meter is full.Negative effect: -25% gadget meter max; -25% energy recharge rate.Keep or discard? Discard - You probably want to have your gadget usage at the ready, instead of having to wait for it to fill up.FlawedUnlock: Select at least two flaws.Positive effect: Gain an extra perk point every 5 levels. This bonus is retroactive.Negative effect: Flaws must be accepted.Keep or discard? Discard - The pop-up even warns you that selecting this option is a bad idea for your first playthrough. Once you've beaten the game and you want to do another run where you accept every flaw that comes your way, then you definitely need to pick this.KleptomaniaUnlock: Keep stealing valuable items in houses and settlements without getting spotted.Positive effect: +100% vendor buying price for stolen items.Negative effect: You'll occasionally steal things automatically.Keep or discard? Discard - This, too, has a warning telling you that it should be avoided for your first playthrough. We're a bit wary due to the effects on faction reputation and bounties, especially if our character suddenly grabs goodies in front of NPCs.Foot-in-Mouth SyndromeUnlock: Regularly skip through dialogue--i.e. press the spacebar whenever an NPC is talking to you.Positive effect: +15% experience gained.Negative effect: Choices in conversations are randomly picked for you after enough time passes.Keep or discard? Keep - We've opted to include this entry here given that the randomization can have drastic effects on your playthrough. Still, Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome is one of the best flaws in The Outer Worlds 2. Naturally, the bonus XP gain helps you level up faster. The penalty can be ignored since you have around 10 seconds to pick a reply. As long as you don't accidentally leave the game idle while talking to a companion--where you might accidentally dismiss them for good--then you shouldn't worry too much.That does it for our guide on how to unlock flaws in The Outer Worlds 2. We'll let you know once we've discovered others, so stay tuned.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on October 28, 2025 at 11:03AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                After months of rumors, EA has finally released Battlefield 6's long-awaited battle royale mode, Redsec. The mode is a blend of Battlefield 6's multiplayer and other popular battle royales, such as Warzone, Apex Legends, and PUBG. You'll find that Redsec offers its own unique gameplay, though, giving players multiple ways to navigate a deadly firestorm that slowly encompasses the entire map of Fort Lyndon.Regardless of whether you just downloaded Redsec for your first taste of Battlefield 6 or you've been playing the multiplayer mode for weeks, you might need some help figuring out all of the systems at play in the battle royale. Below, we have detailed seven beginner tips that you can use to get started and secure your first win in Battlefield Redsec.For lots more on Battlefield 6's big update, check out all the new Season 1 maps, Season 1 weapons, and the first-ever Battlefield 6 battle pass.Take advantage of redeploysBattlefield Redsec has followed the modern battle royale trend of allowing dead players to return to the action once or multiple times during a match. Whether you're in duos or quads, you get one free redeploy after you die for the first time. You have to wait 30 or so seconds before you're able to respawn back into the match, which sees you parachute down from the sky over your team's current location on the map. You won't respawn with any of the gear you had when you died, though.After you use your one free redeploy, the only way you can return to the match in Redsec is if your teammates use a Redeploy Tower to bring you back. This can be done multiple times in a single match, but there's a big risk that comes with doing this.To bring back a fallen teammate, at least one member of your team needs to find a Redeploy Tower on the map and interact with it. This will cause a loud horn to ring out for anyone to hear, signaling that you're trying to respawn a teammate. You or a teammate needs to stay inside the Redeploy Tower's radius until the bar on your screen fills up, after which your dead teammate will spawn back into the match.Pick the right class for your squadJust like in Battlefield 6 multiplayer, Redsec allows you to choose one of the four default classes before you enter a match. Your options are Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. If you're playing the squads (four-player) playlist in Redsec, you'll ideally have all four squad members run one of the four classes, giving your team access to all of the class benefits. However, unless you're playing in a coordinated four-stack of players, it's unlikely you'll see your squad members pick different classes from one another.So, this begs the question, which is the best overall class in Redsec? Every class is viable in some regard, but Engineer and Assault are going to be your best classes for the majority of matches. Engineer has access to plenty of anti-vehicle equipment, which makes a huge impact when you run into tanks and other vehicles near the end of the storm in Redsec. As for Assault, you can use the Assault Ladder as well as the Adrenaline Injector, both of which are massively helpful for solo play.Of course, if you're planning to use a sniper, you'll want to go with the Recon class. Or, if no one on your team has selected the Support class, that's one you're going to want to run. Support's Supply Bag ensures you never have to worry about ammo, and you can revive teammates faster.Always upgrade your weaponsOne of the fresh elements Battlefield Redsec brings to the table is the weapon upgrade system, which you can use to progress weapons through different rarities and make them stronger. You don't even need to visit a specific station or area on the map to upgrade your weapons, as it's done right from your inventory. However, to upgrade weapons in Redsec, you do need to find and use different \"Upgrade Kits.\" These can be looted around the map, and once you have one, you can use it in your inventory to upgrade a weapon. The kits can be easy to forget about, and you'll be at a huge disadvantage if you're running around with a common rarity assault rifle compared to an enemy that has a legendary version. The boundary firestorm is deadliner than you're used toNormally in battle royales, the storm or \"gas\" that encompasses the outer edge of the map is fairly forgiving. You can stay inside the storm for multiple minutes if you have enough healing in other battle royales, such as Warzone or Fortnite. However, Redsec has completely gotten rid of that safety blanket.The firestorm that slowly fills the map during a match is not something you want to mess with. If you even spend more than a second inside the firestorm, you'll die. This adds an entirely different element to Redsec, as you need to carefully pick which fights you kick off, what loot you go for, and how much time you're spending in a single area. Fortunately, your HUD does have an indicator that shows how far the firestorm is away from you when you get too close, but you still need to be mindful of where it is at all times.Remember to shakedown enemiesIf you've killed an enemy in Redsec, you might have seen a prompt to press your melee button while standing over the enemy's body on the ground. This is the \"Shakedown\" mechanic, which is actually quite powerful. By shaking down an enemy, you reveal all of their current squadmates' locations on the map via your mini-map.As long as you don't have enemies shooting at you, you should always try to shakedown a downed enemy before you fully eliminate them. This gives you valuable information that you can then relay to your team, and could make the difference between you surviving and dying.Stand over your Supply Bag for tons of ammoThe Supply Bag is the key Gadget that you gain access to when playing the Support class in Redsec. Just like in Battlefield 6 multiplayer, the Supply Bag refills your ammo when you run over it. However, you've likely noticed in Redsec that running over the Supply Bag only gives you 20 extra bullets. This is because you can essentially get an unlimited amount of ammo by continually standing over the Supply Bag. If you stand over the Supply Bag and don't move for roughly 20-30 seconds, you'll max out your ammo reserves for the weapon you currently have equipped. Save tanks for the endThe final tip we have is regarding everyone's favorite part of Redsec so far: the tanks. Tanks are fully available in the battle royale, and despite how you feel about that, they aren't immediately accessible like other vehicles. Instead, you have to find keycards across the map and then open vaults that contain the tanks, which your team can then hop into.While it might be tempting to go for a tank early on in a match and drive around slaughtering enemies, but that's not the best way to utilize the vehicle. Instead, you want to try to save the tank's ammunition until the end of a match, as they don't have much to start with. You also don't want to make too much noise with the tank too early, as that will draw the attention of more players and lead them to try and blow you up.If you save your tank until there's only four or five teams left, you stand a much better chance of coming out of the match as the last team standing. A tank at the final circle in Redsec is nearly unstoppable unless you're going up against a team full of Engineers with anti-vehicle equipment.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Developer Santa Ragione is reporting that its controversial indie horror game Horses sold 18,000 copies in two weeks. That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game.According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game.\"This result is not enough to begin production on a new game,\" reads the statement. \"The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.\"          It's been an uphill battle for Santa Ragione and Horses. The studio recently revealed that its title had been banned by Steam in 2023 without explanation. Subsequently, Horses was also banned by Epic Games Store and Humble Bundle just before its release. The cancellation of Horses by three of the major PC game distributors comes after a recent effort to target adult-oriented games on storefronts like Steam and Itch. There is definitely material meant for mature audiences in Horses, but the development team is calling for more transparency in the industry after it says it wasn't given a chance to make any changes to Horses in order for it to be released on Steam.\"We also want to emphasize that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce,\" wrote Santa Ragione's spokesperson. \"For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly. We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases.\"Horses is now available for $5 on GOG, and Itch.io.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nBy \n    Eddie Makuch\n   on December 17, 2025 at 1:13PM PST\n              \n          \n                The Harry Potter game Hogwarts Legacy has now sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it among the best-selling games of all time.Warner Bros. Games made the announcement today, December 17, amid its parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's sale to Netflix, or Paramount. At 40 million sales, the game is a smash hit, but not quite close enough to break into the top 10 best-selling games ever. Hogwarts Legacy was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Games through its Portkey Games label, which handles Harry Potter games for the company.Hogwarts Legacy is set in the 1800s with players coming to Hogwarts as a fifth-year student as they learn spells and tame magical creatures. The game outsold Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III in North America in 2023, and that's a rare thing given how dominant Call of Duty has been.Unsurprisingly, Warner Bros. Games has said making a sequel is a major priority for the company, though the follow-up has yet to be formally announced. Another major fantasy franchise, Lord of the Rings, is said to be getting a Hogwarts Legacy-style game in the future. Hogwarts Legacy has been embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community. In this article, you will also find links to trans creators you can support, as well as charities you can donate to.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Available for $61.74 (was $80), it lets you build a functional replica of the fun coin pushing games found at the arcade. This is the first real discount we've seen for the product, and it looks like a neat project to work on over the holidays.                                 Sosuy Motorized Coin Pusher Arcade Game Building Set (2,093 pieces)                                                                $61.74 (was $80)                                                                                                                                                                                    While kids will have fun playing with the Coin Pusher Arcade Game once the build is complete, they'll probably need an adult to help snap together its 2,093 pieces. Not only are there a lot of pieces, but the kit features a bunch of moving parts that likely require a skilled hand to get working properly. For example, the finished game features a movable coin slot, a rotatable switch, and an electric motor drive.In other words, parents can have fun constructing the complex machine alongside their kids, making it a cool winter activity for the whole family. Once the building is done, the machine comes with everything you need to start playing like you're at the arcade, including dozens of durable plastic coins.                      The completed machine stands nearly 17 inches tall and 11 inches wide, making it a pretty robust project. It looks quite premium, too, with a retro yellow-and-red design and a little \"Coin\" marquee at the top by the coin slot.While the brand, Sosuy, doesn't have the name recognition of Lego, it's responsible for some unique building kits. Beyond this game, it sells a Bumper Cars Building Set featuring movable vehicles. It's also on sale ahead of the holidays, now just $48.44 (was $60) at Amazon. And though it's not discounted, the Water Slide Building Set offers a colorful design, a slidable track, a functioning chain to move its passengers, and spans nearly two feet when completed.More Sosuy Building SetsBumper Boat Ride -- $87.29 ($97)Bumper Cars -- $48.44 ($60)Carousel -- $180.49 ($250)Double Helix Ship Track -- $92.33 ($108)Urban Railway -- $85.49 ($100)Water Slide -- $90A similar brand, Pantasy, has discounted its Retro Circus Claw Machine to $109.19 (was $140).

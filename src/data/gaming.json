    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Payday 2 may predate Payday 3 by a decade, but the former still remains popular while the latter has struggled. Now, publisher Starbreeze has lined up Sidetrack Games to work on Payday 2 updates on PC and keep those players satisfied.Sidetrack was previously known as the M.U.G. Team in the Payday modding community, and the studio also worked on updates for RAID: World War 2 after that game's lifecycle came to an end. According to Starbreeze, Sidetrack's first Payday 2 update will go live on October 23, with a focus \"on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience.\" Future updates are planned for \"quality-of-life improvements and general game fixes.\"Starbreeze will host a livestream on October 23 that lays out the details of the patch and invites the player community to \"help shape future improvements.\" With Payday 2 now in the hands of Sidetrack going forward, Starbreeze will primarily be working on updates for Payday 3. Payday 2 still has has tens of thousands of players at any given time, according to SteamDB. However, Payday 3 has trouble cracking 1,000 concurrent players.Earlier this month, Starbreeze canceled its Dungeons & Dragons game and laid off workers in a renewed push towards the Payday franchise and other heist games. The company also added a Payday 2 subscription service that gives players access to the DLC for a monthly charge. Starbreeze went on to apologize for raising the Payday 2 DLC bundle to $170 and subsequently reverted the price back to $118.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Since 2021, Thomas Donofri and the other members of Slurm Team have been passionately working on a conversion mod that transforms The Simpsons: Hit & Run into a Futurama game. Now, four years later, the first demo for Futurama: Hit & Run is available, and it has the approval of Joe McGinn, the lead designer of the original game.          The launch trailer for the demo was released earlier this week, and it quickly caught McGinn's attention. He left a comment on YouTube, and wrote, \"I can only say ... this looks awesome! I want to play it.\"Source: YouTube.The demo is available for free on the links from the YouTube, however it requires players to have a copy of The Simpsons: Hit & Run on PC in order to work. As seen in the trailer above, the town of Springfield is transformed into New New York, and players assume control of Philip J. Fry as he makes his way through the city, one fare at a time.Futurama had its own video game in 2003 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, as well as some mobile titles. But aside from crossovers -- including a Fortnite event -- the franchise hasn't had many opportunities in the gaming realm.In 2023, McGinn indicated that he is in favor of an official Simpsons: Hit & Run remake, but the closest thing to that is a fan-made remake that utilizes Unreal Engine 5.There are strong signs that The Simpsons are coming to Fortnite soon, possibly as soon as November 1. Epic Games has yet to officially announce that event, but an early rumor suggests that the entire town of Springfield will be a playable map.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Amazon disclosed a number of layoffs in its gaming division earlier this week, and now those cuts are apparently affecting the team behind New World: Aeternum. Following the recently released Season 10: Nighthaven update, there will be no more new content released for New World: Aeternum.The announcement was shared on the game's official site by developer Amazon Games Orange County. This doesn't mean that the game is going offline yet, and the devs indicated it will remain online through 2026. Beyond that, there are no guarantees. But there is a small consolation for players, now that the Nighthaven update will be free. \"The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles,\" reads the statement from the developers. \"It is only after much consideration that we've reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players.\"New World: Aeternum will remain available on PlayStation Plus for Extra and Premium subscribers, but even the developers aren't sure when that arrangement will expire. During the game's new phase, bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements will continue, and players can continue to buy and download the game. There will still be world bosses, bonus weeks, and \"some seasonal events,\" but holiday events are now canceled. The development team also stated that it will \"provide a minimum of six months' notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World: Aeternum.\" \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

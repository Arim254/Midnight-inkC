Naturally, you’d think it’ll take a lot of work to get to that stage, and you’re half right. But there are a few tips and tricks we’ve picked up along the way to help you make the sparkly garden of your dreams.Grow A Garden is one of the best Roblox games available to play on the platform, and one of the reasons why is that you can spend a few minutes tending to your plot before leaving it to do its own thing. However, unless someone is willing to donate to you one of their most expensive plants, getting started will take some grit. Here are some tips for the early game, things to focus on once you’ve made a bit of money, and all the more obscure mechanics that help you in the long run.Table of Contents [hide]Best Plants to buy in the early stagesDon’t forget about the guide achievementsMid-late game tips for making moneyMutate your rarest petsBuy tools and get craftingParticipate in Admin Abuse eventsCook plants in the cooking kitLook out for merchantsGnome MerchantHoney MerchantSky MerchantSprinker ShopSummer Seed MerchantInvest in expanding your garden sizeSpend a fortune to Ascend and gain Garden CoinsAscension merchant inventorySam owns the Seed Shop, which regularly restocks valuable seeds you can plant to earn money.Best Plants to buy in the early stagesWhen you’re just starting your garden, growing and selling carrots is a good way to make a bit of pocket change, as they grow very quickly. However, you’ll want to prioritize any plant that doesn’t disappear upon harvesting it before too long. Generally, they’re more cost-effective, meaning that you’ll recoup your money and won’t need to buy and plant replacement seeds.While single-harvest plants don’t normally give a good return upon sale, there are a couple of exceptions. Bamboo is the most plentiful plant with the best resale value. Buy as many seeds as you can afford in the shop whenever they replenish, then plant them in the corner of your garden and leave them there. Expose them to as many weather effects as you can so that they can get as many Grow A Garden mutations as possible, then sell them for a fortune. Mushrooms are also a valuable candidate for single-harvest plants that are potentially worth a ton.The Guide button on the left was added fairly recently, but it's a handy way to check the achievements to get more stuff.Don’t forget about the guide achievementsThe Guide Book has plenty of things you can do to gain a bunch of experience. While the rewards for reaching higher levels aren’t all that exciting, completing each page of the Guide Book’s achievement sections gives you helpful items to boost your garden, such as seed packets, pet shards, and many more.To give you an idea of the work needed to complete the Common Achievements page, you only need to shovel 100 plants, harvest 200 carrots, sell 500 strawberries, and gift a carrot and 5 strawberries. Completing this set of quests will reward you with a cooking kit and 5 silver common seed packs.Occasionally, you'll get a plant that has a whole bunch of different mutations, each one buffing how much it's worth when sold.Mid-late game tips for making moneyOnce you’ve made your first million Sheckles, it’s time to use tools such as the shovel to dig up plants that are no longer needed. Any common, uncommon, and rare plants are taking precious space that you can better use for when you find or buy higher rarity plants. If you’re unsure what the rarity of your plant is, hover your cursor or face the direction of the crop and look at the color of its name. If it’s grey, green, or blue, then you can probably dig it up.Bulky single-harvest plants, such as watermelons, or replenishable ones like apples that don’t give a lot of profit, should be sold as soon as possible. Instead, you should grow high-yield trees such as coconuts, mangoes, dragon fruit, and romanesco. Bamboo is still a good investment at the mid-game, because they grow quickly and are worth a fair bit when affected by many mutations. Eventually, you’ll be able to afford the most expensive plants and dedicate all your garden space to growing them.Some mutations, such as Inverted, give an additional boost to pet XP, while others allow pets to give bonus mutations.Mutate your rarest petsThis is also the time when you should be investing in Grow A Garden pets. Focus initially on trying to get any event-exclusive pets that grant mutations that will disappear once a new update appears. They’re not worth much now, but hatching as many of them as you can gives you potential trades in the future. Don’t bother with any common or uncommon eggs from the shop. There are very few that are worth the hassle of hatching, while rare and higher rarity eggs can be game-changing.As for mutations, a pet can only have one at a time, so choose carefully which one you want. To mutate them, feed them to level 50 and deposit them for 500,000,000 sheckles at the facility next to the pet shop. You can also give them a Golden Acorn from level 40 to give them a random mutation from one of the following options.Shiny - provides an additional 15% boost to the pet’s XP per second.Inverted - provides an additional 30% boost to the pet’s XP per second.Windy - every 4 minutes and 47 seconds, there’s a 20.12% chance a nearby fruit gets the Windstruck mutation.Frozen - every 4 minutes and 47 seconds, there’s a 30% chance a nearby fruit gets the Frozen mutation.Golden - gives a big increase to the pet’s passive.Mega - pet is gigantic and has a 20% faster hunger rate. Gains an additional 10-40 XP per second.Tiny - pet is tiny and has a 20% slower hunger rate. Gains an additional 5-30 XP per secondIronSkin - gives around a 35% to 45% chance to recover any stolen fruit.Rainbow - provides a bigger increase to the pet’s passive.Shocked - during a thunderstorm, every 45-60 seconds, it has between a 25% and 30% chance to attract lightning strikes to give nearby fruits the Shocked mutation.Radiant - every 20 to 30 minutes, it emits sunshine at a random nearby plant to advance its growth by 24 hours.Ascended - every 5 to 6 hours, there is around a 75% chance that this pet will give the Dawnbound mutation to a random fruit.There are also a handful of events in the past and present that give out Pet Shards, which you can use to apply the following mutations:Aromatic - every 24 minutes and 42 seconds, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Aromatic mutation. (Cooking event only)Fried - every 20 minutes, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Fried mutation (Cooking event only)Tranquil - every 25 minutes, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Tranquil mutation (Zen event only)Corrupted - every 25 minutes, a nearby fruit has a chance to get the Corrupted mutation (Zen event only)GiantBean - pet has a 15% faster hunger rate and gains an additional 0.12 XP per second for each Beanstalk planted in your garden. (Beanstalk event only)Glimmering - every 24 minutes and 45 seconds, a nearby fruit has a 20.14% chance of getting the Glimmering mutation (Fairies event only)Luminous - every 34 minutes and 15 seconds, a nearby fruit has a 20.04% chance to get the Luminous mutation (Fairies event only)Nutty - every 19 minutes and 40 seconds, the pet's main ability has a 20% chance to activate twice. If this fails, your pet loses a level. (Chubby Chipmunk event only)You can also get Pet Shards by participating in events or completing achievements. These are single-use items that permanently swap your pet’s mutation, and they include pet mutations otherwise not available elsewhere. Here are the ones currently available:Silver - obtain by completing Pet AchievementsGold - obtain by completing Pet AchievementsRainbow - obtain by completing Pet AchievementsThe Gear Shop and crafting benches provide players with access to some invaluable tools and gear to help their gardens grow.Buy tools and get craftingAnother top tip is to grab some additional tools from the gear shop or craft them at the bench. These can help you improve your pet’s abilities, water your plants more efficiently, and even change cleansing sprays into ones that give plants mutations instead. We highly recommend you save a Basic, Advanced, and Godly sprinkler to craft either a Lightning Rod or Tanning Mirror for 500,000 Sheckles. When you deploy them, they give nearby plants a higher chance to be affected by the Shocked or Sundried mutations during thunderstorms and heatwaves, respectively.You can also craft unusual plants by combining seeds and plants like some kind of Frankenstein’s courgette. It’s frankly absurd as a concept, but if you want access to Lingonberries, Mandrakes, and all the other craftable plants, then you’ll need to invest some time, money, and resources into getting them for your garden.Participate in Admin Abuse eventsBefore loading up Grow A Garden from the Roblox main page, you’ll want to pay attention to the section below that tells you when the next event will begin. This is because, in addition to briefly describing what the event entails, it also states that an “Admin Abuse” will occur starting an hour before the update is released.Yes, the name is rather unfortunate, but what typically happens during an Admin Abuse is that one of the main creators of the game will appear via big messages on the game screen, similar to the ones that tell you when the shop restocks. They will announce things such as when rare items are being added to the relevant shops, and warn players about certain Admin-only Grow A Garden weather events.Having lots of plants with a high resale value in your garden before the Admin Abuse begins is key to making millions of Sheckles per plant. Fill your garden with plants like Bamboo or regrowable plants such as romanesco at least a couple of hours before the new event switchover time to guarantee that you have plenty of valuable crops to sell once the update is complete.Picking up a Cooking Kit will allow you to make food, which is needed for complex crafting recipes and increasing your friendship levels.Cook plants in the cooking kitTo get a cooking kit, you need to either complete the Common, Rare, or Mythical tier achievements or buy one in the cosmetic shop for 1,000,000 Sheckles. Place it in your garden and have a plant in your hand to then put it into the pot for cooking. You can only put in five plants to make food, so make sure they’re high-value or ones with mutations to increase the chances of getting a food with those same bonuses. The mutation gauge on the cooking kit will increase the more fruits with these multipliers are used in the recipe.The advantage of this is that they are worth more friendship points when you feed them to shop owners. Regular food is worth 2 points, while mutated food is worth a lot more for every mutation. Given that there is a 24-hour cooldown before you can feed a shopkeeper again, having many mutations on one plant is vital for ensuring your friendship level increases with as few plants as possible.Crafting specific Grow A Garden recipes, such as Corndogs, is simplified because only the type of plant is taken into account when cooking. For example, the corndog requires one plant to act as the stick, one as the meat, and one as the batter. You can use many plants as the stick part, but only a handful are acceptable meats. The batter, in this case, has to be either violet corn or corn.You should also have a few cakes on hand, just in case there’s an NPC birthday, as giving them a slice will hand you one of the rarer items from their shop for free. Here are all the NPC birthdays:Eloise (Gear shop) - March 4Sam (Seed shop) - July 2Isaac (Cosmetic shop) - December 1Raphael (Egg shop) - October 30Orson (Ascension shop) - UnknownSome merchants will only appear once every half an hour next to the Seed Shop. Their wares are highly sought-after.Look out for merchantsOnce every 30 minutes, a merchant will appear to the left of the Seed shop. They will generally sell rare items that are either unobtainable otherwise or very difficult to craft. When they appear, they probably won’t have a copy of every item in their inventory, and the stock they will have will be limited, but you may find something in their shop that you badly need for your garden.Here are all the currently available merchants:Gnome MerchantCommon Gnome Crate - 55,000,000 Sheckles or 149 RobuxFarmer’s Gnome Crate - 88,500,000 Sheckles or 179 RobuxClassic Gnome Crate - 113,000,000 Sheckles or 199 RobuxIconic Gnome Crate - 155,000,000 Sheckles or 199 RobuxGnome (Pet) - 449 RobuxHoney MerchantTrade in fruits with the Pollinated mutation to get 1 honey per kilogram it weighs.Bee Egg - 18 honey or 129 RobuxHoney Sprinkler - 30 honey or 199 RobuxFlower Seed Pack - 10 honey or 199 RobuxBee Crate -12 honey or 179 RobuxHoney Crafters Crate - 15 honey or 179 RobuxSky MerchantNight Staff - 12,000,000 ShecklesStar Caller - 15,000,000 ShecklesCloudtouched Spray - 50,000,000 ShecklesSprinker ShopTropical Mist Sprinkler - 50,000,000 Sheckles or 229 RobuxBerry Blusher Sprinkler - 50,000,000 Sheckles or 229 RobuxSpice Spritzer Sprinkler - 50,000,000 Sheckles or 229 RobuxSweet Soaker Sprinkler - 50,000,000 Sheckles or 229 RobuxFlower Froster Sprinkler - 50,000,000 Sheckles or 229 RobuxStalk Sprouter Sprinkler - 50,000,000 Sheckles or 229 RobuxSummer Seed MerchantCauliflower - 1,300 Sheckles or 135 RobuxRafflesia - 3,200 Sheckles or 215 RobuxGreen Apple - 3,500 Sheckles or 399 RobuxAvocado - 5,000 Sheckles or 419 RobuxBanana - 7,000 Sheckles or 459 RobuxPineapple - 7,500 Sheckles or 475 RobuxKiwi - 10,000 Sheckles or 529 RobuxBell Pepper - 55,000 Sheckles or 589 RobuxPrickly Pear - 555,000 Sheckles or 599 RobuxLoquat - 900,000 Sheckles or 629 RobuxFeijoa - 2,750,000 Sheckles or 679 RobuxPitcher Plant - 7,500,000 Sheckles or 715 RobuxCommon Summer egg - 1,000,000 Sheckles or 29 RobuxRare Summer egg - 25,000,000 Sheckles or 99 RobuxParadise egg - 50,000,000 Sheckles or 139 RobuxThe plots at the back of this garden were expanded into with the help of a few million sheckles, giving more room for bigger plants.Invest in expanding your garden sizeIf you’re finding that you don’t quite have enough space, you can spend sheckles to extend your garden size.Right side: Adds a total of 280 square studs in a 5x14 configuration to the right side of your garden.

Has a waiting time of 3 days and costs 1,000,000,000 Sheckles or 399 Robux during the waiting time.When you have enough Sheckles and the prerequisite fruit, you can Ascend to get Garden Coins from this merchant.Spend a fortune to Ascend and gain Garden CoinsWhen you have hit your first trillion Sheckles, a new stall will appear in the corner to the right of the Selling Merchant. This is Orson, who handles Ascension, as well as selling a range of upgrades and fence designs. Every time you ascend, you’ll get 10 Garden Coins, which you can use either at the Ascension merchant to buy his stock or at tier 2 stock such as the Seed and Egg shops. You’ll need the specified fruit, sometimes with a mutation,Ascension level 1 - Strawberry + 1 Trillion ShecklesAscension level 2 - Chilled Elder Strawberry + 3 Trillion ShecklesAscension level 3 - Blueberry + 5 Trillion ShecklesAscension level 4 - Chilled Apple + 7 Trillion ShecklesAscension level 5 - Beanstalk + 9 Trillion ShecklesAscension level 6 - Bamboo + 11 Trillion ShecklesAscension level 7 - Windstruck Elder Strawberry + 13 Trillion ShecklesAscension merchant inventorySave Slot Upgrade: adds an additional save slot (1) - 100 Garden CoinsEgg Capacity Upgrade: unlocks 1 additional slot for your farm (5) - 40 Garden CoinsPet Inventory Capacity Upgrade: unlocks 10 additional slots for your pet inventory (5) - 40 Garden CoinsCosmetic Inventory Capacity Upgrade: unlocks 10 additional slots for your cosmetic inventory (5) - 20 Garden CoinsPlant Inventory Capacity Upgrade: unlock 10 additional slots for your plant inventory (5) - 40 Garden CoinsLaser Fence (1) - 10 Garden CoinsGreek Fence (1) - 10 Garden CoinsAscended Fence (1) - 10 Garden Coins\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Over the holiday weekend, there were so many anecdotal rumors about Target, Walmart, and other US retailers pulling Xbox consoles and games that Microsoft decided it was necessary to debunk these reports.\"Target and Walmart, among other retailers, remain committed partners for Xbox consoles, accessories, and games,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told Windows Central. The outlet went on to suggest that the rumors may have been born out of Costco's apparent decision to remove everything Xbox-related from its digital storefront ahead of the price hikes.Microsoft has previously fielded rumors that Xbox is abandoning hardware, as exemplified by Asus handling the release of the ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices. However, Xbox VP Jason Ronald told the press that the company remains committed to its next generation hardware.The increasing cost of the Xbox consoles comes just as Microsoft raised prices on Game Pass. Former Microsoft employee and a founding member of the original Xbox team, Laura Fryer, went on to call those increases a \"betrayal\" of the trust that gamers placed in the company. Microsoft subsequently announced that the price hikes won't immediately go into effect for all players. But the more expensive version of Game Pass is losing a fan-favorite Call of Duty perk.Some analysts also believe that an ad-supported Game Pass service will be added in the future.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Justin Clark\n   on October 14, 2025 at 1:32AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                 It's not an out of pocket statement to say that the modern games industry was built on the backs of the humble side-scroller. Once Super Mario Bros. showed the entire world how to do it, the market flooded, fast. Running, jumping, climbing, and occasionally stomping on a bad guy's head were the default genre of video games for the longest time, and it wasn't long before creators found ways to branch out. Even after 3D changed the game, developers still fell back on bread-and-butter concepts for gameplay, and for good reason. Stages may be sprawling but generally head on particular direction. The vast majority of the mechanics are introduced right at the start and stay constant. There's a clear separation of stages, rather than the blending necessary for a good Metroidvania. And yes, those are old principles to keep alive after all these years, but as a wonderful, macho man once said, the cream will always rise to the top.  And over the years, some genuinely brilliant things have been done to keep the genre up to code in terms of what players expect in recent times. With that in mind, here's a big list of the best sidescrollers that have and likely will stand the test of time. Mega Man 2 on NESMega Man 2 (1989, Capcom, NES) Super Mario Bros may have set the gold standard for how all the best sidescrollers should operate, but within two games, Capcom evolved the whole concept to produce one of the best NES games ever made. The original game innovated the whole concept of selectable stages, stealing the boss' powers, and playing rock-paper-scissors to find out which power works against which bosses, but Mega Man 2 is such a massive jump ahead in every single aspect the first game can't help but feel like a glorified tech demo. The stages and their theming is so much better defined, the challenges within them range from absolute joy to utterly diabolical, the eight robot masters are among the series' most iconic, the surprises waiting in the later Wily Stages are still jaw-dropping. And, y'know, just gonna leave this here. The Arcade version of StriderStrider (1989, Capcom, Arcade/Genesis)In a medium that thrives on wild power fantasies, there are very few thrills that match up to getting to be a badass, sword-wielding ninja. But even in that hallowed niche, Capcom asked the fateful question in 1989 \"You know what's better than playing as a ninja?\", and the answer was \"playing as a future ninja\". And that's how we wind up with Strider, a side-scrolling, globe-trotting action game that looks, sounds, and feels like very little else at the time, every major enemy encounter and mechanic dialed up to absurd, comic-book levels of extreme. And yet, even as chaotic as the minute-to-minute running, jumping, and slashing can be, there's plenty of method to the madness, and some of the most breathtaking and ambitious setpieces in all gaming, from a hammer-and-sickle wielding mechanized centipede made of the Russian politburo, to a zero gravity fight with a sentient satellite, to a final boss that begins with one of the most deliciously evil voicelines in gaming history.Super Mario World on SNESSuper Mario World (1991, Nintendo, Super Nintendo)Just about every mainline Super Mario game that comes out pushes the medium an inch or two forward in some direction or another, and even getting to the point where Mario's hat lets him possess any living creature in the environment, Super Mario World feels like the true apex of our beloved plumber's long, storied career. Sure, it gets credit for introducing Yoshi to the world, and the Super Cape is still untouchable for the best Mario power-up, but we also don't talk about Mario World as one of the most breathtaking feats of game design in game history. This is a game of secrets upon secrets upon secrets, sometimes within the same level. Stages with multiple exits, hidden map levels that unlock platforms, thrilling stage gimmicks, the giant-size enemies, the multiple layers of obstacles, to say nothing of the fact that what passes for a Warp Zone in Mario World, the Star Road and the Special area, is a multistage, expert-level gauntlet that demands complete mastery of the game's mechanics. All of that has laid the foundation for a cottage industry of modded levels that have become viral video bait over the last two decades. This is Mario's masterpiece. Super Castlevania IV on SNESSuper Castlevania IV (1991, Konami, SNES) Castlevania has always straddled a very particular line of campiness. It's never been coy about its Universal Monster influences, and never really ever meant to immerse gamers in anything resembling realism when it comes to how it presents the supernatural. Part of that's the limitations of technology, but by the time CD soundtracks and painterly graphics became commonplace, the series had gone pretty deep down an anime-inspired rabbit hole. Such is why, to this day, it remains such a unique thrill when you let Castlevania IV get to its attract screen: Dracula's desecrated grave struck by lightning and a hauntingly dark synth line rolls in with the fog. More than any game in the series prior, and most of them after, Castlevania IV fully entrenches itself in gothic horror and natural ruin. It looks and sounds the way your average Opeth album feels, with an added dose of Mode 7 surreality ratcheting up the uneasiness. All that is on top of one of the last linear side-scrolling Castlevania titles to feel like a legitimate dark evolution of the NES titles and a worthy horror experience rather than following Rondo of Blood's lead. Sonic 3 & KnucklesSonic 3 & Knuckles (1994, Sega, Genesis)Technically, Sonic 3 & Knuckles is just the real Sonic 3, the ultimate, full-fat, uncompromised version of what Sonic could be on the Genesis, after RAM limitations forced the devs to rush the original version of Sonic 3 out the door. More than that, it's still the flat out best Sonic game (though nothing but love to Sonic CD, and Sonic Mania comes so very close). It's the fastest the blue blur would ever run, the most expansive collection of levels, with nary a dud in the bunch, the best story they would ever tell without having voice acting to fall back on, it's one of the strongest soundtracks on the Genesis, and every new mechanic introduced adds complexity to the moments where Sonic has to slow down without making those stretches drag on as they can often do. 30 years and the series' shift to 3D later, nothing Sega has done with our favorite hedgehog has been able to outdo this.Rocket Knight Adventures on GenesisRocket Knight Adventures (1994, Konami, Genesis) The graveyard of gaming history is littered with the corpses of the mascots that time forgot. For every Kirby or Shantae, there's a James Pond, a Boogerman, an Aero the Acrobat, a Gex, or, god forbid, a Bubsy. But there's also the special category of attempts that may currently be resting in peace, but only because they lived fast and burned bright. In this case, Sparkster burned bright enough to launch into the stratosphere. Rocket Knight Adventures starts out almost laughably simple, as players learn the ropes of how exactly an armored possum with a sword and a jetpack can save the world from an army of pigs, but starting in the second stage, Konami gets ambitious. A unique, cartoony sense of humor, some eye-popping graphical spectacles pushing the Genesis to its limits, a combat and traversal system with enough depth to stay fresh for hours, and an underdog pick for one of the best soundtracks on the Genesis. Seriously, throw this on in a tent at Coachella, see if anybody complains.Super Meat BoySuper Meat Boy (2010, Team Meat, PC/Xbox 360)It would be a long while before the smoke would clear, and 3D platformers could actually make room at the table for 2D to come roaring back, and it would ultimately come down to the holy indie trinity of Fez, Braid, and Super Meat Boy to herald that this style of game was not only back but here to stay. Of the three, while Braid got most of the attention at the time, the meta twist basically made the game instantly age like a fine milk. Fez was creative, but also a pretty big step back, mechanically.  Super Meat Boy, on the other hand, continues to be one of those games you can go hang out with for five minutes or five hours any time of the day. Even as punishing as some of its courses can be, the gross, Nickelodeon-esque sense of humor grants it a ton of grace, and the instant retries means that the fabled \"one more game\" quality all the best quick-hit titles have is absolutely undeniable.Rayman LegendsRayman Legends (2013, Ubisoft Montpelier, 360/PS3/WiiU) Rayman is another one of those would-be mascots that may never have hit the big leagues, but always had the respect of a certain caste of gamer, thanks to a string of outstanding, underrated platformers stretching all the way from the PS1. Rayman Origins, however, felt like our armless hero still had a masterpiece in him yet, with the only real complaint that it gets a little repetitive towards the end. On Rayman Legends, however, Michel Ancel nodded, said \"defi accepte\", and crafted a sequel that levels up everything that was already brilliant about Origins, from the lighting system, to the level design, to the excellent new co-op mechanics. More than that, though, you got musical levels where all the wonderful, free-flowing mechanics were put to good use, bringing an eclectic collection of songs to vivid, delightfully animated life. Shovel KnightShovel Knight (2014, Yacht Club Games, PC/WiiU/3DS)Many a dev winds up making a retro-inspired game that just feels like a modern game with pixel art, many can utilize old-school design principles with a new art style, but very few are capable of crafting a new 8-bit game to such perfection that it's indistinguishable from the real deal. Yacht Club did exactly that with Shovel Knight, essentially setting out to make the best NES game, and succeeding on every single level. It's the equivalent of making a dinner only using tools and ingredients available before 1901. It's not just a work of greatness in its own right, but testament to just how unbreakable these design principles were made to be in the first place.CelesteCeleste (2018, Maddy Makes Games, Multi)Around the time Celeste released is around the time we start seeing the first skirmishes in the war over difficulty and accessibility, and just like the Souls games that kicked off the war in earnest, the beauty of Celeste is that it hits the perfect sweet spot of why and how a game can be insanely difficult: it's justified by the plot--where the peril of our heroine climbing a mountain is baked into the extremely emotional/narrative arc--and even then, the game allows players to adjust their level of masochism without just flicking a switch for Easy Mode. The level design requires a skill and precision that can only come from trial and error, but along with being tough but fair, Celeste showed the world that it's possible to make a game that's still kind and thoughtful at the same time.    \n  \n                      "

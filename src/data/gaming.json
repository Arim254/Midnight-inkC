    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Usually, Fortnite players like it when Epic Games offers a free skin. But that's not the case for Freediver, a new skin that's available for free only through the Priority app, which offers various deals and rewards to customers of UK mobile providers O2 and Virgin Media. O2 and Virgin members can use the Priority app to claim a code that'll let them unlock the skin by gaining a couple account levels.O2 and Virgin Media customers in the UK can unlock the Freediver skin for free in the Priority app. Having a skin locked to specific regional mobile providers means that most of the people in the world cannot get this skin. Not that they'd probably notice, since it's a fairly basic and not particularly interesting skin. But for folks who seriously collect Fortnite skins, that scarcity is a large part of its appeal--having this skin hypothetically offers a little bit of metaverse cred, since it's not something everyone can even get.We'll probably be seeing more of this, however, because this is the second time this year Epic has done this exact thing. Back in August, Epic offered a purple version of this same skin--dubbed Thrilldiver--only to users of the Brazilian telecom company Vivo. It's likely that this free skin is part of Epic's renewed push for mobile players, and that more recolors of this skin will be offered to other groups of mobile customers.Fans of freebies who feel like they're missing out can take solace in the fact that the winter holiday season is about to start, and Epic usually gives out multiple free skins this time of year. In the final six weeks of 2024, for example, Fortnite offered free Juice WRLD and Snoop Dogg skins, as well as the Fortnite-original Yulejacket, plus accessories for all of them.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                There's a free new Minecraft game being developed for mobile in partnership with King--the creators of Candy Crush Saga--but most players won't be able to get their hands on it for some time.Minecraft Blast is a free-to-play mobile game that combines match puzzles with a Minecraft-themed world that you can continually upgrade. Mojang and King describe it as a \"delightfully blocky puzzle adventure,\" and promise \"fun and challenging\" match puzzles that grant rewards that can be used to build structures and items.From the screenshots and footage we've seen so far, it looks like you'll have to clear blocks--some of which may be familiar to existing Minecraft players, such as TNT--which then grants energy or currency that can be used to purchase structures or items to place in your world. We've also spotted some familiar Minecraft mobs, including Chickens, Zombies, and Creepers.          Currently, there's a limited-time playtest available for users in Canada or Malaysia, but Mojang says it plans to make these tests available to more regions in the future. The playtest regions were \"based on specific testing requirements\" and created in order to \"gather early feedback and refine the experience\" ahead of a full release. If you're based in either of these regions, the playtest is currently limited to the App Store in English in Malaysia, or English and French in Canada.While the full game hasn't yet been released, those who have got their hands on Minecraft Blast, such as YouTuber PatarHD, note that they're only seeing a small portion of the contents and core gameplay, with progression being halted after the game's first stage. Any progress made during the playtests won't carry over to Minecraft Blast's full release--but there's no word yet on when that will be.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

As part of the yearly \"State of the Sanderson\" blog post, author Brandon Sanderson shared that he has been in conversations with multiple AAA developers about a potential Mistborn project. If the project does come to fruition, it will be years away.Sanderson seems to be optimistic about the project's chances. He wrote, \"I feel I’m finally getting established enough that we can make a Mistborn game happen. ... This is at Step One only, but it’s an encouraging One.\" Though he doesn't name any names, he does claim that he has been chatting with big players in the industry, including ones he is a fan of himself. Sanderson is also seeking maintain his rights to video game adaptations of Mistborn.It appears that these discussions are in the earliest possible stage. \"These rights were tied up with the film rights for the last... oh, six-seven years,\" Sanderson wrote, \"so I didn’t get to test the market on them until recently.\" Sanderson concluded that any studio or publisher interested in developing a Mistborn or Stormlight project should get in touch with his representatives.Mistborn is one part of Brandon Sanderson's sprawling Cosmere setting, which also encompasses the Stormlight Archive series. Multiple tabletop games based on Sanderson's work have emerged in recent years, including Cosmere tabletop RPGs and a Mistborn deckbuilder.Sanderson himself has some professional experience related to video games. He designed the world and created characters for the tactics game Moonbreaker. Should this project release, it would not be Mistborn's first foray into video games. A project called \"Mistborn: Birthright\" was in development for a few years before being canceled. Protagonist Kelsier was a guest character in Fortnite, owing to Sanderson's long-standing relationship with Epic.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on January 6, 2026 at 11:46AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Ark: Survival Evolved is one of the best survival games on the market, and over the past decade since its launch, the game has fostered a massive community of players. This community has taken it upon themselves to create thousands of mods for Ark, and some of these improve the game in ways that fans would have never expected. From adding entirely new maps to creating more dangerous and unique dinosaurs to making your life easier with quality-of-life changes, the best Ark mods can fundamentally alter how you play the game.Down below, you’ll find the top mods that Ark has to offer. These are all searchable and downloadable via the game's Steam Workshop section. The modding community for Ark began on Steam and never migrated over to Nexus Mods, which is a shift from how many other survival games handle mods. However, with the mods being directly on Steam, this should make it simpler for you to download your favorite mods and immediately boot them up in Ark.Structures Plus (S+)Created by: orionsonDownload link: Steam WorkshopsStructures Plus is a gigantic mod that's completely centered around building in Ark. A bulk of the mod focuses on quality of life fixes and changes for building mode to make your life much easier. However, the best part about Structures Plus is the ability to snap your structures into place, so there's no more guessing where they might fit. You'll also see new materials included with the mod to spice up base life and give you more objects to build and play around with.Awesome Teleporters!Created by: ChrisDownload link: Steam WorkshopsOne of the more tedious aspects of Ark is having to travel everywhere. While you do get access to dinosaurs, both on the ground and in the air, being able to quickly travel somewhere is a benefit many Ark players wish they had. Well, it's no longer a wish with the Awesome Teleporters mod. This mod adds three new items into the game, and one of them is a teleporter that you can place anywhere on the map in whatever quantity you want. You can then quickly teleport to the locations you've placed them at. The mod also adds another teleport that transports you to a public teleporter on the map and a Dino Tracker, which allows you to teleport directly to a dino you're currently tracking.Death Recovery ModCreated by: ManaloDownload link: Steam WorkshopsThere are very few worse things than dying in Ark, as you usually tend to lose whatever you had in your inventory. However, with the Death Recovery Mod, that won't happen ever again. The mod adds a personal gravestone to a set location of your choosing. If you die, you can return to this gravestone to retrieve any items that you lost upon death. You can basically place this gravestone down near your bed or respawn point so that when you die, you'll immediately be able to get your items and go on like nothing happened.Dino Storage v2Created by: Jax, Zuka, LethalDownload link: Steam WorkshopsWhile capturing all sorts of different dinosaurs and seeing them roam out in the wilderness is one of the best parts about Ark, it can also make dinosaur management a real hassle. Fortunately, with the Dino Storage v2 mod, you can safely and quickly store your captured dinosaurs in a safe place. This mod is basically like the PC system in Pokémon or a personal chest in Minecraft. Once you capture a dinosaur, you can choose to store it in the Dino Storage box until you're ready to take it back out. This allows you to easily track the dinosaurs you've caught and saves a ton of space on your part of the island in Ark.Upgrade Station v1.8iCreated by: GhazlawlDownload link: Steam WorkshopsThe Upgrade Station mod allows you to fully improve the quality of any item in Ark. You can upgrade your gear, weapons, and tools from their most basic form all the way to the highest level possible (Ascendant). You can even upgrade the TEK armor set and items that have been modded into Ark. This means both your vanilla and modded weapons and armor can be upgraded using the new Upgrade Station that you can easily place at your base. You're even able to quickly salvage items at the station, giving you more resources to upgrade your gear.Auto EngramsCreated by: ChrisDownload link: Steam WorkshopsA tedious, but necessary, part of the progression in Ark is dealing with Engrams. You need them to access more advanced content throughout the game, but working through the system can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Luckily, the Auto Engrams mod aims to make the system more automatic and less taxing on the player. The mod automatically unlocks Engrams every time you level up and ignores the point restrictions on Engrams. This means you'll be able to take advantage of new Engrams without having to manually unlock them yourself.Improved Dinos - Rare SpawnsCreated by: premixedpieDownload link: Steam WorkshopsHunting normal dinosaurs is always an adrenaline rush in Ark, but what if there were a way to up the ante? The Improved Dinos mod adds rarer dinos into the game and gives them the ability to roam across a vast area, so there's some legwork when it comes to hunting them. If you manage to kill one of these rare dinosaurs, you're guaranteed to receive some rare blueprints that otherwise would have taken you hours to get from hunting other dinos across the island. The mod adds three dinos, with each one having unique traits: Raptor Elite, Alpha Dilo, and Obsidian Carno. You can read about their traits on the mod's Steam Workshop page.Primal FearsCreated by: Pikkon, NovaStrike, lightspinner94Download link: Steam WorkshopsPrimal Fears is one of the biggest mods to come to Ark, and it adds hours of specifically-designed PvE content to the game. The mod adds different tameable tiers for every dinosaur in the game, as well as boss dinos that are incredibly difficult to kill. Each tameable tier of a dinosaur makes it more challenging to capture, and the tiers come with different challenges you'll have to overcome. In addition to all of that, Primal Fears also places brand new items into the game that aid players in capturing or killing the new dinosaurs. You can see more about the new dinos and items on the mod's Workshop page.Awesome SpyGlass!Created by: ChrisDownload link: Steam WorkshopsThe normal SpyGlass in Ark certainly has its uses, but the Awesome SpyGlass mod makes it seem irrelevant. This mod turns your vanilla SpyGlass into a beacon of information, allowing you to point it at anything and receive a slew of details about whatever you're targeting. This includes dinos, eggs, supply crates, and just about anything else you can find on your island. You can also customize the SpyGlass with a variety of options that are available right from the mod's menu in-game.Shiny! DinosCreated by: nevcairiel, strangechildeDownload link: Steam WorkshopsIf you've played Pokémon or even Palworld, then you probably know about the Shiny forms of creatures in those games. Well, the Shiny! Dinos mod brings that mechanic to Ark, giving you extremely rare and differently-colored dinos to track and tame. Dinos with different colors possess special abilities that you can harness if they're tamed, but they can also be killed to receive some unique rewards. These Shiny dinos have the chance to be a beefed-up version of themselves as well, so don't be surprised if you run into an Aberrant or X variant.Immersive TamingCreated by: BurgerssssssDownload link: Steam WorkshopsThe taming system in the vanilla version of Ark is certainly in-depth, but it can get old after a while. We do have some mods on this list that help improve the taming system, but none are as advanced as the Immersive Taming mod. This mod adds a slew of new taming methods to the game, including giving certain dinos new food, protecting the dino, attacking a dino's target, caring for them, and more. There's also a trust meter with each dino you tame, allowing you to build real bonds with the dinos you capture. This also plays a factor in how hostile dinos act towards you, so the mod really changes up your gameplay when it comes to dino interactions.Reusable PlusCreated by: 123, Luci, 123Download link: Steam WorkshopsVanilla Ark features a degradable gear system that forces you to constantly replenish certain tools and weapons in your inventory after they've been used enough. While this adds to the difficulty of Ark, sometimes you just don't want to worry about an item degrading. Fortunately, the Reusable Plus mod does exactly that, making it so a number of items no longer degrade after they've been created. This includes the grappling hook, spear, parachute, flare gun, and bola.Simple SpawnersCreated by: darkloreDownload link: Steam WorkshopsIf you're playing Ark just for the vibes, the dinos, and the exploration, then you might want a way to make your day-to-day life a little easier. The Simpler Spawners mod aims to give you that easier life. The mod makes it so you can immediately spawn in any creature, resource, nest, or crate wherever you want. While some of the spawns do require you to exchange something else, you can pretty much spawn in whatever you want at any time. This allows you to fully customize your base as well as the entire map. Create a new biome, diversify other areas, and expand your base to be as big as your imagination allows for.Dome of DeathCreated by: crystian, ArkolicosDownload link: Steam WorkshopsMap mods have become extremely popular in the Ark community over the years. Perhaps the most infamous map mod of them all is the Dome of Death, which spawns you in on a terrifyingly difficult map. The Dome of Death is a small island map that locks you in with some of the most dangerous creatures Ark has to offer. Your goal in the dome is to find valuables that are scattered around the map, but there are creatures guarding them with their lives. You can't enter the dome with any tamed creatures by your side, so it's just you against nature.Auto TorchCreated by: dubCUTDownload link: Steam WorkshopsThe Auto Torch mod is all about adding some automation to your Ark life. The mod allows you to place timers on all light sources in the game and makes it so they no longer require any fuel. Basically, you're adding the ability to turn lights on and off whenever you want without having to manually go to each light source every day. You can also add some unique colors to the light sources by adding specific resources to them.Birdwatcher's CollectionCreated by: BirdswatcherDownload link: Steam WorkshopsDespite the name of this mod, it doesn't actually add any sort of bird creatures into Ark. Instead, what it does is optimize a variety of the game's elements and adds a slew of new creatures for you to kill, capture, or tame. The mod mostly accomplishes this by combining two other very popular mods, the Saurophaganax Mod and the Giant Spino Mod.Primal BladesCreated by: AlyDownload link: Steam WorkshopsWeapons are never in short supply when you're playing Ark, but the Primal Blades mod adds in three highly unique katanas that you can add to your inventory. The mod also adds extra dinos to the game, which drop the special crafting resources you need to create the three individual katanas. However, before the resources drop, you'll have to defeat waves of dinos, so there's much more depth to this mod than simply adding in a few new weapons that you can use.    \n  \n                      "

This is a free update that brings new activities to the island and offers more ways to play with friends. There are even major collaborations with Lego, Splatoon, and The Legend of Zelda. In this guide we'll highlight everything you need to know about Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update, including details about the new Resort Hotel and customizable islands for multiplayer.If you are a new player or someone returning after a long hiatus, make sure you check out our complete guide hub for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. This offers starter tips, help with various features, and information on how to upgrade locations.Slumber IslandsWhen your Villager goes to sleep, they can now choose the option \"slumber time\" to go to a new dream world introduced in the 3.0 update.Luna's Dream World lets you fully customize a brand-new island with items you've previously obtained in game. You can build up to three Slumber Islands and choose from three different island sizes.With Slumber Islands, you'll be able to exercise more creative freedom than ever before. You can alter the terrain to remove cliffs and widen rivers to your liking. You'll also have the option to place inclines and bridges. You're not tied to real-world time and weather in Slumber Islands, either. Instead, you can customize these details to create the look you want for your island.One of the biggest highlights of Slumber Island is that you can invite or join friends to customize islands together. It's worth noting that you will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription for online play.The Resort Hotel facilityAnother big feature for 3.0 is the Resort Hotel. This new building is located at the end of the pier of your standard island and gives you a variety of guest rooms to decorate.This waterfront hotel is run by Kapp'n and his family, and they want you to help decorate rooms to entice guests to stay. You'll earn Hotel Tickets for each room you decorate, a brand-new currency that is used to buy exclusive items added with the big update.Fashion opportunitiesIf you're a fashionista, you can also plan and suggest outfits for the hotel guests to wear during their stay. You can style and place outfits on hotel mannequins that will then be available for both you and your guests to wear.Hotel promotionAs always, Tom Nook finds a new opportunity to make some Bells in the 3.0 update. He sees potential in the new Resort Hotel, but he wants your help to promote it. Craft special DIY items for him, and he'll reward you with more Hotel Tickets.Increased home storageThe game's previous storage limit was 5,000, but the 3.0 update will expand storage with two additional upgrades for a maximum of 9,000 items. You'll also be able to store trees, flowers, and shrubs.The prices haven't been revealed yet, but if they're similar to the 2.0 update, you can expect to spend around 900,000 Bells and 1,200,000 Bells per upgrade.Resetti's Reset ServiceIt's finally time for easier island clean up. This update introduces Resetti's Reset Service, a new feature that gives you the ability to clear out flowers, furniture, and more in bulk.This new cleaning service lets you pick a specific area for Resetti to clean, though you can also ask him to clean the entire island or limit it to just the beach area. You can also ask him to place items in storage after he cleans up. This means if you have a messy flower bed, but don't want to lose all your flowers, he can both remove and save them for you.Nintendo itemsAs you help the Resort Hotel, the building's souvenir shop will eventually start selling Nintendo items. You can purchase these exclusive items with the Hotel Tickets you earn.These items include retro Nintendo consoles to decorate your home. If you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you can even play a retro game on each of the consoles you buy. This includes playing classics such as Dr. Mario and Ice Climber.Lego collabIn addition to Nintendo items at the souvenir shop, you can also purchase Lego-themed items from the Nook Shopping app. This will let you decorate your home with Lego brick furniture, such as a sofa, bed, or fireplace. There is also Lego wallpaper and a t-shirt. These items all come in a variety of colors, so you can find something brick-themed to match your style.Legend of Zelda and Splatoon crossoversYou'll be able to add four Nintendo characters with Update 3.0, if you have their amiibo cards: Mineru and Tulin from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Cece and Viché, who are inspired by Callie and Marie from Splatoon.Tapping their amiibo cards will let you invite them to your island, and it will also unlock unique items in Nook Shopping.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The next game in The Sims franchise--codenamed Project Rene--has turned into a mobile-first experience that's all about social multiplayer. It is not The Sims 5, and developer Maxis states this title can live in harmony with The Sims 4 and any future single-player installments in the series.EA and Maxis discussed the future of The Sims in a blog post celebrating the new year. Within this article, the companies noted that \"Project Rene has evolved to focus on social multiplayer play, offering a more direct way for friends to share creativity together.\" In addition, the \"mobile-first life-sim game\" is about collaboration.However, The Sims franchise won't forget about its roots. The blog post states: \"At its core, The Sims was built on a deep, single-player life simulation, chock full of rich systems, meaningful storytelling, and player agency that puts you in control. That foundation isn't going anywhere.\"Originally announced in 2022, Project Rene was presumed to be The Sims 5. But that changed in recent years, as EA and Maxis pointed out the in-development game would complement The Sims 4 instead of replacing it. Earlier this month, The Sims team declared their values wouldn't change, in wake of fan concerns regarding EA's $55 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund affecting the life-sim series.Talk of Project Rene exploring multiplayer concepts emerged in 2023, with Animal Crossing and Among Us name-checked as possible inspirations. Now, it's clear, Project Rene is going all in on social multiplayer. Outside of gaming, there is also a Sims movie in the works.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

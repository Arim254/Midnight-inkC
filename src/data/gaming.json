Season 7 of Fortnite OG kicked off on Thursday with a new OG pass--but unlike previous OG passes, half of this one is time-gated until January 9. As frustrating as that may seem, it could mean that this OG Pass will have more skins than these usually do.There are three skins in the part of the Season 7 OG pass that we can see, and judging by the ones Epic picked, it wouldn't be surprising at all if there were additional skins later. This first part of the OG pass includes three remixes of skins from the Chapter 1 Season 7 battle pass--Voidwalker Lynx is unlocked instantly with a purchase of the pass, and you can earn Lt. Winter and Wonder Onesie by leveling up. Wonder Onesie has the most customization options of any OG pass skin thus far, as you can decorate her with any of the sprays or emoticons you have in your locker.Notably missing are the Ice King, who was Season 7's hero, and the Prisoner, who served as the season baddie. Midway through the original Season 7, the Ice King projected a gigantic magical phantom of himself standing over the island, and then unleashed a blizzard that coated the island in snow for several weeks. Presuming Fortnite OG will do that event again the way it has all the other Chapter 1 live events, it would make a lot of sense for a new Ice King skin to be on one of those hidden pages. Each of the three skins currently available in the Season 7 OG pass comes with a back bling, a pickaxe, a weapon wrap, and an emote. The pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and access to the pass is included while players are subscribed to Fortnite Crew, which costs $12 per month.

Before now, every Lego figure in Fortnite was a Fortnite skin that was adapted into Lego form--but this pass includes the first character who started as a Lego figure to be adapted into a Fortnite-style human skin, with Fire Master Kai. Three other Ninjago characters--Ice Master Zane, Earth Master Cole, and Lightning Master Jay--are available in a bundle from the item shop.Fire Master Kai is unlocked instantly when you purchase the Ninjago Lego Pass, which costs 1,400 V-Bucks, and is available through Fortnite Crew. From there, you can unlock a variety of Ninjago-themed builds and decor items, as well as a new emote and a couple of loading screens. You can unlock one item for every two account levels you earn, meaning it will take 60 levels to get everything included in the Ninjago Lego Pass. When it comes to Lego builds, these Lego passes have become essential. In all of 2025, Fortnite only released one new Lego build in the item shop--the Daft Punk Pyramid. Which means nearly every new Lego build added to the game in the past year was earned through quests or the passes. So if you play the Lego modes regularly and plan to continue doing so, the Lego Pass is worth, at the very least, a hard look.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Just one day after Bethesda released The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the Nintendo Switch 2, the publisher admitted the new version has performance problems. Players called the port a \"disaster,\" and many more reported major input lag and a locked 30 frames per second.Over on Reddit, the details of the lag became apparent when someone posted the delay between moving the Joy-Con stick and his character reacting in the game. \"There's like a whole second between me flicking the stick and my character moving its head.\" The discussion evolved into comparing Skyrim's Switch 2 version to Cyberpunk 2077, which runs at 40 frames per second on the same hardware while showing more detailed worlds. Another common complaint is the game's size: Skyrim takes up 53GB of the Switch 2's limited internal storage, even though it uses only 25GB on PC. For many fans, this raised questions about how the port was handled.On Bethesda's official support site, the company posted a mouthful of a question titled \"Why am I experiencing frame rate issues with The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim following the Anniversary Edition update on Nintendo Switch?\" Bethesda responded by saying it is investigating the situation, but has not found solutions as of yet.\"We are investigating reports of performance issues on Nintendo Switch with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim after the Anniversary Edition update,\" and told players to subscribe to the article for updates. \"In addition, you can provide feedback and information regarding on this topic via the Feedback form.\"The Anniversary Edition is priced at $60, and players who own the older Switch version can pay $20 to upgrade and use it on both consoles. The edition includes the base game and the expansions Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire, along with improvements on Switch 2 such as enhanced resolution, faster loading, performance boosts, Joy-Con 2 mouse support, motion controls, Amiibo support, and other upgrades.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

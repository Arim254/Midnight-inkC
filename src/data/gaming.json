The new island features four named locations based on the town of Hawkins, Indiana, as well as a border right down the middle separating the normal world from locations that have been corrupted by the Upside Down--essentially giving the map a pair of distinct biomes, something that Blitz hasn't done before since its map is already so little.The map and the new item shop skins based on Vecna and the original four boys are the entirety of this takeover--there aren't any new Stranger Things weapons added to the loot pool or anything like that. That's fine, because between the ongoing Simpsons season and the imminent launch of Chapter 7, we've already got plenty of new mechanics to worry about.Scroll on for looks at the full new map and each of the named locations.As you can see, the island is split in half between the regular part in the west and the Upside Down part in the east, with each half getting two of the major locations. While the Upside Down half is always dark and spooky, the normal half of the island has the usual day/night cycle.Gnarly FarmsStranger SuburbsLibrary LandingHawkins HeightsHawkins Heights includes this movie theater sign and marquee teasing the Chapter 6 finale event that's taking place on Saturday, November 29. Fun fact: Despite the sign indicating otherwise, there's no movie theater on this map.    \n  \n                      "

One of the best ways to extend your runs is to get more potion uses, which can be unlocked by speaking with an NPC in town. You can have up to five total potions, along with other potions-related upgrades, like improved healing. Here's how to unlock more potions in Moonlighter 2.How to get more potions in Moonlighter 2You can unlock up to five total potion uses for a single dungeon run.Potion upgrades can be purchased from Eris the witch, who is found next door to your shop, just to the south. Eris' upgrades are divided into four sections, unlocked through various means. The first one is available immediately, with the second awarded for reaching the 50,000 coin milestone with the Endless Vault.Once you have a panel unlocked, you need to spend both coins and various crafting materials, dropped by enemies in dungeons. The materials vary depending on the upgrades, although you typically unlock the area with the enemies you need to defeat before unlocking the new panel. Eris also offers other important potion upgrades, like increased healing and pedestals that restore potions during a dungeon.While there are a seemingly endless number of upgrades to purchase in Moonlighter 2, once you have access to the next potions upgrade, you should prioritize it, as having an additional potion will drastically improve your dungeon runs.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                How many relics you can carry back to town is incredibly important in Moonlighter 2, the roguelike shop management game. The more relics you can bring back with you, the more items you have to sell in the shop, which means more money in your pockets. Before you can upgrade your inventory, you'll need to meet an NPC during a run.How to expand your inventory space in Moonlighter 2To expand your inventory space, you will need to purchase additional slots from Sliver, an NPC who will come to town in the western section. You can meet Sliver fairly early into Moonlighter 2, but there is one requirement to get him to come to town. You need to first encounter Sliver during a run in Kalina. This isn't too difficult, as Kalina is the first area you have access to. All you need to do is find Sliver at a \"?\" room during a run. It's not guaranteed to be him, but there are only a handful of possible characters who can appear.You can unlock additional inventory slots, allowing you to carry even more relics.Once you've encountered him during a run, he will be present in town, where you can purchase inventory slots. The first slot costs 4,000 gold, with the second costing 8,000, increasing from there. There is also another row that becomes available after the first, but that requires crafting materials not currently present in the early access version at the time of writing. While you're at it, you'll also want to be sure to get more potions in Moonlighter 2.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

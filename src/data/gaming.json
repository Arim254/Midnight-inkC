    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Billy Givens\n   on November 14, 2025 at 11:53AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Arc Raiders' first major post-launch update has brought with it a whole new map, two additional ARC enemies, and a variety of fresh items (guns, grenades, and more) for players to discover and use. However, it has also introduced the first event in the game, known as Breaking New Ground. While the first part of this event asked the community to come together and commit resources to unlocking the Stella Montis map, the second portion--Staking Our Claim--has a free mini-battle pass of sorts with plenty of rewards to earn by simply playing the game.To unlock rewards during the Staking Our Claim event, you'll need to earn XP in matches. For every 100 XP earned, you are granted 1 Merit. You'll need a total of 3,600 Merits to collect everything in the event--and though this may sound like a major undertaking, XP comes pretty quickly when looting and killing enemies in raids, so it's likely to take you less time than you think.Additionally, if you participated in the first half of the event by giving resources to the tunnel efforts, you'll have already reached up to 900 Merits toward the reward track right out of the gate. This will give you a considerable head start on getting every reward, so here's to hoping you contributed! Rewards are automatically unlocked and granted every 150 Merits, ensuring you're regularly getting something for your hard work while exploring topside.Below is every reward in the Staking Our Claim event and how many Merits you'll need to unlock them. All rewards are free, so there's nothing optional to purchase and you'll not miss out on anything by simply playing and earning XP. The event ends on December 7, so you have a little over three weeks from the start to earn all free rewards.Hiker Backpack150 MeritsRaider Tokens x100300 MeritsDoor Blocker x3450 MeritsCombat Mk. 2600 MeritsIl Toro750 MeritsStriker (Outfit)900 MeritsSeeker Grenade x31050 MeritsBag (Striker Variant)1200 MeritsTrailblazer x2 1350 MeritsBucket (Backpack Attachment)1500 MeritsDeadline1650 MeritsCan't Hear You (Emote)1800 MeritsRaider Tokens x1001950 MeritsDirt Full (Face Style)2100 MeritsExtended Barrel2250 MeritsOrange (Striker Color)2400 MeritsRaider Tokens x1002550 MeritsPadding (Striker Variant)2700 MeritsSnap Hook2850 MeritsRed (Striker Color)3000 MeritsRaider Tokens x1003150 MeritsHelmet (Striker Variant)3300 MeritsRaider Tokens x1003450 MeritsGas Mask (Striker Variant)3600 Merits    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was going to embrace games-as-a-service before it shifted to become XDefiant, a game that the publisher shut down not long after release. This is according to Nick Herman, a developer who worked on the game before leaving to start AdHoc Studios, the team that just launched the episodic game Dispatch to great success.\"I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while,\" Herman said told Bloomberg. \"And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.\"The game was in development \"for a few months,\" Bloomberg reported, and Herman confirmed that Ubisoft wanted to have it feature games-as-a-service elements.\"We tried,\" Herman said. \"Let's make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.\"The report said \"Ubisoft had lost interest\" in this Splinter Cell game and shifted to pursue a project that could attempt to compete with Call of Duty. This became XDefiant, a game directed by former Call of Duty boss Mark Rubin. The game shut down after a year and developers were laid off. \"We thought we were going to be able to make something really great,\" Herman said. \"And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don't anymore. It's a common thing in games.\"While that Splinter Cell game is not coming to market, a Splinter Cell remake is now in the works. Outside of games, the Splinter Cell TV show Deathwatch debuted in October on Netflix and has already been renewed for a second season. A live-action movie was in the works, but apparently no longer is.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The story of Concord is a cautionary tale in the age of live-service games. Years of development and millions of dollars went into the game, only for it to fail at launch and get canceled by Sony weeks later. However, Conord had some fans, and a trio of them worked very hard to bring the game back to life on a server.As reported by The Game Post, Concord's partial resurrection is due to reverse engineering by a user called Red, a rebuild of the game's backend API by open_wizard, and an additional assist from a programmer called gwog. The team shared a pair of a gameplay videos to demonstrate their achievement, but noted that Concord is still somewhat buggy.          The trio successfully tested their ability to load the game, pick their characters, and run a full Clash Point match.\"The project is still WIP, it's playable, but buggy,\" wrote Red. \"Once our servers are fully set up, we'll begin doing some private playtesting.\"          When Concord launched in 2024, it debuted to only 25,000 players. Sony subsequently shut down the game's developer, Firewalk Studios. In the aftermath, Sony recommitted to live-service games and shared some of the hard lessons it learned from the ordeal. Sony Interactive Entertainment chief executive of studio business Hermen Hulst attributed its failure to a lack of oversight.Concord's fate was recently cited in a debate in the United Kingdom's House of Commons about the preservation of video games. That session also addressed the Stop Killing Games movement, but lawmakers were unconvinced of the necessity to create laws that prevent games from being taken offline.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

However, not everything about the update is apocalyptic doom and gloom, as there's a bit of holiday cheer to be found here, too. If you've logged on this holiday season, you may have noticed the Gathering Candleberries event is currently requesting that you earn Merits to gain access to some neat rewards, including Candleberries--which you'll need for the Flickering Flames project, too.There are 25 total rewards to earn during the Gathering Candleberries event, and you'll have until January 13 to get them all. Luckily, since Merits (the currency to unlock these rewards) are obtained by simply earning XP during raids, even casual players should be able to unlock everything from this event if they're doing things that yield decent XP gains.To make the most of your Merit acquisition, make sure you're looting everything you come across for a constant influx of XP. If you want to speed things up, grab a Hullcracker or some Wolfpack grenades and take down large Arc like Bastions, Bombardiers, Leapers, or Rocketeers for a big chunk of XP, then loot their individual parts for even bigger gains. You'll get all of the rewards in no time!If you're curious about what to expect from the Gathering Candleberries event, here's a full gallery of every reward you can net with your Merits.Hi-Tech HikerCandleberries x10Scanner (Hi-Tech Hiker Variant)Candleberries x10Check Compass EmoteCandleberriesRaider Tokens x50Blue Camo (Hi-Tech Hiker Color)Candleberries x30Field Phone (Hi-Tech Hiker Variant)Candleberries x30Sprayed Eyes RedRaider Tokens x50Orange (Hi-Tech Hiker Color)Candleberries x40Mask (Hi-Tech Hiker Variant)Raider Tokens x50Yellow Camo (Hi-Tech Hiker Color)Candleberries x40Headgear (Hi-Tech Hiker Variant)Raider Tokens x50White (Hi-Tech Hiker Color)Goggles (Hi-Tech Hiker Variant)Raider Tokens x50Space Wrench Raider Tool    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Germany's defense ministry is now funding tests to see if hissing cockroaches from Madagascar can be used as reconnaissance drones on the battlefield. It sounds like something out of a futuristic military video game, like Call of Duty.The defense ministry has announced that it's funding research and development at SWARM Biotactics to create technology that can \"steer cockroaches and send them on reconnaissance missions,\" CBS News reported.          CEO Stefan Wilhelm said the cockroaches are \"super resilient\" and can crawl through \"tiny spaces,\" climb up walls, go into pipes, and navigate through rubble. How does this work? Neuroscientists at the company put electrodes on the critters' antennae to \"stimulate the insects' natural ability to navigate.\" They wear little backpacks carrying batteries and chips, with the bugs controlled through a game-style joystick. The researchers claim the cockroaches are not hurt by any of this.Games like Call of Duty and others have gameplay systems that allow people to pilot reconnaissance drones to gather intelligence on the battlefield, but not by way of a cockroach--at least not yet.Image credit: 60 Minutes / CBS NewsOne day, the hope is that the bugs can carry cameras and microphones onto the battlefield, or Doppler radar, the researchers said.Germany's defense minister, Boris Pistorius, said the country is beefing up its military defenses because otherwise, \"there might be people like Vladimir Putin who will take that kind of living away from us.\"Using cockroaches in this manner is nothing very new, as researchers from the US were conducting similar cyborg cockroach tests more than a decade ago.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Pedro \"Flute Guy\" Eustache has become one of The Game Awards most-beloved returning figures, known for playing his outlandish collection of flutes with incredible passion and panache. After another stellar performance at The Game Awards 2025, Eustache has taken to social media to show off all the different instruments he played in this year's show.While Eustache's stage presence is the main element that has made him so popular with viewers of The Game Awards, his unusual collection of instruments has also tickled the internet's fancy over the years he's been a part of The Game Awards Orchestra. This year, he has named all the different instruments he played in the famous Game of the Year medley, which include a handful of curiously custom-made or customized instruments.Showing them off in the order they were played during the medley, Eustache's first two instruments are western concert flutes with swapped-out headpieces--the first from a traditional Armenian shvi, and the second a 3D-printed head based on the Armenian blul. Eustache also demonstrates the strange flute he played during the Clair Obscur section of the medley, simply calling it a \"PVC-based flute.\" Geoff Keighley revealed after the show that Eustache built this instrument just for TGAs.The next flute is another traditional folk instrument, this time a Chinese dizi. The medley is finished with two western flutes, the bass flute, and the huge contrabass flute--the former being the instrument Eustache first went viral with during his enthusiastic performance in the 2022 Game of the Year medley.I'm elated that you were unto our GOTY TGA 2025 performance.YES you got it: the Thumb-size-Ocarina wasn't on my last video!Thanks to @geoffkighley & @lornebafle & to God, for His awesome grace!Stay tuned: many more great projects coming up soon!God bless you all! pic.twitter.com/CfF87T9IRR  — Pedro Eustache (@EustachePedro) December 16, 2025              In a follow-up video, Eustache revealed that he had omitted one instrument that made an appearance at the 2025 awards ceremony--the thumb-sized ocarina played for Donkey Kong Bananza. He finishes by thanking \"gamers of the world\" for their support, promising he will indeed be back for The Game Awards 2026.Outside of Flute Guy and the TGA orchestra's incredible performances, this year's awards show was dominated by Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which took home a record-breaking 13 nominations and nine award wins, including Game of the Year. Clair Obscur has also been revealed as GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2025.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Shadow of the Colossus is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, October 18, 2025. Below, we examine the moral complexity of its narrative as told through its silent protagonist.Does a silent protagonist equal a self-insert? The logic of many video games dictates yes. Heroes like Gordon Freeman and Link have been forever silent, only grunting or shouting. Even Master Chief, who does have a voice, obscures his face. Under his mask, there could be anyone there.Despite this common logic, silence is often alienating. Few games embody this better than the works of Fumido Ueda. The protagonists of Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, and The Last Guardian are taciturn, often silent or speaking only a fantastical language, which is either subtitled or not immediately understood. Moments of speech, or even of action outside of player input, are profound and rare.Under the logic of silent identification, these protagonists would be simple, iconographic player stand-ins. Yet Ueda's curated gaps create an empathetic distance from his games' heroes. Over the 20 years since Shadow of the Colossus' release, it has proven its profundity as a moral fable because of its distance from the player.

Protagonist Wander's quest is grounded in games past. He seeks to rescue his love from death. To do so, he must slay the titular colossi: massive foes strewn across a forbidden land. The entity spurring Wander on, Dormin, is a voice from the heavens haloed in light. Wander wields a legendary sword--one whose connection with the sun guides him on his quest. In every superficial sense, he is the epitome of a hero. He has a noble quest, a holy tool, and monstrous foes meant for killing.Yet, Wander is the aggressor. For many of the colossi, he must fire his bow and arrow at them to even gain their attention. It is only when he intrudes on their space, and often not until he attacks them, that they will attack him. The colossi bleed black. It spurts from them as Wander stabs them. They moan, flail, weep, and scream as he climbs over and on them. Each colossus has an animal nobility, which Wander murders. Each element is a part of Shadow of the Colossus' rhetoric. Collectly, they change the usual aspects of heroic fantasy into something horrifying.Yet, Wander is not a cypher or a stand-in. Often, games with silent protagonists start from a position of relative normalcy. Think of Gordon Freeman's long train ride to the office in Half-Life, or Link's childhood stomping ground of Kokiri Forest in Ocarina of Time. In Shadow of the Colossus, we start midway through Wander's journey as he travels on horseback over the land. When he arrives and places his love Mono on an altar, we learn only a few things about him. One, he carries an \"ancient sword,\" as Dormin calls it. Two, he is attempting to free his love from death and some curse. Three, his horse Agro is a loyal and courageous companion. There is the suggestion of a life lived outside the bounds of the games. There are things that matter that the player cannot yet see or know about.Furthermore, Wander's exact motivations are shadowy. His relationship with Mono is never depicted. Instead we see how he acts without her. His journey to kill the colossi is strenuous and dangerous both, yet he continues with almost unfailing motivation. The player can direct him to stand over Mono's body on the altar. The camera zooms in, intimate in a way the game rarely is otherwise. Wander's love is profound, and perhaps selfish given how much he will destroy to see it restored, yet we do not witness it, and thus struggle to identify with it directly. Shadow of the Colossus builds this understanding through gestures that accumulate into cascading meaning.Through these gestures, the game takes on a theatrical quality. The player inhabits Wander as an actor might play a role. The player makes some choices, like how often he visits Mono between besting colossi or whether their own skill will define him as a dexterous warrior or a clumsy, though strong-willed, commoner. Yet, the form is set. Wander has made his choices. The player can only interpret them.This is a massive contrast with many other games, which are often concerned with the main character's morality. BioShock and Spec Ops: The Line, for example, use the main character as a player surrogate. BioShock's plot twist emphasizes how little agency the player actually has in the story, turning its hero into a hapless stooge. In Spec Ops: The Line, the player's will to finish the game and protagonist Walker's belief in the importance of his mission are equivocated. As Walker's determination damns him, it implicates the player too. In loading screens and monologues, Spec Ops admonishes the player to stop playing.Shadow of the Colossus (2018)Both these games have a little more under the hood than mere player condemnation, yet there is something shallow about their approach to protagonist morality. The developers themselves are curiously absent from this logic, for example. BioShock's twist has dramatic force, but little emotional heft. The protagonist isn't anyone; he is only a tool. The twist relies on player identification that comes only from absence. Spec Ops: The Line fairs better in this regard. Walker is a character of at least two dimensions. Yet, if he is a character who acts on his own terms, why all this discussion of player complicity? The moral swing cannot quite implicate the player in any real way.Shadow of the Colossus is also interested in agency, but not that of the player--, rather, of Wander himself. BioShock and Spec Ops are both loud. Antagonists Andrew Ryan and John Konrad explain tell the themes to the player in direct terms. Shadow of the Colossus is quiet. Its world is full of empty spaces and empty time. That emptiness leads to an empathetic, though still distant, stance. Through the process of play, the player comes to understand Wander. That process of embodiment is fuzzy, mythical, not simple or reducible. Shadow of the Colossus doesn’t treat the player as a hapless stooge, unable to really understand the situation at hand until the game’s writers offer their magnanimous help. Wander’s wrongdoing is not a twist. That fact allows the player to sit with it, even to embody it for a time.Condemnation is cheap; it is understanding that is hard won and difficult. Though Walker has more voice lines and more writing, Wander still feels more real because his personhood is not attached to the player. Instead, there is a sense of an exchange. We feel for Wander and mourn for him. That relationship has a deeper and more profound bearing on our own morality than simple condemnation. If we ask whether we are guilty, Shadow of the Colossus will always be silent.At the game's end, after a fellowship sworn to stop Wander arrives and seals him within the forbidden land, Wander goes where the player cannot follow. The sealing process has turned him into a child, which the successfully resurrected Mono seems to want to raise. All of Wander's heroics and strength have been sapped out of him. He is now a creature incapable of holding a controller.That ambiguous end is part of what gives Shadow of the Colossus its lasting power. We were Wander's companions for a time. We walked with him. But his fate is his own. So too, is ours.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

The friendship mechanic, also known as happiness, determines your teammates' respective affinity toward you, their trainer. This can be improved through various means to help unlock new evolutionary paths.Pokemon can become friendlier toward you through the following methods:Exploring the game world while they're your active buddy.Using various items and equipment.Chilling in cafes and restaurants.Which Pokemon tend to evolve based on friendship levels?Friendship level in Pokemon Legends: Z-A matters to certain creatures whose evolutions are tied to this concept. These include the following:Pikachu - Evolves from a Pichu at high friendship levels.Eevee - Can turn into an Espeon (daytime evolution), Umbreon (nighttime evolution), or Sylveon (evolution with a Fairy-type ability in the moveset).Cleffa - Evolves into a Clefairy.Budew - Evolves into a Roselia during the day.Buneary - Evolves into a Lopunny.Riolu - Evolves into a Lucario during the day.Items that help increase friendship levels: Berries and the Soothe BellVarious items can increase Pokemon happiness and friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. These include different kinds of berries that boost friendship, while also lowering a particular stat. We don't really recommend using these since it's hard to offset the penalties to a Pokemon's stat growth. But if you really want to, you can check unmarked vendor and market stalls all over the city:Pomeg Berry - Lose base points for its HP stat.Kelpsy Berry - Lose base points for its attack stat.Qualot Berry - Lose base points for its defense stat.Hondew Berry - Lose base points for its SP attack stat.Grepa Berry - Lose base points for its SP defense stat.Tamato Berry - Lose base points for its speed stat.Still, one item that's quite viable is the Soothe Bell. It's a reward from Side Mission 36: Some Friendly Competition. Here are a few tidbits:The quest giver NPC is right in front of Cafe Rouleau in Magenta Sector 5. It's in the western part of the map.Defeat the trainer's Clefairy to receive the item.You can have a Pokemon hold the Soothe Bell via the inventory screen. This makes the creature friendlier.Fast friendship boosts via cafes and restaurantsBy far the fastest method of improving friendship and happiness levels involves cafes and restaurants. These are found all throughout Lumiose City:Go to a cafe and purchase a coffee or tea drink. Each option costs roughly 500 gold or more.Do this three or four times to fully max out a Pokemon's affinity toward you. You don't even need to go to a different establishment.You're going to spend 2,000 gold or more each time, but you can still earn a lot of money from the Battle Zone at night.That does it for our guide on how to increase friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. If you're keen on improving the capabilities of your teammates, you can visit our best early-game Pokemon guide and TM locations guide.You don't need to face the challenges in Lumiose City all by your lonesome. We've got a Pokemon Legends: Z-A guides hub to help you go from the bottom to the very top of the rankings.    \n  \n                      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nGame Pass was the best deal in gaming. Now it's a deal in gaming, for some people.By \n    Eric Frederiksen\n   on October 17, 2025 at 3:36PM PDT\n              \n                Microsoft recently announced that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is climbing from the sweaty price of $20 US per month to an eye-watering $30. The \"real\" gamers around the internet already have a joke for it: \"Xbox 360 dollars per year.\"But while the jokes write themselves, determining if Game Pass is still of value to me at this new price has taken far more energy. Yes, the company has also added new incentives and moved some features around, but do these additions create value, or just even more confusion? Let's break things down a bit.Currently, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes access to all Microsoft-published games--as well as many other titles--on their respective release days. It also includes a subscription to EA Play, Ubisoft Classics, and will soon include Fortnite Crew. With Ubisoft Classics coming in at $80 per year, EA Play at $40 per year, and Fortnite Crew at $144 per year, the total value of these subscriptions is $264, which definitely helps sweeten spending $360 a year on Game Pass--if you actually use them.Let's talk about the subscriptions that come with Ultimate and what they mean. First, there's Ubisoft Classics. If you look at the Ubisoft Classics website, the standard subscription tier costs $7.99 per month, but only offers PC play. Ubisoft Classics' Premium tier, however, features both PC and Xbox play for a total of $17.99 per month. Xbox claims that its version of Ubisoft Classics adds $7.99 per month of value per platform, meaning those playing on both PC and Xbox receive the greatest benefit. With the Game Pass version of Ubisoft Classics, you get access to a rotating menu of games in their standard editions rather than the 100-plus games--often in their Premium editions--that are promised in Ubisoft Premium. You're getting access on PC and Xbox, yes, but to a smaller library of games, in Standard editions instead of Premium. Microsoft wants you to think of this as a $15.98 value each month, but with all these caveats, it's hard to take the quoted \"$7.99 a month per platform\" value seriously.EA Play, meanwhile, is more straightforward. Through EA, the subscription costs $5.99 per month and offers 10-hour trials on new games and \"unlimited access to a collection of top EA titles,\" and it seems as though that's what Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is offering as well.However, in their standalone versions, both of these programs offer discounts on Ubisoft and EA games respectively; there's no word on whether those discounts would apply to Game Pass subscribers. We're guessing they won't, though, because as part of the price increase, Xbox also eliminated the game and DLC discounts that previously were included as part of the service.Fortnite Crew is a bit more complex. If you stay subscribed to Fortnite Crew all year long, you gain access to all battle passes all year, and receive 1,000 V-Bucks per month (12,000 total in a year) and 12 sets of unique Fortnite Crew outfits. But while this might sound like a good deal, even if you play a lot of Fortnite, it still isn't worth the value. That's because not all the rewards you get for being a Crew member are created equal--Fortnite battle passes and Crew rewards are full of throwaway items you probably won't care about to fill out their offerings. These rewards mostly aren't the cool genre-bending collaborations like Scooby-Doo or Power Rangers, they're generic, non-copyright-infringing characters and songs.A promotional image from Fortnite's Scooby-Doo-filled Fortnitemares event.You'd have to love the Crew outfits, use the Jam Tracks, and play LEGO Fortnite modes--along with completing the Battle Passes--to really get your money's worth. The short version is that Fortnite Crew is $144 for about $100 worth of V-Bucks, some skins you probably won't use, some LEGO pieces you probably won't use, and Jam Tracks that you may or may not even care about.Regular Fortnite players (myself included) will often buy a Crew Pass to complete a season's Battle Pass and earn the corresponding bonus V-Bucks. But as an ongoing subscription, you have to be extremely invested in Fortnite to justify Crew on its own merits.Now, when speaking purely in terms of Microsoft-published games, Game Pass admittedly makes a pretty strong case for itself. This year alone has brought us Avowed, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Gears of War Reloaded, and I'd be remiss not to mention that Ninja Gaiden 4, Call of Duty Black Ops 7, The Outer Worlds 2, and Keeper are all just around the corner. This also doesn't include the various third-party games that come to Xbox Game Pass on Day One--games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Hollow Knight: Silksong. But again, the exact \"value\" here is subjective--you'd have to play a lot of those games for the math to actually add up.Coincidentally, a study published by Circana shortly after the Game Pass price hike found that most US game players purchase two or fewer new games a year. Sure, there is a lot of nuance to this statistic, but at the same time, when the majority of gamers report they spend around $140 a year on new games, does the average player truly find value in spending $360 a year just to temporarily gain access to a handful of them?It's also worth noting that we can't rely on Microsoft to release that many games next year or the year after. It might happen, but again, we're talking about potential value.To get the greatest value out of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'd almost have to use it to the exclusion of other gaming services, and that's not how the majority of gamers are using the service. Personally, I tend to like Microsoft-published games; by the end of the year I'll have played five of the above Microsoft-published games, along with a bunch of other third-party Game Pass games. I also play Fortnite a lot and tend to play games on my Xbox rather than my PlayStation. I'm one of the rare cases that can maybe justify that \"Xbox $360\" price tag. But even then, I hesitate.In earlier days, Game Pass felt like a steal: You only had to play one or two games to justify the cost. Everything else was just gravy. With this price increase, though, the math becomes far more complex--to the point that it feels like you're talking yourself into giving your wallet to a guy who says he'll definitely bring it back and not to worry. And if that doesn't get you, the changes and transient nature of the service will.Game Pass was the best deal in console gaming. Now, it's a deal in console gaming--but only under very specific circumstances.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

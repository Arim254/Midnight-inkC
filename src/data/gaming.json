    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Steven Petite\n   on December 22, 2025 at 2:13AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The Lego Star Wars UCS Death Star will no longer be exclusive to the Lego Store starting January 1. The enormous 9,023-piece model is available to preorder for $1,000 at Amazon. If you're a Prime member, you can start building the Death Star as soon as January 2. Even if you aren't a Prime member, Amazon estimates January 5 for the free delivery option. This is notable because the Death Star is currently on backorder for 60 days at the Lego Store.As of December 22, Amazon is the only major retailer taking preorders for the UCS Death Star. Given its size and lofty price, we wouldn't be surprised if some retailers don't carry it--and we'd expect inventory to be limited. Amazon is also taking preorders for two smaller Star Wars Lego sets that are bound to be popular.The UCS Death Star first launched at the Lego Store October 1. At 9,023 pieces, it's the biggest Star Wars model in Lego's 25-plus year history with the brand and the fifth largest Lego set overall. The Death Star also shattered the record for most expensive Lego set ever. At $1,000, it's $150 more than the popular 7,541-piece UCS Millennium Falcon, which held the title of largest Star Wars Lego set for eight years.Lego Star Wars UCS Death Star (9,023 Pieces)$1,000 | Releases at Amazon on January 1.The UCS Death Star is based on its original design from Episode IV: A New Hope. Like all Ultimate Collector Series Star Wars sets, it's all about the details with this set. It's a staggeringly elaborate model with many distinct rooms that longtime fans will instantly recognize. Some of the interactive and adjustable elements include a working elevator, the trash compactor, the Superlaser, and a brick-built Imperial Shuttle with adjustable wings.And Lego ensured you can recreate the Death Star scenes from Episode IV by including 36 minifigures and two Lego droid figures. It probably goes without saying, but no Lego set has ever come with 38 figures.There's plenty of room inside the Death Star for all of those figures (and more). Once fully assembled, the UCS Death Star is 27.5 inches tall, 31 inches wide, and 10.5 inches deep.You can take a closer look at the new UCS Death Star below. We've also included details on the two previous UCS Death Star models as well as the current Ultimate Collector Series lineup.And if you want to start 2026 off with a Lego Star Wars build that isn't anywhere close to $1,000, Amazon is also taking preorders for the 643-piece Venator-Class Attack Cruiser, the latest mid-size Lego starship model, for $80. If you'd rather build a beloved droid, the new 569-piece BB-8 Astromech Droid is available to preorder for $90. Over at the Lego Store, you can preorder the 525-piece mid-size AT-AT Walker for $65. A total of eight brand-new Lego Star Wars sets launch January 1.The new Death Star is the first in the Lego Star Wars lineup since 2008.UCS Death Star 75419 is Lego's third iteration of the iconic space station, but it's hard to make a fair comparison to previous models because the level of detail and complexity in the UCS line--and the broader Lego catalog in general--has increased considerably over the years. But for reference: UCS Death Star 10143 released in 2005 as a 3,449-piece model, and UCS Death Star 10188 launched in 2008 with 3,803 pieces. So it's been about 15 years since a UCS Death Star has been sold by official retailers.Death Star compared to other UCS Star Wars models.When the Death Star launched in October, it was one of nine Ultimate Collector Series models sold at retailers, but that number will soon be seven. Lego is retiring the X-Wing Starfighter and Razor Crest, and both models are already sold out at major retailers. The Lego Store is also sold out of the Razor Crest, but the 1,953-piece X-Wing Starfighter is in stock for $240 as of December 22.The Death Star is the third UCS build to launch in 2025. The $300 replica of Jango Fett's Firespray-Class Starship arrived on Star Wars Day. In August, Lego released the UCS AT-ST Walker. Priced at $200, this 1,513-piece display model is the most affordable UCS build available today.Prior to the Death Star, the UCS Millennium Falcon and AT-AT Walker models were the priciest at $850. The AT-AT Walker is retired, but Han Solo's iconic freighter ship is still available today. With the Death Star in the mix, the Millennium Falcon is the second-largest UCS build with 7,541 pieces. The gap between first and second is 1,482 pieces--nearly a full AT-ST Walker model.We've listed the UCS Star Wars models that are still available for retail price below. Lego Star Wars Ultimate Collector SeriesAT-ST Walker (1,513 pieces) -- $200TIE Interceptor Starfighter (1,931 pieces) -- $230X-Wing Starfighter (1,949 pieces) -- $240 | Retiring soonJango Fett's Firespray-Class Starship (2,970 pieces) -- $300Jabba's Sail Barge (3,942 pieces) -- $500The Razor Crest (6,187 pieces) -- Sold out | Retiring soonVenator-Class Republic Attack Cruiser (5,374 pieces) -- $650Millennium Falcon (7,541 pieces) -- $850Death Star (9,023 pieces) -- $1,000You can also check out this custom Amazon page we created for Star Wars UCS models. We included the X-Wing and Razor Crest in the unlikely event they are restocked for retail price. You'll also find the 1,890-piece Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder on that page; the UCS Landspeeder is retired, but it's only selling for around $30 higher than its $240 MSRP on Amazon.USC Death Star comes with 38 Lego minifigures.Here's the list of minifigures included with UCS Death Star:Luke Skywalker (Tatooine)Luke Skywalker (Stormtrooper)Luke Skywalker (Jedi Knight)Han SoloHan Solo (Stormtrooper)Obi-Wan KenobiPrincess LeiaChewbaccaC-3POR2-D2Darth VaderEmperor PalpatineGrand Moff TarkinGalen ErsoOrson KrennicAdmiral YularenAdmiral MottiGeneral TaggeImperial Dignitary5D6-RA-7 Protocol DroidR3-T6 Astromech Droid6 StormtroopersHot Tub Stormtrooper2 Royal Guards2 Death Star TroopersImperial Naval OfficerShuttle Pilot2 Gunners2 Crew MembersAll 38 characters displayed alongside the Death Star reference placard.Make sure to clear some shelf space before you start building.The half-built Death Star is larger than the vast majority of Lego sets.The completed Death Star looks even larger next to a human.The Superlaser is attached to the side of the build.Even though this is technically a partial Death Star, the 10-inch depth means it's one of the most spaciousThe Imperial Shuttle has adjustable wings.Darth Vader meeting with Moff Tarkin and Imperial leadership in the Conference Room.Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader's lightsaber duel in Emperor Palpatine's Throne RoomDarth Vader greets Emperor Palpatine in the hangar bay.C-3PO and R2-D2 in the hangar bay.Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca board the Death StarDarth Vader approaching Princess Leia's holding cell.Darth Vader and Obi-Wan's lightsaber duel.Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Chewbacca escape the trash compactor.Hangar control room with C-3PO and Obi-Wan in his Stormtrooper disguise.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Josh Broadwell\n   on December 19, 2025 at 9:56PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The need for the best Cyberpunk 2077 mods to fix some of the ambitious RPG's bigger issues has changed dramatically in the years since developer CD Projekt Red launched the game in a messy, buggy state. Cars handle less wildly, criminal activity is more tense and dangerous, and things generally just work the way they should.That doesn't mean they can't work even better, though. Cyberpunk 2077's mod scene is still vibrant, with imaginative creators putting out new CyberDecks, overhauling V's apartment, letting you actually unlock and use every perk, and giving extensive control over photo mode and the kinds of scenes you can create. We've rounded up 22 of the best ones, and we've noted which work with Phantom Liberty and are up-to-date with Cyberpunk 2077's latest version.Like with most mods, these only work for Cyberpunk 2077 on PC. If you're after some console fun instead, check out our picks for the best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X|S games to play in 2025.New Level CapCreator: DeepVisionDownload link: NexusModsCyberpunk 2077's existing level cap makes it impossible to learn every perk. The idea is to encourage specialization, as you build toward a specific playstyle, and you can just play again if you want to try others after using your once-per-character respec. That'd be fine--in a world with infinite free time. New Level Cap raises Cyberpunk 2077's cap from 60 to 80, which gives you enough points to unlock and master every perk in the game. There's also a feature that lets you customize stat caps for a more tailored experience.They Will RememberCreator: Eris404Download link: NexusModsNight City's a big place with lots of faces, but when someone makes as much of a ruckus (as V inevitably does wherever they go), you'd expect them to stick out a bit. Gangs whose territory V trespasses on always forget who they are, though. They Will Remember doesn't just fix that by letting gangs remember V and bear grudges. It adds an entire reputation system. Get on the Tyger Claws' bad side? Probably best to stay out of Japan Town for a while. They Will Remember adds a disguise system, where V can try to hide their face and other identifying attributes to avoid hostilities, and a relationship network where some factions become hostile based on how close they think you are with a rival.Night City AliveCreator: KataneDownload link: NexusModsThey Will Remember is already one of the best Cyberpunk 2077 mods for immersion, but Night City Alive makes it even better. It's a fantastic addition on its own as well. True to its name, this one makes Night City feel more alive by increasing how reactive everyone in it is. Gangs commit crimes in public and, if you have They Will Remember You installed, might track you down to pick a fight. The police are aware of your gang affiliations--though it doesn't add police chases--and members of the public are more reactive to what you do around them, so break the law at your own risk. You'll also see motorcycles in traffic more often, which, depending on your driving skills, may be a boon or a curse.Realistic MapCreator: SvenVHDownload link: NexusModsCyberpunk 2077's default map gets bonus points for how thematically fitting it is, with its high-tech, futuristic appearance. It's an absolute nightmare to navigate, though. Even for the more directionally gifted players, the map gives little indication for changes in elevation, nearby landmarks, or other factors that make identifying locations easy. Realistic Map replaces the standard one with a high-resolution scan of the city, the kind you'd expect from Google Satellite, and it makes understanding the layout of Night City and the surrounding area so much easier.There's a recent conflict between this mod and an update for 50xx series Nvidia cards. You may need to roll back your drivers to an earlier version if the mod doesn't work for you. It also conflicts with the Preem Map mod, so make sure the latter is turned off.Native Settings UI and Side Menu Add-OnCreator: anygoodnameDownload link: NexusModsNative Settings UI is an essential Cyberpunk 2077 mod if you use other mods. It adds sliders, toggles, and other settings-related adjustments to the in-game menu for your other mods under a new \"mods section,\" so you don't have to mess with the mod files to make any alterations. The Side Menu Add-On mod that creator anygoodname made to go with it does one even better. It adds a list of active mods on the menu's left side, which makes organizing and finding what you need much easier, and you can navigate to and adjust them at any time. You need Cyber Engine Tweaks and Archive-XL for the base mod to work, and, of course, you need the base mod for the Side Menu Add-On to function.Cyberpunk 2077 HD ReworkedCreator: Halk Hogan PLDownload link: NexusModsCyberpunk 2077 HD Reworked is the Cyberpunk version of The Witcher 3 Reworked and comes from the same modder. It enhances the game's textures, everything from blurry stonework to poorly defined graffiti and even puddle borders and tree bark. It does this mostly without placing excessive additional load requirements on your computer, too, though if you use the \"Ultra Quality\" version for 4K-capable devices, it may use more VRAM than the base game requires. Creator HalkHogan also published a \"Balanced\" version that uses less VRAM, though is also a slightly lower quality compared to the 4K version. They said anyone who can run the base game on their computer can also run the \"Balanced\" mod without any noticeable changes in performance. HD Reworked applies to the base game and Phantom Liberty.Preem ScopesCreator: CyanideXDownload link: NexusModsScoped weapons are a bit of a pain to deal with in Cyberpunk 2077, but this mod sands off most of the rough edges. Preem Scopes removes the green and gray tints from most scopes, so you can actually see what you're trying to aim at. It takes out scan lines, glitches, and other elements that impede your vision, and it deletes 3D HUD effects, making some of Cyberpunk's best weapons even better.Use Your Cybernetic EyesCreator: CDPR and meDownload link: NexusModsAnother useful Cyberpunk 2077 mod for aiming is Use Your Cybernetic Eyes. It lets V zoom in while aiming with any weapon, even one that just has iron sights. You get two stages of zoom, and the result is a much higher level of accuracy using unscoped weapons. It's a nice fit with Preem Scopes as well, since some handguns and smaller weapons have scopes that also suffer from excessive visual effects. Bear in mind that you need Kiroshi Optics for this ability to work.Virtual AtelierCreator: PacingsDownload link: NexusModsVirtual Atelier is a must-have for anyone who uses clothes mods. This one lets you download virtual store mods, then \"purchase\" from them or window shop at V's computer. Virtual Atelier comes with a preview feature that shows what an outfit looks like on your V before you buy it. Mod creators can create a virtual store showcasing their custom clothes for use with Virtual Atelier as well. Bear in mind that Virtual Atelier on its own does not add modded clothes to your wardrobe, nor does it add new items. It's a framework that makes displaying modded clothes easier for creators and seeing how they look easier for players. You just need to install those mods yourself.Drone CompanionsCreator: ScissorsDownload link: NexusModsDrone Companions is one of the few Cyberpunk 2077 mods that adds a new operating system--features such as V's Cyberdeck--and this one, as the name suggests, lets you build drones. It's called the TechDeck, and once you install the mod, you can find drone blueprint plans at most weapon vendors, along with a new crafting component called Drone Modules that non-organic enemies may drop. The TechDeck lets you create several drone types, including androids, smaller flying drones, and large mechs, and it comes with a set of hacks that buffs each drone. The different drone categories have separate sub-categories as well, such as the revolver-wielding \"Techie\" android or an android that specializes in sniper rifles and long-distance combat.Arasaka CyberarmsCreator: AanderzDownload link: NexusModsAt a glance, this mod seems like just a reskin for V's Cyberarms weapon, but there's more to it than that. Arasaka Cyberarms does, indeed, give V some fancy new, Arasaka-inspired Cyberarms that look much more distinct in combat. However, it also comes with a new set of looks for V's arms out of combat, including fingernail customization and even a toggle to remove nails completely. Despite having \"Arasaka\" in the name, there's also a set of Zetatech Cyberarms inspired by those in Phantom Liberty.Breach Protocol AutohackerCreator: JshDownload link: GitLabAutohacker is a perfect mod to install for a second playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077 or a first run if you're struggling with the hacking mini-game. It adds a list of configurations for hacking that ensures you get the right combination every time and walk away with the best rewards, making the best way to earn money in Cyberpunk even more effective. It's simple and effective, and it shaves quite a lot of time off your usual activities. Just make sure to download it from the GitLab link above. The NexusMods version is no longer up-to-date and won't work with Cyberpunk 2077 2.2.Appearance Menu ModCreator: MaximilliumMDownload link: NexusModsAppearance Menu Mod is easily one of the best Cyberpunk 2077 photo mods. The project started as a way to change NPC outfits and save their appearances in 2021, and now, you can spawn vehicles and characters for photo opportunities, pose all NPCs, change outfits and appearances, decorate your apartment, and customize vehicles. You can even alter companion attitudes if, for example, you wanted to create a scene where one of your normally-friendly followers looks like they're about to throw down with V. That's all in addition to a robust set of photo mode tools.Photo Mode UnlockerCreator: SilverEzredesDownload link: NexusModsHowever, if you want even more control over photo mode, Photo Mode Unlocker is an essential companion for Appearance Menu Mod. It removes all in-game restrictions on Cyberpunk 2077's photo mode and lets you do essentially whatever you want with it, and it adds several new, unique poses, all of which are up-to-date with the game's latest version.Proxima's Apartment EmporiumCreator: Proxima DustDownload link: NexusModsProxima's Apartment Emporium is a bundle of apartment mods that change how V's home looks. It comes with two dozen presets, all from mod maker Proxima Dust, and you can have multiple skins active at the same time. These range from designs inspired by Cyberpunk 2077's life paths to one created with the Edgerunners anime in mind. The Corpo apartment, for example, adds a suite of high-tech furniture, a much fancier TV than V normally has, and some swanky houseplants and wallpaper, all befitting a ruthless climber of the corporate ladder. The mod maker keeps these updated with every patch CD Projekt RED releases, so the bundle works with the most recent Cyberpunk update.Baby Driver 2.0Creator: yo soyDownload link: NexusModsMaybe you're good at driving in Cyberpunk 2077, but for the rest of us, there's Baby Driver 2.0. Even with all of CD Projekt Red's improvements to the driving system since Cyberpunk's launch, there's still a serious drift issue where it's far too easy to veer into a wall or oncoming traffic. Baby Driver 2.0 tweaks the way cars and bikes handle so they feel appropriately weighty and turn accordingly. Both vehicle types will still drift, but the mod gives you more control over how it works and when to initiate it.Live in Night CityCreator: FonWasHDownload link: NexusModsLive in Night City creates a completely different way to get through V's adventure by adding survival simulation elements. With this mod, you'll have to manage V's fatigue, thirst, and hunger, all of which have potentially negative effects on their stats if you let them deteriorate. Let V go hungry for too long, and their health drops to dangerously low levels. It's a helpful push toward engaging with other things such as food vendors as well, which you can often ignore without much penalty. Since you have to engage with them now, it's worth downloading something like Immersive Food Vendors that adds new little animations when interacting with a food stall vendor.Virtual Car DealerCreator: DJ_KovrikDownload link: NexusModsKeeping track of your vehicles in Cyberpunk 2077 can be slightly difficult, especially if you've downloaded vehicle mods in addition to owning some vanilla cars and motorcycles. If you want an easy way to log all of the vehicles you've modded into the game, download the Virtual Car Dealer mod. Using this mod, you can access any PC in Night City and view a shop that contains all of the available cars you have available in your garage. From here, all you have to do is find the vehicle you want to drive, and then use the shop to spawn it onto the map.Metro SystemCreator: keanuWheezeDownload link: NexusModsOne of the more notable forms of transportation in the base story of Cyberpunk 2077 is the flying train cars. You use these in several cutscenes throughout the story, but the train cars aren't available for recreational use. That is, until you download the Metro System mod, which adds 19 total metro stations and a fully functioning NCART system into Night City. Using these stations, you can board a train car that's situated on a rail and take it to any one of the other stations across the map. While you won't be manually flying across the map, you'll still take train cars high above Night City's various districts. However, if you want to do the flying yourself, you're in luck with a separate mod.Let There Be FlightCreator: Jack HumbertDownload link: NexusModsAt one point or another, most players in Cyberpunk 2077 have wished their vehicles could fly. We see flying cars all throughout Night City, but that form of transportation is not an option for any base vehicle in the game, including ones you can find randomly on the street. Fortunately, the Let There Be Flight mod takes care of that dilemma, giving every vehicle in Night City the ability to fly. They'll each be outfitted with thrusters and new sounds/animations that allow them to take flight.Better Loot MarkersCreator: rodikhDownload link: NexusModsDuring the heat of combat or after a firefight, it can be difficult to pick and choose what loot you want to take from a dead body. You have to scroll through a slew of items you don't want to see if there's anything you should take. To streamline the looting system, you can download the Better Loot Markers mod, which adds floating icons above every loot source in the game. These icons tell you the type and rarity of loot available, making it quick and easy to tell if a dead body is worth looting.V's Edgerunners MansionCreator: keanuWheezeDownload link: NexusModsIf you're a fan of the Netflix anime show Edgerunners, which is based on Cyberpunk 2077, or you're looking for a major upgrade to V's apartment in Night City, the V's Edgerunners Mansion mod will be of significant interest to you. This mod brings V's exact apartment from the Edgerunners show into Cyberpunk 2077, providing you with more space and amenities than what you have by default with V's apartment. The two-story mansion has an outdoor space with a pool and a massive balcony overlooking Night City, and a fully functioning bed, wardrobe, and armory. It's everything you've wanted in a Night City apartment, and best of all, there are no loading screens to enter or exit from the main world.Immersive First PersonCreator: BonanikiDownload link: NexusModsA couple of oddities are universal among first-person games. One of them is that, hands and forearms aside, you can't see anything below your shoulders. There's probably a good reason or two for that from a developer perspective, but it can still be a bit awkward. Immersive First-Person from Bonaniki fixes that, letting you see your upper torso all the way down to your premium Night City footwear, which is excellent for immersion generally and for actually being able to appreciate your fit without having to stop and activate a mirror. The other peculiarity is that looking around in first-person usually involves turning your entire body, making something normal like looking slightly to your left a bit more dramatic and unwieldy than it probably needs to be. If greater neck flexibility is on your Cyberpunk wishlist, this mod includes a \"free look\" feature that lets you scan the area around you without moving your body--handy if you just need a quick glance without moving where your gun is pointing.Preem ScannerCreator: CyanideXDownload link: NexusModsImagine a Night City where you can just scan things without having to put up with a green filter and potentially miss details thanks to the weird effects it often has on interior lighting. Well, thanks to CyanideX's brilliant little mod Preem Scanner, you don't have to imagine. Preem Scanner removes the filter and lets you use V's scanner as if they're just looking at the world normally--well, as normal as it can be for someone with more silicon than biological matter in their insides. You get all the same info from scanning and have the same access to your hacks. It just looks a lot nicer.Better Vehicle First PersonCreator: BonanikiDownload link: NexusModsIf you're one of those gifted souls who can drive around Night City in first-person without causing (unintentional) chaos and destruction, you'll probably get a lot of use out of Bonaniki's Better Vehicle First Person mod. This one adds several new perspectives in addition to the default first-person driving viewpoint, so you can tailor it more closely to your needs. And it includes settings to toggle as well, most notably a field-of-view slider to make seeing out the windshield and windows easier and a means of adjusting steering wheel sensitivity. It's a straightforward mod, but it makes a huge difference on the road.    \n  \n                      "

The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii \"problem.\"Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.\"One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,\" Lee told The Game Business. \"Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.\"Lee was very complementary toward Nintendo in his follow-up remarks, but he added that the Wii's model of selling only a few games to certain members of its install base was \"not sustainable.\"\"It's very important that we set ourselves up to serve our customer continuously with new innovations,\" added Lee. \"That is how the whole system can sustain. But it started with Wii. We are standing on a giant’s shoulder.\"Nex Playground reportedly accounted for 14% of all console sales on Black Friday, finishing ahead of the Xbox family of systems.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Doster\n   on December 8, 2025 at 11:12AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Black Ops 7 has integrated with Call of Duty: Warzone for Season 1, adding the full BO7 weapon pool and attachments into the battle royale. While you can still use weapons from the last few years, the most powerful options are going to be the new Black Ops 7 guns. In this guide, we'll provide some recommended weapon builds for Warzone in Season 1 of Black Ops 7.Season 1 removes the Wildcard perks from Black Ops 6, and instead, you'll have Overkill by default. This means you can equip a second primary weapon without the need to select any specific perks to your loadouts. This also means there's no Gunfighter Wildcard, so you are limited to five attachments for each weapon build.The Gunsmith is mostly the same this year; however, one new addition is Black Ops 7's weapon build code feature. Weapon build codes are unique to each weapon and a specific set of attachments, making it easy to share and receive custom weapon builds.Simply hit L3 to view your options while you are in the Gunsmith. This will let you import a weapon build code to use. Additionally, any weapon builds you create in the Gunsmith will have a code generated at the bottom-left corner of your screen.We'll list the attachments for each build and include the unique weapon code so you can easily use it.Season 1 of Black Ops 7 overhauls Warzone's perk selection. Make sure to check out our guide for all Warzone perks for BO7, including some recommended perks to try for your loadouts.All our recommended Warzone loadouts can be viewed below, and we also have suggested multiplayer loadouts.MXR-17The MXR-17 is a powerful and easy-to-use assault rifle for long-range fights in Warzone. The recommended attachments will boost the gun's damage range, bullet velocity, and increase ammo count.The Greaves AccuSpot 3X is a great optic for most long-range builds, but if you're playing small map Resurgence and don't want the bigger scope, you can swap this out for something simple and clean like the Lethal Tools ELO.Recommended MXR-17 attachments:Optic: Greaves AccuSpot 3XMuzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: 17\" Greaves Scourge BarrelMagazine: Rhodes Drum MagStock: Winch StockBuild code: A03-26ERW-58T9U-11MK.78The MK.78 light machine gun is a heavy-hitting, long-range option for Warzone. The recommended attachments will help you reduce the gun's recoil, making this much more manageable to use at range.The recommended magazine is a Prestige attachment, so you might not have this unlocked yet, but it's a very impactful attachment for improving mobility and reducing recoil. You can substitute the Gravepack Extended Belt if needed to simply boost the ammo count until you unlock it.Recommended MK.78 attachments:Optic: Greaves AccuSpot 3XMuzzle: RL-7.62 CompensatorBarrel: 25\" EAM Heavy BarrelUnderbarrel: Bowen Sentry ForegripMagazine: MFS Heatshield Belt FedBuild code: L01-T49HC-5HZW-1X9 MaverickThe X9 Maverick is a three-round burst assault rifle with high damage, and it can be a powerful choice for long-range fights. The recommended attachments will greatly boost the gun's damage range and bullet velocity, as well as improve the aim-down-sight speed.Recommended X9 Maverick attachments:Optic: Greaves AccuSpot 3XMuzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: 16\" OS-Density BarrelRear Grip: Pillory GripFire Mods: 4.73 Caseless OverpressuredBuild code: A04-2JEC3-WMFDM-VJ11DS20 MirageThe DS20 Mirage assault rifle is another solid pick for assault rifles in Black Ops 7, but this gun also has a great build for a sniper support class. The recommended attachments will boost the ammo count, reduce recoil, and improve movement speed to make this gun work great for close to medium-range fights.Recommended DS20 Mirage attachments:Optic: Lethal Tools ELOMuzzle: Redwell 5.56 CompensatorMagazine: Andean Extended MagStock: Assault Division StockFire Mods: Recoil Sync UnitBuild code: A05-AUXZ3-94Q55-1MPC-25The MPC-25 submachine gun doesn't feel very powerful in multiplayer, but it's a powerful gun with a fast time-to-kill in battle royale. The recommended attachments will help reduce a lot of the weapon's recoil, and it will also boost the ammo count.This recommended build includes an optic for cleaner sights, but if you don't mind the iron sights, it's worth swapping the optic for the 14.5\" VAS Ashe Barrel for an increase to the damage range.Recommended MPC-25 attachments:Optic: Lethal Tools ELOMuzzle: K&S Brake-28Underbarrel: VAS Drift Lock ForegripMagazine: Sustain-25 Extended MagFire Mods: Recoil Sync UnitBuild code: S06-AV4J3-MWE75-1Kogot-7Season 1's new Kogot-7 submachine gun is another solid choice for close-range combat in battle royale. The Kogot-7 does have a bit of recoil, but the recommended attachments will work to reduce quite a bit of the gun's kick.Recommended Kogot-7 attachments:Muzzle: Hawker Series 45Barrel: 13.5\" Canis-05 BarrelUnderbarrel: Vas Drift Lock ForegripMagazine: Vex Expanse MagFire Mods: Buffer SpringsBuild code: S10-56XPL-8B31VS ReconThe VS Recon is a deadly bolt-action sniper rifle, and this is a popular choice for sniping in Season 1. The recommended attachments will increase the damage range and bullet velocity, and also reduce some of the weapon's kick.The recommended underbarrel attachment is a Prestige attachment, so you might not have unlocked this yet, and you can substitute it for the Stetig-C Handguard if needed.Recommended VS Recon attachments:Muzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: 23\" G-Force BarrelUnderbarrel: MFS R-Stop HandguardRear Grip: R-1 Shelf GripFire Mods: 7.62 NATO OverpressuredBuild code: R01-21WSG-L369K-P711    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Analogue 3D is earning high praise as one of the best 4K N64 emulators ever made, and it'll soon be available in a wide range of \"funtastic\" colors. As part of a highly limited-edition release, Analogue will offer its console with transparent shells designed to emulate the look of classic N64 consoles from the 2000s. Priced at $300 each, these will launch alongside matching 8BitDo controllers on December 10 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET and will be delivered before Christmas.Analogue says it spent over a year getting the colors just right for this release, and it collaborated with 8BitDo to replicate the look of the Funtastic originals. There'll be eight colorways to choose from: Jungle, Ice, Watermelon, Fire, Grape, Clea, Smoke, and a Gold model inspired by the legendary Toys R Us N4 console that collectors highly covet. The 8BitDo controllers will also be released in the same color set.Analogue 3D consoleGallery                                                                                                                                      If you'd prefer a regular version of the Analogue 3D in black or white, it is being restocked on December 10 as well. The price of the base model increased slightly this year to $269, and anyone purchasing one this month can expect it to start shipping in January.While the Analogue 3D has received positive reviews since the first wave shipped, it will face stiff competition from the ModRetro M64 console. Priced at $200, the M64 also uses an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) to replicate the N64's performance authentically, but it remains to be seen how accurate it is in comparison to the Analogue 3D.ModRetro hasn't opened up preorders for the M64 yet, but you can explore it--and its trident-shaped controller--from multiple angles through this gallery.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Following a major tease from series creator Eric Kripke, Sony Pictures Virtual Reality and developer Arvore have announced a new The Boys video game. The Boys: Trigger Warning is coming in 2026 for Meta Quest and PlayStation VR 2.Preorders are open now for the promotional price of $24 USD from the Meta Quest storefront. It's not available yet to preorder for PSVR 2 yet, but you can wishlist it on the PlayStation Store.          Trigger Warning is a stealth-action VR game that puts players into the role of a new, original character who \"uncovers a grotesque Vought secret that turns a family outing into carnage.\"Players become a superhero, or Supe in The Boys parlance, and join The Boys as they infiltrate Vought and try to get revenge \"in the most chaotic way possible.\"\"Blending stealth and combat with the franchise's signature dark humor, the VR title delivers a new story rooted in the world fans love,\" reads a line from the show's description.The developers at Arvore worked with the show's writers and cast and aims to capture the \"edge, humor, and brutality\" of the main TV show.Before this, Kripke said there was a \"desire, but no hard plans for, a console game\" for The Boys on Xbox and PlayStation. However, he alluded to the existence of \"other kinds of video games,\" and that's likely a reference to Trigger Warning.Characters from The Boys have appeared in games like Call of Duty and Mortal Kombat, but there hasn't been a dedicated game on console for the series as of yet.Based on the comics, The Boys is a TV series for Prime Video that spawned a spin-off series, Gen V, and a spin-off called The Boys: Mexico is also in the works. There is also the upcoming prequel series, Vought Rising, which takes place in the 1950s.          As for the main TV series, The Boys returns for its fifth and final season in April 2026 on Prime Video.

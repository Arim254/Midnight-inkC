    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Obsidian has announced that the planned fall update for Avowed is not going to make it on time. The features planned for the update are still coming, but they are now going to be wrapped into a \"larger update\" instead in February 2026 to celebrate the game's first anniversary.\"This update will include everything originally planned for fall, plus additional features that will make it our biggest update yet. Stay tuned as we head into the new year for more details on what’s planned for the Living Lands,\" the developer said.Avowed previously got spring and summer updates that added things like a no-spiders mode and custom map markers. The February 2026 update will include New Game Plus and Photo modes, along with a new weapon type, new character presets, more Godlike feature presets, and the ability to change your character's appearance, among other things.Avowed launched in February 2025 for PC and Xbox Series X|S, and GameSpot's Avowed review scored it a 6/10. \"Avowed's impactful and satisfying combat is undone by a widely unbalanced upgrade system and an uninteresting story that wastes its potential,\" reviewer Alessandro Barbosa said.Like all of Microsoft's other games, Avowed is available with Xbox Game Pass. The game's director, Carrie Patel, said she was interested in making more Avowed, but no sequel has been announced as of yet and Patel has since left Obsidian.Avowed was originally pitched as a multiplayer-centric game that married Destiny with Skyrim. That was before Patel came on board as the game's director and helped lead the project through a major development pivot.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The artist who originally brought the claims against Bungie has now announced that the issue \"has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.\"No further details were divulged regarding the nature of the matter and how this closure came to be. People are theorizing that the artist received a settlement payment, but that is not confirmed.The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.  — N² (@4nt1r34l) December 2, 2025\n  After the art theft claims came to light earlier this year, Bungie responded to say it \"immediately investigated\" the concerns, and \"confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game.\"Bungie also said at the time that it was \"committed\" to doing right by the artist, and that seems to have now happened.In June, Bungie delayed Marathon indefinitely from its previously announced September 23 release date. The game still has no release date.For Marathon, Sony boss Hermen Hulst said the aim is to create a \"very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title.\"\"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game,\" he said.The executive has said Sony now has systems in place to ensure that Marathon won't suffer the same fate as Sony's ill-fated Concord.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

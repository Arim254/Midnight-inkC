The 1,555-piece Imperial Star Destroyer is on sale for $120 (was $160) while supplies last. This Star Destroyer launched last August as part of the Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary collection. It comes with seven minifigures, including a 25th Anniversary minifigure of Cal Kestis from Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series.The Imperial Star Destroyer is based on the ship from the opening chase scene of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. Once fully constructed, the Star Destroyer measures 18 x 11.5 x 6 inches.It's rather fitting that Amazon added the Star Destroye to its Black Friday sale, because Star Wars fans can also get the Lego version of the ship Darth Vader and his crew were chasing: Princess Leia's Tantive IV. The 654-piece Tantive IV display model is 50% off at Amazon and Walmart. You could pair both of these ships with Lego's Boarding the Tantive IV diorama, which is on sale for $38.49 (was $55) and depicts what happens after the Star Destroyer catches the Tantive IV. It's also worth noting Lego's 630-piece midi-scale model of Darth Vader's Executor Super Star Destroyer from Return of the Jedi is on sale for $40 (was $70) at Walmart.Lego Star Wars: Best Black Friday DealsImperial Star Destroyer (1,555 pieces) -- $120 ($160)Executor Super Star Destroyer Model (630 pieces) -- $40 ($70)Battle Droid with STAP (1,088 pieces) -- $90 ($140)Tantive IV Starship Model (654 pieces) -- $40 ($80)  Also at WalmartBoarding the Tantive IV Diorama (502 pieces) -- $38.49 ($55)  Also at WalmartThe Imperial Star Destroyer has only ever received discounts during major sales events like Prime Day and now Black Friday.

The NXTPaper's main draw is its switchable display modes. With the press of the button, you can transform the display from regular Android tablet to color e-ink to black-and-white e-ink. This allows you to use the NXTPaper as a regular Android tablet as well as a drawing tablet and ereader. Amazon's Black Friday sale includes NXTPaper 14.3-inch, 11-inch, and 11.5-inch bundles. The TCL NXTPaper 14 is on sale for a $170 discount, dropping the price to $300 (was $470). The NXTPaper 11 is discounted to as low as $150 (was $250), and the NXTPaper 11 Plus is marked down to $240 (was $370). All three deals include flip cases and styluses.TCL NXTPaper has three display modes.                                                                                                      TCL NXTPaper 14.3-Inch Android Tablet Bundle                                                                $300 (was $470)                                                                                                                                                                                    The 14.3-inch TCL NXTPaper has a 2.4K resolution 60Hz display (2400 x 1600p) with a paper-like texture. It weighs only 1.67 pounds and is 0.27 inches thick. Designed to be used in any lighting environment and to reduce eye strain, the screen has anti-glare coating, DC dimming, and blue light reduction with (optional) automatic brightness adjustments.As mentioned, the NXTPaper button on the side of the tablet lets you seamlessly switch between the three modes: Regular, Color, and Ink. The regular mode is for watching movies, playing games, and other activities you'd use a conventional Android tablet for. Color mimics electronic ink tablets like the Kindle Colorsoft and is geared to artists as well as readers of visually oriented digital media like comic books and graphic novels. Ink mode is the traditional e-ink display option for reading (think Kindle Paperwhite).The 14.3-inch NXTPaper has a MediaTek Helio G99 processor and Android 14 OS. It's equipped with 256GB of flash storage and 8GB RAM, with an additional 8GB of expandable memory. The 10,000mAh battery fully charges in two hours; battery life varies depending on which mode you're using, but it compares favorably to most regular Android tablets due to the large battery size.The NXTPaper has two front cameras (13MP and 5MP) and an 8MP camera on the back with 2K video support. For sound, it's equipped with four stereo speakers and supports private listening with Bluetooth or wired headphones.The bundle comes with a flip case that doubles as an adjustable stand and TCL's proprietary T-Pen stylus with 4,096 pressure levels and a magnet that attaches to the case.                                                                                                                            TCL NXTPaper 11-Inch Android Tablet Bundle (Gen 2)                                                                64GB: $150 (was $250) | 128GB: $180 (was $290)                                                                                                                                                                                    The TCL NXTPaper 11 Gen 2 has a slightly better display than the 14.3-inch model with its upgrade from 3.0 to 4.0 display tech. The electronic ink modes are a bit crisper with improved clarity, and it has better blue light reduction features. The 11-inch screen has a 1920 x 1200p resolution.The Gen 2 model also has AI features such as smart voice memo, writing/speech assistants, and the ability to Google questions by circling an object on screen with the stylus.Two different configurations are on sale. The 64GB model is only $150 (was $250), while the 128GB model is down to $180 (was $290).  Another benefit of the Gen 2 model is that it has a microSD card slot that supports up to 1TB microSDXC cards.Both models have a MediaTek Helio G80 processor and run on Android 15. The Gen 2 64GB model has 6GB RAM with 6GB expandable memory, and the 128GB offers 8GB in both categories. The battery is a bit smaller at 8,000mAh and it only has two cameras: 5MP front and 8MP back. It also has two stereo speakers instead of four.Both configurations weigh 1.14 pounds and are 0.28 inches thick. The bundle deals include the same style of flip case as the 14.3-inch model as well as the same T-Pen stylus.                                                                                                                            TCL NXTPaper Plus 11.5-Inch Android Tablet Bundle (256GB)                                                                $240 (was $370)                                                                                                                                                                                    Before you purchase the NXTPaper 11 Gen 2, you should check out the higher-performing Plus model. Equipped with an 11.5-inch screen, this slightly larger tablet bumps the resolution to 2200 x 1400p and offers double the refresh rate (120Hz vs. 60Hz).Other enhancements include a faster MediaTek Helio G100 processor, 8MP cameras on the front and back, and improved audio with quad speakers featuring DTS and Smart PA (Smart Power Amplifier). The 11 Plus also expands storage capacity to 256GB.Like the other NXTPaper deals, this bundle includes a case with a built-in stand and TCL's T-Pen. If this deal sells out, Amazon has a bundle without the case for $230 (was $350).

IGN and VGC reported that Square Enix informed affected staff today that cuts are being made as part of a \"fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization,\" referring to the company's Western business.Cuts are beng made in Europe and America to help Square Enix become more \"lean\" and \"agile,\" president Takashi Kiryu told staff. The extent of the cuts was not confirmed, but VGC reported that at almost 140 people at the London office alone were \"at risk\" of being laid off. The cuts are affecting various departments, including IT, marketing, publishing, sales, QA, and business planning, the report said.In 2024, Square Enix also made cuts to its Western teams. Square Enix also sold assets as part of its reorganization effort, selling developers like Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal to Embracer. Square Enix's latest earnings briefing included a slide detailing how the company would conduct a \"fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization\" with the aim of \"further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency.\"Square Enix is projecting an annual cost savings of more than 3 billion yen ($19.6 million) as part of the restructuring. Another effort Square Enix is undertaking is further adoption of AI, with the company recently announcing it wants to use genAI to automate 70% of game QA by 2027.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nBy \n    Eddie Makuch\n   on November 6, 2025 at 10:55AM PST\n              \n          \n                Epic Games has acknowledged a mistake with its new Simpsons update in Fortnite pertaining to the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.After the new season began, people quickly noticed that an image of Apu shows the character with the same yellow skin tone as his fellow The Be Sharps quartet members Homer, Barney, and Principal Skinner.This was a mistake and Epic will fix it. \"This wasn't intentional. It's being adjusted in our next release,\" Epic said.The picture can be found in Moe's Tavern, and the venue also hosts a picture of Homer, Moe, Otto, and Apu, and in that photo, Apu has the screen-accurate skin tone from the TV show. Given that, many assumed this was an oversight on Epic's part, and that does indeed seem to be true.Apu has been sidelined in some ways on The Simpsons TV series, as the character has not spoken a word on the show for years after actor Hank Azaria announced that he would stop voicing him. This came after the documentary The Problem with Apu brought up a discussion about negative racial stereotypes.The Fortnite x Simpsons season has been a big hit, propelling Fortnite to the biggest player numbers since 2024.The new Fortnite season, which runs through November 29, brings a new Springfield map to Fortnite featuring locations like Moe's Tavern, the Kwik-E-Mart, and the Springfield nuclear plant. There is also a new Simpsons battle pass, which includes skins for characters like Homer and Marge, along with variants like Stupid Sexy Flanders. Epic is also offering up a free Kang and Kodos glider for people who link their Epic and MyDisney accounts.Looking ahead, Fortnite dataminers believe they've found evidence pointing to future collaborations with SpongeBob SquarePants and Harry Potter.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on December 18, 2025 at 1:48PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The most wonderful time of the year, in both the real world and in Fortnite, has arrived. Winterfest is here, and that means lots of free stuff. As has become tradition in Fortnite, Epic Games has brought back the Winterfest Cabin, which is full of free cosmetics waiting to be opened.There are 14 free gifts available in the cabin, and you can open one each day. In past years, these gifts would stack--if you missed a day, you'd be able to open two the following day. But it doesn't work that way this year. This time, you really can only open one present each day, no matter what. So be sure to keep up with them, or else you might miss out on some of the gifts.As you can see from the graphic, this year's collection of gifts includes two free skins, two back blings, two pickaxes, two musical instruments, a glider, a weapon wrap, a Fortnite-original jam track based on Carol of the Bells, a contrail, and a few sprays and emoticons for good measure.The skins are in the two large presents in the back on the left side of the room, but you won't be able to open them at the start. You can unlock the Glacial Dummy skin after opening seven other presents, which means he'll be available on Christmas day, And you can get Cheeks, the hamster man, only after you've picked every other present, which means he'll unlock on New Year's Eve.Beyond those two skins, you can unlock the presents in any order you want. And despite the fact there's a Hogwarts student chilling in the cabin while the Harry Potter movie theme plays, none of the free gifts have anything to do with the Harry Potter franchise.For a better look at some of the free rewards, as pulled by fortnite.gg, you can pull from this year's Winterfest Cabin, scroll on.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Nintendo has been known to vigorously defend its interests and intellectual properties in court, and one of its longest-running legal battles may be nearing its conclusion. In 2010, the Japanese video game publisher filed a suit in Germany against BigBen Interactive--the previous incarnation of Nacon--over its third-party Wii Remote controllers. Now, the latest ruling has unequivocally gone in Nintendo's favor.As reported by Games Fray, the Mannheim Regional Court has reaffirmed the ruling that Nintendo is owed damages of over €4 million plus interest. Because Nacon fought the ruling, that interest has increased the total fee to just under €7 million.Nintendo's contention was that Nacon's Wii Remote infringed on its patents for the sensor technology and camera needed to track player movements, as well as an acceleration sensor, and \"the ergonomic features characteristic of Nintendo's Wii Remote.\" The initial verdict came down in 2011, but Nacon has consistently appealed the judgment and come up empty each time.This may seem like the end of the story, but Games Fray is reporting that Nacon has filed yet another appeal. So it's not quite over yet.Nintendo has had considerable success in court when going after users who pirate or infringe on its properties. In October, streamer Jesse \"EveryGameGuru\" Keighin was ordered by the court to pay Nintendo $17,500 in damages for livestreaming pirated games and sharing links to the Yuzu and Ryujinx emulators. Keighin had previously mocked Nintendo's efforts to go after him.However, the money Keighin has to pay Nintendo pales in comparison to the $4.5 million that James \"Archbox\" Williams may be on the hook for. Nintendo accused Williams of running a Switch pirates page on Reddit, operating multiple Switch piracy sites, selling hardware hacks, and offering modified Switch consoles with pirated games.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

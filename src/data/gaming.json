The Gibson SG 20th Anniversary Edition retails for $135 and is slated to launch December 19. Notably, this is the first wireless guitar controller in CRKD's catalog licensed by PlayStation. The Gibson SG syncs wirelessly to PS5, PS4, PS3, and PC via a 2.4GHz dongle. The multiplatform version of CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controller is limited to a wired connection on PS5 and PS4, so the Gibson SG is likely the better option for Fortnite Festival and Rock Band 4 players on PlayStation.PS5 players now have two officially licensed wireless guitar controllers to choose from. The other is the PDP Riffmaster, which is still on sale for its $110 (was $150) Black Friday price.                                 CRKD Gibson SG Wireless Guitar Controller (PS5, PS4, PC)                                                                $135 | Releases December 19                                                                                                                                                                                    The real Gibson SG has been around since 1961; the 20th Anniversary Edition moniker is a reference to the original controller bundled with Guitar Hero for PS5 in 2005. The original Gibson SG had a red body and black pick guard, whereas the new model has a black body, white pick guard, and brown neck. Still, it's rather fitting that the first officially licensed Gibson controller for PS5 pays homage to the most recognizable guitar in Guitar Hero history.The 20th Anniversary Edition has Matte EZ Glide Mechanical Frets with RGB backlighting, a Hall Effect strum bar with the classic \"clicking\" feedback, a whammy bar, and a tilt sensor to activate Star Power. Like the Les Paul editions, the SG has a modular design with a removable neck. The controller's D-pad is located on the back of the headstock. The eight-button Navigation Hub has PlayStation input labels and a Hall Effect stick in the center. The dial with the PlayStation logo switches between wireless and wired connections, while the white dial lets you activate KEYJAM and Legacy modes. Legacy mode lets you use the controller wirelessly on PS3 to play old Rock Band and Guitar Hero games.According to CRKD's compatibility list, KEYJAM mode on the SG is different from the Les Paul. It's likely due to the PlayStation license, but KEYJAM seems to only work for PlayStation consoles and PC. The Les Paul multiplatform guitars can play Fortnite Festival in wired mode on PlayStation and Xbox consoles in KEYJAM mode. It's also worth noting the Les Paul multiplatform editions support Switch 1/2 with wireless and wired connections and have Legacy mode for PS3. Both models support Bluetooth connections for mobile devices and are compatible with CRKD's free customization app.Here's what you'll find inside the box:Black SG Guitar Controller BodyBrown OG Signature Pro Fret NeckBlack Shoulder Strap2.4GHz Wireless Dongle8.2-foot USB-C CableRemovable Rechargeable BatteryKEYJAM Nav Hub StickerQuickstart Guide                      All CRKD Gibson Guitar ControllersCRKD Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers                                                                                                                                               The Gibson SG's $135 price point matches the Les Paul Blueberry Burst Pro that's officially licensed by Microsoft for Xbox consoles. The Black Tribal Encore Edition is $125 for Xbox and has membrane fret buttons instead of mechanical switches. The multiplatform versions of the Les Paul are $10 cheaper than the Xbox models. It's worth noting that the Blueberry Burst Pro Editions have strum bars with haptic feedback. Last month, CRKD released a Les Paul Cherry Sunburst Pro Collector's Bundle for $200. This multiplatform model comes with a guitar backpack, a leather strap, pins, and stickers.The Gibson SG has confirmed wireless and wired compatibility with Fortnite Festival and Rock Band 4 on PS5 and PS4. It also works wirelessly on PC with Fortnite Festival, Clone Hero, YARG, and Guitar Hero III. Legacy Mode for PS3 supports all of the platform's Guitar Hero and Rock Band games as well as Band Hero.We've listed all of CRKD's Gibson Guitar Controllers below along with platform compatibility for each edition.Gibson SG for PlayStation:Gibson SG 20th Anniversary Edition -- $135 | December 19Wireless: PS5, PS4, PC, Android, Apple, PS3KEYJAM Wired Mode: Fortnite Festival (PS5, PS4, PC), YARG (PC), Clone Hero (PC)Gibson Les Paul Multiplatform:Blueberry Burst Pro Edition -- $125Black Tribal Encore Edition -- $115Cherry Sunburst Collector's Bundle -- $200Wireless: PC, Switch 1/2, Android, Apple, PS3KEYJAM Wired Mode: Fortnite Festival on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PCGibson Les Paul for Xbox:Blueberry Burst Pro Edition -- $135Black Tribal Encore Edition -- $125Wireless: Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple, AndroidAs mentioned, the PDP Riffmaster for PS5 and PS4 is discounted to $110 (was $150) at Amazon.

The new thriller from director Yorgos Lanthimos and producer Emma Stone--who also stars in the film alongside Jesse Plemons--wasn't a box office hit, but it's certainly an unforgettable movie. If you missed it when it came out, you can preorder it now ahead of its December 23 release, with options for a limited-edition 4K Blu-ray, standard 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVD.

Like other Blu-ray releases, you'll get the film on a 4K Blu-ray disc, a standard Blu-ray disc, and a digital streaming code to watch it online. For bonus features, the Blu-ray includes a documentary on the making of Bugonia, interviews with the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, and more.Bugonia bonus materialsThe Birth and the Bees: The making of BugoniaInterviews with Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, and the rest of the cast and crewBehind-the-scenes footage featuring the sets, music, and cinematography                                                                                                                            Bugonia Standard Edition                                                                $33 | Releases December 23                                                                                                                                                                                    The Bugonia standard edition features different cover art and a standard movie case, but includes the same special features as the steelbook edition.

The film follows two conspiracy-obsessed cousins (Plemons and Aidan Dobis) who are convinced that the CEO of a powerful company (Stone) is actually an alien in disguise, hellbent on wiping out humanity. After kidnapping and trapping her in their basement, the trio engages in a battle of wits, interrogation, and torture, with the film becoming increasingly unpredictable as it races towards its conclusion. While it wasn't a box-office hit, Bugonia did earn relatively high praise from critics and audiences alike thanks to the standout performances of the cast and its wild plot twists.For more Blu-ray deals, you can check out various specials right now. The Hobbit Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray has gotten a big discount, and the box set for the A Better Tomorrow Trilogy has also gotten a substantial price cut.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:                                Official Nintendo Switch 2 Wheel Set For Mario Kart Gets First Discount At Amazon                         Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon                         Super Mario Galaxy Storybook Hardcover Edition Restocked With 15% Discount At Amazon                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (3)                 PSVR 2 Horizon Call Of The Mountain Bundle Is Still On Sale For All-Time Best Price                         New Lord Of The Rings & The Hobbit Illustrated Box Set Is Back In Stock With $72 Discount                         Walmart-Exclusive DualSense Icon Blue Controller Is Back In Stock For $64    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

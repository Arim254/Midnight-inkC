Since then, FIFA has been absent from the video game scene, but today Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive have announced that they will be bringing officially branded FIFA soccer back in a new game slated to launch in 2026.The unnamed FIFA soccer game will be available via the Netflix app on both iOS and Android devices, and it is planned to launch \"this summer,\" just in time for the FIFA World Cup 2026. The official announcement calls the new game a \"newly reimagined FIFA football simulation game,\" but no other details were provided.FIFA and Netflix Games\"This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA’s commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games,\" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in the offical announcement. \"Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football.\"The FIFA partnership marks the latest splash from Netflix Games, which also added WWE 2K and Grand Theft Auto to its service in recent months. Its parent company has not been quiet either, with Netflix recently reaching an agreement to purchase Warner Bros. for $82 billion.Delphi Interactive is a California-based development studio headed by Casper Alexander Daugaard and ex-Zynga executive Andy Kleinman. The studio is also working in partnership with IO Interactive on 007: First Light.More information on this new FIFA soccer game will \"come in 2026.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The battle for Warner Bros. may be down to Netflix and Paramount, but the studio has a clear favorite. Earlier this month, Netflix bid $82.7 billion dollars for Warner Bros., jilting Paramount in the process. Paramount responded with a hostile takeover bid of $108.4 billion. Now, Warner Bros. is urging its shareholders to reject Paramount's \"illusory\" offer.\"Following a careful evaluation of Paramount's recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer's value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,\" reads a letter to shareholders from Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., the chair of Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors.Although Paramount's offer is higher, Warner Bros.' contends that Paramount's owners, the Ellison family, didn't offer a \"full backstop\" commitment to provide the money to cover its offer and that it can walk away from the transaction without paying any penalty. By comparison, Netflix and Warner Bros. have a $5 billion breakup fee if their deal fails to close or meet regulatory approval. Warner Bros. also contends that the proposed Paramount deal will not be approved by regulators. Regardless, Netflix isn't guaranteed to be approved either.Warner Bros.' guidance isn't binding, and its shareholders could still reject the Netflix deal in favor of the higher bid from Paramount. But there may be reason to question Paramount's ability to close the deal. Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners apparently dropped its support for Paramount's bid earlier this week. Kushner--who is the son-in-law of President Donald Trump--is also one of the backers of the deal to purchase EA by Saudi Arabia's PIF, which may leave that country with almost full control of the company.Whichever studio winds up with Warner Bros., they may also pick up the studio's game developers as well as control of the DC, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat gaming franchises.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley has shared his thoughts on using generative AI to aid in game development, saying the technology cannot \"grow and think for itself.\"The technology \"just consumes, and tries to mimic what it's consumed,\" he told Polygon. \"That's the best it can do right now.\" He also described generative AI as \"a snake eating its own tail.\"One of the reasons why AI has been such a contentious issue in gaming is that not everyone defines it the same way. For his part, Straley said \"NPCs are AI\" and have been for decades already in gaming. Straley's new game, Coven of the Chickenfoot, has players taking on the role of Gertie, an elderly witch who works alongside a \"creature companion\" who can \"observe, learn, and evelopment new behaviors based on contextual situations.\"          This setup has led some to wonder if the creature was made using generative AI or other types of artificial intelligence technologies. But Straley said the creature was human-crafted.\"If you feed it too many bad apples, it gets indigestion and poops in the woods. These are the things you can discover, but it's because we can create a world and craft those moments,\" he said.The goal was not to create a \"human\" companion with \"human intelligence,\" Straley said. He pointed out that the human brain is a \"miracle\" and trying to replicate that in a machine isn't something Straley is interested in pursuing.\"I don't know who wants it, I don't know who's asking for it, I don't know who's pushing for it, but I don't think it's the way as a human species we need to be evolving,\" he said.For Coven of the Chickenfoot, Straley said there was no machine-learning or large language models used in the game's development. \"No, we did none of that. This is hard work, and a lot of problem solving, and a lot of creative thinking,\" he said.Finally, Straley said he believes generative AI systems can \"maybe\" create compelling content in some contexts where the systems are limited to a specific game world. But Straley said he is \"not interested in the slightest\" to pursue this. \"I have zero interest in looking at art that is generated by a computer. I don't think prompting is art. I don't like AI!\" he said.Straley left Naughty Dog in 2017 after 18 years and started a new studio, Wildflower Interactive, in 2022.In other AI-related news, the CEO of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian recently responded to backlash to his comments about how the studio may use AI in early-production work for Divinity.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

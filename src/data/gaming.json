    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Steven T. Wright\n   and \n    Phil Owen\n   on December 22, 2025 at 12:39PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                What makes a bad Fortnite skin? There's no objective measure, certainly. After eight years and more than 2,000 skins, Fortnite's library of character skins has something for just about everybody. Since there's so much variety and so many different styles of skins, it would be silly to make this list of the worst Fortnite skin be focused on skins we simply think are ugly. Instead, we'll focus on other criteria--like if a skin is boring, a cheap cash grab, or broken in some way. Let's take a look.Apprentice ReyWhen it was revealed that Fortnite would hold a Star Wars mini-season in May 2025, fans were excited to see the new skins that would be coming to the battle pass and the item shop. And while most of the skins were great picks, it was a little baffling that the final new skin of the season was Apprentice Rey. Apprentice Rey had two style options: grey version of the existing Rey skin, and Sith Rey--who appeared for about half a second in everyone's least favorite Star Wars move. It was a weird move when there are still plenty of well liked Star Wars characters that have never had a Fortnite skin at all. -POCrackshotAt first glance, Fortnite's Nutcracker skin is pretty decent. But if you look closer, you'll realize that this is just a Chapter 1 default character with a Nutcracker helmet, whose clothes were painted Nutcracker colors. Since this skin was released in Fortnite's very first season, we might be willing to cut them a little slack on this one--but not until they drop a new, more legit Nutcracker skin. -PODoom 2099Fortnite celebrated the launch of Marvel Rivals by selling this pretty hideous Doctor Doom skin. This thing is much uglier than the previous Doom skins, and also it's bulky in ways that make it irritating to play with. Shoulder pads that stick that far out on a skin this enormous? Forget about it. -POFrankenstein's BrideYears before Quentin Tarantino ever considered making a Fortnite movie, Epic collaborated with Universal Monsters to make what was supposed to be a series of short films about the adventures of a new, Fortnite-original Bride of Frankenstein. The first short film was pretty good, but the design of the character was pretty bland and didn't feel much like any version of the character anybody had any affection for. And then they never released any more shorts, and this skin was largely forgotten. -POLexaWhile more recent versions of Lexa have been popular, the original cel shaded Lexa is a horror show that's been giving Fortnite kids nightmares for most of the past decade. Her weird red eyes are particularly haunting. -POMidas RexIn a vacuum, this is a perfectly OK new Midas skin. But when you're dropping $30 on a pack of DC Comics skins, it's pretty annoying to see this guy in there instead of a character from DC Comics. This isn't even a mashup skin--Midas Rex is just an unrelated guy taking up space in a very expensive pack. And to make things even worse, this is the only Midas who doesn't have the Midas Touch effect that makes every gun you pick up gold. So it's not even a good Midas. -PONolan ChanceThis guy, who was the main character on the heist-themed Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass, looks like somebody decided to reboot Ocean's 11 with Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins taking over the lead role from George Clooney. There is nobody on Earth who wants that, except maybe Ninja himself, so this skin is best sent to the archive. -POCarmine RossoThere have been some great skins to come from Lego passes, like Andy Fangerson and Chewbacca. And then there have been some that were not so great, like this lady who's wearing a red-painted version of the Chapter 2 default outfit.MincemeatThis isn't a ranked list, but if it were, this would be number one with a bullet. Mincemeat is not only one of the worst skins in Fortnite, but one of the strangest character designs in a video game in the past few years. While I have to give Epic credit for creativity when it comes to this concept--a terrifying pie man straight out of a horror movie--perhaps there's a reason that no other game thought to feature a skin like this. I appreciate Epic sticking with the Halloween theme, but this confection is ugly and unappealing, and only good for scaring your younger relatives.Fabio SparklemanePerhaps the most controversial selection on this list, Fabio Sparklemane has divided Fortnite players for years now. I know that the rainbow-haired stallion has his defenders out there, but for me, he looks like a DeviantArt rip-off of a certain beloved child's television show starring colorful horses--a license that Epic could definitely swing if they were so inclined. Perhaps Fabio's generic, NPC-esque appearance is part of the appeal for some players, but for me, he sticks out like a sore thumb, and not in a good way. -SWSinister StrikerFortnite's zombie skins were a major success, and players couldn't get enough of its soccer skins, too. However, the decision to combine the two for yet another Halloween skin led to some underwhelming results. While the skin isn't quite as uncreative as some on this list--the monstrous ball is a nice touch--it's such a specific combination of ideas that it doesn't have much appeal, except perhaps around Halloween time. No wonder this skin is often listed as one of the game's least-popular. -SWFlytrapThe first Legendary item on this list, Flytrap is simply one of those skins that makes you ask \"why?\" The character's Poison Ivy-inspired design isn't the worst starting point, but it quickly goes downhill from there, especially in the color coordination department. When I look at Flytrap, I think of a rotting grapefruit, or perhaps your friend's homemade cosplay for a supervillain that you've never heard of. Though Flytrap isn't the worst skin on this list, Fortnite has come a long way since 2018, and you're better off spending those 2,000 V-Bucks elsewhere. -SWClover Team LeaderThis skin is another example of a Fortnite design that occupies a liminal halfway point between referencing another media property and making Epic's own version of it. In this example, the ratty bear-suit looks like something that a Five Nights at Freddy's fan might draw up in class, but it ends up as the example that might come up when you Google the word \"fursuit.\" It's inevitable that some skins in a game like Fortnite are going to fall into this category, and Clover Team Leader is merely a recent example. That said, it's quite ugly, so it makes the list. -SWRenegadeOne of the very first skins ever sold in Fortnite's Item Shop, Renegade is a great example of how far the game's skins have come since its 2017 origins. In this case, Epic wants you to pay 800 V-Bucks for essentially the default Banshee skin with a shirt that's red instead of orange. Reskins and palette swaps are a well-trod tradition in video games, but unless you're a hardcore Banshee fan, there's really no reason to spend actual money on this. Renegade isn't a particularly terrible skin, but it's here as a stand-in for all of the weak tea reskins that Epic has put in the shop over the years, and it deserves a spot for that reason alone. -SWAerobic Assassin & Mullet MarauderThis '80s-themed \"Spandex Squad\" duo have to be one of the all-time strangest ideas for a Fortnite skin ever. When you consider that the average Fortnite player was born at least 15 to 20 years after this fad and aesthetic had already died off, it's easy to see why it's one of the least-popular skins in the game. The actual execution of the jazz cup-esque color scheme is pretty competent, and the hair effects are well-done, too. This is just one skin that's in the game for the dads out there, and there's nothing wrong with that. But you can understand why most players want nothing to do with it. -SW    \n  \n                      "

The game's offline modes like Play Now and Showcase will remain available after the servers go dark.All virtual currency, along with DLC and add-ons, will be removed from sale on January 31, 2026, along with the game itself, as mentioned.WWE 2K24 was released in March 2024, so the servers will have been online for about two years.

The newest WWE 2K game, WWE 2K25, was released in March 2025.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Microsoft has said it's committed to bringing Call of Duty to Nintendo Switch, and it could be coming as soon as next year. Reporter Jez Corden said \"the first CoD Switch version is nearly done.\"He added that the game, whatever it is, will launch \"in a few months.\"In another post, Corden said the release may not be \"close\" but it's \"on the way\" for a 2026 release. He added that the game is \"hitting milestones,\" which is a reference to how a game is proceeding through development.It remains to be seen if the reported Call of Duty game for Switch is a port of an existing Call of Duty game, like Black Ops 7 or Warzone, or a new title.In 2022, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said there was \"definitely\" work to be done to get Call of Duty running on Switch. Since then, Nintendo has released the more powerful Switch 2.In 2023, amid the FTC vs. Microsoft court case, Microsoft said it had signed a \"binding 10-year legal agreement to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players.\" The statement said Microsoft would launch Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms \"the same day as Xbox, with full features and content parity.\"Then in June 2025, a spokesperson for Activision said, \"We're committed to getting the [Call of Duty] franchise on Switch,\" adding that both Microsoft and Activision were working on making it happen. The companies never set any expectations for a release window, however.If a Call of Duty game is indeed coming to Switch, one possible venue for its announcement could be the January 2026 Xbox Developer Direct. Activision has skipped Nintendo platforms for Call of Duty for more than a decade, as the last Call of Duty release on a Nintendo platform was a port of Call of Duty: Ghosts for Wii U in 2013. Call of Duty has a long, strange history on Nintendo platforms.Since Microsoft acquired Activision and the Call of Duty series, the company has continued to release new Call of Duty games on PlayStation day-and-date with the Xbox and PC versions. GameSpot has contacted Activision in an attempt to get more details on Call of Duty's future on Switch.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

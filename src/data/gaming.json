    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Diego Nicolás Argüello\n   on November 5, 2025 at 2:02PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Discord servers rejoice: Peak has just gotten a new major update called The Roots. The multiplayer climbing game from Aggro Crab and Landfall is introducing another biome into the existing roster, and its theme is quite terrifying.Available today, The Roots might seem similar to Tropics at first glance, but it's got a totally different vibe. Think of it more like a forest than a jungle, packed with its own enemies, traps, and weather hazards. In addition, you can also expect an assortment of fresh items to play with and totally not ruin your current run with friends.From new edible mushrooms with mysterious properties to scary bugs and occult items, there's a lot to unpack. Before you schedule a time and date with the group chat, make sure to check out what's new in Peak with The Roots update below, including the full patch notes at the bottom.If you're looking for some guidance returning to the game, we have guides covering how to get the 24 Karat badge, where to find the secret entrance, how to do the Scout Cannon glitch, where to find the Scoutmaster, and a list with all items available and what they do. In addition, we've also listed the 10 best Peak mods available.New biome enters the rotationThe Roots joins the official Peak lineup of biomes. As of launch, The Roots is replacing Tropics and will be present in every run until November 17. After this date, future maps will rotate randomly between the two. As a summary, Roots is a redwood forest filled with mushrooms--some of which have mysterious properties--as well as some rather obscure creature sightings. If you're not a fan of spiders, make sure to activate the Bug-Phobia mode in the options menu. You've been warned.New enemies to contend withThe Roots introduces a new assortment of enemies that will shake up your expeditions. This includes spiders that can hang from branches and grab you before letting go and potentially ruining a climb, as well as giant beetles. Oh, and there are zombies as well. The update might not have been launched right on time for Halloween, but it definitely carries the spirit.There's a bunch of new itemsExpeditions live and die by the items you find, and there'll be plenty of new strategies to consider with the new update. In terms of Roots-specific items, you'll find the Cloud Fungus, Bounce Fungus, and Fortified Milk. There are also Shroomberries, which have a random effect that cycles out every day alongside the map. The developers mentioned that there are more items, but they are leaving it up to players to discover them.There are also new items that you can find in every biome, including the Rescue Claw, Checkpoint Flag, and Book of Bones, the latest being a new mystical item. Curioser and curioser.Cooking has been overhauledThe cooking mechanic in Peak has undergone some significant changes. Now, a lot more non-food items will have an effect when cooked. Cooked usable but non-food items, such as bandages, for example, will no longer grant additional stamina. Lastly, cooked poisonous berries will now be safe to eat. That being said, you still can't cook the poison out of mushrooms. Try not to burn anything during your experiments.New badges and emotesThe Roots is a massive update, and it's one that also focuses on the smaller, yet important elements that make Peak so fun to play and revisit. Mainly, there are eight new emotes available, plus a total of 11 new badges related to the latest biome. We have the full list here, but be wary that it might spoil a few surprises.Full Peak The Roots Update Patch NotesMAJOR FEATURES Added a new biome: the ROOTS.11 new badges to earn, each with associated cosmetics to unlock as rewards!New Roots-specific Items:  Shroomberries: Each color of Shroomberry gives a random effect, which cycles out every day alongside the map.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                You spend a lot of time in Arc Raiders seeking out a variety of items topside to help Speranza thrive down below. One quest called Root of the Matter tasks you with visiting the Research Building to find a seed vault. If you've arrived in the building and want to know where to find the seed vault, we'll cover the bases for you in this guide.Note that you won't need to extract to complete this quest. Because of this--and given how dangerous the Research Building and surrounding areas can be to explore--we'd recommend bringing a free loadout unless you're feeling particularly confident in your survival skills.When you're ready to find the seed vault and wrap up Root of the Matter, follow the steps below.Where to find the seed vault in the room with a great viewYour first objective in Root of the Matter is to head to the Research Building. This building is located to the right of Marano Park and is a very popular and chaotic area to explore. It's often overflowing with other raiders eager to pick fights, as well as a variety of ARC both inside and outside. Be especially aware of approaching from the Marano Park side, as there are often large ARC patrolling within the square.Research BuildingWhen you arrive at the Research Building, search for the \"room with a great view,\" which is on the west side of the building with a massive window overlooking the park. In here, you can find the seed vault, which is a cylindrical container against the wall. Interact with it to secure the seeds.Here's where you'll find the seed vault.Now that the quest is complete, you can continue looting or fighting to your heart's content. You don't need to extract for the quest to count, but if you decide you want to get out alive (as you should), the Northern Station is nearby to the northwest of the Research Building, offering a place for a clean getaway. Just be careful heading down the steps, as the train stations in Buried City often house Pod ARCs that will explode when you get near them. Good luck!For more, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The cooking game Overcooked is getting adapted into a competition reality series for Netflix, according to a new report. The production company A24 has bought the rights to the game and is working with Netflix on an unscripted show, Deadline reported.The show is said to be similar to other Netflix competition series such as Nailed It and Floor Is Lava. \"Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans,\" the report said.The series is said to be in the \"early stages\" of development, with multiple developers from Ghost Town Games signed on to be executive producers.Overcooked launched in 2016 and was a big success thanks to its local co-op gameplay where people play as chefs in a kitchen. Players must cook meals, serve them, and clean up against the clock, and the action can get heated very quickly. It's not hard to imagine the appeal as a reality TV series. A sequel, Overcooked 2, came out in 2018, which was followed by Overcooked: All You Can Eat in 2020.The Overcooked reality series is just the latest video game project coming to Netflix. A BioShock movie is also in the works for Netflix, as is a new Assassin's Creed TV show.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

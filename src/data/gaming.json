However, that has changed with Battlefield 6, as EA has given players an extremely quick and easy to view the most pertinent stats on their account. Below, you can see exactly how to check your stats in Battlefield 6 right from the main menu of the game. How to view player stats in Battlefield 6During the multiplayer beta in Battlefield 6, the only way you could check your stats was by going to a website, typing in your EA account name, and then seeing the stats that were tracked. Fortunately, EA has completely removed this and instead streamlined the process of checking stats. When you load into Battlefield 6, all you have to do to view your stats is follow the steps below: Scroll over to the \"Profile\" tab on the bar at the top of the screen in the main lobby screenFrom here, you can see your stats near the top-left of the screenYour stats include the number of kills you have recorded, your total career score, your kill/death ratio, and how many revives you've pulled offIf you look at the bottom-right of the Profile page, you'll also see your most played game modes and your career best stats, which include your most number of kills in a match and other match-specific records Currently, those are the only stats you can see in Battlefield 6, and there's no additional menu to click on to bring up more detailed statsThe Profile page in Battlefield 6While the stats page is certainly bare right now in Battlefield 6, at least we can see the most important stats on our accounts. Also on the Profile page in Battlefield 6, you can see your Top Badges, which are awarded to you by ranking up weapons, classes, and vehicles. Below your Top Badges, you can see your Playercard. This is viewable by enemies and teammates while in a match, and you unlock more customization options to equip on your Playercard as you play Battlefield 6 and complete challenges. You can edit your Playercard by clicking on the \"Edit\" button at the bottom of the page. The Playercard section of Battlefield 6And that does it for all the stats you can check in Battlefield 6. Perhaps EA will expand the stats section of the game in the future, but that's all that is available at the launch of the game. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Ratchet & Clank's franchise has been dormant since Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart was released in 2021, but that didn't stop some fans from searching for a game that few remembered. Ratchet & Clank: Clone Home was announced was announced in the mid-2000s as the follow-up to the mobile title Ratchet & Clank: Going Mobile. Although Clone Home was canceled and never officially released, the game has finally been found and a copy has been shared online.The Golden Bolt's YouTube channel (via Engadget) has posted a video detailing the years-long search for Ratchet & Clank: Clone Home. As noted in the video below, several members of the gaming community took part in the search, but college students \"Emily\" and \"Super Gamer Omega Clank\" were credited for finding a Sony Ericsson W880i that had a working copy of Clone Home. Breaking the phone's encryption was the most difficult step, but their efforts paid off.          The title of the game refers to a pair of digital clones of Ratchet and Clank who team up with their counterparts in the real world to foil the plans of Vox, the returning nemesis from Going Mobile. The digital Ratchet and Clank exist in a video game within the game, and the real version of that duo are also transported into the game around halfway through the story.It's believed that Clone Alone was briefly online by mistake before being pulled down. The preserved copy is fully playable, but it's unclear why Clone Home wasn't released. The Golden Bolt believes it was over a possible legal dispute between Sony and Handheld Games, the developer of Going Mobile. He also notes that Clone Home was likely developed by JavaGround, rather than Handheld Games.This isn't the only surprise that fans of the Ratchet & Clank franchise had in 2025. Earlier this year, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart senior designer Grant Parker revealed that he placed a hidden minigame in the title. Although Rift Apart was ported to PC in 2023, there's no word on when or if another sequel will follow.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The traditional input throughout the lifespan of Battlefield has been a controller. While Battlefield 6 has full support for mouse and keyboard on PC as well as consoles, a majority of the playerbase will head into battle with a controller in their hands. Due to the popularity of controllers, Battlefield 6 offers a wide range of input settings, including some brand-new options that haven't been seen before in the franchise.It can get a little daunting trying to go through all of the available controller settings, so if you want to set all of them correctly and head straight into the action, we have you covered. Below, you'll see a list of every major controller setting in Battlefield 6 and what you should be using for those settings.Best controller presets in Battlefield 6For starters, you'll want to head into the \"Settings\" menu of Battlefield 6, which is done by pressing the cog icon at the top of your screen. Once you're in Settings, go to the Controller section on the left side of the screen.This brings you to a large image of your current controller layout. Here, you can choose to \"Edit Presets\" or \"Edit Settings.\" Choosing to edit your presets allows you to simply go through all six of the available controller schemes and decide what buttons you want assigned for every action in those schemes. You can also \"Edit Keybinds\" by clicking edit presets, which allows you to change every single keybind within a specific controller scheme individually.While you can customize everything to your liking, the simplest way to go about your controller schemes is by using the following presets:Controls: DefaultButtons: AlternateThe basic controller settings menu in Battlefield 6By going with the \"Alternate\" buttons preset, you're swapping some key actions on your controller. The Alternate preset makes it so your Melee button is now assigned to B/Circle and your Crouch/Prone button is assigned to the right joystick on the \"Soldier\" controller scheme. This has always been the most popular way to play first-person shooters, but you can, of course, switch this back to default if that's what you're used to.However, you really don't want to switch back to default in the \"Vehicles\" and \"Aircraft\" schemes. By swapping these to the \"Alternate\" preset, you change the left joystick to turn/yaw left and right instead of moving backward and forward. This makes it much easier to control aircraft and ground vehicles in Battlefield 6, and should result in you crashing less.The other schemes can also be set to the \"Alternate\" buttons preset, but they're not as important.Once you're done switching your presets, you can now press \"Edit Settings,\" which launches you into an entirely new section of your controller options.Best control settings in Battlefield 6After clicking \"Edit Settings,\" you can click on \"Control Settings\" in each of the different sections. Specifically, you want to click Control Settings within the \"Infantry\" section, as this changes how your character moves, aims, and shoots in Battlefield 6.In the Infantry Control Settings menu, you can change your aiming sensitivity, field of view, aim assist, and general movement settings. Here are the most important settings and what they should be set to:AimInfantry Aim Sensitivity: 45Field of View: 110-115Vertical Aim Ratio: 45Vertical Zoom Ratio: 45Unifrorm Infantry Aiming: OnZoom Sensitivity Coefficient: 178Infantry Aim Assist: 100Infantry Aim Assist Slowdown: 100Infantry Aim Assist Zoom Snap: 100Soldier Aim Input Curve: BF1, BF4Infantry Zoom Aim Input Curve: BF1, BF4Stick Input Acceleration Presets: BF2042 Old, BFVAiming Left / Right Acceleration: 50MovementInfantry Sprint: ToggleDouble Tap Forward Sprint: Sprint or Autosprint (Autosprint gives less control, but is easier on your hands)Sprint: Click Left JoystickCrouch Toggle Sprint: StandVault Over Sprint: OnSlide: Leave emptyCrouch Slide: AllDouble Tap Crouch For Sprint Slide: OnZoomInfantry Weapon Zoom: HoldZoom: Personal preferenceSteady Scope: HoldSteady Scope: Click Left JoystickInfantry Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 901.00x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 901.25x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 901.50x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 901.75x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 902.00x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 902.50x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 903.00x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 853.50x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 854.00x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 854.50x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 855.00x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 1006.00x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 1008.00x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 10010.00x Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 100OtherInteract & Reload: Prioritize ReloadSkip Revive: HoldRequest Revive: HoldInvert Demolition ChargeMount Breakout: InstantInteracts: OffYou can also go through all of the other Control Settings sections (Ground Vehicles, Transport Vehicles, Aircraft, etc.), but they're all mostly set to the best options by default.Best controller tuning settings in Battlefield 6Finally, if you scroll all the way down the Control Schemes menu, which is where you can access all of the individual Control Settings sections, you'll find a section called \"Other.\" In this section, select the \"Controller Tuning\" option.Here, you can set all of your controller deadzones and vibration settings. These settings are always crucial to nail down in an FPS, so look below for the general options you should be using:Controller VibrationVibration: Off (unless you personally enjoy it enabled)Controller Left StickCenter Deadzone: 5 (and work your way up depending on your controller's stick drift)Axial Deadzone: 10Max Input Threshold: 70Controller Right StickCenter Deadzone: 5 (and work your way up depending on your controller's stick drift)Axial Deadzone: 10Max Input Threshold: 100Controller TriggersLT Deadzone: 0LT Max Input Threshold: 100RT Deadzone: 0RT Max Input Threshold: 100Setting the right Controller Tuning settingsThe Gyro and Flick settings in the Controller Tuning menu don't need to be messed with unless you're actively using those features.With that, you now have all of the best controller settings to use in Battlefield 6. These settings could change after the game has launched and the community has time to find the most optimal values, but for now, you can easily head into battle with these settings and not worry about a thing with your controller.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

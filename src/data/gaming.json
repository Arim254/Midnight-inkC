    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    James Carr\n   on October 21, 2025 at 9:00AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has arrived, and the vampire RPG has plenty of biting and killing, but you can also experience a bit of romance. While the system isn't as deep as some other RPGs, there are a few important things to know before making your move.How romance works in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2When speaking with a character, you will occasionally have the option to flirt with them. If they like what you've been saying in other dialogue options, they'll like the flirting and respond positively. Do this enough times, and you will eventually get a new dialogue option, but there are some important things to know. Many of the romance options are also Clanrepresentatives,so performing side quests for them will improve your relationship, give you more opportunities to make dialogue choices, and improve your Clan Affinity all at once.Don't pick the flirt option unless you have had several positive interactions otherwise, as any character that doesn't have some positive affinity for you won't like you flirting. If you aren't sure, be careful picking the flirt option, because it will negatively impact your relationship if it isn't well-received.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 does not have an in-game tracker for relationship status. You will see notifications in the top right corner to indicate how a character has reacted to your conversation in the moment, but there is no way to check the status from a menu. That said, once you have reached a point where a character is interested in you romantically, they will prompt you in a conversation. There will be a fade to black, before returning to where you were previously. There does not appear to be consequences for getting involved with multiple people.All Vampire The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Romance Options:FletcherOndaMrs. ThornNikoPatienceSilkySafiaFletcherFletcher can be found in Makom Bar, at the piano.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Eric Frederiksen\n   on October 21, 2025 at 8:30AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                In Satisfactory, everything has a recipe. Iron Plates require Iron Ingots. Screws require Rods. Reinforced plates require Iron Plates and Screws. But in the same way that a cookie recipe will let you substitute out things like eggs and butter, Satisfactory has all kinds of alternate recipes that let you make items out of simpler recipes and more common resources. They range from being true game changers to being something you should skip. In this article, we'll explain how to find Hard Drives and get the most out of them, and lay out some of our favorite alternate recipes, focusing especially on the early game.How to find and use Alternate RecipesBeing inventive and creative isn't enough to make an alternate recipe--you need cold, hard data, in the form of Hard Drives. You'll find tons of Hard Drives around the Satisfactory map as you explore, build new sites, and connect sites together. Once you unlock Radio Signal Scanning in the Quartz research tree, you can also scan for Hard Drives using the Object Scanner.Once you have a Hard Drive in hand, though, you can head back to your Molecular Analysis Machine and dump the drives there for safe keeping.There are a few important things to note about using Hard Drives. Each drive will randomly select a set of alternate recipes when you research it, but the options reflect your current status in the game. In other words, you're not going to get an alternate recipe for nuclear materials when you haven't even unlocked oil processing. You can re-roll each drive's alternate recipe options once, but we recommend holding off. The MAM can store multiple Hard Drives, and there's absolutely no rush to use that new drive right away. By leaving that undesirable recipe in the MAM, you're ensuring that next time you research a drive, you won't get that same recipe again, as it's kind of reserved. Rerolling it later also means you'll be drawing from a wider variety of options more reflective of the progress you've made.In other words, save those Hard Drives up until you see a recipe that fits your needs.For a full, in-depth list of alternate recipes, the Reddit community has a great alternate recipe tier list worth consulting.Speaking of which, here are some of our favorites from the over 100 alternate recipe options.Cast & Steel ScrewsScrews are one of the most annoying components in Satisfactory's early game. They take two steps to make--Iron Ingots to Iron rods to screws--and they don't output at the rate you'll want to use them at. If you can find the Cast Screw recipe early on, grab it. This lets you convert Iron Ingots directly to Screws. It uses the same resources, but it requires one less machine, which saves both space and power. Better yet, it outputs those screws 20% faster, from 40 to 50 per minute.Later on, the Steel Screw recipe is even better. You'll be making tons of steel beams anyway, and this recipe will allow you to convert five steel beams to 260 screws per minute.Iron WireIron Wire isn't an inherently huge improvement over regular Copper Wire, but situationally it can be very useful. For example, the starting area in the Rocky Desert has three pure Iron nodes in a relatively short distance, but only one normal Copper node. Copper quickly becomes a crucial resource, and you'll have plenty of Iron in a case like this. This recipe allows you to direct some of your Copper needs away from Copper until you have better miners and more Copper nodes.Iron & Copper Alloy IngotsThis is a peanut butter/chocolate situation--these two recipes are good on their own but pair up very well. Both of these recipes use Copper and Iron Ore, but send them directly to a foundry, which you unlock in Tier 3, to be combined into different alloys. These two recipes not only use the same ingredients, they both triple the output compared to standard Iron and Copper Ingots. Win-win.Fused Wire & QuickwireAnother great recipe pairing. Both recipes use Copper and Caterium Ingots, so it's easy to route the incoming Caterium and Copper to two machines instead of one. Fused Wire will triple your Wire output in the same amount of time without making production any more complex--you'll use an assembler instead of a constructor--and for roughly the same power. Fused Quickwire, meanwhile, will increase your quickWire output by 50%. Overall,Stitched & Bolted Iron PlateReinforced Iron Plate is a common part that you'll use throughout the game. If you find one of the screw recipes above, Bolted Iron Plate will allow you to triple your output with only slightly more resource input. Meanwhile, if you have an abundance of Wire, Stitched Iron Plate will use Wire instead of Screws, slightly raising your output and letting you make use of a component you're swimming in.Iron PipeIron Pipes aren't a huge leap in efficiency, going from 20 steel pipes per minute to 25 Iron pipes. But what's important here is the ingredient change. Steel Ingots, just like Iron, end up going into lots of different components once you get going, and Iron pipes give you the option to shift to something you might have an excess of--Iron Ingots.Copper & Steel RotorsThe Copper Rotor is the real star here, offering almost triple the output for fewer resources, but the Steel Rotor works too, giving you a slight output bump.Encased Industrial PipeThese are actually slower to produce than Encased Industrial Beams, but switching out Steel Beams for Steel Pipes means a 20+ percent reduction in steel Ingots needed, making this an overall win.Fine & Rubber ConcreteConcrete is one of the first things you'll find in Satisfactory, and it'll be one of the last things you use whether you play for ten hours or a thousand. Fine Concrete adds a bit of silica to the mix, while Rubber Concrete does the same, but with Rubber. The standard output for Concrete is 15 per minute, but these recipes raise it to 50 and 90 Concrete per minute, respectively--three or six times the output.Heavy Encased & Flexible FramesHeavy Modular Frames are a mid-game item, and this alternate recipe is a great option if you manage to find it, offering a significant drop in resources needed along with a 40% output bump.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Darryn Bonthuys\n   on October 21, 2025 at 8:22AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                As the month starts to lean toward spooky themes and nights of frights, Sony has revealed a new batch of games coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog on October 21 for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers. Keeping with the Halloween theme, the highlights this month are all about getting your heart rate to spike dangerously high, thanks to two great horror titles joining the games library. Bloober Team's remake of Silent Hill 2 made one of the best survival-horror games of all time even better, while the 2024 version of Until Dawn is a grisly and entertaining choose-your-own-demise adventure.One thing to note here is that you might want to be careful about which games you claim from PS Plus. An ongoing bug with the service has yet to be resolved, and it could cost you ownership of one of your digital games. As pointed out by PlayStation Lifestyle, downloading Yakuza: Like a Dragon from the Game Catalog will result in you losing the ownership license for it if you claimed it as part of the August 2022 PS Plus Essential line.Basically, if you claim the monthly games via PS Plus Essential and then download them at a later time through the PS Plus Extra and Premium Game Catalog, you will be locked from playing them if those titles leave the service and you'll have to purchase them again.. In comparison, games claimed via PS Plus Essential are yours to keep as long as you have an active PS Plus subscription. This issue has been around since PS Plus relaunched in 2022, and has yet to be resolved.After being teased during the recent State of Play livestream, Tomb Raider Anniversary and Tekken 3 are also being added to the Game Catalog's lineup of classic PlayStation titles for PS Plus Premium subscribers. Here's a closer look at everything coming to the service soon.All PS Plus subscribers can also claim new games in October, as Alan Wake 2, Goat Simulator 3, and Cocoon will be available until November 3.Silent Hill 2 | PS5A remake of the 2001 survival-horror classic, Bloober Team's take on Silent Hill 2 is more than just the same game reimagined with updated visuals and gameplay. Sure, the improvements on the game's technical presentation and feel are welcome upgrades, but this is also a meticulous and stunning reimagining of Silent Hill 2 that knows exactly when to change things up while keeping the vision of the original game intact. Until Dawn | PS5Another dose of rebuilt horror, the 2024 version of Until Dawn was rebuilt for PS5 so that it could make you feel like you had a front-row seat inside of a slasher movie. Set in an isolated mountain lodge that a group of friends visit so that they can get to the bottom of a gruesome mystery, things quickly take a turn for the worse as they face off against a terrifying force that's stalking them. V Rising | PS5This survival-action-RPG adventure was a big hit when it first launched, as it flipped the script on your usual vampire-themed game. This time, players stepped into the boots of a vampire that had woken up from a centuries-long slumber, and now in a weakened state, they were tasked with rebuilding their castle, turning humans into minions, and reclaiming their lost power in a world full of danger and mystery.Yakuza: Like a Dragon | PS5, PS4A new era for the Yakuza series--now retitled to Like a Dragon--began in 2020. Yakuza: Like a Dragon kicked off this new chapter with the introduction of Ichiban Kasuga, a low-ranking Yakuza who takes the blame for a crime he didn't commit. After 18 years in the joint, Ichiban found himself in the middle of a major conspiracy between warring Yakuza clans and sinister forces in the background. The game not only introduced a new status quo for the franchise, but it also saw a massive change to the gameplay, swapping the beat-'em-up action of previous games for a turn-based RPG experience.Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1 | PS5, PS4Another horror game to add to your collection, Poppy Playtime is set in a toy-manufacturing-factory inhabited by vengeful creatures. A combination of horror and puzzle-solving, you'll have to be on your toes as you explore the facility if you don't want to be caught by the homicidal toys.As Dusk Falls | PS5, PS4A gripping crime drama that follows two families across decades, As Dusk Falls is a narrative adventure anchored by incredible storytelling and pitch-perfect performances. Created by the lead designer of Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls, the game offers multiple paths to explore, choices that have tangible consequences, and a highly replayable campaign.Wizard With a Gun | PS5The title pretty much says it all, but in case you missed it when it first came out, Wizard With a Gun is a colorful adventure set in a magical wilderness. Stranded in this harsh frontier, you'll need to master spells and guns to survive, but at least you can team up with fellow players in the game's co-op mode as you explore, collect resources, and craft enchanted bullets for your guns.Tekken 3 | PS5, PS4PlayStation Plus Premium subscription requiredThe first two Tekken games were landmark titles that pushed the 3D fighting game genre to new heights, but Tekken 3 was the game that put Bandai Namco's franchise on the map. Packed with a roster of unique fighters and a storyline that fleshed out the Mishima Bloodline saga, Tekken 3 is still regarded as one of the best games in the entire franchise. This version has been updated with several quality-of-life features like enhanced visuals, quick-save options, and custom video filters.    \n  \n                      "

The best deal is on Pokemon Labyrinth, which is up for grabs for only $17 (was $30). The Super Mario version of the fast-paced and highly replayable classic has also received a price cut to $24 (was $30).Check out both games below. We also rounded up deals on several other officially licensed board games themed around Pokemon and Super Mario. Pokemon has surprisingly few board games, but you can get Pokemon Monopoly and Pokemon TCG Battle Academy for great prices. Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom pals have starred in numerous classics as well as a bunch of original tabletop experiences that Amazon recently restocked.                                                                                                      Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game                                                                $17 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Pokemon edition of Labyrinth originally released in 2021 and remains one of the the most popular classic board games themed around a video game franchise.Pokemon Labyrinth is for two to four players and challenges you to navigate your way through twisting mazes as you track down various Pokemon, including Snorlax, Eevee, Chimchar, Piplup, Turtwig, Grookey, and many more. Playing pieces are based on the original four starter Pokemon: Pikachu, Charmander, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle. Every round of Labyrinth is different due to the board's shifting design, and games only take around 20-30 minutes.A glow-in-the-dark version of Pokemon Labyrinth released last year, but it's selling for full price ($30).Pokemon fans can also save on the latest version of Pokemon Monopoly. Normally $25, Monopoly Pokemon Edition is only $19 at Amazon. The playing pieces are adorable miniature figures of Pikachu, Quaxly, Fuecoco, and Sprigatito. And if you want to learn how to play the Pokemon Trading Card Game, the Pokemon TCG Battle Academy board game is only $13.69 (was $25) at Amazon.

The Mushroom Kingdom sets up well for a game like Labyrinth, because the 34 maze cards use the familiar brick blocks from the video games.Each player picks one of the wooden pawn playing pieces and sets out to find many different characters from the Mushroom Kingdom, including Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, Bowser, Wario, Toad, and Toadette. Mario and his friends even invited Donkey Kong to play.Like the Pokemon-themed version, Super Mario Labyrinth is recommended for players ages 7 and up.Mario fans can also get the Super Mario Jenga for $16.66 (was $22) thanks to a coupon deal at Amazon.There are plenty of other Super Mario-themed board games, including The The Super Mario Bros. Movie Monopoly, a Super Mario Checkers & Tic-Tac-Toe combo pack, and a wide selection of original titles from Epoch Games such as the newly released Super Mario Mushroom Mania Balancing Game ($13) and Super Mario Cap Tower Balancing Game ($20).Check out this Super Mario board games Amazon store page for more options.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Mega Man Legends 2 is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, October 25, 2025. Below, we look back at how its unresolved cliffhanger ending still overshadows its memory.Mega Man Legends 2 is an unfinished promise. The anime-inspired adventure series was beloved by fans of the blue bomber for its inventive, Zelda-like spin on the classic formula. It was filled with lovable characters who have endured long past the series itself, like Tron Bonne, the Servbots, and the hero, Mega Man Volnutt. But like a serialized cartoon series, the second game in the series ended with a whopper of a cliffhanger--and then never returned to it. The legacy of Legends for the last 25 years has been fans waiting for a resolution that never came.Spoilers for the Mega Man Legends series followFor those unfamiliar with the Mega Man Legends series, it's unusually story-rich for a Mega Man game. Set in the distant future, in a world almost completely covered with water, Mega Man Volnutt and his adoptive family, Barrel and Roll Caskett, dig for treasure in ruins guarded by ancient technology called Reaverbots. All the while, they're alternatively pursued and occasionally aided by sky pirates called the Bonnes: Teisel, Tron, and big baby Bon Bonne. Each of the main characters in the colorful world is fully voiced, aiding in the presentation as a Saturday-morning cartoon come to life.The first game explores Mega Man investigating ruins to avert a prophesized disaster, but inadvertently awakening it in the process. Another being, called Mega Man Juno, reveals to Volnutt that his original name is Mega Man Trigger. Trigger was designed as a \"Purifier Unit\" whose purpose was to eliminate the Carbons--aka the artificial humans who live in this world. Needless to say, he does the right thing and protects humanity instead.The second game treads familiar ground but expands upon it with multiple new characters and a larger scope. This time a unit called Sera tasks Mega Man to find four keys that will unlock the Mother Lode, a rich energy source that would usher in utopia and end the constant scrapping for resources. But Sera's counterpart, Yuna, later informs Mega Man that the keys would not save humanity but rather doom it, by eliminating the Carbons and replacing them with the ancient, non-artificial humans. In the end, the three come to an understanding and stop the Master Program from initializing the wipe, but in the process, the three are left stranded on the moon of Elysium, separated from their home on the planet Terra. To make matters worse, Yuna explains that the shutdown of the Master system will trigger a failsafe by reactivating an even older Elder system, activating machines across the ruins of Terra. Mega Man Legends 2 ends with Roll attempting to build a rocket to save her stranded sibling, but we never see if it's successful.          This is the canonical, chronological end of the Mega Man series. Several of the individual Mega Man series--from the classic 8-bit platformers, through Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero, and Mega Man ZX, and finally Mega Man Legends--form one continuous (though loosely connected and often ret-conned) story. Legends is the last, which means that its unresolved ending is the last thing we see happening in a story that has been changing and evolving since the 1980s. The last in a long line of heroes called Mega Man is stranded, with a clock ticking toward the destruction of all society. It's unsatisfying enough on its own, but even more so as the bookend for an entire franchise that spans dozens of games.Making matters worse is the unfulfilled promise of Mega Man Legends 3. The anticipated sequel was teased by Capcom in 2010, closely coinciding with the departure of series co-creator Keiji Inafune. Capcom's plans for Legends 3 included an ambitious idea to invite fans into the development process, soliciting feedback from the community. The company announced it would release a \"Prototype Version\" on the 3DS eShop, to act as a prologue. This was remarkable for the time, as early access was not yet an industry standard.But as the months went on and no Prototype Version released, fans began to suspect that the project had been canceled. Capcom confirmed this in July 2011, announcing that there would be no Mega Man Legends 3 or even Prototype Version released at all, despite later reports that the demo was nearly completed. And in a PR misstep that would live in infamy for Mega Man fans, Capcom's UK Twitter account appeared to blame the cancellation on a lack of fan involvement. A later tweet clarified that it meant to refer to a lack of interaction in the online \"Development Rooms\" Capcom had made, not fan support more broadly. Inafune, for his part, expressed interest in making the game, as an outside contractor with his own studio, as late as 2014.Meanwhile, Mega Man Legends exists now mostly in memory. Capcom has gladly capitalized in its history of Mega Man games with compilations of almost every series. The Legacy Collections have now compiled the classic, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX, and Mega Man Battle Network series, with a Mega Man Star Force collection coming in 2026. Once that releases, every Mega Man series will be readily accessible on modern platforms--except Mega Man Legends. Those games, first released on PlayStation, have remained stuck in that generation, aside from a PSP port.And so Mega Man Legends has become a symbol of unfulfilled potential. The series charted a new path forward for the classic character, reinventing him as an anime-styled adventurer with deep lore and a wide cast of lovable, memorable characters. But for all of its promise, it's also the Mega Man series that has received the least games: two in the main series and the quirky minigame spin-off The Misadventures of Tron Bonne. It's become a sore spot for Mega Man fans, even as the series has received new entries like the well-received Mega Man 11. For fans of Mega Man Legends, we're all up there with Volnutt, Yuna, and Sera: waiting for a rescue, and a resolution, that will never come.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

If you purchase the premium version, it will not expire, allowing you to earn rewards beyond the event.The second event is Marvel Zombies, which is a four-player PvE mode where you have to fight through zombie hordes to take down the queen of the undead. This mode is where you will complete most of the event challenges to earn Lanterns for the Voyage to Astonish event.In the store, and available for 27 days from October 24, are two legendary Halloween skins. You can get the Jeff the Land Shark Jeff O'Lantern skin and the Namor Phantom Tide skin.

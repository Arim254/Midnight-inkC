Doster\n   on November 18, 2025 at 11:13AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is live now, and the game is packed with 30 weapons and tons of attachments to use. There are plenty of weapon builds that can be created in the Gunsmith, but this guide will recommend some of the best options to use in Black Ops 7 multiplayer.Black Ops 7's new Gunsmith addition is the weapon build code feature. Weapon build codes are unique to each weapon and a specific set of attachments, making it easy to share and receive custom weapon builds. We'll list the attachments for each build, but also include the unique weapon code for you to easily enter and use.Simply hit L3 to pull up your options while you are in the Gunsmith. This will let you import a weapon build code to use. Additionally, any weapon builds you create in the Gunsmith will have a code generated at the bottom-left corner of your screen.If you're on console, we have a recommended settings guide to help you get the most out of Black Ops 7's multiplayer and other modes. Our Black Ops 7 perk and Wildcard guide can be found here.M15 Mod 0The M15 Mod 0 is an easy-to-handle assault rifle perfect for when you're just getting started. It's also very powerful to use. The recommended attachments will make this even easier to handle by reducing the gun's recoil, improving the damage range, and more.Recommended M15 Mod attachments:Optic: LTI MiniMuzzle: VAS 5.56 SuppressorBarrel: 16.5\" FusionUnderbarrel: Ironhold AngleRear Grip: Hexcut GripBuild code: A01-5XP7V-4KFH1-1MXR-17The MXR-17 is another strong assault rifle contender in Black Ops 7. The recommended attachments will boost the gun's damage range, increase ammo count, speed up the aim-down-sight speed, and help reduce recoil.Recommended MXR-17 attachments:Muzzle: Greaves TI-762Barrel: Redwell 90 CompensatorUnderbarrel: Lateral PrecisionMagazine: Vault Extended MagRear Grip: Aril Assail GripBuild code: A03-6U1FL-TJ11AK-27There's no shortage of long-range powerhouses in Black Ops 7, and the AK-27 assault rifle is another solid pick for medium- to long-range combat. The recommended attachments will increase the gun's damage range, boost ammo count, and help you reduce the weapon's recoil.Recommended AK-27 attachments:Muzzle: SWF-Tishna 11Barrel: 18.2\" Vostok Extended BarrelUnderbarrel: Lateral PrecisionRear Grip: Garin AdvanceFire Mod: Buffer SpringsBuild code: A02-6U4K6-SQ51M8A1If you want a burst-fire weapon with high precision, the M8A1 marksman rifle is a great pick for multiplayer. This is a powerful and very accurate gun for medium- to long-range combat. The recommended attachments will improve accuracy, boost your ammo count, and reduce recoil.Recommended M8A1 attachments:Optic: Lethal Tools ELOMuzzle: Vas 5.56 SuppressorUnderbarrel: Force Stabilizer HandstopMagazine: Sentinel Extended MagRear Grip: G7 Launch GripBuild code: M01-5XMZH-ZNHY1-1Dravec 45The Dravec 45 submachine gun is one of the best close-range weapons in Black Ops 7. The Dravec 45 is fairly easy to use, and the recommended attachments will help improve the bullet velocity, boost your ammo count, and reduce recoil.Recommended Dravec 45 attachments:Muzzle: Bowen .45 SuppressorBarrel: 19\" EAM HorizonMagazine: Gator Extended MagRear Grip: Herald ZI GripFire Mod: Accelerated Recoil SystemBuild code: S04-CYGM8-G51Ryden 45KWhile it's not quite as fast-firing as the Dravec 45, the Ryden 45K is another powerful submachine gun for close-range fights. The recommended attachments will increase the damage range, boost your ammo count, and reduce recoil. If you're still struggling with recoil on this gun, you can always swap the recommended rear grip attachment for the Skeletonized Grip for further recoil control.Recommended Ryden 45K attachments:Muzzle: Bowen .45 SuppressorBarrel: 12\" Vienna BarrelMagazine: Torch 40 Round MagRear Grip: Eruption GripFire Mod: Recoil Sync UnitBuild code: S01-A2L6U-D51Velox 5.7If you're not planning on running the Overkill wildcard and need a strong secondary, the Velox 5.7 is a three-round burst pistol that packs a punch.

Points are earned by completing weekly challenges and earning XP. You reach a new reward tier for every 10 battle pass points you earn.The pass is available to complete between now and the launch of Season 1's Winter Offensive update on December 9.The full list of rewards can be found below, including a new operator skin, vehicle camo, XP boosters, the new shotgun, and more."

It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025.Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games. This year, I finally really got into games on Steam with Peak and Repo, and I'm still dabbling with Lethal Company.It's the most wonderful time of the year - Steam Replay 2025 is now available!Take a trip down memory lane and see how many games you played, how much you played per month, and many more fun stats for the year.Check out yours (login required): https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4… pic.twitter.com/SrVS9oNdIP  — Steam (@Steam) December 16, 2025              Other gaming platforms have also released their yearly summaries, as PlayStation posted its yearly wrap-up last week. To see your Steam Replay, you can visit Valve's website or click the Steam Replay banner in the Steam app's store page. It'll be interesting to see how the Steam Machine will affect players next year for those who prefer a more traditional console setup.There are a few limits to keep in mind: Steam Replay does not count time played while offline or disconnected from the internet. It also leaves out unreleased games, preloads, prerelease versions, and disabled games.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The success of Baldur's Gate 3 went far beyond anyone's expectations with 20 million copies sold and multiple Game of the Year awards. That was all very good for the future of Larian, but it's also creating some pressure now that the developer focuses on its latest Divinity game.\"It's more pressure,\" Larian founder Swen Vincke told PC Gamer. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing.\"Vincke also indicated that the team at Larian believed that making Divinity would be easier after the studio's experience with Baldur's Gate 3. But that turned out to not be the case.\"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this,'\" added Vincke. \"By now, we've been humbled by the development experience, by the actual development again: No, we don't know anything. We have to relearn everything, but we do have the experience of the past with us. Every game has its own language that you need to learn.\"Vincke recently came under fire for saying that Larian uses some generative AI in game development. He subsequently said that AI is not being used to replace human artists, and that generative AI is used to \"explore things\" and that it allows artists to \"experiment\" and \"make their lives easier.\" He added that there will be no generative-AI-created content in Divinity.According to Vincke, Divinity will probably get an early-access release like Baldur's Gate 3 did. But he didn't fully commit to that and the game doesn't currently have a release date.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Deciphering the Data quest in Arc Raiders sends you to Spaceport to check out some Magnetic Decryptors, and finding exactly where they're located can be a bit of a challenge. However, you've come to the right place, as we'll tell you exactly where you can find both locations you need to interact with to complete this quest from Shani.You won't need to extract to complete Deciphering the Data--but we recommend you run a free kit either way, as you may come across other raiders working on the quest, too, and you wouldn't want to risk losing your gear if a fight breaks out while you're busy exploring.When you're ready to take on Deciphering the Data, follow the steps below.How to complete Deciphering the Data in Arc RaidersThe first step of Deciphering the Data sends you to the Fuel Control building, which is located on the northeastern portion of the Spaceport map. This building is very dark inside, so don't be afraid to turn on your flashlight if needed.Fuel Control building locationIn the main (very dark) room, you'll find a ton of computer terminals. Along the southeast wall is a different kind of machine that you can interact with to use the Magnetic Decryptor. This will provide you with a new objective, tasking you with visiting the Arrival Building.Decypher the data at this machine.The Arrival Building is located on the northwestern side of the map, so you'll have to cross some open space to reach it efficiently. Be careful doing so, as some raiders like to try to snipe folks running out that way.Arrival Building locationWhen you arrive at the Arrival Building, head upstairs to the top level. Here, against the north by northwest wall will be another set of machines. These look a bit different than the one you toyed with back at the Fuel Control building, but they'll get the job done just the same.Decypher the data at these machines.Now that the quest is complete, you can leave via any of the elevators that are still functioning. They're all equally prone to have extraction campers, especially if you did this quest at night, but you should be fine as long as you find a safe spot to wait things out and keep your eyes and ears peeled. Don't forget to turn the quest in when you get back to Speranza.For more on Arc Raiders, check out our comprehensive guides hub.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

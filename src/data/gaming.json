The lineup of January 2026 Lego Star Wars sets features notable starships and transport vehicles like the Venator-Class Attack Cruiser and AT-AT Walker as well as the return of the most popular droid from the recent Star Wars film trilogy. That's right, BB-8 has returned to the Star Wars Lego lineup following a lengthy hiatus. The 569-piece BB-8 Astromech Droid is available now for $90 at Amazon, the Lego Store, and other major retailers.See all new Lego sets at: Lego Store | AmazonLego Star Wars New Releases (January 2026)Here's a list of all eight brand-new Star Wars Lego sets as well as the massive UCS Death Star, which is no longer exclusive to the Lego Store.

The model comes with a display plaque and information card. A small BB-8 figure connects to the end of the stand.Interactive features include an openable front hatch with a burner arm in his chest cavity, just like in The Force Awakens, and a movable head that rotates in random directions when you slide BB-8 across a flat surface.Just be aware that this BB-8 model is much smaller than the one Lego released back in 2017. The new BB-8 (model No. 75452) is just over 3 inches tall, whereas the 1,106-piece build (model No. 75187) was over 10 inches tall.On the positive side, the smaller-sized BB-8 is a more detailed replica of the droid. Plus, there's a practical reason for this BB-8 to be smaller. Lego designed BB-8 to be accurate in terms of scale when compared to other buildable droids released over the past two years, including R2-D2, C-3PO, and Chopper.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim Need For Speed Unbound, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper starting January 6 and they will remain available until Monday, February 2.NFS Unbound promo art.The most recent Need for Speed game, NFS Unbound, has single-player and multiplayer campaigns set in Lakeshore City, which greatly resembles Chicago. Street racing is a key part of the experience, but so is outrunning the cops. As your \"Heat\" index rises after each race, the police will pursue players with greater intensity as they establish their rep outside of the law. Between races, players can customize their rides and compete in weekly qualifiers to get into the ultimate street racing contest: The Grand.Mickey unleashes his paint brush in promo art for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed.Epic Mickey was a Wii exclusive upon its 2010 debut until THQ Nordic's 2024 remaster, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, brought the game to modern consoles. The visuals and gameplay have been noticeably improved as Mickey Mouse is sucked into the Wasteland where forgotten characters and concepts have languished for decades. This game is one of the reasons why Disney made a deal to gain the rights to Walt Disney's previous creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. And for the first time, Mickey has to come face-to-face with his brother, Oswald, and reconcile with him if he wants any chance of escaping the Wasteland.Promo art for Core Keeper.Core Keeper is kind of a blend of cozy and survival games that allows players to explore a vast cavern that has hidden treasures and \"untold secrets.\" Players can dig for the relics and resources they need to craft tools, build bases, and dive even further into the cavern. To defeat the Titans, players will have to upgrade their skills while tending to their animals, growing their own food, fishing, and even cooking in their spare time. If you haven't claimed December's PlayStation Plus free games yet, make sure to do so before Monday, January 5. December's games include Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                My favorite moment in Skin Deep, an immersive sim and stealth game about rescuing cats and fighting your evil clone in deep space, was always the one immediately after a thoroughly developed plan inevitably went sideways. The skittish way that I was forced to sprint and crawl under a table or into a vent. The manner in which my strategy devolved into simply batting things off of shelves in order to incapacitate a roaming guard or noisily distract them from looking in my direction. The way that I leapt onto a guard's back, dug my claws in, and careened them into surfaces in order to knock them out. If you were to close your eyes, I'd argue you could almost hear that distinctive, feline yowl mid-action.In short, I think Skin Deep best captures the experience of being a cat, even if Nina Pasadena, the game's protagonist, is decidedly not one. And for this tremendous feat, I am rewarding it with the honor of being the best cat game of 2025. Long live Skin Deep.In a typical Skin Deep mission, I often tried to keep to the shadows, as is the norm for a game in its genre. I would relegate myself to the ventilation, the pipework surrounding it, and the undersides of tables. Like Batman, I skulked around the perimeter looking for a precise opening that'd enable me to punch a hole in the level's defenses while keeping my cover. Of course, in Skin Deep, it almost never worked out in my favor. Because I am not, in fact, Batman. I'm just a (cat) girl.Eventually, I'd be made in the silliest way possible. I'd linger in the dust-covered vents a little too long and let out the world's loudest sneeze, alerting the guards to my exact location. I'd throw down a bar of soap on one end of the room, be discovered while pickpocketing a guard on the other, and slip on my own trap as I ran back the way I came. Or, as is most often the case, I crouch-walked through a door or vent without first peeking into the room, jumpscared the first guard I saw, and threw the apple core I was holding in my hand at them. When you're crouched like I often was, the camera's perspective is so low to the ground, I almost always felt like a kitten traipsing through the halls and vents of a home I didn't belong in. And just like a flustered orange tabby, my priority became to zoom to safety at the risk of endangering everything and everyone in my warpath the second I was found out.          I could sooner count the number of times a plan has gone right than wrong in Skin Deep, primarily because the former is a far lower number. Most of my successes stem from slapdash plans developed on the fly and from the wreckage of another plan. And yet, despite the failures, it has been more fun to improvise in Blendo Games' deliberately slapstick sandbox and cosplay some kind of fumbling cat lady than come across as some calm and collected black-ops agent. To that end, I found I enjoyed leaning into the bit.I much preferred stalking high and narrow walkways with a charming assortment of irreverent items (a bolt, some ground pepper, a banana, etc.) to looting a weapon. And when I was looting, I, like many cat owners can likely attest to, loved to snatch something I was really not supposed to have--in this case a walkie-talkie or key card--before scurrying back into the shadow and making off as if I got one out from right under those guards' dumb noses.Of course, when I was found by the guards for sticking my nose a little too close to the sun, I did combat like a cat too. Even in the most harried of situations, ones where I was backed into a corner and forced to face off against Skin Deep's roving guards--an intergalactic goon squad straight out of pulpy sci-fi novel called the Numb Bunch--I still felt like a lithe and frenzied cat warrior rather than another human combatant. Melees were won not by hard blows but by swift strikes. A quick flick of the wrist launched one of my collected throwables at a guard. Disoriented, I climbed on their backs and sent them smashing into sinks, toilets, screens, pipes, etc. Anything that carried a high risk of causing CTE, really. Once they were conked out, I hurriedly popped their heads off (since these could fly towards respawn stations and revive a guard) and, like a cat secreting its stolen goods, I hid or threw them down a toilet or garbage chute, permanently incapacitating my foe.Fights in Skin Deep were rarely decided, you see, by sheer willpower and force. It was always about thinking on your feet paws. It was about pulling a fast one on your unsuspecting combatants. It was about being a cat in a world filled with boorish humans and their brute dogs.I found Skin Deep's interpretation of cat-like design immediately refreshing. The industry is no stranger to cat games, many of which are charming in their own ways. However, I typically found that when I engaged with them, they were more preoccupied with the aesthetics of cats than the ways in which their mechanics could convey the feeling of being one.In Stray, I performed and looked like a cat, but never quite felt like one. In Skin Deep, the inverse is true. It is as if, untethered by the expectations of having to make an aesthetically pleasing feline protagonist, Skin Deep was more free to recreate environments a cat would thrive and play in and design systems that rewarded that fantasy. By my estimate, it nailed it. Across its frenetic combat, slapstick stealth, and skittish movement, Skin Deep more wholly realizes the idea of being a cat than any other game I've played. For sticking that landing, it deserves 10/10 toe beans. Or y'know, however many cats have.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

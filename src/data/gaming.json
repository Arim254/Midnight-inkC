The only spooky pumpkins coming your way this year are in Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival, the pumpkin-carving MMO that's back online after its planned hiatusGhost Town Pumpkin Festival was created by Whippoorwill Ltd aka Adam R. & Dawn B., and the game sends players into a literal ghost town where they can take part in the in-game Halloween festival and pumpkin-carving contest. Players can win prize ribbons from other players who dole out awards to their favorite pumpkins. The game also encourages players to wander around the small town and customize their ghost avatar.          Previously, Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival was limited to 200 players at a time. This year, the game has added support for 800 simultaneous players. There are also new areas to find, including the Ghost Town Cinema, which plays classic silent movies. Some of the other activities in town include exploring a haunted and a hayride.Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival can be downloaded at its official site for PC, Mac, and Linux. Players can name their own price, but if they choose to pay $2 or more, they get a version of the game that includes hats for ghosts. According to Adam R., the game has already set a record this year with 24,000 pumpkins created by players since the game's return earlier this month.The team behind the game has also said that Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival will be taken down a week or two after Halloween, presumably before its inevitable return in 2026. If you're looking for something scarier, GameSpot put together a list of the horror games you can play for the Halloween season. Other titles are also having in-game tie-ins for the spooky season.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

His memorable commentary on the game became part of NBA Jam's blockbuster success in arcades. However, Kitzrow has revealed that he was paid a very small amount for his work in the first game.While speaking with The Escapist, Kitzrow disclosed that he was paid $50 an hour for his work on NBA Jam, which was the same amount of money he made recording lines for Bally Midway's pinball machines. It wasn't until after the game was released that Kitzrow realized that he should have charged more.\"I'd go in, do a couple of sessions, maybe 15 hours total, and that was it,\" recalled Kitzrow. \"I wasn't smart enough, savvy enough to know the business, to go, 'Gee, these games make a lot of money, maybe I should make more than $50 an hour.' I didn't have an agent at the time ... When the game came out and I found out it made a billion dollars, that's when I realized I'd made like $800 and change ... I thought, 'Well, I'm probably being underpaid, I might want to raise my rate.'\"Kitzrow returned for the sequel, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, and he became Midway's go-to guy for commentary on NFL Blitz, NBA Showtime, and MLB Slugfest. Kitzrow also recorded lines for EA's NBA Jam reboot and he was the featured announcer in a more recent arcade game, NBA Superstars. Currently, Kitzrow is providing commentary for Mutant Football League 2, which is scheduled to be released in early access on Steam on December 10.In 2021, director Sean Menard signed a deal to helm an NBA Jam documentary, which was optioned from author Reyan Ali's 2019 book NBA Jam. In the four years since, the project has yet to be completed.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

FromSoftware’s multiplayer experiment hasn’t seen any truly breakout mods yet, but the game is still within its first year, so there’s plenty of room for major additions.FromSoftware’s multiplayer take on 2022’s Elden Ring has already proven to be one of the best roguelike games, and players have put in serious work to make it even better. It’s not Elden Ring in the traditional sense--you’re not diving into a massive world. Instead, Nightreign focuses on shorter sessions built around teaming up with friends to overcome bosses.Some of the most popular best Elden Ring mods overhaul the game entirely, add Bloodborne-inspired content, or introduce features like randomizers that greatly boost replayability. Nightreign modders, however, have mostly focused on improving the core experience, especially for solo and duo players. After all, you should still be able to enjoy the game even if you don’t have two friends ready to jump in.We found these mods on Nexus Mods, and while others live on lesser-known sites, you should always be cautious when downloading files from external sources. Here are the best Elden Ring Nightreign mods worth using right now.How to install Elden Ring Nightreign modsSince Elden Ring Nightreign is an online multiplayer game that uses Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), there are some negatives to using some of these mods. The majority of them alter the game's files, meaning you can't play on FromSoftware's servers without getting banned. Not ideal, we're sure you'll agree. However, you can play using a different save system and without interacting with \"vanilla\" players to stick to the game's terms of service. You can always uninstall mods and return to the official servers if you'd like to play as normal again.As long as you're playing with others who are using mods, you'll still be able to matchmake with your friends via the Steam servers. Here's how to install and play Elden Ring Nightreign with mods:Download the Elden Ring Mod LoaderExtract the contents into your Nightreign folder (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN\\Game by default)Copy your downloaded mods into the \"Mods\" folderHowever, sometimes the installation instructions vary, so be sure to check each mod's page for details.There’s also the Mod Engine 3 Manager, which makes installing, switching between, and adjusting the settings of all your mods much easier and more accessible than managing everything manually.Seamless Co-opThe Seamless Co-op mod by Yui adds two-player party size capabilities. Previously, two-player co-op had only been possible if the third person in your party left during the game, leaving the two of you vulnerable without a third person. Sometimes, though, you just want to play with one other friend. Maybe you're communicating on Discord and the third party member has an entirely different approach to the game, or maybe you're just a pair of recluses who don't want a third person involved. Whatever your reasons, Seamless Co-op addresses this and shrinks the party size down to two.Yui states that the mod is in a \"rushed alpha state\" and will be expanded upon in the future. The addition of Everdark bosses saw Yui create a temporary solution to the Everdark boss activity, meaning that the mod needs to be able to communicate with GitHub, so make sure that isn't blocked on your PC before taking on any of the new bosses. The mod prevents you from connecting to the FromSoftware matchmaking servers, and uses different save files to the non-modded game, so you won't risk a ban by installing it.Fun Is AllowedThe Fun Is Allowed mod from MrGaeity was created in collaboration with the Elden Ring community, and focuses on increasing the amount of fun you can have playing Nightreign, without sacrificing the core experience. You'll have increased resists, deal more damage, gain FP from kills, and rally your health back after taking damage. It's meant to be played alongside the Seamless Coop mod above.The creators say that Nightreign currently \"isn't a good experience\" for anyone playing solo or duo, and so Fun Is Allowed addresses that with balancing changes that decrease the difficulty. There is a \"slightly harder\" option available for those still wanting a punishing time without sacrificing enjoyment.The mod has been regularly updated since its release to add new features, including a whole new set of spells for the Recluse. These allow you to create Mana Shields that protect the spellcaster and make her a more viable character. Those shields will break after one hit, but you can perform a Magic Cocktail spell to claim them back. The Magic Mana Shield is reliable and shoots two magic missiles with good damage and accuracy. The Fire Mana Shield is risky and burns in a close circle around you, applying stackable damage over time. The Lightning Mana Shield does high damage using lightning bolts, while the Holy Mana Shield does no damage but knocks enemies into the air and heals the party.With these changes and more, MrGaeity says they wanted to \"do something radical\" and we're entirely in agreement that's been achieved.Better Player ScalingThe Better Player Scaling mod from Keiran1925 increases the HP, FP, STM, and DMG scaling for players, making you more of a formidable opponent versus the Elden Ring Nightreign enemies and bosses.Essentially, it means that those four statistics will receive more of a buff every time you level up at a Site of Grace. In our Elden Ring Nightreign tips guide, we recommend leveling up as often as possible in the early game to ensure you're strong enough to face the first boss at the end of the first night.No Circle DamageAnother mod from Keiran1925, the No Circle Damage mod addresses the painful deaths you've been dealt by venturing outside the closing circle. We've all been there, and while it's one of the game's core mechanics, sometimes it's just frustrating to deal with. The mod removes damage from outside the circle, and means you can take your time exploring the game's map and uncovering better weapons for your approach to each boss. You will still need to race to the boss location at the end of each night to face it in order to progress, and some might argue this mod actually takes too much away from the core gameplay experience in Elden Ring Nightreign. However, it's fun to play around with, and there's certainly no obligation to keep it installed if you find it alters the game too much.Unlock Outfits Early The Unlock Outfits Early mod from Isotope allows access to the dresser and outfits available to purchase before defeating any bosses. Isotope thought it \"sucked\" that the best outfits can only be unlocked after progressing through the game, so this simple mod was created that unlocks the outfits early. It's not quite free though, as you'll still need to buy the outfits in the shop unless you tinker with the mod's settings. There are several versions, from offering Nightlord skins for cheap, through to offering all outfits for just one Murk. To use the mod, you'll have to ensure Seamless Co-op is disabled, but you can use it once to unlock the outfits before switching back to your regular save file. All of the outfits will still be there. Add More Skins for Nightreign - Skin OverhaulDo you miss some of your favorite armor sets and outfits from Elden Ring, or do you think Nightreign does not have enough skins of its own? Look no further than this mod, titled Add More Skins for Nightreign - Skin Overhaul. Created by Zeus, this mod adds fan-favorite armor sets like Lionel, Snow Witch, and Bloodhound to complement the skins that Nightreign already includes. It also brings in some heavy hitters from other franchises, including Kratos and 2B.Ultrawide SupportElden Ring players with ultrawide monitors, rejoice. The Ultrawide Support mod from Cellko removes the black bars that appear when playing with ultrawide resolutions. While our image above might not look impressive--thanks, image size restrictions--playing with this mod creates a much more immersive experience for those with wide monitors. To improve the player experience even more, this mod works alongside Seamless Co-op.Tourist ModeThe Tourist Mode mod by Vawser allows you to experience Elden Ring Nightreign in the ideal way--as a tourist. A special talisman will grant you invulnerability to all damage, meaning you can traverse the beautiful world of Elden Ring and take in its beauty. One of my favorite things to do in 2022's Elden Ring was observe the environment, and I'm glad I can now slowly meander through the hills observing the beauty in Nightreign, too.Free ReignFree Reign, like Tourist Mode, lets you explore the map at your leisure, but that is not its main draw. Created by TKGP, this mod allows you to fight bosses directly from the Roundtable Hold. It is a great way to practice, learn boss patterns, and get ready for your next game night before teaming up with your fellow Tarnished.Easy ModeFromSoftware games are hard, and sometimes having friends around does not make it any easier because you just cannot get into the swing of things. Elden Nightreign is understandably challenging, and Easy Mode is designed for players who want the same experience but with more forgiveness. Created by Syyyke, this mod offers two different easy modes, one even easier than the version originally released. It adjusts drop rates for items, how players interact with hazards, and much more to reduce the challenge without trivializing the overall gameplay experience.Custom Model ReplacersDo you think Elden Ring Nightreign needs a few more ... Transformers? No? Well, me neither, but with the Nightreign Custom Model Replacers mod by KRDCD, you can play as one. In fact, there are multiple model replacements based on popular franchises. So far, you can choose to play as characters from NieR, The Witcher, Black Myth Wukong, God of War, Doom Eternal, Stellar Blade, and more. If you're looking for the Optimus Prime model above, it replaces the Raider's default armor. There is a bug at the moment where your weapon won't show in cutscenes, but it's a small price to pay for high customization.Dark Souls Armor SetsIf you can't get enough FromSoftware in your FromSoftware game, the Dark Souls Armor Sets mod replaces various characters with armor sets and weapons from the Dark Souls series that are not included in Nightreign. Included are classics such as the Elite Knight set, Dragonslayer set, and Black Iron set, among others.Like the above model replacement mod, your weapons won't be visible during the cutscenes, but it's worth the trade-off.FOV Tweak For some reason, FromSoftware insists upon having no field of view (FOV) options in the Nightreign menus. This FOV Tweak mod addresses that, giving players full control over how much of the map you can see at a time. As fair warning though, do not attempt to use this mod online without Seamless Coop installed, or without disabling Easy Anti Cheat, as it will get you banned.Nightreign RandomizerRandomizers are a wonderful creation. They help make games like Pokémon, Fire Emblem, Zelda, and Elden Ring endlessly replayable, and often hilarious, by mixing and matching content from throughout the game and presenting it in a random order. The Nightreign Randomizer, created by thefifthmatt, does exactly that for Elden Ring Nightreign.    \n  \n                      "

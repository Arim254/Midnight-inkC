This map also adds an Easter egg song you can activate on the map. Here we guide you through the steps needed for unlocking the secret song for Ashes of the Damned in Black Ops 7 Zombies.How to unlock the Ashes of the Damned egg songActivating the secret song for Ashes of the Damned works just like the song Easter eggs for Black Ops 6's Zombies mode.In order to play the song, you first need to find three hidden headphones. The headphones are blue and have fuzzy ears like the mode's Mr. Peeks bunny, but some of them are located in sneaky areas that are hard to see. These headphones can be interacted with in any order and at any time during your match. Press Square (PlayStation) or X (Xbox) depending on your platform.Completing this Easter egg will play the new Zombies song called \"Turn to Ashes,\" which is composed by Kevin Sherwood and performed by Elena Siegman.Mr. Peeks headset #1The first of the headphones are found in the spawn area. Look in the same room as the objective marker that sends you toward Ol' Tessie's first upgrade. Move near the back corner of the room, close to the Quick-Revive machine, and look up on the top of the servers.Mr. Peeks headset #2The second pair is found in Ashwood. Following the initial quest markers to zip up and head to the power generator here. You'll want to run past the generator, up the stairs towards the buildings, go behind the broken building, and turn right. There's a small set of stairs leading behind the building. From the top of these stairs, look up to find the headphones on the broken boards above you.Mr. Peeks headset #3Head to Exit 115. This headphone set is located in the passenger seat of a black Jeep just outside of the diner. Get close to the windshield in order to interact with this set.The song will play once you've interacted with all three. You can do these Easter egg steps once per match to play \"Turn to Ashes.\"For more guides, make sure to check out the best settings for Black Ops 7 and the full list of Zombies perks, ammo mods, field upgrades, and augments.    \n  \n                      "

There are 11 missions total, and each mission has one piece of hidden campaign intel to collect. In this guide, we'll show you all 11 pieces of intel and where to collect them in the Black Ops 7 campaign.If you're looking for how long the story will take to complete, we break down all the Black Ops 7 campaign missions and details for you. Our full Black Ops 7 review can be found here.ExposureOnce your mission takes you to Nicaragua, you'll find this piece of intel after the first giant machete tries to hit you. The intel is a machete sitting on the well.InsideWhen you first meet Karma by the docks. This piece of intel is on the ground by the body bag behind her.DistortionThis one is tricky. When your objective becomes \"Rescue Woods\" and you need to open the container, do not open the container right away. Enter the mausoleum on the floating island below the platform with the container. This is hard to see, but go behind the container, look down, grapple to the lower island, and then turn around to see a hidden mausoleum room. The intel is dog tags hanging from a knife.EscalationNear the end of the mission. When you reach the server room you need to hack, don't start hacking right away. Instead, go inside and look for the smaller room with laptops on a desk. The intel is a USB flash drive in the laptop.DisruptionEventually, you're tasked with jumping down through a skylight into a Guild building. Do this, but search the building before entering the restricted area for your mission. There is a small staircase leading to an office. This intel looks like a hard drive sitting on a table.CollapseExit the colosseum and head toward the SAM site you need to secure. Turn left and look around the broken walls and pillars for the intel. It's a head from a statue.FractureThis one is early in the mission. You'll warp through a red portal and the highway becomes distorted. Fight through the enemies and run along the middle of the warped highway until you see a red semi-truck. Drop inside the cargo area of the truck and look near the back to find an American Flag pin as intel.QuarantineAt the start of the mission, you're tasked with breaching a tower and zipping up to a top floor. You'll force open elevator doors, and your mission asks you to \"search the office.\" You'll want to ignore the office and take an immediate right after exiting the elevator. There's a set of stairs here. Go up the stairs and enter the large conference room on the right. The intel is a canister on the large table.SuppressionYou'll need to fight through the prison segment of the mission. Afterwards, you'll reach the cabin that was David Mason's childhood home. Go inside and up the stairs to the room on the right. Turn right again as soon as you walk inside. There is a fishing pole in the corner, and this is your intel.BreakpointAfter leaving the safe house, you are tasked with disabling Cradle shipments. Your objective mark leads you to Avalon's stadium. Don't complete the objectives once you get there. Instead, drop down to the section of the road close to the bridge. There's a shipping line of Guild cargo containers. One near the bridge is open, and you can get an intel item called Trigger Finger.ContainmentThe last piece of mission intel is found during the G-X Strider boss fight, and it's in a sneaky location. Look for the control room window above you, and you'll see a cluster of white shipping containers. You want to mantle up to the top of the containers and turn right. There is another container you can run along the top of, and you're wanting to get on top of it, look down, and find the open container you can get inside of. This final piece of intel is a canister.Collecting this intel will earn you XP, a Calling Card reward, and it also works toward the completion of the Loremaster trophy/achievement for Black Ops 7.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In June, Hypixel and its parent company, Riot Games, announced that the Minecraft-inspired adventure game Hytale was canceled after 10 years of development. At that time, Hypixel was set to be shuttered as well. But now, the founders of Hypixel have rescued the studio with plans to finally bring Hytale into early access.Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced the news on social media that his studio has repurchased the rights for Hytale from Riot Games and plans to release it as soon as possible. However, he cautioned fans to temper their expectations as the game remains unpolished. While Collins-Laflamme acknowledged that \"there's a lot of work to be done,\" he added that there will be, \"No more waiting. You'll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won't be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we'll shape it into something truly special.\"We did it. Hytale is saved. We have acquired Hytale from Riot Games.  — Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) November 17, 2025              In a lengthy post on Hytale's official site, Collins-Laflamme noted that he and his Hypixel co-founder Philippe Touchette are co-funding the resurrected Hytale, with Kevin Carstens as the technical lead and Patrick Derbic as the management lead. They also announced that 30 developers who previously worked on Hytale have been hired to return.Collins-Laflamme also revealed that the team is dropping the current Cross-platform Engine build of Hytale because it \"is significantly behind in terms of gameplay\" and it would take years to reach early access. Instead, the team is reverting back to The Legacy Engine build, which is four-years old and significantly further along.Early access is expected to \"last at least a few years,\" as the team doesn't want to rush it through development. Exploration Mode, Creative Mode, and modding will be available at the launch of early access. However, minigames and Adventure Mode will be saved for a later date. The Hypixel founders added that they are committed to funding this project for 10 years, and they are fully independent with no outside investors or publishers. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

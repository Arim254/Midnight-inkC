    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Mark Delaney\n   on October 16, 2025 at 1:40PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                We're now a decade removed from what has become Supermassive's most famous game to date. Until Dawn was once meant to be a PlayStation Move game for PS3, before it was later reinvented and repurposed for PS4. A game that Sony didn't seem to have much faith in went on to become something of a modern horror game classic, and has paved the way for most of Supermassive's work since then. These days, the studio has gone multiplatform, creating many more games in the cinematic vein of Until Dawn, most of which fall under The Dark Pictures Anthology series.With so many games in this space now, we decided to rank them all. I'll note, however, that I find Supermassive's games to be like a Final Destination entry: Even the \"worst\" ones are still a good time. Thanks to these games reliably offering co-op--though they do so in different ways at times--they make great party games that don't demand much video game experience from players. They also tackle a diverse range of horror subgenres, from witches and wendigos to serial killers and ghost ships. Here's our ranking of Supermassive's interactive horror \"movie\" games.7. The Dark Pictures: Man of MedanThe first entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology is also the worst of them, but like I said in the introduction, even the lesser Supermassive horror games are still a good time. Man of Medan focuses on a group of young people going diving for a rumored WWII-era shipwreck. They find it, but it comes with a lot more than they bargained for. This one doesn't do enough to create compelling characters, including the face of the game, Shawn Ashmore, whose character can possibly die at an oddly early point in the story if you go down the wrong narrative path. Still, it's a decent time if you're one to play all of these anyway.Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, PC, SwitchFor fans of:Ghost ShipHaunting of the Queen MaryThirteen Ghosts6. The Casting of Frank StoneFrank Stone is the latest game of this type Supermassive has released, but it isn't part of The Dark Pictures. Instead, it's a collaborative project between the British studio and Behaviour Interactive, the team behind the multiplayer horror game Dead By Daylight (DBD). The Casting of Frank Stone is essentially a big lore dump for the DBD world, though it works as an intriguing supernatural slasher if you don't care about its ties to another horror universe. Like Man of Medan, it pushes you into the action before it's given its characters room to breathe, which hinders its effect, but it's still a quality time for you and some buddies to play with the lights off.Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, PCFor fans of:Friday The 13thHalloweenA Nightmare on Elm Street5. The Dark Pictures: Little HopeLittle Hope is perhaps the most polarizing of Supermassive's work in this space so far. Starring Will Poulter (The Bear, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch), Little Hope is a time-hopping story of witchcraft and family tragedy. The story jumps between the present day and a period hundreds of years ago, essentially focusing on the Salem Witch Trials, though oddly not setting the story in Salem itself, but rather a nearby fictional town. For many, Little Hope's ending is controversial, though I happened to like it. Check this one out and see where you land.Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, PC, SwitchFor fans of:The Blair Witch ProjectThe WitchThe Wicker Man4. The Dark Pictures: House of AshesHouse of Ashes made it three Dark Pictures entries in as many years back when it first released in 2021, and for many players, it's their favorite of them all. House of Ashes stars Ashley Tisdale, best known for her work on Disney Channel's The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, and despite that history, she does a great job in the lead role. Set during the US invasion of Iraq, Tisdale and others play American soldiers trapped in a cave with some sort of ancient monsters. Whereas the first two Dark Pictures landed on endings that had some fans scratching their heads, this one is a more straightforward creature feature.Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, PCFor fans of:The DescentAlien vs. PredatorAs Above, So Below3. The Dark Pictures: The Devil in MeWith Directive 8020 delayed into 2026, there will be no 2025 Dark Pictures entry, making The Devil in Me the most recent one at the time of writing. It's also the best of them in my opinion. The Devil in Me mixes the gruesome real-life history of Chicago's serial killer, H.H. Holmes, with a slasher that updates his story for modern times. Like a lot of Supermassive's work in this space, it takes a true story or legend and fleshes it out as something it can call its own. This one blends bits of Saw-like deadly traps with a straight-up stalker-killer, making it a really fun time for fans of either subgenre.Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, PCFor fans of:SawIn a Violent NatureThe Strangers2. The QuarryThe Quarry can be looked at as an unofficial Dark Pictures entry. It plays just like the others and came out in the middle of the series' ongoing run, but it's not officially billed as one because it was once intended to be a Google Stadia exclusive. When Stadia folded, The Quarry got a wider release, which is great news because it's awesome. It looks the best of anything on this list; it features a great storyline with plenty of twists, plus David Arquette has a prominent role, which is such a fun nod to his work in Scream. We won't spoil what this one's really about. Just know it's well worth your time.Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, PCFor fans of:Sleepaway CampEvil DeadCabin in the Woods1. Until DawnLike a lot of horror series, there's just something special to be said about the original, isn't there? Supermassive's \"series\" is more like a mish-mash of several different standalone stories and a deliberate anthology, but it's clear all of the games on this list are trying to emulate Until Dawn, and while they each do that to varying degrees of success, the OG remains the team's best a decade later. This one has it all: a fantastic twist, some heavy choices to make, a cast of characters who are memorable and well-established, plus a killer setting. Though I'd say playing any or all of these games listed would make for a fun night of co-op horror gaming, Until Dawn is still the gold standard.Platforms: PS4, PS5 (original and remake), PC (remake)For fans of:Cabin FeverScream30 Days of Night    \n  \n                      "

The only spooky pumpkins coming your way this year are in Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival, the pumpkin-carving MMO that's back online after its planned hiatusGhost Town Pumpkin Festival was created by Whippoorwill Ltd aka Adam R. & Dawn B., and the game sends players into a literal ghost town where they can take part in the in-game Halloween festival and pumpkin-carving contest. Players can win prize ribbons from other players who dole out awards to their favorite pumpkins. The game also encourages players to wander around the small town and customize their ghost avatar.          Previously, Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival was limited to 200 players at a time. This year, the game has added support for 800 simultaneous players. There are also new areas to find, including the Ghost Town Cinema, which plays classic silent movies. Some of the other activities in town include exploring a haunted and a hayride.Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival can be downloaded at its official site for PC, Mac, and Linux. Players can name their own price, but if they choose to pay $2 or more, they get a version of the game that includes hats for ghosts. According to Adam R., the game has already set a record this year with 24,000 pumpkins created by players since the game's return earlier this month.The team behind the game has also said that Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival will be taken down a week or two after Halloween, presumably before its inevitable return in 2026. If you're looking for something scarier, GameSpot put together a list of the horror games you can play for the Halloween season. Other titles are also having in-game tie-ins for the spooky season.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

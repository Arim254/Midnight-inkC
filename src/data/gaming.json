    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    James Carr\n   on October 14, 2025 at 5:09PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The Season 4.5 update for Marvel Rivals has arrived, adding another new hero to the ever-growing roster. Daredevil joins the roster, adding to the massive selection of Duelists on the Marvel Rivals roster. While he might not have the same explosiveness as Black Panther or Magik, Daredevil is a dive powerhouse in his own right, and his radar sense can keep your team from getting flanked.Daredevil overviewDaredevil is on the beefier end of Duelists, with a base HP of 300, allowing him to take some hits as he closes the distance on opponents. While playing Daredevil, you will have to deal with a pinkish outline of the map and enemies, with the \"normal\" vision limited to relatively close. Daredevil can see enemies that are moving through walls within a certain distance, whom he can tag with his Sonic Pursuit ability. This gives Daredevil a speed boost when closing in on the target and allows for a dash once they are within range that blinds.As for attacks, Daredevil wields his Billy Clubs, which have a close-range attack pattern and build Fury upon attacking enemies. Daredevil also has the Devil's Latch, which is another movement ability, grappling Daredevil towards either his target or whatever part of the environment he hits, also building Fury. Fury can be used to activate his Infernal Fury, which lets you either use the Devil's Chain, a close-range attack that grants bonus health based on damage dealt, or Devil's Throw, a ranged ability that can ricochet and slow hit enemies. His ultimate, which creates a large AoE, damages enemies within Daredevil's sight and blinds them, while constantly building Daredevil's Fury meter.Daredevil abilities and team-upsJustice Jab (primary): Swing Billy Clubs forward. Gain Fury on hit.Righteous Cross: Cross your Billy Clubs and surge forward. Gain Fury on hit.Objection!: Whirl Billy clubs in a tight guard to block frontal damage and reflect projectiles, becoming immune to all incoming harm during this stance and gain Fury.Devil's Latch: Fire a grappling line that reels Daredevil and his target toward each other. On completion, gain Fury and temporarily enable Cross Interrogation.Infernal Fury: Expend Fury to unleash Devil's Chain or Devil's Throw. Devil's Chain converts damage into Bonus Health, while Devil's Throw Slows enemies on hit and temporarily enables Cross Interrogation.Sonic Pursuit: Locks onto a target, gaining increased Speed and Damage Reduction when attacked. While in range, dash to the target, Blinding them and restore Fury.Radar Sense (passive): Detect enemy movements within a set radius.Blind Ascent: Run along walls and spring off them to reposition.Let The Devil Out (ultimate): Embrace the Beast within. Enemies in Daredevil's line of sight take damage and suffer a ramping Blind effect. Continually gain Fury while active.Blind Verdict (team-up): Daredevil shares the location of his Sonic Pursuit target with The Punisher. At the same time, The Punisher can launch a devil-infused shock grenade to damage and blind enemies.Hand-to-hand combatOutside of Daredevil's ultimate and the occasional favorable ricochet from Devil's Throw, he excels in one-on-one combat the best. The attack combo follows a relatively simple flow. Start with the Sonic Pursuit, use the dash to get in close, and start wailing on them with Infernal Fury into Devil's Chain. In between uses, you'll need to rebuild Fury with basic attacks, but continually using Devil's Chain will give you bonus health, which should make it easy to win a one-on-one fight against most non-Vanguard enemies. If an enemy starts to run, close the distance with Devil's Latch or finish them off with a Devil's throw.A master of defenseDespite being designed with a dive playstyle in mind, Daredevil works well as a defensive counter to a dive-heavy opponent. Because Daredevil can see nearby enemies through walls--as long as they are moving--he can play defense for your Strategists on the backline, intercepting incoming attackers before they have a chance to take out your supports. While he won't replace anti-dive Duelists like Namor fully, he can run enough interference to keep your team moving forward on offense.Let the devil outDaredevil's ultimate ability, Let The Devil Out, is as much about crowd control as it is about finishing off opponents. It does a low amount of damage continuously to enemies within his vision, so it can be used to take out escaping opponents or to take out a bunch of enemies that are low. Since it has a large AoE effect that is visible to opponents, most people will try to flee out of range once you use it, which can be used to push enemies back or to get them off an objective. The damage by itself isn't going to take out enemies by itself, so you will need to keep beating down with your Billy Clubs, but it's enough damage to throw your opponents off temporarily.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    S.E. Doster\n   on October 14, 2025 at 2:43PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Season 6 of Call of Duty: Warzone added two new guns and some weapon tuning. This update includes some decent gun buffs, and the new Dresden 9mm submachine gun and Merrick 556 assault rifle are both worth leveling up and using. In this guide, we'll provide some recommended loadout recommendations for Season 6 of Warzone.Season 6 is themed around Call of Duty's annual The Haunting event for Halloween. The update launched with a brand-new battle pass, which added spooky cosmetics and The Predator as a playable operator. Black Ops 6 multiplayer has new maps and modes, including a slasher-themed mode that gives you the opportunity to play as Jason Voorhees or Chucky. Make sure to check out all the highlights for Season 6 of Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Additionally, the Season 6 patch notes can be viewed here.All our recommended Warzone loadouts can be viewed below, and we also have suggested Season 6 multiplayer loadouts.Kilo 141The Kilo 141 remains one of the most popular and easy-to-use assault rifles in the game. This gun is a great pick for both standard battle royale and Resurgence modes. The recommended attachments will help improve the gun's damage range and bullet velocity, as well as boost the ammo count.Recommended Kilo 141 attachments:Optic: Willis 3xMuzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: Reinforced BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripMagazine: Extended Mag IIMerrick 556Season 6's Merrick 556 assault rifle is unlocked in the free version of the battle pass, and this is a solid pick for mid-range fights in Warzone. It definitely has a bit more recoil than the Kilo 141, but the recommended attachments will make this recoil manageable.Recommended Merrick 556 attachments:Optic: Willis 3xMuzzle: CompensatorBarrel: Gain-Twist BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripMagazine: Extended Mag IIABR A1The ABR A1 assault rifle is another option for Season 6. This three-round burst rifle packs a punch, and it has a built-in scope, so you don't have to waste an attachment on an optic. This is a solid pick for long-to-medium range combat, especially when playing big map matches on Verdansk.Additionally, if you don't like the built-in scope on the ABR A1, you can swap the recommended muzzle attachment for a different optic like the Willis 3x.Recommended ABR A1 attachments:Muzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: Reinforced BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripMagazine: Extended Mag IStock: Infiltrator PadFFAR 1The FFAR1 assault rifle offers a very fast time-to-kill, and it makes a solid pick for a sniper support gun to pair with the HDR or whichever sniper rifle you prefer. The recommended attachments will help manage recoil, boost the ammo count, and increase the damage range and bullet velocity.Recommended FFAR1 attachments:Optic: Kepler MicroflexMuzzle: CompensatorBarrel: Reinforced BarrelUnderbarrel: G-GripMagazine: Extended Mag IDresden 9mmSeason 6's new Dresden 9mm is basically the iconic MP40 submachine gun renamed for Black Ops 6. This submachine gun is powerful and feels great to use in close-quarters combat. The recommended attachments will help boost the damage range and bullet velocity, as well as reduce some of the weapon's recoil.Recommended Dresden 9mm attachments:Muzzle: CompensatorBarrel: Long BarrelMagazine: Extended Mag IRear grip: Quickdraw gripStock: Infiltrator StockC9The C9 is another strong choice for close-range weapons in Season 6 of Warzone. The recommended attachments will help increase the damage range and decrease the gun's recoil.Recommended C9 attachments:Barrel: Long BarrelUnderbarrel: Vertical ForegripMagazine: Extended Mag IIRear Grip: Ergonomic GripStock: Balanced StockHDRThe HDR is still the most powerful and most popular pick for Warzone in Season 6. The recommended attachments are mostly the same for a standard build of the gun, but Season 6 does feature night maps for Verdansk and Rebirth Island, making thermal scopes much more viable to use.If you want to try a thermal scope, swap the rear grip for either the Otero Thermal 2x or the Thermal 6x. They both offer different visuals, and while the 6x is preferred for the long-range fights on Verdansk, either can be beneficial on the night maps.Recommended HDR attachments:Muzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: Gain-Twist BarrelUnderbarrel: Lightweight BipodRear Grip: Quickdraw GripFire Mod: 108MM Overpressured    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Tencent Games and developer Grey State Studio aren't sending players to Hell in their upcoming game, Rules of Engagement: The Grey State. But this free-to-play tactical-horror action-RPG shooter might be Hell-adjacent, thanks to a nightmarish realm filled with monsters and other unspeakable creatures.          The Grey State is the name of an unstable dimension that's too dangerous for humanity, but it also contains alien artifacts that are invaluable. To survive in this hellscape, players assume the role of Striders who remotely pilot their bio-engineered shells from the comfort of their own dimension. Grey State Studios describes The Grey State as a \"graveyard of nightmares\" and a \"Horrorverse\" that includes Lovecraftian creatures, as well as monsters inspired by films, books, and even creepypasta online tales.The gameplay is a PvEvP loop that gives players only a limited time to drop into The Grey State. Striders will have to scavenge for gear inside the nightmarish dimension and ultimately choose between accepting an early extraction for limited rewards or taking a shot at even bigger profits if they can beat their fellow players to an alien artifact.          Grey State Studios is planning an alpha test for Rules of Engagement that will feature four classes of Striders that players can pick. The fourth option is currently being hidden, but the other three are listed below.Sledge, an unstoppable juggernaut that forges a path with shield and hammerPyro, a chaotic madman that controls the battlefield with fire and gasPhantom, a swift assassin that strikes from the shadows with extreme precisionThe studio notes that players who demonstrate talent for buildcrafting and strategy will reap the rewards in this game. It also added that \"Rules of Engagement was built with the future in mind, and we plan to support the game for years to come with content updates, meta shakeups and player-friendly free-to-play business model supported by a cosmetics-only in-game shop.\"Rules of Engagement: The Grey State will hit PC in 2026, and it can be played as a single-player experience or with up to three other players. Additional seasonal content is planned post-launch to explore other aspects of the game's Horrorverse.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

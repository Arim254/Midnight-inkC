To mark the occasion, Blizzard is giving out rewards in several of its games. The only thing players have to do to unlock rewards in multiple games is to earn the \"Welcome Home\" Achievement. To do that, all you need to do is move into a home and fill out a form. That will grant you a new set of cosmetics in Overwatch 2, Heathstone, and StarCraft 2. Here's a breakdown of what you'll get in each game.Overwatch 2Xal’atath Symmetra Legendary SkinXal’atath Symmetra SprayXal'atath Symmetra Name CardDark Heart Player IconThe Overwatch 2, Heartthstone and StarCraft 2 rewards from World of Warcraft.HearthstoneEarning the \"Welcome Home\" achievement in WoW unlocks the Hearth & Home Card BackStarCraft 2Earning new Horde and Alliance StarCraft II console skins after you earn the \"Welcome Home\" achievement in WoW.Heathstone is also running a new, limited-time in-game event, \"Welcome to the Neighborhood!,\" featuring an earnable Epic event card.The Midnight expansion is also changing transmog in the game, and some people are upset about it. Subsequently, Bilzzard has already made some adjustments to the changes in response to feedback. Blizzard is also introducing a new in-game currency that can only be spent on housing items. The company has argued that making that change is better for players, but not all of them would agree with that.World of Warcraft's Midnight expansion will launch on March 2, 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Now, the dev behind Scrappy has come forward to explain how he was put in the game and why he became such an important part of it.Johan, a 3D artist who has works on Arc Raiders, shared the origin story of Scrappy in a post on the game's official page.The real Scrappy is a rooster named Hakan who once crashed Johan's Zoom meeting while he was staying at his parents' house. Johan describes the rooster as, \"Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye. He had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.\"Scrappy the Rooster rocking a hat in Arc Raiders.Johan went on to explain that he photoscanned Haskan into the game \"as a silly little Easter egg.\" He didn't plan for Haskan to become a resource provider in the game, but it was suggested by one of his teammates.\"That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon,\" recalled Johan. \"Scrappy went from hidden Easter egg, to 'temporary mesh we’ll definitely replace later,' to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the Arc Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!\"Earlier this month, Arc Raiders hit 480,000 active players on Steam, which was nearly four times as many players as Black Ops 7 had during its launch weekend. A new patch for the game was released last week.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

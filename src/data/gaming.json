That game went on to become one of most downloaded mobile titles of all time. Now, the sequel, Subway Surfers City, is set to launch next month on mobile devices.The announcement of the game's release date was accompanied by a cinematic trailer that shows off the world of Subway Surfers City.          This endless runner takes place in Subway City across four unlockable neighborhoods: The Docks, Southline, Sunrise Blvd, and Delorean Park. New neighborhoods will be added each season, alongside additional characters, outfits, and hoverboards. Players will also be given new abilities, including a stomp move, and a bubblegum shield that can enhance jumps. There are also three new game modes:Classic Endless: The beloved fast-paced runner experience where players chase high scores and discover new paths, even on their thousandth run.City Tour: A new finite game mode where players progress through levels with distinct goals, exploring districts to find hidden stars and complete missions.Events: A rotation of finite runs and trials designed to challenge even the most advanced players’ skills.\"At its core, Subway Surfers City is the next chapter of Subway Surfers' nearly 15-year-long legacy,\" said SYBO CEO Mathias Gredal Nørvig in a statement. \"Subway Surfers continues to experience remarkable success year after year, and we're thrilled to now provide players with an entirely new way to interact with the IP.\"Subway Surfers City will be released on February 26, and interested players can preregister on the game's official site.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this month, word leaked about a new Life is Strange game that's on the horizon. Now, Square Enix has confirmed that the next Life is Strange is coming soon, but players will need to wait another five days for the full details.As noted on X, the latest installment of Life is Strange will be announced on a livestream on January 20, at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET.Thanks to the leak from the Pan-European Game Information, we know the name of the game is Life is Strange: Reunion. And as the title implies, it will reunite the leading character, Max Caulfield, with her best friend, Chloe Price.According to the game's description, Chloe reenters Max's life when the latter is a student at Caledon University. Chloe urgently needs Max's help, but the more immediate problem is that the entire campus will be destroyed in three days' time unless Max finds a way to stop it with her powers. Using her power to rewind time is one of the reasons why Max lost Chloe in the first place. And who knows what price she'll have to pay this time?PEGI's rating for Life is Strange: Reunion only mentioned PS5, and didn't confirm its release on PC or Xbox Series X|S. But we'll know soon which platforms it will be on, and when it will arrive.Late last year, Prime Video ordered a Life is Strange TV series. However, the original creators of the game are apparently not involved in the show.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

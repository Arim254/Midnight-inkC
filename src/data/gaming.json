    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Pokemon Go is celebrating the arrival of fall with the Harvest Festival event from October 10-16. Fall-themed Pokemon like Miltank, Smoliv, and Combee will be appearing more frequently over the next few days, but most exciting is the arrival of two new Pokemon: Dipplin and its evolved form, Hydrapple.Dipplin is another alternate evolution of Applin, originally introduced as part of the Teal Mask DLC for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Like Applin's other evolved forms, however, you'll need to collect a new type of item--Syrupy Apples--before you can get one, and they're a little difficult to get your hands on. Here are some tips to help you get Dipplin and Hydrapple in Pokemon Go.How To Get DipplinThe easiest way to obtain Dipplin is to evolve one from Applin, but you'll need to collect quite a few items first. Specifically, you need 200 Applin Candy and 20 Syrupy Apples to trigger the evolution.Syrupy Apples are a new type of item introduced as part of the Harvest Festival event, and they can be found at PokeStops. Once you've collected the requisite items, you can evolve Applin into Dipplin right from the Pokemon's detail page.How To Get Syrupy ApplesLike Sweet Apples and Tart Apples (which are required to evolve Applin into Appletun or Flapple, respectively), the primary way to obtain Syrupy Apples is at PokeStops. Set a Mossy Lure Module at one of these waypoints, and apples will periodically appear on the map while the module is active.Once you see an apple, simply tap on the item to collect it. However, not every apple can be picked up; sometimes tapping on one will trigger an encounter with a wild Pokemon, so you'll need patience and persistence while trying to collect them.How To Evolve Dipplin Into HydrappleYou won't need any more Syrupy Apples to get a Hydrapple, but you will need to have a lot of candy saved up. It costs 400 Applin candy to evolve Dipplin into Hydrapple. On top of that, you must catch seven dragon-type Pokemon while Dipplin is set as your buddy before you can trigger the evolution, adding a further complication to the process.It typically takes quite a long time to collect 400 candy, but there are a few ways to expedite the process. Since Applin is appearing more frequently during the Harvest Festival event, make sure to use a Pinap Berry before catching the Pokemon to increase the amount of candy you get as a reward. You can also convert any Rare Candy you have stocked up into Applin candy, which will help you reach the 400 requirement faster.Can Dipplin And Hydrapple Be Shiny?Since shiny Applin has not yet been added to Pokemon Go, you can't yet get a shiny Dipplin or Hydrapple in the mobile game. There's no indication when shiny Applin will make its Pokemon Go debut, but new shiny Pokemon are typically introduced during special events, so it'll likely arrive as part of some future event.The Harvest Festival is underway until October 16, but there are plenty of other events still in store for this month, including a Pokemon Legends: Z-A crossover and the annual Halloween celebration. You can read more about everything happening over the next few weeks in our Pokemon Go October events guide.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Lovecraft is responsible for a long list of classic horror stories that continue to be highly influential in the world of literature, film, television, and video games. The author's blend of unsettling cosmic horror with sci-fi/fantasy and Gothic settings--almost always with an ample dose of weird--is so recognizable that the word Lovecraftian is used to describe stories inspired by his work. Stories like The Call of Cthulhu and At the Mountains of Madness are still well-worth reading nearly 100 years after they were first published. Those stories and the rest of the author's writings were recently collected in a two-volume box set dubbed The H.P. Lovecraft Experience--and fans can save 25% on this stunning collection at Amazon.The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society worked with publisher Weldon Owen--an imprint of Insight Editions--to craft the comprehensive two-volume collection. Published in August with a $100 MSRP, The H.P. Lovecraft Experience Deluxe Box Set is now on sale for $74.80.                                 The H.P. Lovecraft Experience Deluxe Box Set (Hardcover)                                                                $74.80 (was $100)                                                                                                                                                                                    This is almost certainly the most stunning Lovecraft collection you can find at a major retailer or bookstore.The 1,188-page collection is spread across two striking, dark green volumes hardbound in leatherette to resemble high-quality books from Lovecraft's time. The cover and spines have foil-stamped insignias and lettering.The H.P. Lovecraft Experience includes all of the author's work, so this is a one-stop shop for his novels, novellas, short stories, and other writings.The two books are packaged inside a sculpted display case featuring a new 3D depiction of Cthulhu. When we say 3D, we mean that Cthulhu rises from the surface of the case, which makes the cosmic entity more terrifying than it already is.The oversized display box houses more than just the two books, though. The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society created a brand-new Reader's Guide that examines 10 of Lovecraft's short stories. The guidebook was written by Sean Branney and Andrew Leman, the co-founders of the Lovecraft Historical Society, and should be an interesting read for newcomers and experienced readers alike. The Reader's Guide matches the look of the two main volumes, but it's sized like notebook. The format here keeps with the overarching theme of the collectibles.All of the supplements are tied to Miskatonic University, a fictional Massachusetts college that plays a major role in many of Lovecraft's stories, including all of his work related to the Cthulhu.Big Lovecraft fans will probably want to frame their diploma from Miskatonic University that's included here--but only after you follow The Undergraduate Course Book, presented as a small booklet. Other Miskatonic-themed collectibles you'll find in the box include a bookmark, a library card, a patch, and a decal.The H.P. Lovecraft Experience is also available as a Kindle ebook for $20. Obviously, you'll miss out on the collectibles and premium presentation, but you'll still get both volumes and the Reader's Guide. Note: The \"paperback edition\" on Amazon's store page is not the real H.P. Lovecraft Experience. It was self-published by someone who wanted to game the system. Don't buy it.                      The H.P. Lovecraft Experience Deluxe Box SetGallery                                                                                                More Lovecraft Box Sets & CollectionsSince most of Lovecraft's work is in the public domain, you can read many of his horror stories for free online. You'll also find a dizzying number of Lovecraft collections on Amazon. But keep in mind that Lovecraft being in the public domain means that there are a lot of terribly designed editions created by random people across the world.Strangely, The H.P. Lovecraft Experience is one of the rare editions of the author's complete writings that actually looks nice. There are cheaper options that that readers like, but they aren't always as comprehensive.                                                                                                                                               One solid budget-friendly option is The H.P. Lovecraft Collection: 6-Book Deluxe Box Set. The set includes clothbound editions of six of the author's best-known works in a display box. The artwork and cover designs aren't super exciting, but the books themselves are well-made. It's on sale for $35.49 (was $60) at Amazon and is eligible for Amazon's B2G1 Free Book Sale through October 11. Here's the list of books included in the box set:At the Mountains of MadnessThe Dunwich HorrorThe Call of CthulhuThe Shadow over InnsmouthPolarisThe Color Out of SpaceRats in the WallsThe same publisher released The Necronomicon: 5-Book Box Set in paperback in 2021. The Necronomicon includes Lovecraft stories as well Cthulhu Mythos tales by other authors. You can get The Necronomicon Box Set for $23 (was $40)--it's also in the B2G1 Free catalog. Heads up: This publisher is also releasing a 928-page hardcover H.P. Lovecraft Collection with illustrated page edges for $25 on November 4.H.P. Lovecraft: The Complete Fiction - Barnes & Noble Collectible EditionWe'd also recommend the Barnes & Noble Collectible Edition of Lovecraft's Complete Fiction for $27 (was $30). This beautiful hardcover edition has a bonded-leather binding, illustrated endpapers, and a ribbon bookmark. Barnes & Noble also has a Collectible Edition of The Complete Cthulhu Mythos Tales for $30. For another respected edition, check out The Complete Fiction of H.P. Lovecraft for $14 (was $18). This 1,112-page hardcover was published by Chartwell Books in 2016 and remains a great option today. The Complete Tales of H.P. Lovecraft, published in 2019 by Rock Point, is essentially the same book, but it has more evocative cover art and is available for around the same price.H.P. Lovecraft Manga AdaptationsH.P. Lovecraft manga adaptations by Gou Tanabe (Dark Horse Manga)Lovecraft fans and horror manga readers in general should definitely check out the manga adaptations of Lovecraft's work. Written and illustrated by Gou Tanabe and translated to English by Zack Davisson, the manga is hauntingly beautiful. You can probably already tell by the cover art above, but Tanabe's illustrations are simply incredible.Five Lovecraft manga adaptations have already been published in the US by Dark Horse Manga, including the 288-page adaptation of The Call of Cthulhu for $16.52 (was $20) and At the Mountains of Madness, which has a 626-page hardcover Deluxe Edition for $26.65 (was $50).

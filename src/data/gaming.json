The friendship mechanic, also known as happiness, determines your teammates' respective affinity toward you, their trainer. This can be improved through various means to help unlock new evolutionary paths.Pokemon can become friendlier toward you through the following methods:Exploring the game world while they're your active buddy.Using various items and equipment.Chilling in cafes and restaurants.Which Pokemon tend to evolve based on friendship levels?Friendship level in Pokemon Legends: Z-A matters to certain creatures whose evolutions are tied to this concept. These include the following:Pikachu - Evolves from a Pichu at high friendship levels.Eevee - Can turn into an Espeon (daytime evolution), Umbreon (nighttime evolution), or Sylveon (evolution with a Fairy-type ability in the moveset).Cleffa - Evolves into a Clefairy.Budew - Evolves into a Roselia during the day.Buneary - Evolves into a Lopunny.Riolu - Evolves into a Lucario during the day.Items that help increase friendship levels: Berries and the Soothe BellVarious items can increase Pokemon happiness and friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. These include different kinds of berries that boost friendship, while also lowering a particular stat. We don't really recommend using these since it's hard to offset the penalties to a Pokemon's stat growth. But if you really want to, you can check unmarked vendor and market stalls all over the city:Pomeg Berry - Lose base points for its HP stat.Kelpsy Berry - Lose base points for its attack stat.Qualot Berry - Lose base points for its defense stat.Hondew Berry - Lose base points for its SP attack stat.Grepa Berry - Lose base points for its SP defense stat.Tamato Berry - Lose base points for its speed stat.Still, one item that's quite viable is the Soothe Bell. It's a reward from Side Mission 36: Some Friendly Competition. Here are a few tidbits:The quest giver NPC is right in front of Cafe Rouleau in Magenta Sector 5. It's in the western part of the map.Defeat the trainer's Clefairy to receive the item.You can have a Pokemon hold the Soothe Bell via the inventory screen. This makes the creature friendlier.Fast friendship boosts via cafes and restaurantsBy far the fastest method of improving friendship and happiness levels involves cafes and restaurants. These are found all throughout Lumiose City:Go to a cafe and purchase a coffee or tea drink. Each option costs roughly 500 gold or more.Do this three or four times to fully max out a Pokemon's affinity toward you. You don't even need to go to a different establishment.You're going to spend 2,000 gold or more each time, but you can still earn a lot of money from the Battle Zone at night.That does it for our guide on how to increase friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. If you're keen on improving the capabilities of your teammates, you can visit our best early-game Pokemon guide and TM locations guide.You don't need to face the challenges in Lumiose City all by your lonesome. We've got a Pokemon Legends: Z-A guides hub to help you go from the bottom to the very top of the rankings.    \n  \n                      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has revealed a new map for the game, set inside an abandoned restaurant. The location--Neil's Diner--was unveiled during a TwitchCon panel that celebrated the recent fifth anniversary of the co-op horror game, and players can explore it starting November 11.Kinetic Games described Neil's Diner as a \"run-down, retro restaurant\" that's been long-abandoned by staff and diners alike. While this is one of the smaller maps in Phasmophobia, it's still full of authentic details and phantoms hungry for thrills.\"We always thought a diner would fit perfectly, so Nell's was born, and it's been such a fun challenge bringing it to life,\" lead developer Daniel Knight said in a press release. \"Alongside the farmhouse reworks from this year, Nell's is an example of how we want all the maps in Phasmophobia to feel going forward. It's unique, and has been meticulously designed to tell more of a story to our players--beyond the immediate ghost theyâ€™re hunting.\"Phasmophobia will be releasing into version 1.0 next year, but this is just the start of Kinetic's big plans for its hit game. An upcoming overhaul--dubbed Horror 2.0--will release alongside the 1.0 launch, and the studio says that the update will make Phasmaphobia feel like a new game. Hollywood is also calling, as production company Blumhouse--Five Nights at Freddy's, Paranormal Activity, The Purge, and Insidious--is adapting the game for the big screen.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The new island features four named locations based on the town of Hawkins, Indiana, as well as a border right down the middle separating the normal world from locations that have been corrupted by the Upside Down--essentially giving the map a pair of distinct biomes, something that Blitz hasn't done before since its map is already so little.The map and the new item shop skins based on Vecna and the original four boys are the entirety of this takeover--there aren't any new Stranger Things weapons added to the loot pool or anything like that. That's fine, because between the ongoing Simpsons season and the imminent launch of Chapter 7, we've already got plenty of new mechanics to worry about.Scroll on for looks at the full new map and each of the named locations.As you can see, the island is split in half between the regular part in the west and the Upside Down part in the east, with each half getting two of the major locations. While the Upside Down half is always dark and spooky, the normal half of the island has the usual day/night cycle.Gnarly FarmsStranger SuburbsLibrary LandingHawkins HeightsHawkins Heights includes this movie theater sign and marquee teasing the Chapter 6 finale event that's taking place on Saturday, November 29. Fun fact: Despite the sign indicating otherwise, there's no movie theater on this map.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this year, Hytale was canceled after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and purchased all of the rights for Hytale from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale will retail for $20. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.\"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible,\" wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. \"I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast.\"Collins-Laflamme added that he wants to attract as many players as possible, even during rough economic times. Hypixel has also released a post detailing how far along the modding feature is. The short answer is there's still a lot of work to be done. For now, Hytale doesn't have a release date, but Collins-Laflamme has implied that the game's early-access period will begin relatively soon.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

With the fifth and final season starting on Netflix next week, Stranger Things is returning to Fornite with a new set of heroes crossing over.Epic Games has revealed that Stranger Things' Mike, Dustin, Will, and Lucas are coming to Fortnite's Blitz Royale mode. Max, Steve, Nancy, Jonathan, and Robin apparently didn't make the cut. The artwork below features the Stranger Things kids--or perhaps young adults is more accurate now--with a backdrop revealing portals to the Upside Down across Hawkins and appearance by Vecna, the show's primary villain.The Stranger Things kids will get their own Fortnite skins very soon.At least some of those Upside Down designs will be a part of the Stranger Things Fortnite Blitz Royale map and the Stranger Things skins will be released through the Fortnite store today. The older Stranger Things skins--Eleven, Jim Hopper, and a Demorgon--aren't currently available, but they seem like strong candidates to return.Fortnite is still in its Simpsons mini-series mode until November 29. The game has already introduced a giant--and-shirtless-Homer Simpson. On that same day, Fortnite Chapter Seven will introduce The Bride from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. That season is also rumored to feature Harry Potter and James Bond. Back to the Future's Marty McFly appears to be a part of this season's Battle Pass. For now, Epic has yet to officially announce Marty's Fortnite debut.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

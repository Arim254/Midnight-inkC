    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Baltimore Ravens have gotten off to a 1-5 start this NFL season, and the coaching staff are apparently making moves to help turn things around, including removing certain items from the locker room, in an effort to help players focus.According to reports, a series of leisure items--including video games, cornhole boards, a ping pong table, and a basketball hoop--have been removed from the team locker room for the time being.Writer Sam Cohn of The Baltimore Sun said some Ravens players really enjoyed playing Super Smash Bros. in the locker room, with teammates crowding around to watch, but that's coming to an end for now. Players told The Sun that the coaching staff wanted to remove distractions for the players.The video games were apparently removed after the Ravens started the season 1-3, and since then, the Ravens have lost two more games to sink to 1-5. \"The only worse thing is 0-6, so yes, it's a big hole. We're going to have to bounce back,\" center Tyler Linderbaum said. \"We have 11 games left to try to run the table.\"The Ravens hit the field again this Sunday, October 26, at home against the 4-2 Chicago Bears. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

She said in a new interview that people are beginning to \"evolve way past\" the idea that a game should be exclusive to one store or device.\"The biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at Call of Duty, you look at Minecraft, you look at Fortnite, you look at Roblox ... that's actually what's really driving community in gaming. That's where people gather. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people,\" she told Mashable.\"You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they're on. And we're really leaning into that with this experience [Rog Ally X]. It just opens up another way for you to play, as does cloud, as does PC as do the consoles we all have in the living room,\" she added.          Microsoft was once a big believer in exclusive games, but the company has updated its business strategy and has in recent times opted to release its games in more places, including rival systems.For Sony, the company has also begun to bring more of its games to places beyond PlayStation, including PC and, in the case of Helldivers 2, Xbox. Nintendo, however, only releases its own games for its own exclusive platforms, and that's proven to be good business for the company.Microsoft does not have one single strategy it applies to all of its game releases, as some titles are released across multiple platforms simultaneously, others are not. One of the next Xbox games that could make the jump to PlayStation is Starfield, with a report saying this will be announced in 2026.In other news, Microsoft is reportedly gearing up to announce a Halo: Combat Evolved remake, and it might be in the works for PS5.Microsoft was also in the news recently regarding Bond's comments about the next Xbox console, labeling it \"high-end\" and prompting fears from fans that it will be very expensive.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The deal also covers \"new content and experiences\" for EA's College Football series, along with \"new, large-scale interactive experiences for football fans...\"EA and the NFL are staying in business together.EA and the NFL aren't giving much away about future projects, but the companies teased a \"reimagining\" of \"interactive football experiences.\" The aim here is to give players the ability to \"play, watch, create, and connect.\"EA and the NFL had already expanded their partnership somewhat, as EA was the presenting sponsor for the recent NFL game in Dublin.EA announced this deal with the NFL not long after it confirmed it was selling itself to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia's PIF for $55 billion.While EA's Madden NFL series is continuing, the company's efforts to revive its college basketball game series are apparently not coming to fruition.The Madden series is an annual juggernaut, regularly ranking as one of the best-selling games each year in the US. So far in 2025, Madden NFL 26 is the No. 7 best-selling game of the year in the US.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

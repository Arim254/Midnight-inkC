    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Everybody needs a friend, and that's especially the case in Satisfactory, where it's just you against all of nature and capitalism. Thankfully, the Lizard Doggo is there to keep you company. And even if you prefer your alone time, there's a good reason to keep a pen of Lizard Doggos around.Lizard Doggos are short, friend-sized lizards with dog-like features. They have a physique similar to that of a Beagle, but are scaled and have armor on their back. Untamed, Lizard Doggos are entirely harmless, and will quickly run when approached if done so carelessly.To tame a Lizard Doggo, you'll need a few Paleberries--the raspberry-like fruit found all over the map. If you already have Blade Runners by this point, unequip them before you try to tame one of these little guys, and toggle your movement speed to slow (Shift key). Find a Doggo and wait until it turns and starts staring at you. At this point, open your inventory and drop a Paleberry on the ground in front of you and wait. The Doggo will slowly approach you to eat the Paleberry. Make sure not to move during this process. Once the Doggo has completely eaten the Paleberry, slowly approach it. You should have a prompt to pet it (E). If you're able to pet it, you're golden--you have a new buddy.Make sure to name every single one of your Lizard Doggos.Lizard Doggos are slow, though, and they aren't very smart, either. You won't want to take these guys exploring, because they can't keep up with anything faster than a walking pace. They can be killed by poisonous gas or hostile creatures, too, though they're immune to radiation. They also have a tendency to take a walk off the nearest cliff.To protect them, you'll want to take them right home and build a pen for them. Make sure the pen has a foundation underneath, otherwise they can de-spawn. If you get creative with the builder, you can still give them grassy space to play in with a hidden foundation underneath to keep them from disappearing. They can't jump, and their maximum step height is one meter, so they can't climb very high, meaning that your pen walls can be pretty low.Now that you have a Doggo and a Doggo Park, you'll want to check back every so often. Each Doggo has a one-slot inventory, and will at random intervals generate one of a list of 46 potential items, ranging from Hog Remains to Power Slugs to Nuclear Waste. With a pen full of Doggos, you can generate quite a few items in short order, and some of them can be pretty rare. At the current time there's no way to farm those items automatically, or to breed Lizard Doggos, so this will still be a manual process, but a Purple Power Slug or a Nuke Nobelisk is nothing to sneeze at.Here's the full list at the time of this writing, with the resource linked above:OreS.A.M.Flora and FaunaHog RemainsSpitter RemainsBlue Power SlugYellow Power SlugPurple Power SlugHealing ItemsBeryl NutComponentsIron PlateIron RodWireCableConcreteScrewReinforced Iron PlateRotorCopper SheetModular FrameSteel BeamSteel PipeEncased Industrial BeamStatorMotorPlasticRubberCircuit BoardHeavy Modular FrameComputerQuickwireAlclad Aluminum SheetAluminum CasingCrystal OscillatorSilicaQuartz CrystalElectromagnetic Control RodHeat SinkCooling SystemFused Modular FrameHigh-Speed ConnectorTurbo MotorFuelSolid BiofuelBiomass (Generic)AmmoNuke NobeliskPulse NobeliskNobeliskRifle AmmoIron Rebar\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The holy grail of Satisfactory is having a perfectly balanced factory, where everything made is used, with your storage emptying at the same rate it's being depleted. But that's not going to happen--you'll have extras. That's what the Awesome Sink is for.What is the Awesome Sink?The Awesome Sink (with Moody Lighting)The Awesome Sink is a building that exists to get rid of all of your extra stuff, rewarding you with tickets based on the complexity of the items. This building is entirely optional, but those tickets can be used in the Awesome Shop to buy things like new cosmetic building parts, walkways, vehicles, and more. There's some really useful stuff in there, so you'd be a fool not to put one up. See the official Satisfactory wiki page on the Awesome Shop for a complete list of available items and ticket values.How does the Awesome Sink Work?You can dump items into the Awesome Sink as quickly as conveyor belts can supply them, so if you have a production line that's pumping out materials at ultra-high volume just for this purpose, the Awesome Sink is ready. You can build multiple Awesome Sinks around your factory, the points they generate are universal to all Sinks, and you can print out your tickets from any Sink at any time. So it's smart to have a Sink in various areas of your megafactory, taking in extra items and turning them for profit. The higher complexity the item, the more points it will generate toward your next ticket. Further, tickets become more expensive with each one generatedFor example, an Iron Ingot generates just two points, while a Crystal Oscillator generates 3,072. A Thermal Propulsion Rocket will generate over 370,000 points.Inside the Awesome ShopHow to get the most out of your Awesome SinkOnce you can get higher-speed conveyor belts attached to your Awesome Sink, it becomes a matter of finding the right ratio of highest points to lowest complexity. For example, Silica and Quickwire are two low-complexity options that can yield a lot of output fast. Later on, you'll need that Silica for manufacturing, so you'll need to shift to some of those higher-complexity items as you continue to progress.There are certain items the Awesome Sink won't accept, such as consumables or radioactive materials, but almost anything else you can produce can go in.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

It is also a great time to meet up and reconnect with those faces you may not have seen in a while, or just time to unwind and relax. Either way, games are a great way to spend newfound time off, and luckily, 2025 saw the release of some wonderful titles that can appeal to whatever sort of gaming relaxation you are looking for.Whether you're looking for a game to boot up at a party or something to put on and escape into as a blizzard rages outside, here are 10 games that are great to check out this holiday.Super Mario Party JamboreeNothing screams holidays quite like getting together again with your friends or family and screaming at them for stealing your stars in a Mario Party game. The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.Read our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree hereCall of Duty: Black Ops 72) Call of Duty Black Ops 7When work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.Read our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hereDragon Quest I & II HD-2D RemakeWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.Read our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake hereClair Obscur: Expedition 33Few games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.Read our review of Expedition 33 here.Sonic Racing: CrossworldsI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.Read our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds hereSplit FictionIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.Read our review of Split Fiction here.Ball X PitThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.Read our review of Ball X Pit hereBlue PrinceIf you are more in the mood to keep your mind sharp over vacation, then step inside the ever-shifting rooms of Blue Prince. In this mind-bending game that mixes puzzles with a clever mystery you need to solve, you will need to count your steps and solve puzzles in the various rooms of the mysterious manor in an effort to discover Room 46. Every time you step inside, your route will be different, with each door leading to a new place with new challenges to solve. Blue Prince is one of 2025's best brain-busting titles and a great way to spend your downtime this holiday.Read our review of Blue Prince herePeakWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.Check out a bit of the history behind Peak hereSuper Smash Bros. UltimateWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!Read our review of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate here    \n  \n                      "

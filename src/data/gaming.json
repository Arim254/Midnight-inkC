Expedition 33 had previously won both awards, but it was stripped of its Indie Game Awards over AI concerns.Expedition 33 didn't walk away from the Steam Awards empty handed. Voters gave it the Best Soundtrack Award for 2025. Among this year's 11 game categories, Silksong was the only title that won more than just a single award.Beyond that, Steam voters spread the wealth to include fan-favorites Dispatch, Hades 2, Silent Hill f, Peak, ARC Raiders and more. Baldur's Gate 3 even got another award for its post-game updates and bug fixes.The complete list of winners for the 2025 Steam Awards is included below.Game of the Year Award -- Hollow Knight: SilksongDeveloper: Team CherryPublisher: Team CherryRunners-up:ARC RaidersClair Obscur: Expedition 33DispatchKingdom Come: Deliverance 2VR Game of the Year Award -- The Midnight WalkDeveloper: MoonHoodPublisher: Fast Travel GamesRunners-up:PavlovEmissary ZeroF1 25Le Mans UltimateLabor of Love Award -- Baldur's Gate 3Developer: Larian StudiosPublisher: Larian StudiosRunners-up:Helldivers 2No Man's SkyRustDOTA 2Best Game on Steam Deck Award -- Hades 2Developer: Supergiant GamesPublisher: Supergiant GamesRunners-up:Digimon Story Time StrangerBall X PitCloverPitDeep Rock Galactic: SurvivorHades 2Better With Friends Award -- PeakDeveloper: Aggro Crab and LandfallPublisher: Aggro Crab and LandfallRunners-up:Split FictionR.E.P.O.Schedule 1Battlefield 6Outstanding Visual Style Award -- Silent Hill fDeveloper: NeoBards EntertainmentPublisher: KonamiRunners-up: My Little PuppyFinal Fantasy 7 RebirthENA: Dream BBQDoom: The Dark AgesMost Innovative Gameplay Award -- ARC RaidersDeveloper: Embark StudiosPublisher: Embark StudiosRunners-up:Europa Universalis VMage ArenaEscape From DuckovBlue PrinceBest Game You Suck At Award -- Hollow Knight: SilksongDeveloper: Team CherryPublisher: Team CherryRunners-up:Where Winds MeetPath of Exile: The Last of the DruidsElden Ring: Night ReignMarvel RivalsBest Soundtrack Award -- Clair Obscur: Expedition 33Developer: Sandfall InteractivePublisher: Kepler InteractiveRunners-up:DeltaruneRift of the NecrodancerSpider-Man 2Tokyo Xtreme RacerOutstanding Story-Rich Game Award -- DispatchDeveloper: AdHoc StudioPublisher: AdHoc StudioRunners-up:The Last of Us Part 2 RemasteredDying Light: The BeastKingdom Come: Deliverance 2No, I'm Not a HumanSit Back and Relax Award -- RV There Yet?Developer: Nuggets EntertainmentPublisher: Nuggets EntertainmentRunners-up:MegabonkChill with You: Lo-Fi StorySlime Ranchers 2Power Wash Simulator 2    \n  \n                      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                As GPU prices continue to skyrocket and stock becomes increasingly scarce, rumors are swirling that Nvidia might be about to resurrect a previously discontinued line of hardware.According to Wccftech, Nvidia is reportedly on the verge of resuming production on its budget-friendly GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs to combat the ongoing shortage of RAM being caused by an uptick in development on AI technologies and the increasing prices of memory.Wccftech's reporting on these rumors seems to stem from a credible leaker of Nvidia GPU production news on Twitter called @hongxing2020. According to a post they made early on January 5, Nvidia seems poised to bring back the RTX 3060 in the first quarter of 2026.01.05updatertx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲  — hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) January 5, 2026              The back half of 2025 saw GPU prices sharply rise as tech companies voted to go all in on AI. In short, many of these companies need more raw computing power, which means that companies like Nvidia are now dedicating massive amounts of their own consumer stock to these ends. What little is left for consumers looking to build PCs has now risen in value, and you've likely seen as much if you've spent the last few months shopping around for the right parts for a gaming PC.Just days into 2026, it was reported that both AMD and Nvidia , two of the most reputable names in the business, would be raising the prices of their consumer GPUs quite heavily this year. Some of the estimates being floated sound preposterous, but regardless, you better get used to the idea of paying a lot of money--more than usual, at least--for memory as we wade deeper into 2026.That is, unless the rumors prove true and Nvidia does really bring back the RTX 3060, which is still one of the most popular graphics cards around despite being phased out for the newer (and more expensive) 40 and 50 series GPUs.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Microsoft has announced a new partnership to Hisense to bring the Xbox app to TVs that run on the company's TV operating system, V (formerly known as VIDAA).In essence, the big takeaway here is that people will soon be able to play Xbox games in yet another place, without needing to own an actual physical Xbox. This is possible through Xbox Cloud Gaming, which is included with Game Pass Essential, Premium, and Ultimate.Your Hisense TV will soon be an Xbox.\"Our vision is to make sure your games, your community, and your achievements are always within reach. Bringing the Xbox app to select Hisense and V homeOS-powered TVs is another step toward making gaming available across a broad range of devices, to meeting you wherever you want to play,\" Microsoft said.Playing Xbox on a Hisense TV won't be here tomorrow, or next week. Microsoft said it will share more details on how this all works \"in the coming months,\" so keep checking back for more.Hisense TVs are just the latest to welcome the Xbox app, as Samsung welcomed the Xbox app all the way back in 2022 to allow people to stream games to their TVs.All of this is part of Microsoft's push to expand the Xbox audience beyond consoles. The company is messaging this with the tagline \"This is an Xbox.\"In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox, but \"playing on Xbox\" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. \"It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it,\" he said.Game consoles usually do not make much money, and if they do, it's not a lot compared to the much more lucrative games and services. This is why Microsoft is pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard. Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

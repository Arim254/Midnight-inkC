    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                PowerWash Simulator 2 is a zen experience solo, allowing you to get lost in a relaxing process of cleaning away grime for hours on end. However, it also features a multiplayer component for up to four players, so you can team up with friends to tackle some of the game's biggest and most challenging jobs together. If you're curious about what options you'll have available when doing so, here's everything you need to know about split-screen, crossplay, and cross-progression in PowerWash Simulator 2.Does PowerWash Simulator 2 have split-screen?If you and a friend are hanging out on the same couch and want to play PowerWash Simulator 2 together, you're in luck. By simply opening up the multiplayer menu and selecting \"Start Split-Screen Session,\" you two can get started cleaning up any job you wish.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: PowerWash Simulator 2 | Release Date Announcement Trailer\n      \nDoes PowerWash Simulator 2 have crossplay?If you're hoping to play PowerWash Simulator 2 with friends on different platforms, your ability to do so will depend entirely on which platforms you're playing on. Xbox and PC players can team up with one another in multiplayer by creating a room and sharing their unique room code with up to three other players. However, those playing on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 can only team up with players on their respective platforms for now--and maybe forever.While FuturLab has hinted that they're at least considering crossplay functionality for PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2, nothing has been confirmed. It doesn't seem like a likely feature, especially given that this same restriction applied to the original game.Does PowerWash Simulator 2 have cross-progression?If you're the type to play a game on multiple devices, you'll run into some issues with this title. Unfortunately, PowerWash Simulator 2 does not feature cross-progression. As such, your saves won't be able to transfer between different platforms, meaning you'd need to replay the game from the beginning if you switch to a different ecosystem.As of now, there is no indication that FuturLab will add cross-progression at a later date, so just be certain the platform you choose is best suited for you and any friends you want to play with.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

That's according to series creator Ed Boon, who said in a new interview that every time he's watched the opening sequence, he's cried.\"I don't think I've seen it yet and not cried,\" Boon told Collider, as reported by GamesRadar. \"It is intense. It punches you in the face. And it absolutely is the best way to start it, but the rest of the movie just lives up to it. It's such a powerful opening scene.\"That's all he had to say, so we don't know exactly what he's referring to here or how the opening sequence will do what Boon claims it will.Also in the interview, Boon said the sequel will \"absolutely\" live up to what fans expect, including going in on violence to earn its R rating. \"We have the tournament, which is a big request from fans. It will absolutely satisfy you,\" he said.Mortal Kombat 2 was previously set to hit theaters on October 24 this year before Warner Bros. delayed it at the last minute to May 2026. Director Simon McQuoid said the delay was due to the film being \"a victim of our own success.\"\"Every time people have seen this movie, it's gained momentum,\" the director said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"We've created a massive summer blockbuster, so I think we should all be proud of the fact that Mortal Kombat 2 and the franchise itself is going to kick off next year. Yes, we have to wait, but it's going to feel massive when it comes out.\"The Boys' Karl Urban is the most prominent addition to the cast of Mortal Kombat 2 as the fan-favorite Hollywood actor Johnny Cage. The cast also includes Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade, Ludi Lin as Liu Kang, Adeline Rudolph as Kitana, and Tati Gabrielle as Jade.At New York Comic-Con this month, Warner Bros. announced that it had greenlit Mortal Kombat 3.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

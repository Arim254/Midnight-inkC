    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The city-building RTS Anno 117: Pax Romana had barely been released when sharp-eyed fans noticed the tell-tale signs of AI artwork in one of the loading screens. But rather than deny it, publisher Ubisoft has promised that it will replace the artwork in an upcoming update.The image in question was first spotted by a user on Reddit, as seen below. The scene is set at a Roman banquet, and the background elements and characters feature some common AI mistakes including misshapen faces and bodies that don't line up to human physiology. It may not even be the only AI pic in the game, as Kotaku has pointed out another image that has a pair of Roman senators who are missing their heads.An Ubisoft spokesperson told IGN that the initial version of the banquet art was meant to be replaced in the final version of the game.\"This image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process,\" said the Ubisoft spokesperson. \"The final image ... will replace the current version of this artwork with the upcoming 1.3 patch.\"The updated and revised version of the pic that will be added to Anno 117: Pax Romana.As seen above, the final image appears to be a retouched version of the AI pic. That makes the origin of the picture less obvious. Ubisoft has acknowledged that other AI tools were used for \"for iterations, prototyping, and exploration.\" Regardless, the company stresses that the final version of the game \"reflects the team's craft, artistry, and creative freedom.\"This isn't the only game that's been recently called out over AI. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 apparently used AI to make the game's \"Ghibli-style\" Calling Cards. Activision subsequently acknowledged that some AI was used in the creation of Black Ops 7. Arc Raiders also came under fire for using AI voiceover readings. Congressman Ro Khanna subsequently called for regulation over the use of AI.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In June, Hypixel and its parent company, Riot Games, announced that the Minecraft-inspired adventure game Hytale was canceled after 10 years of development. At that time, Hypixel was set to be shuttered as well. But now, the founders of Hypixel have rescued the studio with plans to finally bring Hytale into early access.Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced the news on social media that his studio has repurchased the rights for Hytale from Riot Games and plans to release it as soon as possible. However, he cautioned fans to temper their expectations as the game remains unpolished. While Collins-Laflamme acknowledged that \"there's a lot of work to be done,\" he added that there will be, \"No more waiting. You'll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won't be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we'll shape it into something truly special.\"We did it. Hytale is saved. We have acquired Hytale from Riot Games.  — Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) November 17, 2025              In a lengthy post on Hytale's official site, Collins-Laflamme noted that he and his Hypixel co-founder Philippe Touchette are co-funding the resurrected Hytale, with Kevin Carstens as the technical lead and Patrick Derbic as the management lead. They also announced that 30 developers who previously worked on Hytale have been hired to return.Collins-Laflamme also revealed that the team is dropping the current Cross-platform Engine build of Hytale because it \"is significantly behind in terms of gameplay\" and it would take years to reach early access. Instead, the team is reverting back to The Legacy Engine build, which is four-years old and significantly further along.Early access is expected to \"last at least a few years,\" as the team doesn't want to rush it through development. Exploration Mode, Creative Mode, and modding will be available at the launch of early access. However, minigames and Adventure Mode will be saved for a later date. The Hypixel founders added that they are committed to funding this project for 10 years, and they are fully independent with no outside investors or publishers. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Cody Perez\n   on November 18, 2025 at 1:52AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Roblox has a near limitless supply of games and experiences for you to check out, including even shooter games. In fact, the finest of the Roblox shooter games are up there with the overall best Roblox games of all time. The best Roblox shooter games include ones for fans of both first-person and third-person entries in the genre alike.Whether you are more on the Battlefield side with intense gameplay and competitive features or you prefer a more survival-focused battle royale experience, there is a shooter game available for you in Roblox. Even those who like the infinite waves of Call of Duty Zombies will find a game to like among the best Roblox shooter games below.HypershotIf you like your FPS action cranked up to the max in every category from speed to gunplay to abilities, Hypershot is the one for you. It is similar in some ways to the most cracked out Call of Duty games you can think of in terms of how fast the characters are able to move around. This is even intensified when you can pick what abilities to have in your customizable loadout, such as speed boosts and high jumps.The beauty of Hypershot comes in how free you are able to play however you like. You don’t feel boxed into one type of gameplay, which is a common issue with a lot of Roblox shooter games. Instead, you can slow things down and be a sniper or sprint in seconds across the surprisingly large maps to be an up-close-and-personal objective player, or anything in between. Hypershot has so many game modes, too, from Capture the Flag to Domination to Gun Game, so it offers some of the best variety.War SimulatorWar Simulator is a strange Roblox shooter game that offers one of the most persistent progression experiences you’ll find. How it works is instead of going into different matches, you are constantly in the same “match.” In some ways, you could almost think of it like a historical MMO.You pick a war period to start out in, such as World War I, and you are able to freely advance through periods of history to take part in battles against bots alongside other players. The more modern the war, the more powerful you will need to be to be able to survive there. This is where the grind comes into play, requiring you to take out enemies in a specific war, master it, upgrade your weapons and armor there, and then advance to the next one to start all over.Thankfully, all of the battlefields are varied and a joy to explore, so the grind never feels that frustrating, especially if you have friends to fight alongside.Tropical RoyaleThese days, the battle royale genre is the name of the game when it comes to the best overall shooter games in existence. Of course, Roblox is no stranger to the genre and the best of the bunch is Tropical Royale. There were games in the past that did extremely well, too, like Island Royale, but they have since died over time.In the case of Tropical Royale, it has an active community with frequent updates and plenty of options for game modes to choose from. The general premise remains the same: fight against other players on a massive map until you or your team are the last ones standing. The gameplay is fast but not too floaty or frustrating and the building mechanics are close enough to the real deal in other games like Fortnite.Zombie UprisingZombie Uprising is for the Call of Duty Zombies fans out there. Taking cues from some of the best examples of round-based zombie games like the original Black Ops, players hop into matches and face off against waves of the undead that grow stronger with each one you survive. The maps even have the various upgrade machines like the classic Pack-a-Punch that will upgrade your abilities and weapons.Fortunately, Zombie Uprising doesn’t just copy Call of Duty Zombies, but it builds upon the basis with some neat quality-of-life features. For one, you aren’t locked to a particular map at the start of the match. Every once in a while, you will be able to vote for a new map to go to for the next wave, which ensures you always have new scenery to check out. Better yet, the progression system is permanent, allowing you to level up, upgrade your loadout, and unlock new guns no matter if you win or lose against the horde.As a side note, it is also one of the best games on this list to play for mobile players, which isn’t usually the case for Roblox FPS games.Combat ArenaCombat Arena feels like one of the most traditional takes on a Call of Duty FPS multiplayer experience. It is highly grounded in its warfare and maps, not allowing the player to move too slow or fast but just right. The gunplay is also fluid enough that it matches some of the time-to-kill of FPS giants like Black Ops 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.The maps are some of the best parts of Combat Arena, as you can tell the developers really put a lot of thought into balancing them well for this more grounded military warfare experience. There are some truly memorable locales that are more enjoyable to play on than the cookie cutter locations in other similar Roblox shooting games.RivalsRivals is a highly specific type of FPS game for a certain type of audience. In some ways, it feels like a mix of the Counter-Strike one life system with a bit more of the fast-paced nature and sliding of a Call of Duty game. The matches in Rivals are all the same: you battle against another team on a map until you eliminate the entire enemy for a round win. First to five round wins takes the match.Rivals can sometimes feel a bit slower than other Roblox shooting games, but this works to its benefit. The pace isn’t breakneck like other games and lets you really focus on what matters the most: aiming and firing in this experience. Thankfully, those mechanics work extremely well, even for mobile players. In fact, Rivals is one of the most welcoming FPS games on Roblox due to even allowing mobile players to only battle against other smartphone users and have a balanced experience.D-DayD-Day is the closest you will find to a Battlefield-style game on Roblox. Focusing mainly on the war between the Allies and the Axis in World War II, each match has you take on one of these sides on a gigantic battlefield. The goal is to fight your way to each flag on the map and capture it to advance your team’s reach until you take over the enemy base and win the match.You will see dozens of players in each match, giving off a truly large-scale competitive war experience that is unlike anything else on Roblox. There are many different classes to pick from, including the Medic that is able to heal other players, and even vehicles you are able to drive to cross the wide open spaces.Phantom ForcesPhantom Forces is one of the oldest Roblox shooting games that still has an active community playing it to this day, and for a good reason. The look and feel of Phantom Forces is more akin to a blocky Counter-Strike but with a bit of a tiny speed boost. The developers behind Phantom Forces, StyLIS, ensure that each gun feels radically different from one another.This is not the type of cracked out game where you are going to be getting hundreds of eliminations per match. Instead, every weapon has its function and place in the meta. The assault rifle is able to deal solid damage from afar but won’t instantly decimate foes. On the other hand, shotguns are noticeably broken up close and can one-shot players. This type of dedication and careful balancing helps Phantom Forces to feel like one of the most professional Roblox FPS experiences.FrontlinesFrontlines is by far the best-looking Roblox shooter game you will find on the entire platform that also happens to play well. Everything from the characters to the guns themselves look ripped right out of a late 2000s FPS title, rather than having the usual cartoony Lego look of most Roblox experiences.The gameplay in Frontlines also happens to match the visual appearance, opting for a generally fast experience with the likes of Call of Duty’s tactical sprint being included. Somehow even with all of the graphical prowess, Frontlines manages to have a high frame rate and performance almost everywhere from smartphones to PC to console, making it well worth a try.Dead RailsDead Rails offers a completely different shooting experience from any other Roblox game here. This Roblox title feels more like a FPS-focused take on the survival game A Dusty Trail than anything else. You start out alone or with friends in a town with a train you use to explore the world. You have to manage the fuel of the train, using coal and the corpses of the undead to replenish it.In practice, this means you’ll have to stop often to find supplies, ammo, and the like to help you on your journey. Unfortunately, the world is full of zombies, so you’ll have to use various weaponry like the Blunderbuss to take them out. The gameplay is a lot slower than other games, but this allows for more precise aiming and movement that is necessary for a survival game like this one. If you want an engaging Call of Duty Zombies-like survival experience that will always have you wanting to go on one more train run, give Dead Rails a look.    \n  \n                      "

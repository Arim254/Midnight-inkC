    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fallout Season 2 is just around the corner, and Amazon Prime Video has largely kept this season's storyline a secret. But there's one thing we can be reasonably certain about: Ella Purnell's Lucy won't be having a romance with Walton Goggins' Ghoul now or ever.During an interview with Geek Culture, Purnell was with Goggins and Aaron Moten when she shot down the very idea of a love affair between Lucy and the Ghoul.\"Here's what I would say: you guys need therapy,\" said Purnell. \"You can't fix him. You can't save him. Let it go. Let it go, hon.\"Goggins expressed surprise at the fan-shipping between Lucy and the Ghoul, while Purnell said she's asked about it all of the time.Following the first season finale, the Ghoul and Lucy are heading for New Vegas. He's looking for the location of his wife and child, while Lucy is searching for her father.Purnell reiterated that Lucy and The Ghoul won't be romantic partners, but she did say that their bond is a \"really beautiful thing\" before adding, \"they're both looking for the people that they love. Let's leave it at that.\"Although Goggins recently lent his voice and likeness as the Ghoul to Fallout '76, he added that he has never played the Fallout video games and doesn't want to.Fallout Season 2 will premiere on December 17 on Prime Video, with new episodes released weekly through February 4, 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Cash is still the ultimate commodity in Grand Theft Auto Online, and Rockstar Games has been known to go out of its way to entice players with in-game currency rewards... sometimes for just logging in. Now, Rockstar is offering $500,000 in game currency to anyone who follows a simple request.To earn the prize, all you have to do is link your Discord account to your Rockstar Games account. Just clicking on this link will take you where you need to be.If you need something to invest all of that cash in, GTA Online's next update--A Safehouse in the Hills--allows players to buy their own missions. A new trailer for that update dropped today, and it revealed the return of Michael De Santa, one of the leading characters from Grand Theft Auto 5. If the footage is any indication, Michael's retirement didn't fully take. Or perhaps he's just very passionate about keeping certain criminal affairs out of his upscale neighborhood.          To get one of these mega mansions for yourself, players will have to strike a deal with the Prix Luxury Real Estate company, which promises \"sprawling grounds, breathtaking views, and first-rate amenities--including the latest in personal assistance and business service technology.\"A Safehouse in the Hills will launch on December 10, and players who opt into a Prix Luxury Black Tier VIP from now through December 7 can grab an Ubermacht Revolter sports car at the Luxury Autos showroom. Players can also advance to the Gold Tier membership by finishing all three New Listings missions, which will reward users with a $1 million bonus of in-game cash, as well as a $2 million discount on one of the luxury estates being offered by Prix Luxury.Earlier this fall, Rockstar added GTA Online to its GTA+ membership service. It's still unclear what will happen to the game after Grand Theft Auto 6 is released in November 2026, but at least one video game analyst has argued that GTA Online is the real cash cow of the franchise.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The Limited Edition Steelbook is up for preorder for $38 at Amazon and Gruv (and $44.25 at Walmart). If you're interested in adding this to your collection at launch, you may want to secure a preorder. The original Steelbook Edition sold out prior to launch, and a second Steelbook Edition did the same. Preorder Five Nights at Freddy's 24K Blu-ray Steelbook -- $384K Blu-ray -- $28Blu-ray -- $23DVD -- $18If you still need to grab a Steelbook Edition of the original, you're in luck: Universal Pictures reprinted last year's version ahead of the sequel's premiere. Five Nights at Freddy's Limited Edition Steelbook launched December 2 and is in stock for $33 (was $35) at Amazon and $30 at Walmart. The reprint released alongside the new Ultimate Collector's Edition, which is exclusive to Amazon and comes with a different steelbook case, a metal poster, and more.

Naturally, Freddy Fazbear nabbed the front cover, while the back cover showcases Withered Foxy. The interior artwork features Chica on the left and Bonnie on the right.We'll update this story once we learn more about the technical specs of the 4K Blu-ray edition as well as a list of special features. Considering the original film supported HDR10 and two surround sound tracks--Dolby Atmos and Dolby TrueHD 7.1--we'd expect the sequel to at least match those specs.The Steelbook and standard 4K Blu-ray editions also come with a 1080p Blu-ray disc and a voucher for the Movies Anywhere digital edition. The 1080p Blu-ray edition also includes a digital copy.                      Five Nights at Freddy's 2 Limited Edition SteelbookFive Nights at Freddy's 2 isn't reviewing well with critics, and that's the kind way of saying it. The sequel is currently sitting at a 13% on the Tomatometer and a 31/100 on GameSpot sister site Metacritic. It's faring better with audiences so far, though. On Rotten Tomatoes, the Popcornmeter is at 88%, which is actually slightly higher than the original. On Metacritic, the sequel has garnered a \"generally favorable\" 6.8/10.To be fair, the 2023 film didn't earn great reviews from critics either, but that didn't stop it from becoming one of the most successful video game adaptations of all time. Five Nights at Freddy's is Blumhouse's biggest box office hit with $291 million worldwide.

Don't worry, Chica didn't lose Cupcake; the little animatronic pastry is on the back of the case.

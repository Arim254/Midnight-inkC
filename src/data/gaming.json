    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Palworld: Official Card Game, a brand-new trading card game based on Pocketpair's creature-collecting game, has been revealed by Bushiroad and developer Pocketpair. While details are light for now, the game already has a launch date penciled in for July 30.Bushiroad describes Palworld: Official Card Game as a two-player competitive card game where players can \"enjoy strategic and tactical battles\" by deploying unique Pals to the battlefield. \"Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory,\" the description reads. Each Pal also has unique traits, and cleverly utilizing them can open up a path to victory.          Rumblings of a Palworld trading card game kicked off last year after Pocketpair and Animate subsidiary COS purchased shares in Japanese card game publisher Bushiroad. Bushiroad Corporation's CEO and president, Takaaki Kidani, sold his shares to the company (via Automaton). This followed Pocketpair's formation of Palworld Entertainment, a new company arm dedicated to maximizing Palworld's merchandising opportunities.Amidst these developments, Pocketpair has found itself involved in a lawsuit against Nintendo over Palworld and several comparisons to the Pokemon franchise, including a cozy spin-off game called Palworld: Palfarm, that looks similar to Pokemon Pokopia. Pocketpair eventually removed some of the Palworld gameplay features that Nintendo objected to.The litigation has become even more complex between the two, following an order from the head of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to reexamine Nintendo's registered patent that \"covers the fundamental gameplay mechanic of summoning a character and letting it fight another\" in a video game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Normally $70, Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. is on sale for $63. Lego's recreation of the iconic Pixar mascot launched last June and has rarely budged from its MSRP. The current discount is the best we've seen for the set, but it's not marked as an official deal. Over the past few weeks, Luxo Jr.'s price on Amazon has sometimes changed multiple times in a single day, so we wouldn't be surprised if the the price has changed again by the time you read this story.                                 Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (613 Pieces)                                                                $63 (was $70)                                                                                                                                                                                    The 613-piece replica of Luxo Jr. measures 5.5 x 4 x 11 inches--though Luxo Jr.'s height varies based on how you pose it. Luxo Jr. can stand next to the buildable Pixar Ball or balance on top of it by making a couple of simple adjustments.Lego designed Luxo Jr. as a fully articulated model capable of being displayed in poses from the iconic Pixar production logo and short film starring the semi-anthropomorphic lamp. The light bulb doesn't actually work, but Lego did a good job of making it look realistic.As a Lego model, Luxo Jr. is quite different than the vast majority of Disney Pixar building sets. Designed for experienced builders and collectors, the model has an interesting build process thanks to its multi-hinged arm, modifiable base, and the many Easter Eggs Lego worked into the authentic recreation.There are dozens of references to Pixar movies hidden throughout the Luxo Jr. and Pixar Ball builds. For instance, the Pizza Planet truck from the first Toy Story movie is included inside the light bulb. The lamp's base has a miniature build referencing Marlin & Dory from Finding Nemo as well as clever allusions to Inside Out, Cars, Coco, WALL-E, A Bug's Life--and possibly others that we missed.The instruction booklet calls out the Finding Nemo character builds as well as the mini-builds found in the Pixar Ball. The interior of the colorful ball features multiple characters from five different Pixar movies:Toy Story - Woody & BuzzUp - Carl & RussellMonsters, Inc. - Mike & SullyThe Incredibles familyRatatouille - Linguini & RemyAs mentioned, one of the display modes is Luxo Jr. \"deflating\" the toy ball, just like in the production logo's animation sequence. Once you remove two of the rounded plates from the ball, Luxo Jr. can connect to the top. It's a quick and easy modification. The Pixar Ball has its own buildable stand, so the model still feels stable with Luxo Jr. on the ball.                      Lego Ideas: Disney Pixar Luxo Jr. (21357)Luxo Jr. was the star of Pixar's first short film in 1986. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short, but most Pixar fans were introduced to the character when it hopped across the screen to complete the Pixar logo at the beginning of Toy Story in 1995. The short film originally only played at film festivals and conventions, but it eventually played in theaters worldwide before screenings of Toy Story 2 in 1999.  Luxo Jr. the building set is a member of the Lego Ideas collection. The original pitch was submitted by a fan back in 2022 and was approved by Lego about two years later in November 2024. As always, the retail edition looks different than the concept images, but the hinges on Luxo Jr.'s arm look quite similar overall.                                                                                                                                               Lego launched a bunch of new Disney building sets on January 1, including a very popular Speed Champions Lightning McQueen race car that has been difficult to find in stock. At the time of writing, the 270-piece set is in stock at Target and Walmart for $28. Fans of Pixar's Cars franchise can also place an order from the Lego Store, but new orders aren't estimated to ship for 60 days.If you love Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Lego's 2,862-piece recreation of Captain Jack Sparrow's Ship is now available at Amazon for $380. The highly detailed model originally launched as a Lego Store exclusive last September, but now you can find it at major retailers. The model measures 25 x 9 x 25 inches and comes with nine Lego minifigures.

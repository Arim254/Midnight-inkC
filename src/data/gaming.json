    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Ratchet & Clank's franchise has been dormant since Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart was released in 2021, but that didn't stop some fans from searching for a game that few remembered. Ratchet & Clank: Clone Home was announced was announced in the mid-2000s as the follow-up to the mobile title Ratchet & Clank: Going Mobile. Although Clone Home was canceled and never officially released, the game has finally been found and a copy has been shared online.The Golden Bolt's YouTube channel (via Engadget) has posted a video detailing the years-long search for Ratchet & Clank: Clone Home. As noted in the video below, several members of the gaming community took part in the search, but college students \"Emily\" and \"Super Gamer Omega Clank\" were credited for finding a Sony Ericsson W880i that had a working copy of Clone Home. Breaking the phone's encryption was the most difficult step, but their efforts paid off.          The title of the game refers to a pair of digital clones of Ratchet and Clank who team up with their counterparts in the real world to foil the plans of Vox, the returning nemesis from Going Mobile. The digital Ratchet and Clank exist in a video game within the game, and the real version of that duo are also transported into the game around halfway through the story.It's believed that Clone Alone was briefly online by mistake before being pulled down. The preserved copy is fully playable, but it's unclear why Clone Home wasn't released. The Golden Bolt believes it was over a possible legal dispute between Sony and Handheld Games, the developer of Going Mobile. He also notes that Clone Home was likely developed by JavaGround, rather than Handheld Games.This isn't the only surprise that fans of the Ratchet & Clank franchise had in 2025. Earlier this year, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart senior designer Grant Parker revealed that he placed a hidden minigame in the title. Although Rift Apart was ported to PC in 2023, there's no word on when or if another sequel will follow.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Battlefield franchise has always been known for its high-quality graphics, and Battlefield 6 is no different. At the launch of Battlefield 6, the game is fairly well-optimized, but it also features plenty of intense graphics that can make a high frame rate difficult to achieve. You'll have to use the absolute best graphics settings if you want to maintain your target frames per second and have a smooth experience. Fortunately, that's where we come in. We'll be listing off every single one of the PC graphics settings in Battlefield 6 and letting you know what you should set each one to. This will not only give you a great-looking game, but it will also allow you to play at a high FPS and get the most out of your PC.Best graphics settings in Battlefield 6To get started with your graphics settings, go to the main menu screen in Battlefield 6 and click on the cog icon at the top of the screen. From here, click the \"Graphics\" section on the left side of the screen.Here, you'll be able to change around all of the general graphics settings, including choosing what resolution you play at and which monitor Battlefield 6 appears on. These settings are going to be more personal for every player, but you can find a list of our best settings for the general graphics menu below:GraphicsGraphics Quality: CustomBrightness: 50-60Sharpness: 75CameraField of View: 110-115Vehicle 3rd Person Field of View: 83Weapon Field of View: WideWorld Motion Blur: 0Weapon Motion Blur: 0Camera Shake Amount: 20Chromatic Aberration: OffVignette: OffFilm Grain: OffDisplayFullscreen Mode: Borderless or FullscreenFullscreen Device: Your preferred monitorFullscreen Resolution: Your preferred resolution from the monitor you're usingAspect Ratio: AutoRefresh Rate: Maximum Hz of your monitorVertical Sync: OffThe main graphics settings menu in Battlefield 6There are other sections further down in the graphics menu, but they only relate to your HUD. Change them as you see fit, but they can be left alone for the most part.Moving on, if you scroll back up to the Graphics section of the menu, you can click on \"GRAPHICS\" to modify each individual setting. This allows you to raise or lower the graphical fidelity of Battlefield 6 by changing settings that have a high or low impact on your PC's performance.You can see a full list of these settings and what they should be set to below:Graphic Settings Texture Quality: HighTexture Filtering: HighMesh Quality: LowTerrain Quality: LowUndergrowth Quality: LowEffects Quality: LowVolumetric Quality: LowLighting Quality: LowLocal Light & Shadow Quality: LowSun Shadow Quality: LowShadow Filtering: PCFReflection Quality: LowScreen Space Reflections: OffPost Processing Quality: LowScreen Space AO & GI: OffHigh Fidelity Objects Amount: MediumCustomizing the individual graphics settingsNaturally, if you want the most frames per second possible, then just set every single setting to its lowest value. Our settings will still give you a decent frame rate, but they also keep your game's graphical fidelity high so you can see objects and enemies more clearly.Finally, back out of the \"GRAPHICS\" settings and look right below the \"Brightness\" and \"Sharpness\" settings in the graphics menu. Here, you'll see an option called \"ADVANCED.\" Click on it and you'll be brought to a new menu where you can change your upscaling and other performance options. Look below for the optimal settings in this menu:Advanced SettingsFixed Resolution Scale: 100Frame Rate Limiter: On and set to your maximum refresh rate (160,144, 240, etc.)Nvidia Reflex Low Latency: Enabled or Enabled + Boost  Use Enabled if your GPU is better than your CPU and use Enabled + Boost if your CPU is better than your GPUUpscaling Technique: DLSS for Nvidia users / FSR for AMD usersUpscaling Quality: Quality for better visuals, Performance/Ultra Performance for the highest FPSNvidia Frame Generation: Off (adds too much input lag)Future Frame Rendering: OffPerformance Overlay: OffGoing through the upscaling options in Battlefield 6Your choice of upscaling depends on your graphics card's brand and whether you want to run Battlefield 6 at a native resolution. You can also run Nvidia Frame Generation if you have a capable RTX GPU, but the added input lag is noticeable, so you'll have to decide if the extra frames are worth it.With that, we've covered every available graphics setting.

Last week it was Soda Jungle Maker, and this week it's Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle. Normally $65, this 738-piece building set is discounted to only $28. Like Soda Jungle Maker, Peach's Castle is retiring soon, so this is likely your last chance to get a massive discount on the set.Amazon has already sold out of this deal once today (November 23), but the deal is back in stock as of 5:55 PM PT.                                 Lego Super Mario: Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (738 Pieces)                                                                $28 (was $65) | Retiring soon                                                                                                                                                                                    Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle comes with three buildable Lego Super Mario figures: Roy, Red Toad, and a Chain Chomp that pulls Roy's sled. It doesn't include Peach, who is only available as an interactive figure in the Super Mario Adventures Starter Set, which is on sale for $40 (was $50).The castle's fold-out walls are destructible, so you can easily refortify your defenses after Chain Chomp crashes into them. Toad can sling projectiles at Roy and Chain Chomp with a built-in catapult atop the castle. If you have Interactive Princess Peach, you can tap the Action Tags on the rotating throne, in the small garden where Toad likes to hang out, and in hidden spots. Tapping an Action Tag plays music and sound effects from the Peach figure's built-in speakers.

Select Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses models are seeing generous discounts for Black Friday 2025. These are all Gen 1 models--so they won't have the extended battery life or upgraded cameras of the Gen 2 models--but they still offer many of the same features as the newer models, including Meta AI support, built-in speakers and camera, and more. While the smart glasses are available in a variety of frames and lens styles, it looks like only the Wayfarer frames are currently getting discounts. You can snag a pair for as low as $239.20 (normally $299) thanks to Amazon's sale.                                 Ray-Ban X Meta Smart Glasses - Wayfarer Frames (Gen 1)                                                                Starts at $239                                                                                                                                                                                    If you're unfamiliar with Meta's collaboration with Ray-Ban, these smart glasses aren't your average pair of frames. Inside its larger arms, you'll find heaps of cool tech that lets you ask Meta AI questions, take photos or videos, or listen to music. You can even ask Meta AI what you're looking at, making the smart glasses a helpful travel companion. The frames are only slightly thicker than those of some typical glasses, so unless someone is looking closely, most won't even realize you have a computer sitting on your head. As for the actual specs, you'll find an ultra-wide 12MP camera, a five-mic system for easy voice recognition, an included charging and travel case, and a built-in button to activate its AI. Any images or footage you capture can also be easily shared on Facebook or Instagram.                      While these AI-powered smart glasses are stylish, they're much simpler compared to AR and VR devices. Those who are interested in something more powerful should also check out Amazon's limited-time Black Friday deals on the Meta Quest 3S VR headset. Amazon has two deals available--the first drops the Mea Quest 3S 128GB model to just $250 (was $300) and includes a $50 Amazon gift card as a free bonus. You can also score the Meta Quest 3S bundle that includes the 256GB model of the headset with a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow and a $49 Amazon Gift Card for just $329 (was $400). These deals are exclusive to Amazon and won't stick around long, so grab them while you can.Meta Quest 3S VR Headset Black Friday Deals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Quest 3S is much bigger than the Ray-Ban AI Smart Glasses, but they're also much more powerful, acting as a complete standalone, wireless VR setup (though you can also plug the headset into your PC or PS5 if you want to play more demanding VR games). If you've been curious about VR gaming but haven't jumped in yet, these bundles are an excellent way to get an affordable VR setup.For more VR and gaming deals, head over to GameSpot's Black Friday 2025 hub.

That's just barely above its all-time low price of $29.53. While Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is focused on Summer Olympic sports, Amazon's 50% discount is a great way to get in the Olympic spirit a few months before the winter event kicks off.                                 Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020                                                                $30 (was $60)                                                                                                                                                                                    Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 features 34 events, a variety of minigames, and both single-player and multiplayer modes. You'll find all the Summer Olympic staples here, taking you from the track to the swimming pool and boxing ring to the archery range. Each event ranges in complexity--most feature easy-to-learn controls, while others, like soccer and rugby, offer more depth and challenge, making this a great minigame collection for players of all skill levels. The roster of playable characters includes familiar faces from both the Sonic and Mario series, including the titular mascots themselves, and friends like Luigi, Tails, Waluigi, Dr. Eggman, and more.                      Our Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 review gave it a 7/10, due to its entertaining events (each with its own gimmick) and unique control schemes that make it easy to find a playstyle that works for just about everyone.\"Mario & Sonic at the Tokyo Olympic Games 2020 is an entertaining take on the sports-event genre that has, by and large, disappeared in the modern-day,\" wrote critic James O'Connor. \"The game aims for accessibility at every opportunity, and while nothing about it is particularly exceptional, it still has plenty of unique flourishes to offer, and the wealth of different events and simple controls make for an appealing casual multiplayer title. Thanks to a generous selection of events and a few neat gimmicks, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is the best entry in this series.\"Amazon is discounting several other Switch exclusives for Black Friday 2025, including hits like Super Mario Odyssey, but the deals are selling out quickly.

Traits are inherent quirks of your character, and you choose them at the start of the campaign. Ideally, you'll want a combination of positive aspects, and perhaps one negative modifier that remains manageable.The best positive and negative traits to pick in The Outer Worlds 2Here's what you need to know about the available traits in the game:There are nine positive traits and three negative traits.You can start the game with just one positive trait and leave it at that. However, if you choose two positive traits, you're required to take one negative trait as a drawback.Ensure that you make the right decision that supports your playstyle. You won't be able to respec your character outside of one instance after the prologue.List of positive traitsThese are the positive traits in The Outer Worlds 2:Brawny - Sliding or sprinting into enemies knocks them down; has a five-second cooldown.Brilliant - Specialize in one additional skill--i.e. start the game with +2 points in that skill.Heroic - Reduces companion ability charge time by -20%.Innovative - Create up to twice as many ammo, throwables, and resources when crafting.Lucky - Gain +5% critical hit chance; certain opportunities become available to you.Nimble - Gain +25% crouch speed and +25% combat sprint speed.Resilient - Death is prevented for three seconds the first time you take fatal damage in each combat encounter.Suave - Gain a 10% discount when buying from vendors; bounty must be two times higher than normal to be considered an outlaw.Witty - Your reputation with any faction will never drop below neutral level.List of negative traitsAs mentioned earlier, you have to pick a negative trait if you select two positive traits. Here are your options:Abrasive - Your reputation with any faction can never increase above neutral.Dumb - During skill selection, lock five of the 12 available skills. You can never allocate points into these skills.Sickly - Reduces base health by -15%; reduces toxicity crash threshold by -15.Best traits comboWhile it's recommended to just play the game with only one positive trait, it's really viable to pick two along with a negative effect. If that's to your liking, then we recommend the following combo:Positive traits: Brilliant and LuckyNegative trait: Dumb or SicklyBrilliant essentially grants a bonus skill point, which is great since you'll ideally specialize in at least three skills anyway. Lucky, meanwhile, grants additional options when progressing through the campaign. Perhaps the most noteworthy early in the game involves the decision to crash the Vox Relay facility.As for the negative traits, Dumb locks you out of certain options, but you probably won't be using the vast majority of other skills anyway. Sickly is another decent choice, as long as you can avoid taking the brunt of the damage from enemies. We definitely don't recommend Abrasive since more opportunities and benefits become available the higher your reputation with a faction, and Abrasive becomes a huge detriment to that.In any case, that does it for our tips on the best traits in The Outer Worlds 2. Since we're talking about how to properly build your character, you can also head over to our best skills guideand best flaws guide.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on October 29, 2025 at 10:42AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Just like in Battlefield 6 multiplayer, weapons play a massive role in the world of Redsec. Even if you manage to position yourself perfectly and hit every shot with pinpoint accuracy, an enemy with a stronger weapon than you has the advantage in most scenarios. While you can't always avoid the weapon you're using, you can ensure you eventually equip a powerful gun through the loadouts system. That's just one of our Redsec tips you should know.You can use your custom loadouts in Redsec by opening custom weapon drops, which fall onto the Fort Lyndon map at random times during a match or can be earned by completing missions that your squad activates. In any case, when you go to create the loadouts that will be available from a Custom Weapon Drop, you want to ensure you're using the strongest guns with the best attachments.Below, we have five of the top weapons and loadouts you can equip in Season 1 of Battlefield Redsec. As time goes on, new loadouts will take over the meta, but this is what's dominating the community shortly after the launch of the battle royale.SOR-556 MK2The SOR-556 MK2, being one of the dominant assault rifles and overall weapons in Redsec, doesn't come as a big surprise to anyone who's used the gun in Battlefield 6 multiplayer. Featuring an outstanding damage profile, virtually no recoil, and a steady fire rate, the SOR-556 MK2 dominates at mid-long range on the map of Fort Lyndon. While you'll struggle at close range with it, the same can be said for most other long-range weapons as well.Here's the best loadout for the SOR-556 MK2 in Redsec:Muzzle: Standard SuppressorBarrel: 14.5\" FactoryRight Accessory: 50 MW BlueUnderbarrel: Ribbed StubbyMagazine: 30 RND MagazineScope: 3VZR 1.75xPSRIt wouldn't be a traditional battle royale if there weren't a dominant sniper rifle that every squad used. Redsec's top sniper so far has been the PSR, which has quite the unlock method that requires you to complete a variety of sniper challenges. However, once you unlock the PSR and level it up, it becomes a truly formidable weapon if you can manage to hit upper-body shots.Here's the best loadout for the PSR in Redsec:Muzzle: Long SuppressorBarrel: 27\" MK22Left Accessory: Range FinderUnderbarrel: Full AngledMagazine: 7 RND MagazineAmmunition: Match GradeScope: S-VPS 6.00XOptic Accessory: Anti-Glare CoatingPW5A3Next up is an SMG, the PW5A3. While it might not seem too viable to use a close-range weapon on such a large map, the PW5A3 is much different from the rest of its class. The SMG has practically zero recoil when you equip it with the right attachments, and it can melt enemies at close-mid range with its high fire rate. Naturally, with how much long-range fighting you do on Fort Lyndon, you'll want to try and pair the PW5A3 with a rifle of some kind, but even without one of those, this SMG can hold its own.Here's the best loadout for the PW5A3 in Redsec:Muzzle: Standard SuppressorBarrel: 245MM CustomUnderbarrel: Canted StubbyMagazine: 40 RND MagazineAmmunition: FMJScope: Iron SightsM250The light machine gun weapon class has certainly made itself known early on in Redsec, as there are multiple solid options you can use for your Support loadout. However, the best so far is the M250, which is a traditional LMG that features very little recoil and incredible damage. While you will have to account for more bloom when using an LMG compared to an assault rifle or SMG, the M250 manages it fairly well. Here's the best loadout for the M250 in Redsec:Muzzle: Lightened SuppressorBarrel: 556MM PrototypeUnderbarrel: Ribbed StubbyMagazine: 50 RND Belt PouchAmmunition: Hollow PointScope: RO-M 1.75xSVDMOur final weapon and loadout is a highly underrated choice so far in Redsec, but we have a feeling it's going to break into the meta once more players unlock the weapon and start using it. The weapon we're choosing is the SVDM, which is a marksman rifle that can drop fully-armored enemies in just a few shots with the right attachments. It's a single-shot weapon, so you need to have a fast trigger finger, but once you get used to the SVDM, you'll have an armor shredder on your hands. Here's the best loadout for the SVDM in Redsec:Muzzle: Standard SuppressorBarrel: 620MM ClassicMagazine: 20 RND MagazineAmmunition: FMJErgonomics: Improved Match CatchScope: R4T 2.00X    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 29, 2025 at 12:47PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Are you thinking twice about whether you should side with Milverstreet or Kaur in The Outer Worlds 2? These two characters both lead their contingents in the town of Fairfield, but they just can't get along. That said, the person that you support will also assist you as you make your way to the Vox Relay. Our guide has all the details, but be forewarned that there are minor spoilers ahead.The Saboteur of Paradise quest guideBefore we get to the meat and potatoes, here's a quick summary on what you can expect when dealing with Milverstreet and Kaur:An early-game main quest called \"The Saboteur of Paradise\" tasks you with entering the Vox Relay. You can approach this objective through various means, including general exploration. However, it's also possible to gain help from the aforementioned NPCs.Minister Milverstreet and Acquisitions Officer Kaur are both inside the large building in Fairfield. They're members of the Auntie's Choice faction, but they have different preferences when it comes to solving their dilemmas. Milverstreet prefers subterfuge and a more conniving approach. Kaur, meanwhile, wants direct, in-your-face combat.You can talk to Milverstreet first and say that you'll think about his offer. Then, you can talk to Kaur to hear her out. Once you've made up your mind, talk to the NPC that you want to support to begin their quest chain. This locks you out of the other NPC's side missions and rewards.You need to make a major decision upon reaching the end of the Vox Relay. This can lead to a drastic outcome that affects both Milverstreet and Kaur, as well as other inhabitants of Fairfield.Minister Milverstreet's quests and rewardsIf you choose to side with Milverstreet instead of Kaur in The Outer Worlds 2, then you have to complete the following tasks:Quest 1: \"A Refreshing Bit of News\" - This takes place in the Ministry of Accuracy to the west of Fairfield. You need to find information about a certain \"Mental Refreshment.\" Take note that a recruitable companion, Inez Silang, can also be found in the Ministry of Accuracy.Quest 2: \"The Brain Benders of Auntie's Choice\"- Milverstreet wants you to convince the townsfolk of Westport to relocate to Fairfield. Note that there's another side quest called \"The Saga of Malfunctioning Mechanicals\" that you might want to tackle.Once you've completed the second quest, Milverstreet finally relents with his part of the deal. He'll then whisk you away to the Vox Relay to continue with the main quest. As far as rewards go:The first quest nets you the Topmost Coat. It looks snazzy but it's just a regular item.The second quest nets you the Limited Edition Gentleperson's Oxonian. This is one of several unique helmets in the game. Its mod, Marketing Manager, causes companion abilities to charge +10% faster. The effect scales up to 30% based on your Speech skill.Officer Kaur's quests and rewardsConversely, siding with Kaur instead of Milverstreet in The Outer Worlds 2 leads you to other locations:Quest 1: \"Above and Beyond Repair\" - The goal is to head to the Euphoria Coast Automech Repair Center.  If you're unable to gain access to the facility even via skill checks, then you still need to visit the Ministry of Accuracy to obtain a gate pass.The Automech Repair Center is also where you can acquire the Gas Energy Deflection Apparatus. Just like other gadgets in the game, it consumes energy when activated. But it does have a nifty effect, since it allows you to pass through Zyronium gas clouds and poison fields.As for the quest itself, you can either sabotage the facility or help the soldiers. We recommend choosing a peaceful route just to obtain additional items.Quest 2: \"Ascent in the Howling Tower\" - Next up, Kaur will send you to Skycutter A102, which is north of the Ministry of Accuracy. Initially, you'll climb on ladders since the lift isn't working. Then, upon reaching deck 6, you'll be able to call on the lift, though it also causes numerous Raptidons to spawn. Upon reaching the outer walkway, you can fire a pulse that destroys most of the mechs in the Vox Relay.In terms of rewards, here's what you'll get if you buddied up with Kaur:You'll receive Kaur's Kuirass after finishing the first quest. This is a unique armor that has the Adrenaline Shot mod--i.e. Reduce toxicity levels by -1 whenever you take damage. This effect scales based on your Medical skill.Continuing that trend, you'll obtain the Kaur's Korroder after completing the second quest. This is a unique weapon that has the Infection mod--i.e. Goo projectiles bounce off surfaces and apply a Corrosion effect. The spread is improved based on your Science skill.But wait, what about Inez Silang?As mentioned earlier, Inez does show up in the Ministry of Accuracy. You're bound to meet her if you're doing Milverstreet's first quest. Alternatively, if you sided with Kaur and you need an access card to enter the Automech Repair Center, then you'll be heading to the Ministry of Accuracy anyway.What's important is this: After you talk to talk to Inez, she'll say that she's going back to Fairfield. Complete the main objective in the ministry, then fast travel back to Fairfield. You'll see Inez accosting Milverstreet for short-changing her. Choose non-antagonistic dialogue responses when talking to Inez. She'll then move near the entrance, where you can recruit her as a companion.The point-of-no-return in FairfieldWhether you sided with Milverstreet or Kaur in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll still end up in the Vox Relay sooner or later. The pivotal moment that we cited takes place after you defeat a boss named Brigadier Montelli. In the next room, you suddenly learn that the Vox Relay is about to launch. You have to redirect its flight so that it crashes elsewhere.This is important: If the Vox Relay crashes into Fairfield, then all the inhabitants, including Milverstreet and Kaur, will die. If you weren't able to recruit Inez earlier, then she'll perish as well. Your only recourse is to either send the facility crashing into Westport or have it explode in space. If you want to learn about all the options and ramifications, then you can head over to our Vox Relay guide.Black market smugglers? Autocratic regimes? Rampaging Raptidons? Invisible cultists that can only be seen if you wear special goggles? These shenanigans need not cause any alarm because we've got you covered in our The Outer Worlds 2 guides hub.    \n  \n                      "

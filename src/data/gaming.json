    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                After giving everyone a free Juice WRLD skin a year ago, Fortnite is once again offering a free licensed skin to mark the start of a new chapter. Anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 at 6 AM PT and December 1 at 6 AM PT will receive a skin based on Yuki Yubari, a character from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill who didn't make the final cut of the movie when it was originally released.This Yuki Yubari skin is free to anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 and December 1.Back when Tarantino wrote his massive two-part epic Kill Bill, it included an additional sequence that was cut before filming, in which Yuki seeks revenge for the death of her sister Gogo, whom The Bride had killed during the battle at the House of Blue Leaves. Yuki finally sees the light of day in Fortnite Chapter 7, apparently.The Yuki Yubari skin is not actually in the Fortnite game files yet, so you won't be granted the skin until after Chapter 7 begins on November 29. Yuki is one of at least three Kill Bill-related skins coming to Fortnite in Chapter 7. The Bride herself will be included in the Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass, and a skin based on Gogo Yubari will be sold in the item shop--and you can also earn it by purchasing a ticket in advance for a showing of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair during its opening weekend.With Chapter 7 arriving imminently, that means it's almost time for the Chapter 6 finale live event--which will go down on Saturday, November 29 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                You probably know Jeon Jung-kook as the youngest member of the South Korean boy band BTS, but now that he's been discharged from his mandatory military service, the singer has taken on a new venture: livestreaming some video games.Don't worry: The vocalist isn't done putting his pipes on display, as the BTS boys will be back with a new album in early 2026. However, to fill the time and relax for a while, Jung-kook decided to partake in some livestreaming on the South Korean app Weverse, which saw him go live for multiple consecutive days in a row to play some games with and sing some songs to viewers.His game choices were quite eclectic. Fans wanted Jung-kook to check out games like Roblox (which he said he thinks he's heard of) and Outlast (which he claimed was too scary), but instead, he opted for the cute platformer Party Animals and the multiplayer racer Up N' Down. He didn't shy away from the frights entirely, though, as he did play the first-person survival-horror indie Escape the Backrooms and the first-person horror mystery Poppy Playtime. And of course, he got some shooty-shooty-bang-bang in there as well, booting up and getting some time with Arc Raiders and Overwatch 2.Overall, his streams--with one of his longest running from October 27 to November 3--attracted millions of viewers and saw him discuss his astigmatism and reportedly play games with fellow BTS member Kim Seok-jin. Here's a collection of all the games Jung-kook has livestreamed recently."

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                This may be the winter of discontent for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players. Activision has been notably quiet about the game's sales, and has yet to share metrics or statistics. There's also been an uptick in anger from fans over conspiracy issues related to the game's Skill-Based Matchmaking mode. That's led Charlie Olson--the creator of CoD's SBMM--to directly address some of those concerns himself.OIson--who spent a decade at Raven Software under Activision--shared a lengthy video on his YouTube channel that dives into how his SBMM is supposed to work. He also took the time to explain why Activision's announcement about bringing \"open matchmaking\" to Black Ops 7 didn't mean the game was dropping SBMM. If fans were expecting the chance to cut down inexperienced or casual players, they've been disappointed. Olson argues that it means the game has been dominated by \"sweats,\" or experienced players, rather than rookie players.\"Some players are leaving because they thought this tweet meant SBMM had been completely removed from the game, and then they felt betrayed by the inclusion of one standard matchmaking playlist, and then blamed it for stealing 'fodder' from the open playlist,\" explained Olson. \"What's really going on here is there aren't enough casual players at launch to make open matchmaking the pubstomp that was expected or promise. If open lobbies are sweaty, it's because it's mostly sweats playing.\"He added that casual players are sticking with the modes they're comfortable with, and suggested players try open TDM playlists \"if you're looking for noobs to stomp.\"Olson went on to say that the \"sweaty\" open lobbies, longer wait times, degraded connections \"are just trade-offs from bringing back persistent lobbies for launch, assuming they don’t want low-pop playlists to starve.\" He also predicted that the game's players will \"get sweatier\" and that he believes the game will mirror the cratering numbers of XDefiant. Olson even held out the possibility that Activision may switch to a two-year model for Call of Duty, rather rushing a new game out every year.Black Ops 7 received a small update for its Endgame content this week, which also added disconnection protection. Activision has announced the BlackCell DLC is coming during Season 1. It may need the boost, because physical sales from Black Ops 7's international launch are down, although it remains to be seen how Game Pass might factor in. There's a real possibility that Battlefield 6 may become one of the few shooters to out-sell Call of Duty in the last two decades. For now, it's too soon to say if that will actually happen.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

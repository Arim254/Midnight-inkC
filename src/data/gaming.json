    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Meta has shut down three of Oculus Studios' internal developers, new reporting has revealed. Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studio have all been impacted.Outlets suchs as The New York Times indicated that cuts were coming to Meta's Reality Labs business, which encompasses first-party VR game development. On Tuesday, developers from the three aforementioned studios posted on X and other social media websites, indicating that they had lost their jobs. UploadVR confirmed that the entirety of Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studios were impacted as part of this round of Meta layoffs. In a statement to Polygon, Meta's Tracy Clayton says these cuts were made so the company could focus on Wearables like its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. It's a significant gutting that massively reduces Meta's AAA first-party development capabilities for its Quest headsets. All three studios shut down today are also quite well known, and had storied histories prior their their acquisitions by Meta.Twisted Pixel Games initially gained fame thanks to Xbox Live Arcade titles like 'Splosion Man and Comic Jumper: The Adventures of Captain Smiley. It had worked on VR games for the past decade, just releasing Marvel's Deadpool VR in November 2025.Sanzaru Games was the studio behind Asgard's Wrath 2, which was a free pack-in title for the Meta Quest 3. Before that, it worked on the original Asgard's Wrath in VR and some Sony 3D platformer spin-offs like Secret Agent Clank and Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time.Finally, Armature Studio was founded by former Retro Studios developers and is best known for the Xbox One console exclusive ReCore. Its most recent game was an impressive VR port of Resident Evil 4 in 2021.As it stands, Beat Saber developer Beat Games and Batman: Arkham Shadow developer Camouflaj are still in operation, so Meta's first-party development capabilities aren't completely gone. Still, it's a heavy blow to VR game development as Meta is the most prominent player in the virtual reality space. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Nearly a decade on from launch, Pokemon Go continues to add new features and quality-of-life improvements. Following the big leveling revamp back in October, the game has now introduced another highly requested feature: Remote Trades.Just as Remote Raids allow you to participate in a Raid Battle from anywhere in the world, Remote Trades allow you to exchange Pokemon with another player, regardless of where you both are. However, the feature comes with a few caveats, most notable among them being that it's locked behind a new friendship level called Forever Friends.Here's everything you need to know about Remote Trades, including how it works, what Pokemon are ineligible, and how to become Forever Friends with another player.What Is Remote Trading?As the name indicates, Remote Trades allow you to exchange Pokemon with a friend anywhere around the world. This is a significant addition to the game, as up until now, you could only trade Pokemon with another player in person. Not only is this a much more convenient way to exchange monsters, but it also makes it easier to get Pokemon that are typically only available in specific regions, such as Farfetch'd and Mr. Mime.Remote Trades do come with a few restrictions, however. Unlike in-person trades, you must first go through your collection and tag Pokemon that you're willing to trade remotely. Moreover, Remote Trades are restricted to Forever Friends: a new friendship level that's above Best Friends. This means you'll need to level up your friendship with another player before you can start trading remotely.How To Become Forever FriendsClearly, these two are Forever Friends.With the arrival of Remote Trades, Pokemon Go has introduced a new, higher friendship level called Forever Friends. To become Forever Friends with another player, you must earn friendship points, which are awarded when you complete enough activities and interactions together.You can earn up to one friendship point with another player each day by doing certain activities, such as sending and opening gifts, trading Pokemon, and battling in raids together. You can also complete new weekly challenges with other players to earn further friendship points.How To Trade RemotelyOnce you've earned enough friendship points and become Forever Friends with another player, you'll be able to trade Pokemon remotely. However, the process works a little differently than standard trades.First, you must go through your list of Pokemon and use a special Remote Trade tag to mark the ones you're willing to trade. Once you're ready to begin a trade, both players will go through each other's tagged Pokemon and select up to three that they'd like to receive. Each player will then choose one of the three requested Pokemon to send over.Adding a further wrinkle to the feature, you'll only have one Remote Trade available with a friend at a time. After you've used that Remote Trade, you'll need to accumulate friendship points again with that player before you can earn another Remote Trade.Ineligible PokemonAs mentioned, not every Pokemon is eligible for remote trading. You cannot exchange any Pokemon you've recently caught, nor can you trade special monsters like Shadow or Mythical Pokemon, which does put some limits on the feature. That said, Remote Trades are not considered to be Special Trades, regardless of which Pokemon you exchange, so they won't count toward your daily Special Trade limit.Here's the full list of Pokemon that can't be traded remotely:Pokemon caught in the past 30 daysPreviously traded PokemonShadow PokemonMythical PokemonPokemon defending Gyms or Power SpotsPokemon that are set as your buddyPokemon that are actively Mega-EvolvedFused PokemonCrowned Sword Zacian or Crowned Shield ZamazentaPokemon placed at Pokemon PlaygroundsRemote Trades arrive in the middle of Pokemon Go's Precious Paths season, which rolls on this month with a variety of different events and activities.

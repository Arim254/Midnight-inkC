This information was disclosed on the game's Steam page, but also applies to the console editions.Once the servers go dark, \"all game functions requiring online servers will no longer function.\"2K Sports actually first confirmed the server shutdown on December 8, but it wasn't widely reported on until more recently. The game's offline modes like Play Now and Showcase will remain available after the servers go dark.All virtual currency, along with DLC and add-ons, will be removed from sale on January 31, 2026, along with the game itself, as mentioned.WWE 2K24 was released in March 2024, so the servers will have been online for about two years. The impending closure is a bummer for people who want to keep playing online, but this kind of thing is not uncommon in the world of sports games and beyond, for 2K and other publishers.In September this year, 2K shut off the online servers for The Golf Club 2019 and PGA Tour 2K21. The newest WWE 2K game, WWE 2K25, was released in March 2025.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

In its place, indie-darling Blue Prince was declared the new Game of the Year winner. Now, publisher Raw Fury wants to make sure everyone knows that Blue Prince wasn't made with AI of any kind.In a statement released on X, Raw Fury credited Tonda Ros and his team for a game that \"was built and crafted with full human instinct ... It is the result of eight years of development [fueled] by imagination and creativity, and we are extremely proud of what Tonda has achieved.\"For people that need confirmation: There is no AI used in Blue Prince.

Jones, a man who is set to inherit a mysterious mansion called the Mt. Holly Estate following the death of his great uncle Herbert S. Sinclair. There are 45 rooms known to be in the mansion, and Simon has to find the hidden 46th room in order to claim his inheritance. However, the layout of the mansion changes each night, and Simon largely has to start from scratch if he can't find it in time.The game also allows Simon to investigate mysteries that are more closely linked to his own past than he initially suspects. Not every mystery in the game is solved, but that only adds to the emotional impact of the entire narrative. Blue Prince was also one of 2025's best-reviewed games.In May, Ros was very clear that Blue Prince will not receive any DLC or expansions in the future.\"It had always been my dream to release a definitive version of the game at launch,\" wrote Ros. \"I'm a big fan of complete standalone experiences and it was never my plan to continually tinker with the game with regular content updates, room rebalancing, or DLC and the like.\"Blue Prince is out now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Season 1's battle pass includes over a hundred items to earn across free and premium tiers. This content includes two more guns, a new operator, and plenty of cosmetic items to earn. Season 1 also changes how players unlock items in the battle pass to make it more rewarding.Purchasing the standard ($10) battle pass for Season 1 includes an instant operator unlock for Dorne, who is the season's newest operator for the Guild faction. Call of Duty's $30 BlackCell pass returns with plenty of bonus content and battle-pass tier skips. Season 1's new BlackCell operator is called Scorn, who is clad in full-body armor.The two weapons in the Season 1 battle pass are the Kogot-7 submachine gun, and the fan-favorite Maddox assault rifle from Black Ops 4 returns as the Maddox RFB. Just like previous seasons, these new DLC weapons are unlocked in the free tiers of the pass.The developer says the studio has \"taken learnings\" from Black Ops 6's battle pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey for players. Earlier pages in the Black Ops 7 battle pass can now be completed faster with fewer tiers needed to unlock the more desirable HVT content, while later pages will contain more rewards. This means players will earn more high-value content sooner across all 100 tiers.Additionally, players can now earn battle pass tokens by completing daily challenges. These challenges will be available across multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, Co-op campaign, and Endgame.All of these new battle pass rewards can be seen in the gallery below. The images also include Season 1's new shop bundles, including a new operator bundle for David Mason and skins for the Call of Duty League.Dorne instant operator unlockAlden Dorne is part of  The Guild and Emma Kagan's right-hand man. He's instantly unlocked by purchasing the premium battle pass.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                A handful of new Mega-Evolved Pokemon are making their debut in Pokemon Legends: Z-A's upcoming Mega Dimension DLC, and ahead of the expansion's launch, The Pokemon Company has revealed another new one: a second Mega Evolution for Lucario.Mega Lucario Z marks the game's first Z Mega Evolution--a new kind of Mega-Evolved form that has a shorter cooldown period, but depletes Mega Energy much more quickly. According to the official Pokemon website, \"Pokemon that undergo Z Mega Evolution require less time to fire off moves after receiving the orders from their Trainer, but they also burn through their Mega Power very quickly, making them less suited for long battles.\"          Like the original Mega Lucario, Mega Lucario Z is a steel and fighting type. Where this form differs, however, is in its defense and speed stats. As the official Pokemon website explains, \"While Mega Lucario concentrates its aura into a destructive force, Mega Lucario Z uses it to surround its entire body, cloaking itself to increase its defense, flexibility, and agility.\"It's unclear how many other Pokemon will be able to undergo Z Mega Evolution, but we've already gotten a look at several new Mega-Evolved forms coming in the Mega Dimension DLC. In addition to Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y, the DLC will introduce Mega Evolutions for Baxcalibur, Chimecho, and the mythical Pokemon Zeraora.Pokemon Legends: Z-A's Mega Dimension DLC launches on December 10 and costs $30. The expansion takes players to an alternate dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose, where they'll encounter Pokemon not normally available in the base game, including wild Pokemon that are over level 100.In the meantime, Pokemon Legends: Z-A's third Ranked Battle season is underway until December 17. Players who hit Rank S before the season ends will receive a Mega Stone for Chestnaught. A new Mystery Gift is also now available. All players can claim a free Mewtwonite X and Mewtwonite Y, which will unlock a new side quest that leads to an encounter with the legendary Pokemon Mewtwo.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

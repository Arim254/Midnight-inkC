Normally $499, the Luma Pro XR Glasses are discounted to $424 for a limited time. In addition to saving $75, you'll also get a free Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Bluetooth Controller with a translucent black color scheme. Once you add the Luma Pro XR and 8BitDo Ultimate 2C to your cart, you'll see an extra $39 promotion discount at checkout. Amazon is also offering a great deal on the Viture Pro Mobile Dock that drops the price to $99 (was $129). As an added bonus, you'll get the official Mobile Dock Mount for Switch or Switch 2 for free ($19 value). You need the Mobile Dock to connect the glasses to Nintendo Switch 1/2.If you don't want to spend quite that much, the standard Viture Luma XR Glasses are discounted to $359 (was $400) and come with a free translucent clear 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Controller. For a detailed comparison between the Luma and Luma Pro, check out this chart on Viture's official website.If you're unfamiliar with XR technology, Viture XR Glasses are essentially wearable projectors. The Luma Pro XR creates a 152-inch 1200p display, and the Luma XR has a 146-inch 1200p display. Both models boast 120Hz refresh rates. You can connect the glasses to your PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet, or game console to play games, watch movies, or get some work done. The glasses are plug-and-play on PC/Mac, tablets, smartphones, Steam Deck, and Windows handhelds. With Viture's free Spacewalker desktop and mobile app, you can use your smartphone as a hub and set up three smaller displays instead of the one large screen.                                                                                                       Viture Luma Pro XR Glasses                                                                $424 (was $499) | Free 8BitDo Ultimate 2C                                                                                                                                                                                    Viture says the 152-inch 1200p simulated display is 50% sharper picture than the Pro XR. I have used both models, and the technological leap forward is certainly noticeable, especially if you want to use your XR glasses for productivity in addition to gaming and entertainment.The Viture Luma Pro XR Glasses are markedly better for reading and writing compared to previous models. The 52-degree field of view is easier on the eyes than the Pro's 46-degree FOV, and the enhanced brightness helps with focusing on small points of interest like letters and numbers. Multi-screen support via Spacewalker includes the ability to rotate the display from horizontal to vertical orientation. It also has a screen mode designed specifically for programmers.Electrochromic film on the lenses keeps your screen private from those around you. The lenses do a great job of blocking out glare, allowing you to use them comfortably in different environments.The built-in speakers are better on the Luma Pro thanks to a redesign by the engineers at Harman Audio.The Luma Pro XR comes in regular and large sizes, both of which have translucent black frames. Adjustments can be made to the fit by bending the arms, swapping the magnetic nose pads, and tilting the temples. It also has a myopia adjustment dial for users with corrective vision.As mentioned, you'll also get the translucent black Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Bluetooth Controller for free with the glasses. The Ultimate 2C is compatible with Switch, Switch 2, PC, and mobile devices. It has Hall Effect sticks and two extra remappable shoulder buttons.If you game on an Android smartphone, you should also check out the Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller, which is on sale for $59 (was $79). The controller connects to your phone via USB-C, turning it into a Switch-like handheld. The Ultimate Mobile Controller has two back buttons, Hall Effect sticks, and Hall Effect triggers.                                                                                                                            Viture Pro Mobile Dock                                                                $99 (was $129) | Free Switch or Switch 2 Mount                                                                                                                                                                                    The Viture Pro Mobile Dock is a hybrid USB-C hub and battery pack, so it's useful for extending the range on home devices while also improving the battery life of mobile devices and handhelds that are connected to the glasses. To be clear, the Pro Mobile Dock is required to use the Viture Pro XR Glasses on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 consoles. The Mobile Dock is discounted to $99 (was $129). As mentioned, the $30 discount is just one part of the deal. You can grab the official Switch or Switch 2 mount for free with your purchase. Just make sure you choose the right model. The Switch 2 Mobile Dock Mount is only compatible with Switch 2. The Switch Mobile Dock Mount only works with Switch and Switch OLED. If for some reason you aren't eligible for the freebie, the mounts are discounted to $15.20 (was $19).Since you could just place the Mobile Dock on your lap or a nearby surface, the mount is technically optional. That said, we'd highly recommend using the mount, especially if you plan on traveling with your Viture glasses and Mobile Dock.The Mobile Dock is only required for Nintendo Switch 1/2. Handheld Windows PC and Steam Deck users should strongly consider grabbing the Mobile Dock for the battery benefits. And unless you always sit very close to your PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, using the glasses without the Mobile Dock will be a challenge. The same goes for desktop PC players.

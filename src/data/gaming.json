    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Steven T. Wright\n   and \n    Phil Owen\n   on December 22, 2025 at 12:39PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                What makes a bad Fortnite skin? There's no objective measure, certainly. After eight years and more than 2,000 skins, Fortnite's library of character skins has something for just about everybody. Since there's so much variety and so many different styles of skins, it would be silly to make this list of the worst Fortnite skin be focused on skins we simply think are ugly. Instead, we'll focus on other criteria--like if a skin is boring, a cheap cash grab, or broken in some way. Let's take a look.Apprentice ReyWhen it was revealed that Fortnite would hold a Star Wars mini-season in May 2025, fans were excited to see the new skins that would be coming to the battle pass and the item shop. And while most of the skins were great picks, it was a little baffling that the final new skin of the season was Apprentice Rey. Apprentice Rey had two style options: grey version of the existing Rey skin, and Sith Rey--who appeared for about half a second in everyone's least favorite Star Wars move. It was a weird move when there are still plenty of well liked Star Wars characters that have never had a Fortnite skin at all. -POCrackshotAt first glance, Fortnite's Nutcracker skin is pretty decent. But if you look closer, you'll realize that this is just a Chapter 1 default character with a Nutcracker helmet, whose clothes were painted Nutcracker colors. Since this skin was released in Fortnite's very first season, we might be willing to cut them a little slack on this one--but not until they drop a new, more legit Nutcracker skin. -PODoom 2099Fortnite celebrated the launch of Marvel Rivals by selling this pretty hideous Doctor Doom skin. This thing is much uglier than the previous Doom skins, and also it's bulky in ways that make it irritating to play with. Shoulder pads that stick that far out on a skin this enormous? Forget about it. -POFrankenstein's BrideYears before Quentin Tarantino ever considered making a Fortnite movie, Epic collaborated with Universal Monsters to make what was supposed to be a series of short films about the adventures of a new, Fortnite-original Bride of Frankenstein. The first short film was pretty good, but the design of the character was pretty bland and didn't feel much like any version of the character anybody had any affection for. And then they never released any more shorts, and this skin was largely forgotten. -POLexaWhile more recent versions of Lexa have been popular, the original cel shaded Lexa is a horror show that's been giving Fortnite kids nightmares for most of the past decade. Her weird red eyes are particularly haunting. -POMidas RexIn a vacuum, this is a perfectly OK new Midas skin. But when you're dropping $30 on a pack of DC Comics skins, it's pretty annoying to see this guy in there instead of a character from DC Comics. This isn't even a mashup skin--Midas Rex is just an unrelated guy taking up space in a very expensive pack. And to make things even worse, this is the only Midas who doesn't have the Midas Touch effect that makes every gun you pick up gold. So it's not even a good Midas. -PONolan ChanceThis guy, who was the main character on the heist-themed Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass, looks like somebody decided to reboot Ocean's 11 with Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins taking over the lead role from George Clooney. There is nobody on Earth who wants that, except maybe Ninja himself, so this skin is best sent to the archive. -POCarmine RossoThere have been some great skins to come from Lego passes, like Andy Fangerson and Chewbacca. And then there have been some that were not so great, like this lady who's wearing a red-painted version of the Chapter 2 default outfit.MincemeatThis isn't a ranked list, but if it were, this would be number one with a bullet. Mincemeat is not only one of the worst skins in Fortnite, but one of the strangest character designs in a video game in the past few years. While I have to give Epic credit for creativity when it comes to this concept--a terrifying pie man straight out of a horror movie--perhaps there's a reason that no other game thought to feature a skin like this. I appreciate Epic sticking with the Halloween theme, but this confection is ugly and unappealing, and only good for scaring your younger relatives.Fabio SparklemanePerhaps the most controversial selection on this list, Fabio Sparklemane has divided Fortnite players for years now. I know that the rainbow-haired stallion has his defenders out there, but for me, he looks like a DeviantArt rip-off of a certain beloved child's television show starring colorful horses--a license that Epic could definitely swing if they were so inclined. Perhaps Fabio's generic, NPC-esque appearance is part of the appeal for some players, but for me, he sticks out like a sore thumb, and not in a good way. -SWSinister StrikerFortnite's zombie skins were a major success, and players couldn't get enough of its soccer skins, too. However, the decision to combine the two for yet another Halloween skin led to some underwhelming results. While the skin isn't quite as uncreative as some on this list--the monstrous ball is a nice touch--it's such a specific combination of ideas that it doesn't have much appeal, except perhaps around Halloween time. No wonder this skin is often listed as one of the game's least-popular. -SWFlytrapThe first Legendary item on this list, Flytrap is simply one of those skins that makes you ask \"why?\" The character's Poison Ivy-inspired design isn't the worst starting point, but it quickly goes downhill from there, especially in the color coordination department. When I look at Flytrap, I think of a rotting grapefruit, or perhaps your friend's homemade cosplay for a supervillain that you've never heard of. Though Flytrap isn't the worst skin on this list, Fortnite has come a long way since 2018, and you're better off spending those 2,000 V-Bucks elsewhere. -SWClover Team LeaderThis skin is another example of a Fortnite design that occupies a liminal halfway point between referencing another media property and making Epic's own version of it. In this example, the ratty bear-suit looks like something that a Five Nights at Freddy's fan might draw up in class, but it ends up as the example that might come up when you Google the word \"fursuit.\" It's inevitable that some skins in a game like Fortnite are going to fall into this category, and Clover Team Leader is merely a recent example. That said, it's quite ugly, so it makes the list. -SWRenegadeOne of the very first skins ever sold in Fortnite's Item Shop, Renegade is a great example of how far the game's skins have come since its 2017 origins. In this case, Epic wants you to pay 800 V-Bucks for essentially the default Banshee skin with a shirt that's red instead of orange. Reskins and palette swaps are a well-trod tradition in video games, but unless you're a hardcore Banshee fan, there's really no reason to spend actual money on this. Renegade isn't a particularly terrible skin, but it's here as a stand-in for all of the weak tea reskins that Epic has put in the shop over the years, and it deserves a spot for that reason alone. -SWAerobic Assassin & Mullet MarauderThis '80s-themed \"Spandex Squad\" duo have to be one of the all-time strangest ideas for a Fortnite skin ever. When you consider that the average Fortnite player was born at least 15 to 20 years after this fad and aesthetic had already died off, it's easy to see why it's one of the least-popular skins in the game. The actual execution of the jazz cup-esque color scheme is pretty competent, and the hair effects are well-done, too. This is just one skin that's in the game for the dads out there, and there's nothing wrong with that. But you can understand why most players want nothing to do with it. -SW    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Vince Zampella, the co-founder of Infinity Ward and one of the leading figures behind the first Call of Duty game, has passed away. Zampella was reportedly in a single-car accident on Sunday, December 21 in the San Gabriel Mountains when the vehicle went off the road and hit a concrete barrier.According to NBC4 Los Angeles, the driver of the vehicle perished in a car fire while the passenger was ejected and died at the hospital. The report didn't share any further specifics about the incident.Zampella got his start in the video game industry in the late '90s with stints at GameTek, Atari, Interactive Media/Ripcord Games, and SegaSoft. In 1999, he joined 2015 Inc and became the lead designer of the third Medal of Honor game, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, which was published by EA.Following a dispute with EA, Zampella, Grant Collier, and Jason West co-founded Infinity Ward and partnered with Activision before launching the Call of Duty franchise in 2003. \"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks,\" said Zampella during a recent interview.Zampella and West remained at Activision until 2010 when they were fired by the company over alleged insubordination. The pair subsequently filed a lawsuit against Activision that was settled out of court for undisclosed terms. They went on to co-founded Respawn Entertainment, which released titles including Apex Legends, Titanfall, and the Star Wars Jedi games. Respawn was ultimately purchased by EA.EA put Zampella in charge of DICE in 2020 with a mandate to revitalize the Battlefield franchise. Those efforts paid off earlier this year when Battlefield 6 was released to great acclaim and higher-then expected sales numbers.Zampella had a major impact on the games industry, with many sharing memories of him on social media. You can find a selection of those tributes below.Vince was awesome. A real one - chill, but with a strong will and powerful heart. We have been friends for a long time and he and my wife Kristy were very close - confidants and allies. He leaves behind great children and many who love and respect him. When we were respectful…  — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) December 22, 2025              Vince Zampella was influential in first person shooters. Having been a fan of his since I was a kid, I was honoured he took an interest in and chatted to us about Battalion 1944.A remake of his games.  — Joe Brammer (@Brammertron) December 22, 2025              Vince Zampella was not just an amazing game creator. He was also a friend. In absolute shock right now. Rest in peace to an absolute legend and giant of our industry. pic.twitter.com/acqJxlD1u1  — JP Kellams (@synaesthesiajp) December 22, 2025              Vince was an extraordinary person — a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognize talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great.I saw that up close while writing The Final Hours of Titanfall. I’ll always be…  — Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) December 22, 2025              When Kristy got the call from Coco (Vince's daughter), she just started balling and I knew what was coming. I cannot console her. I can't console myself. It's so, so, so fucked.  — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) December 22, 2025              this is awful. I am so sorry to hear this. Cannot believe it. Vince was a legend and a force behind some of the greatest games ever made. Don’t even know what to say. https://t.co/b1xHPr98Bs  — David Goldfarb (@locust9) December 22, 2025              I just saw that Vince Zampella passed away yesterday in a car crash. I had to read it multiple times to believe it. He was an amazing mentor and friend. He will be sorely missed. My heart goes out to his family. RIP my friend!  — Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) December 22, 2025              Image credit: Getty Images/Barry Brecheisen\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The superb Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard is up for grabs for only $70 (was $120) at Amazon-owned retailer Woot. You can also save on the tenkeyless wireless keyboard directly from Amazon, but the price is considerably higher ($96). The Retro 87 launched in January alongside the matching Retro R8 Mouse, which is on sale for only $48 (was $60) at Amazon. The wireless mouse is bundled with a magnetic charging dock.To round out your transparent green collection, you can pick up the matching version of the 8BitDo Ultimate 3-Mode Controller for $50 (was $70). The transparent green Ultimate 3-Mode Controller works wirelessly on PC and mobile, but it only supports wired play on Xbox consoles. It is worth noting that there is a version of the Ultimate 3-Mode Controller that can sync wirelessly with your Xbox: the Rare 40th Anniversary Edition. Released in August, the eye-catching special-edition controller is bundled with a matching charging dock and is on sale for $72 (was $90) at Amazon.8BitDo Xbox Transparent Green Accessories8BitDo's transparent green PC gaming gear pays homage to one of the original Xbox console's most popular special editions.8BitDo Retro 87 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard -- $70 ($120) | $96 at Amazon8BitDo Retro R8 Wireless Mouse -- $48 ($60)8BitDo Ultimate 3-Mode Controller -- $50 ($70)8BitDo Retro 87 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard: Xbox Edition$70 ($120) at Woot | $96 at Amazon | PC, Mac, Android8BitDo Retro 87 TKL Mechanical KeyboardGallery                                                                                                The Retro 87 uses UV-coated ABS keycaps and Kailh Jellyfish X transparent switches, which feel and sound great--especially if you like clicky keyboards. Kailh's box switches are dust- and splash-resistant and offer a stable, predictable typing experience. The Retro 87 has customizable RGB backlighting with eight unique light modes. Like all other 8BitDo keyboards, the Retro 87 has a hot-swappable PCB and comes with a detachable Super Button module. The two large microswitch buttons can be remapped on the fly, and the housing for the Retro 87's Super Button module is transparent green, too.The Xbox Guide button pulls up the Xbox overlay menu on PC. The four arrow keys match the colors of the face buttons on official Xbox controllers (green, red, blue, and yellow). You can customize keybindings, create macros, and tinker with the RGB lighting effects with 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2 on PC, Mac, and mobile.The Retro 87 works on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Steam Deck, Asus ROG Xbox Ally, and other devices. You can sync to your devices wirelessly via 2.4GHz or Bluetooth; the keyboard also comes with a green, detachable USB-C charging cable that can be used for wired mode. The 4,000mAh rechargeable battery can power the Retro 87 for up to 300 hours between charges with the lighting effects turned off. With RGB backlighting on, I typically get around 25-30 hours between charges.Woot -- $70 ($120)Amazon -- $96 ($120)8BitDo Retro R8 Wireless Mouse + Charging Dock: Xbox Edition$48 ($60) | PC, Mac, Android8BitDo Retro R8 mouseGallery                                                                             The Retro R8 sports an ambidextrous design with four additional programmable buttons--two on each side of the mouse. Like the Retro 87's directional keys, the extra buttons match the colors of the Xbox controller's face buttons. The Retro R8 uses Kailh Sword GM X microswitches and has a PAW 3395 26K DPI optical sensor and has six different sensitivity levels. You can adjust DPI and other settings with Ultimate Software V2.The mouse can sync to PC, Mac, and Android devices over Bluetooth or 2.4GHz wireless via the included dongle. The USB-A dongle can be stored in either the mouse itself or the included magnetic charging dock. If you prefer a wired connection, the Retro R8, just like the keyboard, includes a green USB-C cable for charging and wired mode. The mouse can also be charged directly, so you don't need to bring the dock with you when away from your desk. The Retro R8 has a max polling rate of 8,000Hz in wired mode and 4,000Hz with a 2.4GHz wireless connection.                                                                                                                                               In May, 8BitDo launched an NES-themed edition of the Retro R8 Mouse that's on sale for $45 (was $50). The Retro R8 is 8BitDo's second gaming mouse following the N30 2.4GHz Wireless Mouse, which has a D-pad instead of side buttons and a touch panel for scrolling. You can get the N30 $25 (was $30) at Amazon.                                                                                                                                               8BitDo N Edition Mechanical Wireless KeyboardIf you'd prefer a different retro-inspired design, several other 8BitDo wireless keyboards are on sale right now at Amazon. Nearly all 8BitDo keyboards are inspired by retro game consoles or computers, including the NES-inspired NEdition, Famicom-inspired Fami Edition, and the Commodore 64-themed C64 Edition.Like the Xbox Edition, these models can connect wirelessly to PC, Mac, and mobile devices via 2.4GHz or Bluetooth. Each one comes with a Super Button module and has Ultimate Software integration for rebinding keys, creating macros, and adjusting other settings.The C64 Edition includes the Super Stick--a detachable arcade stick--in addition to the Super Buttons. You can also get the Super Stick with the Best Buy-exclusive N Edition bundle for $70 (was $100).All of the aforementioned models are tenkeyless (TKL), but 8BitDo has matching wireless numpads that double as calculators.

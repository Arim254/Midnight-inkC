    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Halo fans are eagerly awaiting the Halo World Championships later this week, where new details about the next Halo game will be revealed. Now, a new report suggests that there are actually two Halo games coming in 2026 for the franchise's 25th anniversary, and one of those titles may be a live-service game.According to Rebs Gaming, Halo Studios is working on \"a live-service long-term updating [Halo] multiplayer game,\" before adding, \"Its live-service component is like Fortnite.\" The report didn't offer any other specifics about the gameplay, but went on to add some comments about the way AI is used in the game's creation.\"Generative AI is apparently woven into every aspect of development, such as enemy AI and terrain generation. I think what they're mostly doing is that and then touching up the work with human hands. Also, developers are expected to meet similar or quicker deadlines and the only means to do so is through the use of AI, whether that's mundane tasks like scheduling things or writing emails all the way up to actual game development.\"This part of the report went viral, which prompted Windows Central executive editor Jez Corden to respond.Halo is not using generative AI in its game dev / art assets, etc. for its next game. Microsoft has no mandate on studios to use generative AI for games. I'm sure it's being used for emails n shit like that but they're not making a gen AI game here.  â€” Jez (@JezCorden) October 19, 2025              Rebs Gaming later clarified his initial report.Many people are misinterpreting what I reported as if it directly confirms AI is being used in all the wrong ways and Halo is doomed. I did NOT report that. I have begun reaching out to sources to figure out specifics about how Halo Studios is using generative AI. Also using AIâ€¦ https://t.co/9HZ3Y1PFct  â€” Rebs Gaming (@Mr_Rebs_) October 18, 2025              The title most-likely to be announced at the Halo World Championships is a new remake of the original game, Halo: Combat Evolved. The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered developer Virtuos is reportedly working on that project with Halo Studios. Halo: Combat Evolved was previously remastered in 2011. However, the new version is reportedly using a hybrid engine that combines Unreal Engine 5 and the Halo Reach Engine. It also has a strong chance of being the first version of Halo to hit PlayStation consoles.Microsoft has previously confirmed that multiple Halo projects are in development. Halo Studios will be sharing its news about the next title at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET on Friday, October 24, during the Halo World Championships.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

A subsequent rumor suggested that The Division's executive producer, Julian Gerighty, was also heading out the door. However, Ubisoft has officially denied that report while teasing a future for Gerighty that includes The Division 3.In a message on social media, Ubisoft reaffirmed that Gerighty remains with the company while guiding The Division: Resurgence, The Division 2 and its upcoming expansion, Survivors, as well as The Division 3.Agents, weâ€™ve seen the rumors that Julian Gerighty has left Ubisoft - thatâ€™s far from true.Julian is still with us as Executive Producer for The Division franchise, leading the creative vision for TCTD2, Resurgence, Survivors and TCTD3.

Unlike Assassin's Creed, The Division wasn't included in Ubisoft's spin-off subsidy, which will also focus on Far Cry and Rainbow Six.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

You'll find your first one early in the game, and the rest you'll unlock as you continue the campaign.What are Shift codes?A reward system comprised of 25-character codes, Shift codes have been around since the days of Borderlands 2. Typically, these reward players with Golden Keys that can then be used in a special treasure chest, but they can also unlock cosmetics to be used in a Borderlands game. Codes also have an expiry date, usually ranging between 48 hours and a week, and they're found online through affiliated social media channels.How to redeem Shift codesTo redeem your Shift code, you'll first need to create a Shift account on the Gearbox website. This is quick and easy to do, and you can then activate your Shift codes on the same website or via the in-game Social menu or via Borderland 4's Social menu at launch. The other thing to note about Shift codes is that they typically have expiration dates, so it's a good idea to redeem one as soon as possible.From there, you can bank the rewards if they turn out to be Golden Keys, or splurge and use all of them to grab some new gear in one go.One important note: The rewards contained within these chests scale to your current level, so you may want to consider waiting to use a Golden Key. Otherwise, using one early in the game will net you low-level gun as opposed to one you can use long-term.For more on Borderlands 4, you can see how Gearbox plans to keep you looting and shooting after launch, how to get a free Borderlands 4 gun skin, and this deep dive into every Vault Hunter in the game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

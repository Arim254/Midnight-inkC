    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on January 8, 2026 at 9:36AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                South Park is coming to Fortnite on Friday, but this is not the sort of Fortnite collab that only adds skins to the item shop--though we're certainly getting a pile of skins. No, South Park is also taking over Fortnite's Battle Royale mode by introducing several major new gameplay overhauls (and we mean major) and taking over one of the major named locations on the map. Also, there's a completely free event pass that'll allow players to earn free South Park cosmetics by completing quests--yes, you'll actually have to play the game to earn these things.And, of course, there will be five skins in the item shop, all of which are the boys from South Park in mech suits--there's Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, and Butters. More importantly, there will also be a Towelie sidekick in the shop for all the sweaty gamers out there.New quad size: QuintsThe single biggest change being introduced with this crossover event is the addition of Quints, a five-player variety of the main Battle Royale mode, playable in both Build and Zero Build. It's the first time Epic has added a new squad size to BR since it added Trios about five years ago, so this is kind of a big deal. We don't know for sure if Quints will stick around beyond this event, though. Epic previously added a six-player version of Blitz Royale earlier this year, but removed it after a few weeks. Kenny TokenThe Kenny token, which you can find as random loot, is an entirely new gameplay concept for Battle Royale. If you have one of these tokens when you die, you'll automatically reboot. That'll be quite a game-changer, depending on how common these end up being.Cheesy PoofsWhile this may seem like just another consumable healing item, Cheesy Poofs are also a weapon--throwing a box at an enemy will damage them. The days of feeling like an idiot because you accidentally threw a shield pot at the other guy when you tried to switch to a different gun are finally over. At least temporarily.The Stick of TruthOnly one Stick of Truth will appear each round, and the person who claims it will become the round's final boss. But not because it turns you into a kaiju or gives you sick abilities--having the Stick of Truth in your inventory will make the storm circle center on you for the remainder of the match. Wonkeeland is now CartmanlandThe Wonkeeland POI in the northwest part of the island has received a South Park-themed makeover and is now Cartmanland, based on the theme park Cartman took over on the show. It's still more or less the same place, just with Cartman's face all over it.Born in Chaos event passFor the first time in almost two years, Fortnite is doing a new event mini-pass. This one is completely free to everyone, and includes 13 tiers of items that you can unlock by completing quests in Battle Royale--meaning this is not the sort of pass that you can passively get through by gaining XP. We don't know what all the pass will include, but among them are Terrance and Phillip dolls as a pickaxe, and a CRED backpack.Final pass reward: Imaginationland GliderThe very last reward on the pass, which requires completing every available South Park pass quest, is the Imaginationland Airship glider, which comes from an epic three-episode story in Season 10 that was originally planned to be a theatrical movie.     \n  \n                      "

For a limited time, players can earn Fallout operator skins and other themed rewards by unlocking them in free and paid event passes. Here's a look at all Fallout rewards in Call of Duty and how you unlock them during the event.Call of Duty's Fallout event runs from now until January 29. This adds operator skins and cosmetics themed around Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show. While there are plenty of free rewards to earn, you'll need to purchase the paid \"premium\" pass for 1,100 CoD Points ($10) if you want to unlock all items for the event.There are 20 rewards in total for the Fallout event. There are 10 rewards in the free pass, and 10 more optional rewards can be unlocked with the paid pass. The highlights of the free pass include two vault dweller operator skins and the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun. The paid pass is required to unlock Maximus and The Ghoul characters from the show.It's also worth noting that the character, Lucy MacLean, will arrive as a shop bundle at a later date. Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.All Fallout event rewards can be seen below. This is an XP-based event, so you'll simply need to grind XP across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. For multiplayer, objective modes like Kill Confirmed and Domination work best, while Plunder and Casual battle royale modes will yield more XP for Warzone. This is also a good time to use double XP tokens if you have them.It's worth noting that this crossover features Fallout-themed game modes and events across multiplayer, Zombies, Endgame, and Warzone.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                GameStop announced this week that a proposed pay package worth approximately $35 billion for its CEO, Ryan Cohen, was in the works. The compensation is tied entirely to the company's performance and depends on a major turnaround. To earn it, Cohen must increase GameStop's market value by more than 10 times and significantly raise profits.Meeting these goals would require a big change for GameStop, which has struggled in recent years. Its stock price is also severely down from the record highs reached in 2021, when GameStop gained popularity among retail investors during the meme-stock surge.Even at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, GameStop was already planning on matching the number of store closures from the previous year.Under the new plan, Cohen must help grow GameStop's market value to $100 billion and deliver $10 billion in cumulative performance EBITDA--earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization--a common measure of operating profit. GameStop's current market value is about $9.26 billion. The company previously reached a peak market value of around $34 billion during the 2021 rally.Cohen will not receive a salary, cash bonuses, or traditional stock awards under the plan. Instead, his compensation would come from stock options to buy more than 171.5 million shares at $20.66 per share. Cohen, a billionaire investor, joined GameStop's board in January 2021 and became CEO in September 2023. The shareholders are expected to vote on the package at a special meeting in March or April.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

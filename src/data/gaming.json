    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Twitch Hype Train world records are a rare thing. The ultimate show of dedication from a creator's fanbase, these accumulative trains rely on a streamer's viewers donating subscriptions or Bits to the channel. Neuro-sama beat her own world record at the end of December 2024 and now, well, she's only gone and done it again. The hat trick of Hype Train world records belongs to the AI VTuber, her sister Evil Neuro, and their creator Vedal987.For the uninitiated, or those outside of the \"Swarm\"--the name for Neuro's fanbase--Neuro is an AI VTuber created by Vedal who utilizes a large language model and a VTuber model to communicate with her Twitch chat, play games, and even go on adventures in VR thanks to the 3D version of her model. Neuro was originally created to play the rhythm game OSU on Twitch, but rapidly evolved to become a series of AI systems that work in harmony. Vedal created a program that takes its input from Twitch and voice, gives that input to the LLM, which is then sent to a text-to-speech system, resulting in the Neuro we know today. It's for that reason that Neuro is widely considered far from the \"AI slop\" that many people take issue with.          It's possibly a combination of the complexity of that system, the resulting effects, or the opinion that Neuro-Sama is the cutest little button, that has led Vedal to gain such a dedicated fanbase. On January 4, seemingly out of nowhere, Neuro once again began to see an impressive number of Bits and subscriptions donated to Vedal's channel. Vedal's friend and fellow VTuber Camila offered to commission a new outfit for Neuro if the Hype Train continued. She also promised to \"show feet\" but we won't talk about that. These incentives led the hype train to level 100 in a matter of a few hours, and it didn't stop there. Vedal wasn't present with Neuro on stream for this attempt, instead choosing to type in chat with sentiments such as \"Realistically wtf is going on?\" and \"I was gonna join after the train, but it's getting a bit silly.\"This time around, Neuro-Sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record, reaching level 126 with 126,273 subscriptions and 1,194,921 Bits donated to the Vedal987 channel in a limited period of time. Neuro celebrated the massive achievement by stating, \"No matter what temporary fame this world record grants me, I'm far happier just to have shared in the love of this moment with you all.\" Vedal joined after the Hype Train eventually came to an end adding, \"What the actual fuck have you all done?\" The duo's former record was level 123, with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits donated. Neuro's birthday subathon began on December 19, with each subscription donated adding a specific amount of seconds to a steadily-declining timer that determines when the subathon ends. At this rate, she'll be streaming until her fourth birthday.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nBehind the QTEs and tough choices, is a pretty great dispatching sim.By \n    Matt Kim\n   on January 4, 2026 at 9:00AM PST\n              \n                Quick-time events, despite everyone's best efforts to spice them up, remain pretty meh.When you first begin Dispatch, the new episodic superhero adventure game from AdHoc Studio, you're asked if you want to enable quick-time event prompts as an optional game mechanic. It says something that these QTE prompts only really appear in the first and last episode of Dispatch's eight-episode run. But if you're worried the only input you'll have in Dispatch is pressing a button at the right time, or picking the different narrative choices that affect the game's story, you should know AdHoc has a more compelling, non-optional gameplay hook that deserves as much attention as the game's charming storytelling. And it's in the title of the game itself.Set in a fictional version of Los Angeles, California where superheroes are real, Dispatch centers on Robert Robertson III, a former hero turned dispatcher for SDN. It's a private security and service company, except instead of sending paramedics out, SDN (or Superhero Dispatch Network) sends out caped heroes to tackle clients' problems big and small. This serves as the basis for Dispatch's core minigame, and it's one that could honestly be a standalone game in and of itself.Whether that's rescuing a cat from a tree, breaking up drunken tailgates, or rescuing people from a collapsing dam, there's no job SDN won't help out with so long as you're a paying customer. And while the superheroes out in the field get most of the credit, Dispatch's true heroes are the team of behind the scenes blue-collar dispatchers who match the right heroes with the right crisis, or at the very least, try to.The actual mechanics of dispatching heroes takes the form of a full-on minigame that you play at least once per episode. As Robert sits down at his work station for another day of work, players assume a first-person perspective at SDN's proprietary dispatching program that shows a map of South LA, various crimes that appear in real time, and a menu full of heroes waiting to be dispatched.Dispatching in DispatchThe key to success is dispatching the right hero for the job. For example, if there is a cat stuck in a tree, you'd want to send a speedy hero who can fly, not someone who solves problems with their fists, who'd likely have a lower success rate of rescuing said cat. Likewise, if a gang of grunts is robbing a bank, then you'd send in some bruisers to take care of business. The initial description of each mission clues you in to which skills are best suited to the job at hand, and each hero has individual stats with strengths and weaknesses — your success will depend on how well you line up the heroes' skills with the task at hand. The less overlap there is between skillset and problem, the less likely your hero is to succeed. But get the right hero on a crime, and they'll solve the problem and level up while they're at it.There are real emotional stakes to dispatching as well. Failure is a very real possibility, especially during rush hour when heroes become unavailable due to exhaustion. This means you're racing against the clock to try to save as many people as possible, and when you find that you can't help everyone, Dispatch makes that emotional burden feel very real, and very disappointing thanks to the feedback you receive in real-time from your team of superheroes. And when Robert doesn't get flak from the team, he'll also cry out in frustration if a job goes poorly.What I found truly surprising is how this dispatching minigame fits into the burgeoning subgenre of labor simulators. That is, games that revolve around basic, blue-collar jobs. PowerWash Simulator, for example, is about powerwashing dirty surfaces, and it's one of the most popular games around. In the same way, the dispatching minigame feels very much a part of this microgenre thanks to some clever design choices that put you, as Robert, directly into the action.The entire dispatching minigame is played directly on Robert's '90s-era workstation PC, which you interface with in first-person. You might as well be sitting in the cubicle at SDN yourself. Plus, get good enough at dispatching and you'll find that you can enter a flow state: a very real state of being when you find yourself becoming particularly adept at instantly diagnosing a crime and knowing already the best hero for the job. It made me wonder if I could actually be a dispatcher in real life, though I will say being unemployed means I find myself wondering if I could do most jobs in real life these days.All this is to say, if you've tried choice-based narrative games before and find yourself wishing there were a little more meat on the bones beyond just quick-time events, one of this year's most popular games has a full-blown sim tucked inside it that is very much worth playing for its own sake.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Scheduled to launch January 30, the new edition matches the color scheme of the N64 controller that debuted with the console back in 1996. The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller originally launched last August for $40 with two color options: solid black and solid white. Nostalgia will cost you an extra five bucks, but the gray edition looks very good. The 8BitDo 64 Controller works wirelessly on Analogue 3D, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PC, Apple devices, and Android.The controller's reimagined form factor and layout was designed in partnership with retro hardware manufacturer Analogue. The 8BitDo 64 is the official controller for the Analogue 3D, the superb FPGA console that plays Nintendo 64 cartridges in 4K resolution. After multiple delays, the Analogue 3D launched in November. If you're interested in picking one up, the white and black editions of the Analogue 3D are back in stock for $270 on Analogue's online storefront. Note: The console does not come with a controller, and the 8BitDo 64 is currently the only officially supported wireless option for the Analogue 3D.                                 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller (N64 Gray)                                                                $45 | Releases January 30                                                                                                                                                                                    The colors on the gray edition of the 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller look virtually identical to the original Nintendo 64 controller. The shell's distinct shade of classic Nintendo gray is complemented by colorful buttons. Here's the list of inputs on the 8BitDo 64 Controller:Hall Effect Control Stick (Light Gray)D-pad (Dark Gray)A button (Blue)B button (Green)C-pad (Yellow)Start button (Red)L/R shoulder buttons (Dark Gray)L/R Z triggers (Dark Gray)Select / Star / Home (Light Gray)A switch on the back of the controller toggles between S-Input for Switch 1/2 and D-Input for everything else, including Analogue 3D. With the 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 desktop or mobile app, you can fully remap the controls and make other adjustments.The 8BitDo 64 connects wirelessly via Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) or Bluetooth 5.0. The Analogue 3D and some newer Android phones support Bluetooth LE, so battery life is a bit better when gaming on those devices. The 8BitDo 64 can run for up to 36 hours between charges when connected via Bluetooth LE. On Switch 1/2, that number is closer to 30 hours, in our experience, which is still impressive.You can also use the 8BitDo 64 as a wired controller with the detachable USB-C to USB-A charging cable. Instead of the bulky N64 Rumble Pak, the 8BitDo 64 has built-in rumble motors. Vibration only works on Analogue 3D and when playing N64 games in the Nintendo Switch Online app on Switch 1/2.Outside of the color scheme, the new gray model is identical to the white and black editions, so the features outlined below apply to all three colors.                                                       8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller                                                                $40                                                                                                                                                                                    The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller has a contemporary form factor like the manufacturer's Ultimate Controller series and the official Switch 1/2 Pro Controllers. 8BitDo retained the unique aspects of the original joystick while upgrading the tech and ergonomics. The joystick is repositioned to the left side of the controller, and while the cap has the trio of circular ridges, the rubberized texture is much kinder to your thumb than the N64 controller's plastic surface. Just like the original, the 8BitDo 64 has an octagonal stick gate, which Nintendo included to mimic an eight-way D-pad. The stick is activated with a Hall Effect sensor (anti-drift) and has a wear-resistant metal ring.The classic four-way D-pad still sits in a recessed pocket, while the large A/B buttons and C-pad match the original layout. The R/L shoulder buttons are chunkier and offer better feedback. The N64's Z button, which was located on the back of the middle prong, is replaced with two conventional Z triggers behind the shoulder buttons. The dual triggers are helpful if you want to use the controller for games outside of the N64 library.The N64's big Start button returns and is joined by three buttons found on many 8BitDo Switch controllers: Minus (select), 8BitDo (home), and Star/Turbo. With standard turbo activated, your game will register holding a button down as repeated taps. There's also an auto-turbo mode that spams the programmed input without needing to press the button at all.                       If you have trouble syncing the 8BitDo 64 to Switch 2 or Analogue 3D, make sure the controller is updated to the latest firmware. If you're a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriber, the 8BitDo 64 has superior ergonomics and is more affordable than the official N64 Controller sold on the Nintendo Store.Analogue 3DThe Analogue 3D is a region-free console that plays every Nintendo 64 cartridge released in North America, Japan, and PAL regions. This includes games that required the N64 Expansion Pak, such as The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and Donkey Kong 64. As an FPGA console, the Analogue 3D offers a thoroughly authentic experience that mirrors original hardware on a moment-to-moment gameplay level. The visual upgrade is staggering. The console has HDMI output and can display your N64 games in 4K resolution; it also supports 1080p resolution, if you don't have a 4K display. Like Analogue's other retro FPGA devices, the 3D has multiple display modes, aspect ratio options, and a bunch of other customizable visual settings. It also has a built-in Expansion PakThe Analogue 3D is compatible with original N64 accessories and has four controller ports for official Nintendo 64 controllers. As mentioned, you need to provide your own controllers. If you don't have old N64 controllers in a drawer somewhere, there are budget-friendly wired controllers that mimic the three-pronged form factor. We'd recommend the Hyperkin Captain, which is available in translucent and solid color schemes. Amazon has five different colors of the Hyperkin Captain in stock for $20-$23 each.The 8BitDo 64 is the only wireless controller with official Analogue 3D support, but there is a workaround. First-party Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox controllers can connect wirelessly to Analogue 3D and original Nintendo 64 hardware with a third-party accessory such as the Bitfunx BlueRetro N64 Wireless Controller Adapter.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The worlds of Silent Hill and Castlevania have crossed over with Dead by Daylight before, but the latest collaboration between Konami and Behaviour Interactive is taking things even further into The Fog. This time, Silent Hill's Pyramid Head and Castlevania's Dracula are teaming up as The Executioner and The Dark Lord. And they aren't the only guest characters in this 2v8 battle.          Dead by Daylight's Silent Hill X Castlevania collaboration starts today, November 6, and extends through November 20. Both of the series' respective villains will be joined by a pair of returning heroes: Silent Hill 3's Cheryl Mason and Castlevania's Trevor Belmont. All four characters are available for free during the 2v8 battles for the duration of this event.There are also four new outfits--one for each of the returning characters. Trevor's Legendary Outfit essentially transforms him into his descendant, Richter Belmont. Dracula's alternate look is called the Scorched Terror Outfit. Basically, it's what Dracula looks like when he's left in the sun long enough for his skin to blister and peel.Cheryl's alternate look is the Awakened Order outfit, which features her as she \"embraces a sinister ritual.\" As for Pyramid Head, he's a glutton for punishment with his Flayed Torturer outfit, which is exactly what it sounds like.Earlier this year, Dead by Daylight had crossover collaborations with The Walking Dead's heroes, Five Nights At Freddy's murderous animatronics, and Resident Evil characters. Knowing this game, there are almost certainly more crossovers coming after this one.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Square Enix unveiled a bold strategy that could have far-reaching implications for the games industry, as the Japanese publisher aims to use generative AI to automate 70% of game QA and debugging by 2027.After releasing its financial results, Square Enix also revealed a progress report on the company's medium-term business plan. On page five of the 20-page presentation, Square Enix announced a partnership with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo to research ways of \"improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies.\"Titled \"Joint Development of Game QA Automation Technology Using Generative AI,\" the project features a research team of more than 10 members from both the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory and Square Enix. The goal is to \"automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027\" by using automation technology to improve QA efficiency and operations. Through this R&D, Square Enix hopes to \"establish a competitive advantage in game development.\"AI has become a hotly contested topic in games and beyond. Many developers and publishers have mixed opinions on the technology, with some saying it should be embraced and others claiming it poses legal risks. It's not used everywhere; Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment won't use generative AI despite its publisher, Krafton Inc., going all in on the technology. However, it's still being pushed onto developers, with EA wanting its employees to think of AI as a \"thought partner\" while training it on their work.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

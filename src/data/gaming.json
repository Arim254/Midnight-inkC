    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Blair Marnell\n   on November 19, 2025 at 10:14AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Earlier this week, The Game Awards shared its list of the nominees for the 2025 ceremony. And while there are some clear favorites, the outcome will ultimately come down to a vote by the fans.The voting period has begun and can be found on The Game Awards' official site. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had the most nominations of any game with 12 total, including three nominations in Best Performance.One of the lone stragglers from late 2024 was Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. While that title wasn't forgotten, it only received two nominations, including one for Troy Baker's performance as Indy.While the Indy game only got two, indie games performed particularly well this year, with titles like Hollow Knight: Silksong and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 holding their own with five and two nominations, respectively. But over 60 games received only a single nomination for this year's awards.It's too soon to say if any of this year's titles will run away with the awards, but Game of the Year is down to six fan-favorite titles: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hades 2, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.To help you keep track of this year's Game Awards, GameSpot has listed each multi-nominated game alongside their respective categories. The results will be announced live when The Game Awards is streamed on December 11.Clair Obscur: Expedition 33Nominations: 12Categories:Game of the YearBest Game DirectionBest NarrativeBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Audio DesignBest Independent GameBest Debut Indie GameBest RPGBest Performance x 3Ben Starr, Charlie Cox, and Jennifer English are all nominated for their performances in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Death Stranding 2: On the BeachNominations: 7Categories:Game of the YearBest Game DirectionBest NarrativeBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Audio DesignBest Action Adventure GameGhost of YoteiNominations: 7Best Game DirectionBest NarrativeBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Audio DesignBest Action Adventure GameBest PerformanceHades 2Nominations: 6Categories:Game of the YearBest Game DirectionBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Independent GameBest Action GameHollow Knight: SilksongNominations: 5Categories:Game of the YearBest Art DirectionBest Score and MusicBest Independent GameBest Action Adventure GameSplit FictionNominations: 4Best Game DirectionBest Action/AdventureBest Family GameBest MultiplayerSilent Hill fNominations: 3Categories:Best NarrativeBest Audio DesignBest PerformanceKingdom Come: Deliverance IINominations: 3Game of the YearBest NarrativeBest RPGBattlefield 6Nominations: 3Categories:Best Audio DesignBest Action GameBest MultiplayerDonkey Kong BananzaNominations: 2Categories:Game of the YearBest FamilyMario Kart WorldNominations: 2Categories:Best FamilyBest Sports/RacingIndiana Jones and the Great CircleNominations: 2Categories:Best PerformanceBest Action/AdventureDoom: The Dark AgesNominations: 2Categories:Innovation in AccessibilityBest Action GameFinal Fantasy 14Nominations: 2Categories:Best OngoingBest Community SupportFortniteNominations: 2Categories:Best OngoingBest Community SupportHelldivers 2Nominations: 2Categories:Best OngoingBest Community SupportNo Man's SkyNominations: 2Categories:Best OngoingBest Community SupportEA Sports FC 26Nominations: 2Categories:Innovation in AccessibilityBest Sports/RacingBlue PrinceNominations: 2Categories:Best Independent GameBest Debut Indie GameSingle-Nominee GamesThe following games received a single nomination from The Game Awards.

Technically you could already do this, as only one player in a group needed to beat the campaign to get into Endgame, but soon everyone can play it.For anyone just catching up, Endgame takes place on the Avalon map where 1-32 players in squads of up to four fight through zones of increasing difficulty. Players enter Avalon in a wingsuit and can then get through the map on foot or in a number of different vehicles as they complete missions.For anyone who has completed the campaign, Treyarch is giving them a variety of bonuses, including double XP tokens and Perkaholic Gobblegums. You can see a rundown of all the bonuses below.We've seen an awesome response to Endgame from players who've already been dropping in, so we're making it available to everyone in #BlackOps7 starting Friday, Nov. 21.Team up with other players to complete objectives, increase your power, earn unique Weapon Camos, and take on… pic.twitter.com/2igahTPHv6  — Treyarch (@Treyarch) November 19, 2025\n  In other Call of Duty news, Treyarch is launching the Nuketown 2025 map on November 20.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Over two decades have passed since Half-Life 2 was released, but its developer, Valve, has never gotten around to making Half-Life 3. Instead, Valve has been busy turning Steam into the top marketplace for PC game sales (and making a VR spin-off that won our GOTY award). But every once in a while, rumors about Half-Life 3 flare up, and it's happening again right now.As noted by Kotaku, Valve's Steam storefront says that it has two upcoming games, but only Deadlock is listed, and that title is still in early access. The Game Awards are also coming soon, and there almost always seems to be speculation that Half-Life 3 will debut there. Some fans have also read a little too much into The Game Awards' post celebrating today's 27th anniversary of the original Half-Life.For the record, The Game Awards makes that same post on this date every year. But that's never stopped the speculation before. Dataminers have also been snooping around in Valve projects, and claim to have found evidence of an unannounced shooter codenamed HLX. More recently, Valve unveiled Steam Machine and Steam Frame, and fans have noted that Half-Life 3 would probably help the company sell a lot of hardware.Near the beginning of 2025, Mike Shapiro--who voices G-Man in the Half-Life games--shared a cryptic New Year's message that was also taken as a sign that Half-Life 3 was near. But nothing came of that either.The most excitement Half-Life 2 fans had this year was the demo for the RTX mod that significantly upgraded the game's graphics. Maybe one day, Valve will finally resolve that last Half-Life 2 Episode 2 cliffhanger. For now, the most recent game in the franchise was the VR game Half-Life: Alyx in 2020.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

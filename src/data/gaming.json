Yet Nintendo is surprisingly absent from the top trending games of 2025, with only a single title making the cut: Pokemon Legends: Z-A.Google has shared its annual report about the top trending search topics, including which subjects changed in the year since the previous disclosure. Note that these are not the most-played or most popular games of the year--the data shows which of these games saw a significant spike in search via Google throughout 2025.Only a single game from Google's top trending games of 2024 returned for 2025's list. The game in question was Strands, a free-to-play word game from The New York Times.Many of this year's breakout titles made the 2025 list, including Split Fiction, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Arc Raiders, and Battlefield 6. Perennial hits Roblox and Minecraft staked out the final two spots for this year.Grand Theft Auto 6 is the only unreleased game to make this year's list, and it will likely show up again next year even if the game is once again pushed out of its release window.You can find the complete lineup of Google's top 10 trending game searches for 2025 below."

He said in a new interview that he doesn't have much experience playing the Fallout games, but he's well-versed in the Fallout lore thanks to YouTube videos.\"I'm very familiar with the lore,\" the Home Alone star told IGN. \"For sure. I've less hands-on experience with the games themselves, but that being said, I knew what I was walking into. When we [Culkin and actress Brenda Song] were watching the show, I would pause it for her and catch her up on like, 'Oh, that's what this means, or that means, or that kind of thing.' Even some of the subtle subtext of the show.\"Culkin, 45, said he's too busy these days to try to play video games, so he \"watched a lot of YouTube stuff\" for Fallout.Fallout Season 2 premieres December 17 on Prime Video. Season 1 is streaming now on Prime Video, or if you don't have a subscription, you can watch the entirety of Season 1 on Samsung TV Plus with ads. In addition to Culkin, Fallout Season 2 adds Kumail Nanjiani and the action heads to New Vegas. For more, check out GameSpot's Fallout TV show review for Season 1.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Those waiting for the return of Diablo 4 leaderboards will have to wait a little longer, as the feature has been delayed into 2026.Blizzard announced the delay during its most recent Diablo 4 developer update livestream. The new leaderboard system revolves around a new dungeon called The Tower, where players will be able to test their builds and compete for clear times and rewards.\"This is to make sure we have some stability with the season launch, and then when The Tower shows up, it's online and people are ready to tackle it,\" associate game director Zaven Haroutunian said regarding the reason for the delay.Leaderboards and The Tower were originally set to debut as part of Season 11 on December 11. Instead, Blizzard said the feature will arrive with patch 2.5.2 sometime in the new year. Even when The Tower and leaderboards do arrive, they will technically be in \"beta\" form, an approach Blizzard hasn't taken before when it comes to developing new features for Diablo 4.Delaying The Tower wasn't just in the name of season-launch stability. Haroutunian said it was also to incorporate learnings and feedback from the recent Season 11 public-test-realm, which featured a version of The Tower Haroutunian said was intentionally \"rough.\" Blizzard wanted to test it and make sure it was going in the right direction for the feature before committing to it, he said.          Now, Blizzard is aiming to refine The Tower based on feedback. One problem Blizzard is looking to fix is to make it so progress orbs dropped by slain enemies will spawn closer to players to require less backtracking. Another problem area is the feeling that players need to \"fish\" for optimal dungeon layouts before committing to a run, something that was also a problem in Diablo 3.Haroutunian said Blizzard is looking to address or remove outliers like certain bosses and or environments that aren't as conducive to a competitive game mode.\"We want to aim at consistency and make sure the mode is fun, exciting, and competitive over just cramming in visual variety in it just for its own sake,\" Haroutunian said.Haroutunian also addressed feedback that The Tower currently feels too similar to The Pit, another part of Diablo 4's endgame. He said the comparison is completely valid, as The Tower currently is very similar to The Pit, with both modes taking inspiration from Greater Rifts in Diablo 3. Over time, however, the goal is for both The Pit and The Tower to diverge and offer different experiences.\"The Tower is going to start very similar, because it's starting at the same foundation,\" Haroutunian said. \"Over time, it will change, it will morph, it will be its own thing. And The Pit will suddenly have all this space it's freed up to occupy. It doesn't have to be this pseudo-competitive mode anymore, it can just be whatever it needs to be. It can be as crazy as we want.\"When The Tower does officially arrive, it won't be the first time Diablo 4 has had leaderboards. A similar feature launched with one of Diablo 4's earlier seasons, only to be removed a few months later with the launch of its first expansion, Vessel of Hatred.Diablo 4 Season of Divine Intervention begins December 11 and just might be the game's biggest rework yet. The new season will introduce permanent overhauls to systems like Tempering and Masterworking, as well as make enemies smarter and deadlier. A second Diablo 4 expansion is slated to arrive in 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

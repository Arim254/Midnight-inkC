    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot.Other instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models. We have reached out to the developer, SNK, for details on the trailer and will update this post as soon as we hear back.          If Fatal Fury is using generative AI, it wouldn't be the first game to do so. Activision confirmed that AI tools were used in the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but it has insisted that the creative process \"continues to be led\" by humans. Meanwhile, fans believe that Battlefield 6 features AI-generated art, and the Indie Game Awards rescinded the awards given to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 after it was discovered that developer Sandfall Interactive used AI-generated assets during the game's production.Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios has also faced backlash after it was revealed that it had been experimenting with AI tools for concept art. Studio CEO Swen Vincke later addressed the controversy and explained that the studio will avoid using generative AI entirely in concept-art creation for its next game, Divinity.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Animal Crossing: New Horizon's free 3.0 update has dropped earlier than expected, bringing new features including the Slumber Islands, Resort Hotel, and the return of Resetti. One feature players didn't see coming is the brand-new movement system, which allows players to move precisely one square at a time, allowing strafing and even a cute little hop.The new style of movement has been added to aid in construction and decorating. The options are mentioned as part of a tutorial in the Island Designer app, though some players managed to discover the new feature on their own.One player posted to Reddit after finding that pressing L now makes your character jump, while others discovered that this was only part of the new movement function, which allows precise movement one square at a time by pressing and holding L.          Compared to New Horizon's usual free movement mode, the new feature essentially snaps players to the game's grid, which should make decorating, pathbuilding, and general terraforming a much smoother process.Beyond its functionality, the new movements are just fun, with players already planning how they will use the feature's little hops or backwards walks to express themselves in game--why not try moonwalking around town, for one.The new movement scheme is just a small part of the new 3.0 update, which is live in game now. The latest update adds both quality-of-life updates and some new content, intended to clean up the 2020 title ahead of its Switch 2 release on January 15. Already downloaded the update?

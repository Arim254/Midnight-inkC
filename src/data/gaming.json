Mainline objectives are outlined and accompanied by illustrated maps with annotations to help you uncover the many secrets hidden across the interconnected regions in the base game and The Old Hunters expansion.In addition to mandatory objectives, the guide tackles all of Bloodborne's optional side content. Most notably, it has a thorough section on the ever-changing Chalice Dungeons to help you unlock some of the game's best weapons and loot. You can also use the guidebook as a reference manual, as it contains a full bestiary with in-depth analysis on the monsters who want to keep you in the nightmare. Along with the bestiary, you can reference the weapon and gear catalog to maximize your build's potential.The book's final chapter, Hunter's Appendices, helps you track your progress toward 100% by cataloging every character, shop, special enemies, and more. The text is accompanied by work of From Software's concept artists, making this the ultimate companion for fans of the game. Even if you don't need a traditional \"guide,\" there's enough here in terms of art and lore to make it a worthy addition to your shelf.Beyond the walkthrough, reference catalogs, and annotated maps found in the main chapters, Bloodborne's Complete Edition Guide comes with a \"bonus chest\" featuring the following: Exclusive interview with Hidetaka MiyazakiThe Story of Yharnam - background info on the game worldThe Art of The Old Hunters: 20 pages of concept artLore Index with important reference notes on YharnamNote: This guidebook is technically called Bloodborne Complete Guide 25th Anniversary Edition.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Keyboard and mouse are extremely popular inputs for Battlefield 6 players. While most players still play the game on a controller, thanks to the console versions, many fans have swapped to a keyboard and mouse due to how difficult it can be to nail down the best controller settings in Battlefield 6.If you've made the switch to keyboard and mouse (KBM) or have been using KBM for ages, you'll need the best settings for your devices. Getting your keybinds, sensitivities, and other settings tuned just right can lead to a more enjoyable gameplay experience and often makes the difference between life and death on the battlefield.Below, you'll find the optimal setting for every keyboard and mouse menu option in Battlefield 6.Table of Contents [hide]Best settings for keyboard and mouse in Battlefield 6Infantry Control SettingsInfantry KeybindsVehiclesVehicles Control SettingsBest settings for keyboard and mouse in Battlefield 6First off, you can find your keyboard and mouse settings by pressing the cog icon at the top-right of the Battlefield 6 main menu. Here, navigate to the tab labeled \"Mouse & Keyboard\" and select it to find all sorts of different options to view and change.The keyboard and mouse settings in Battlefield 6 are split up into multiple sections and menus, and it can be difficult to go through every available setting. Fortunately, all you have to do is read below to find the section you want to change and all of the settings that go with that section in Battlefield 6.Infantry Control SettingsAimInfantry Mouse Aim Sensitivity: 40-50Uniform Infantry Aiming: OnZoom Sensitivity Coefficient: 178Infantry Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 80-90Vertical Mouse Aim Ratio: 100Invert Vertical Look - Infantry: OffField of View: 105The Mouse and Keyboard settings menu in Battlefield 6MovementInfantry Sprint: ClickDouble Tap Forward Sprint: OffSprint: Left ShiftCrouch Toggle Sprint: StandVault Over Sprint: OnSlide: N/ACrouch Slide: AllDouble Tap Crouch For Sprint Slide: OffLanding Roll: OnZoomInfantry Weapon Zoom: HoldZoom: Right Mouse ButtonSteady Scope: HoldSteady Scope: Left ShirtInfantry Zoom Aim Sensitivity: 80-90Vertical Mouse Aim Ratio: 100OtherParachute Auto Deploy: Insertions OnlyInteract & Reload: Prioritize ReloadSkip Revive: HoldRequest Revive: ToggleInvert Demolition Charge: OffMount Breakout: InstantMount Presets: ComboPeek Type: Side and UpMount Type: Side and UpInteracts: OffInfantry KeybindsThe Infantry Keybinds menu in Battlefield 6GeneralInteract: EEnter / Exit Vehicle: EBig Map: MQuick Loadout Customization: YToggle Inventory/Scoreboard: TabChange Seat in Vehicle: FSkip to Deploy: SpacePing / CommoRose (Hold) / Call-in Gadget Half Combo: Left AltMovement & AimingWalk Forward: WWalk Backward: SStrafe Right: DStrafe Left: ALook Up: Mouse ForwardLook Down: Mouse BackwardLook Right: Mouse RightLook Left: Mouse LeftJump: SpaceVault: SpaceSprint: Left ShiftCrouch (Hold): CCrouch (Toggle): Left CtrlProne: ZParachute Deploy: SpaceSlide: N/ALean/Peek: N/AWeapons & EquipmentFire: Left Mouse ButtonZoom: Right Mouse ButtonReload: RMelee/Takedown: FPrimary Weapon: 1Secondary Weapon: 2Gadget One: 3Gadget Two: 4Weapon Inspect: ISquad Progression/Class Gadget: XGrenade: GContextual Action: 5Toggle Laser And/or Flashlight: TFire Mode/Zeroing /Ranger Finder Zeroing: BSteady Scope: Left ShiftToggle Scope: VCycle Primary Weapon: Mouse Wheel UpCycle Secondary Weapon: Mouse Wheel DownDeploy Bipod/Mount: FVehiclesVehicle Mouse Aim Sensitivity: 40Vehicles Control SettingsInvert Vertical Flight - Aircraft - OffInvert Vertical Look - Aircraft: OffAir Control Sensitivity: 40-50Helicopter Control Sensitivity: 40-50Helicopter Control Assists: OffThird Person Aircraft Camera Roll: OnVehicle Boost: ToggleVehicle Weapon Zoom: HoldAnd that takes care of every pertinent keyboard and mouse setting you'll need in Battlefield 6. We ommitted some of the non-important settings and all of the UI keybinds, as those are generally left perfectly fine on their default options. However, you can always head back into the settings if you find you want to change something on that front. We also recommend to try our settings and then tinker with them yourself to find the best values for you and your preferences.For more Battlefield 6 guides, make sure to check out our full guides hub for the game, which includes everything you need to know about EA's new hit shooter.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Eddie Makuch\n   on October 10, 2025 at 11:39AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Wildly popularSteam is the world's most popular destination for PC gaming, so if a game makes it to the top of the platform's charts, that's saying something. Recently, EA's Battlefield 6 launched on October 10 and reached more than 745,000 peak concurrent players. That makes it the No. 14 biggest Steam game of all time based on concurrent players. It's the second time that Battlefield 6 ranks in the top 20 as well, as the game's open beta stands at No. 2 with more than 520,000 peak concurrent players.In this post, we're rounding up the top 20 most popular games of all time on Steam based on peak concurrent users. The data was supplied by SteamDB.There are some important things to know about this list. It includes both free-to-play and paid games, along with the non-traditional \"game\" called Banana where players continuously click the banana until they get a new one.Another thing to know is that the numbers in this list do not represent a game's entire reach, as the figures pertain only to Steam games on PC. Plenty of the games on this list are available via other PC storefronts, on console, or Game Pass. Finally, the nature of concurrent players means it's only a snapshot of one moment in time. The peak gaming hours in North America and Asia, for example, do not overlap.Finally, you might expect GTA 5 to show up on this list, but it does not, despite being one of the best-selling video games in history. That's because GTA 5 on PC via Steam recently split into two games--GTA V Legacy and GTA V Enhanced. The peak concurrent records for those games are 364,548 for GTA V Legacy and 187,059 for GTA V Enhanced. Combined, this would amount to more than 551,000 people, which would squeeze into the top 20.20. Battlefield 6 Open Beta - 521,079Record achieved on August 9, 2025.19. Path of Exile 2 – 578,569 Record achieved on December 8, 2024.18. Hollow Knight: Silksong - 587,150Record achieve on September 6, 2025.17.

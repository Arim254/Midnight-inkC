Flickering Threat requires you to jump into the Dam Battlegrounds map and fix up a power generator, so don't think you're getting any time off today. And if you're feeling a little lost on how to complete this quest, we're here to help you out.While you don't need to extract to complete Flickering Threat, you will need 4 Wires to repair the generator during the quest, so make sure to add those to your inventory or loot them from the Power Generation Complex while you're exploring. Without these in your inventory, the quest can not be progressed.When you're ready to tackle Flickering Threat, follow the steps below.Where to find the Generator HallThe Generator Hall is located on the left side of the Power Generation Complex in the northern region of the Dam Battlegrounds map. It's a high-traffic location that is often filled with both ARC and raiders, so come prepared for a fight just in case.Generator HallOnce you reach the Generator Hall, you'll be prompted to repair a generator. Here's to hoping you remembered to bring 4 Wires!How to repair the generatorTo repair the generator, head to the location on the map above and look for long openings in the ground. Use these to drop inside the Generator Hall. You can also get to this room via nearby doors and hallways, but dropping in saves a lot of time.Repair the generator using 4 Wires.Once inside, stand between the two elevators and look at the end of the westernmost one to see a prompt to repair it using 4 Wires. Interact with this prompt to finish your repairs. However, you'll now need to flip a power switch.Leave the Generator Hall via the southernmost door at the end of the hall. Follow the stairs up and through two more doors, then turn immediately left and pass through an additional two doors. In this room will be a box in the corner that you can interact with to turn the power on and complete the quest.Interact with this box to turn the power on.In this same room is a staircase leading up and onto the surface right near the North Complex Elevator. You can use this extraction point to return to Speranza--though you should be careful while doing so, as raiders frequently camp this spot and may try to kill you on sight. So, take it slow, and stay in cover while waiting for the elevator, then extract to return safely to Speranza.For more, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders is probably the last game you'd expect to need to go beehive hunting, but that's exactly what you'll need to do in the aptly-named Bees! quest--and shoutout to Embark Studios for the Arrested Development reference. This quick and straightforward quest sends you to Blue Gate to snag one of these honey-filled bee homes from the Olive Grove POI, and we'll tell you exactly where to get your hands on it.You'll need to extract with the beehive in your inventory to get credit for the quest's completion, so you'd do well to bring an augment that possesses a safe pocket so that you can toss this quest item in there for safekeeping--you know, just in case some other raider decides to get fiesty with you. Don't worry--the bees won't sting, though.When you're ready to get your hands sticky with honey, here's how to find a beehive for the Bees! quest.Where to find a beehive for the Bees! questTo collect a beehive, you'll need to visit the Olive Grove POI on the Blue Gate map. This area is located in the southern region of the map and happens to be a very active spot for raiders since Olives are a hot commodity. With this in mind, make sure you wave and ask to be friends if you don't want to catch any fire from folks while you're snagging the beehive here.Find the beehive here.When you arrive to the location on the map above, you'll find a little shack. If you listen closely, you can probably hear the bees swarming nearby. Look under the roof on the side of the shack to spot the beehive and plenty of little bees flying around. Interact with it to add it to your inventory.Interact with the beehive to pick it up.With the beehive acquired, you'll need to extract and take back to Speranza to finish the Bees! quest. The Forest Airshaft is to your northwest, while the Overlook Airshaft can be visited by heading northeast. Head to whichever one is open based on how much time is left in the map, as they're both likely to be equally dangerous. Keep a lookout for rogue raiders and any patrolling ARC, hit the button, drop inside, and interact with the computer to get back to Speranza and finish things up.For more on Arc Raiders, we've compiled a full quest list for you.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.In a message posted to the official Halo site, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on \"multiple Halo titles in development.\" This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been saying for over a year now that there are multiple new Halo games in development.\"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us,\" reads the statement. \"While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.\"The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of the original Halo that will bring the franchise to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about a live-service Halo game, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed some light on the Halo MMO from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the Halo remake \"warms my heart,\" while another former Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

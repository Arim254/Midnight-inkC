Arc Raiders came in behind at No. 2, followed by Dispatch at No. 3, Battlefield 6 at No. 4, and NBA 2K26 rounding out the top 5 for the US.Among PlayStation 4 games, Red Dead Redemption 2 kept a firm grasp on both European and North American gamers. But that was about the only direct area of agreement they had this month. Although many of the titles on both lists were the same, the order was drastically different aside from the top slot.Alien: Rogue Incursion VR topped both charts for the top 10 VR2 games, although the selection has been lacking in that category for some time. It wasn't until the free-to-play games that North American and European tastes diverged for the top slot. American and Canadian gamers favored Where Winds Meet, while Europeans chose Battlefield Redsec.You can find the full breakdown of PlayStation's top games for November 2025 in North America and Europe below."

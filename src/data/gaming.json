    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Electronic Arts has announced another impending server shutdown. The developer has confirmed that after seven years and 50+ updates, The Sims Mobile will go offline for good on January 20, 2026.At 1:59 PM UTC that day, the game will no longer be playable at all. There is no offline mode, so the game will be gone for good at this time.\"The Sims Mobile and The Sims community as a whole are full of creativity, kindness, and imagination. You've amazed us with your stories, builds, and Sims. We're proud to have shared this journey with you,\" the developer said.There will be a number of events coming to The Sims Mobile ahead of the shutdown, now through January 2026, and you can see a complete rundown on EA's website (via PC Gamer).Say goodbye to The Sims Mobile.The final update for The Sims Mobile went live today, October 20, and from this date forward, players cannot buy any in-game packs or spend real money. Players who have a balance of SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets can continue to use these until the game closes in January 2026. Unspent currency will not be eligible for a refund after January 20, 2026.The October 20 update also added \"unlimited energy\" to The Sims Mobile, which will help players progress more quickly while the game remains online.On October 21, The Sims Mobile will be delisted from mobile game stores. Anyone who has the game installed currently or previously, however, can keep playing until January 2026.EA also announced that on January 6, 2026, all Build Mode and Create A Sim items will be unlocked for everyone. \"We want to give everyone the opportunity to build their dream home, design their perfect Sims, and experience everything The Sims Mobile has to offer before the servers close,\" the developer said.EA regularly closes servers for older titles for a variety of reasons, but the company did not provide any details on why The Sims Online is being taken offline in January 2026. The announcement of the game's upcoming closure came not long after EA announced that it was selling itself to an investor consortium including Saudi Arabia for $55 billion.While The Sims Mobile is coming to an end, EA continues to support The Sims 4 with new content, but it's sold so much DLC for that game that the company doesn't plan to make The Sims 5.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The 619-piece brick-built model of the dragon Alduin is discounted to only $32.49 (was $54). This deal is slightly better than Amazon's offer during Big Deal Days ($36). Check out the impressive Skyrim collectible and two Fallout 4-inspired building sets below.                                                                                                      The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Alduin Collector Set (619 Pieces)                                                                $32.49 (was $54)                                                                                                                                                                                    Mega's 619-piece Skyrim building set is quite impressive considering the budget-friendly price. Alduin has an appropriately intimidating wingspan of 25.5 inches. Though this is a brick-building set, Mega utilized cloth for the wings, which gives it a more realistic appearance.Alduin is essentially a buildable action figure with articulated joints. You can open Alduin's mouth to make it look like he's using Fire or Frost Breath, adjust his legs, and twist his wings to make it appear as if the god-king is about to take flight. The buildable flight stand has an adjustable lever that helps create additional poses. A Skyrim logo plaque attaches to the front of the stand.Alduin was the ruler of Skyrim throughout the Merethic Era. The legendary dragon has multiple nicknames, but Mega opted to go with Alduin's best-known \"World Eater\" moniker.The set also comes with a Dragonborn figure that is fittingly small in comparison. That said, the player-character figure is fairly detailed in its own right. Dovah-Kiin comes with multiple removable accessories, including the signature helmet from Skyrim, a sword, and chest armor.                                                                                                                            Fallout: Red Rocket Truck Stop Collector Set (824 Pieces)                                                                $70 (was $86.39)                                                                                                                                                                                    The 824-piece Red Rocket Truck Stop is the largest of the trio of Bethesda Mega Bloks sets that launched last fall. Unlike the Skyrim set, the Red Rocket Truck Stop was cheaper during Big Deal Days; Amazon had a limited-time deal that dropped the price to $55.The ramshackle truck stop itself utilizes most of the pieces, but this kit also comes with a Sole Survivor figure, T60 Power Armor figure and buildable rig stand, Dogmeat the Dog, a Nuka Cola vending machine, and other accessories like a tiny Pip Boy figure.You could display the T60 Power Armor figure alongside the five from the other set, or all six figures could take over the truck stop.                                                                                                                            Fallout T-60 Power Armor Collection (327 Pieces)                                                                $32 | Amazon Exclusive                                                                                                                                                                                    The Fallout T-60 Power Armor Collection isn't on sale, but Fallout fans who buy the Red Rocket Truck Stop should keep it on their radar. Exclusive to Amazon, the collection comes with five small action figures with designs inspired by Fallout 4.Vault-TecBrotherhood of Steel PaladinRustedHot Rod FlamesMilitaryThe Power Armor Collection is more of a miniature action figure set than a building kit, but you will piece together five rigs that serve as display stands. Each of the figures can hold a small accessory such as a bottle of Nuka Cola Dark, a shotgun, or an issue of Hot Rodder Magazine.

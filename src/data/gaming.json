    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fortnite's big crossover with The Simpsons is now live, and it brings with it a host of content themed around the longrunning animated series. Players can purchase the battle pass to unlock Homer and Stupid Sexy Flanders skins (among other cosmetics and items), but you don't have to spend anything extra to unlock a free glider based on Springfield's most famous aliens if you meet a few requirements.As part of the collaboration, Epic and Disney are offering up the Kang and Kodos glider for people who link their MyDisney and Epic accounts by the end of February 2026. If you have Disney+, that will be the same MyDisney account for most cases. Here's how it works:How to link MyDisney and Epic Games accounts:Go to your Epic Games accountClick \"Linked Accounts\"Click the link under \"MyDisney\"Follow the prompts to link your MyDisney and Epic Games accountsThe Kang and Kodos glider. In a FAQ, Epic explained that account-linking is not supported in all regions, so it simply might not be possible where you live, unfortunately. Another thing to note is that only one MyDisney account can be linked to an Epic Games account.Epic Games also clarified that, although the only way to get the Kang and Kodos glider right now is by linking accounts, the developer may offer it for real-money purchase starting in March 2026 at the earliest.The Simpsons are taking over Fortnite for a month, and right now you can dive into a new map with various Springfield landmarks, including Moe's Tavern and the nuclear power plant where Homer works.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                World of Warcraft may soon receive a new form of premium currency called Hearthsteel, one that will likely be used to buy housing-specific items.A datamine by Wowhead of the alpha build for WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion revealed the currency and a number of icons that show increasingly larger amounts of it, reminiscent of the icons used to denote premium currency bundles. The currencies are linked to a description that states they are part of a housing market bundle.          While Blizzard has not yet released official details about how Hearthsteel will work or what it will be used for, it's likely it will be similar to that of Trader's Tender, another premium currency used for the game's Trading Post vendor. Trader's Tender is primarily earned in-game by completing monthly challenges. The currency can't be bought on its own in the in-game shop but is included as part of other shop cosmetic bundles. It's also given out as a reward for preordering various editions of WoW's next expansion as well, with more expensive versions of the expansion granting more of the currency.Hearthsteel might be used similarly in that it's something players may be able to earn by playing but also acquire by buying certain cosmetics on the store. Blizzard has already confirmed it will be selling housing related cosmetics via the shop, so Hearthsteel could potentially be included as part of those bundles for use at a specific housing-item vendor, similar to the Trading Post.Until Blizzard officially outlines its plans, players will be left to speculate wildly about another form of microtransaction coming to the MMORPG, something one would think Blizzard would like to explain and justify sooner rather than later.Assuming Hearthsteel will be coming alongside housing early access as part of WoW's 11.2.7 patch, players might not have wait long to learn more. The patch is expected to arrive in December. Midnight does not yet have an official release date but is expected to arrive in February 2026 based on a datamine revealing a date for the expansion's pre-patch.Midnight's pre-patch will add the entirity of WoW's housing system by introducing Neighborhood events. For those wanting to get a head start on decorating their Azerothian dream home, a new WoW add-on shows all of the housing items tied to existing in-game achievements that can be earned right now.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                One of the recurring themes from a vocal segment of Battlefield 6 fans before and after launch was a desire to see the game free of Call of Duty-style ridiculous skins. The dev team responded by telling fans that Battlefield 6 would be \"a gritty, realistic shooter.\" But after releasing the recent \"Wicked Grin\" skin, Battlefield Studios has quietly removed the light blue outfit from the lineup.Much like an apparent orange skin and an earlier leaked skin, the response to the \"Wicked Grin\" outfit was largely swift and negative.\"[What do you mean?] That is classic naval camouflage, because of all that water. Just find a fountain and you are golden,\" wrote one Reddit user. \"LMAO this is not grounded and horrible looking,\" added another fan. \"Doesn't even look cool. What a mess.\"After the response from players, Battlefield Studios re-released this outfit in more conventional military uniform colors and left the light blue shades behind. Battlefield 6 recently received a number of new cosmetics in the Season 1 battle pass.EA recently announced a new mode, Casual Breakthrough, which will let Battlefield 6 players earn Career XP, Weapon XP and Battle Pass XP, while also accruing points towards challenges. This mode will only feature 16 real players in each lobby, with 32 bots to fill out the matches. A new DLC map, Blackwell Fields, has drawn scorn from players for being a \"sniper fest.\"One aspect that seems to be well-received so far is the game's free-to-play battle royale mode, Battlefield Redsec. For new and veteran players, GameSpot has put together seven Redsec tips that you need to know before diving into the game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

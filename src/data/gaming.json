Doster\n   on December 8, 2025 at 11:12AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Black Ops 7 has integrated with Call of Duty: Warzone for Season 1, adding the full BO7 weapon pool and attachments into the battle royale. While you can still use weapons from the last few years, the most powerful options are going to be the new Black Ops 7 guns. In this guide, we'll provide some recommended weapon builds for Warzone in Season 1 of Black Ops 7.Season 1 removes the Wildcard perks from Black Ops 6, and instead, you'll have Overkill by default. This means you can equip a second primary weapon without the need to select any specific perks to your loadouts. This also means there's no Gunfighter Wildcard, so you are limited to five attachments for each weapon build.The Gunsmith is mostly the same this year; however, one new addition is Black Ops 7's weapon build code feature. Weapon build codes are unique to each weapon and a specific set of attachments, making it easy to share and receive custom weapon builds.Simply hit L3 to view your options while you are in the Gunsmith. This will let you import a weapon build code to use. Additionally, any weapon builds you create in the Gunsmith will have a code generated at the bottom-left corner of your screen.We'll list the attachments for each build and include the unique weapon code so you can easily use it.Season 1 of Black Ops 7 overhauls Warzone's perk selection. Make sure to check out our guide for all Warzone perks for BO7, including some recommended perks to try for your loadouts.All our recommended Warzone loadouts can be viewed below, and we also have suggested multiplayer loadouts.MXR-17The MXR-17 is a powerful and easy-to-use assault rifle for long-range fights in Warzone. The recommended attachments will boost the gun's damage range, bullet velocity, and increase ammo count.The Greaves AccuSpot 3X is a great optic for most long-range builds, but if you're playing small map Resurgence and don't want the bigger scope, you can swap this out for something simple and clean like the Lethal Tools ELO.Recommended MXR-17 attachments:Optic: Greaves AccuSpot 3XMuzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: 17\" Greaves Scourge BarrelMagazine: Rhodes Drum MagStock: Winch StockBuild code: A03-26ERW-58T9U-11MK.78The MK.78 light machine gun is a heavy-hitting, long-range option for Warzone. The recommended attachments will help you reduce the gun's recoil, making this much more manageable to use at range.The recommended magazine is a Prestige attachment, so you might not have this unlocked yet, but it's a very impactful attachment for improving mobility and reducing recoil. You can substitute the Gravepack Extended Belt if needed to simply boost the ammo count until you unlock it.Recommended MK.78 attachments:Optic: Greaves AccuSpot 3XMuzzle: RL-7.62 CompensatorBarrel: 25\" EAM Heavy BarrelUnderbarrel: Bowen Sentry ForegripMagazine: MFS Heatshield Belt FedBuild code: L01-T49HC-5HZW-1X9 MaverickThe X9 Maverick is a three-round burst assault rifle with high damage, and it can be a powerful choice for long-range fights. The recommended attachments will greatly boost the gun's damage range and bullet velocity, as well as improve the aim-down-sight speed.Recommended X9 Maverick attachments:Optic: Greaves AccuSpot 3XMuzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: 16\" OS-Density BarrelRear Grip: Pillory GripFire Mods: 4.73 Caseless OverpressuredBuild code: A04-2JEC3-WMFDM-VJ11DS20 MirageThe DS20 Mirage assault rifle is another solid pick for assault rifles in Black Ops 7, but this gun also has a great build for a sniper support class. The recommended attachments will boost the ammo count, reduce recoil, and improve movement speed to make this gun work great for close to medium-range fights.Recommended DS20 Mirage attachments:Optic: Lethal Tools ELOMuzzle: Redwell 5.56 CompensatorMagazine: Andean Extended MagStock: Assault Division StockFire Mods: Recoil Sync UnitBuild code: A05-AUXZ3-94Q55-1MPC-25The MPC-25 submachine gun doesn't feel very powerful in multiplayer, but it's a powerful gun with a fast time-to-kill in battle royale. The recommended attachments will help reduce a lot of the weapon's recoil, and it will also boost the ammo count.This recommended build includes an optic for cleaner sights, but if you don't mind the iron sights, it's worth swapping the optic for the 14.5\" VAS Ashe Barrel for an increase to the damage range.Recommended MPC-25 attachments:Optic: Lethal Tools ELOMuzzle: K&S Brake-28Underbarrel: VAS Drift Lock ForegripMagazine: Sustain-25 Extended MagFire Mods: Recoil Sync UnitBuild code: S06-AV4J3-MWE75-1Kogot-7Season 1's new Kogot-7 submachine gun is another solid choice for close-range combat in battle royale. The Kogot-7 does have a bit of recoil, but the recommended attachments will work to reduce quite a bit of the gun's kick.Recommended Kogot-7 attachments:Muzzle: Hawker Series 45Barrel: 13.5\" Canis-05 BarrelUnderbarrel: Vas Drift Lock ForegripMagazine: Vex Expanse MagFire Mods: Buffer SpringsBuild code: S10-56XPL-8B31VS ReconThe VS Recon is a deadly bolt-action sniper rifle, and this is a popular choice for sniping in Season 1. The recommended attachments will increase the damage range and bullet velocity, and also reduce some of the weapon's kick.The recommended underbarrel attachment is a Prestige attachment, so you might not have unlocked this yet, and you can substitute it for the Stetig-C Handguard if needed.Recommended VS Recon attachments:Muzzle: Monolithic SuppressorBarrel: 23\" G-Force BarrelUnderbarrel: MFS R-Stop HandguardRear Grip: R-1 Shelf GripFire Mods: 7.62 NATO OverpressuredBuild code: R01-21WSG-L369K-P711    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The PlayStation 5 dominated Black Friday sales in the US, according to new data shared by Circana, which tracks gaming sales in the US.Circana's Mat Piscatella said Sony's console made up 47% of total Black Friday week hardware unit sales, outpacing the Switch 2 (24%) and Nex Playground (14%). He didn't share any data about how Xbox performed.\"So, yeah, Black Friday week is extremely promotional for video games. Stuff that does not price promote (generally speaking, here) does not see much of a seasonal lift at all from the prior week (usually none). BF Week performance can correlate closely to what's being promoted and by how much,\" Piscatella said.He added: \"On the hardware side, PS5 saw the most extensive discounting. So, it got a big sales lift. Wouldn't take much more away from the week than that, tbh.\"Indeed, the PS5 was discounted substantially for Black Friday, with Sony selling the consoles for about $100 off. Retailers offered discounts on Xbox consoles and the Nex Playground as well. For anyone unaware, the Nex Playground is an AI-powered console similar to Kinect, featuring a camera to track bodies for interacting with games. The Nex Playground outsold every PS5 and Xbox model the previous week in the US.In the UK, the PS5 dominated as well, making up 62% of all console sales. By comparison, Switch 2 made up 23% of sales, with Xbox following with 10%. The PS5 Pro in particular was a big hit in the UK for Black Friday, recording its best week for sales since launch in November 2024.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                As of November 18, Fortnite Crew is now an included benefit with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. That certainly appears, on its face, like a pretty solid deal, but on the other hand, Game Pass Ultimate got a significant price bump at the same time Fortnite Crew was added, so there are some other factors you might want to take into account before signing up.Let's take a look at the details to see what kind of value this really is.Table of Contents [hide]What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite CrewWhat Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costs Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?What you get with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Fortnite CrewXbox Game Pass Ultimate includes a large library of games for both Xbox and PC, including most titles published by Microsoft and its subsidiaries, which include Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. Yes, that includes the newly released Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The Ultimate plan is the only version of Game Pass that is guaranteed to include new games published under the Xbox banner on day one, and it's also the only tier to include subscriptions from two other publishers--Ubisoft Classics, and EA Play. Fortnite Crew benefits are exactly the same if you subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate as they would be if you bought a standalone Crew subscription. You get access to the current battle pass, music pass, OG pass, and Lego Pass as long as you're subscribed, you'll receive 1,000 V-Bucks and a Crew skin each month you're subscribed, and you'll also get the premium Rocket Pass for Rocket League.What Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Fortnite Crew costsXbox Game Pass Ultimate now costs $30 a month, a sizable jump from its previous price of $20. By itself, Fortnite Crew costs $12 per month.Do I need to have an Xbox console to get Fortnite Crew on Game Pass Ultimate?There are many ways to play Xbox these days, including consoles, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, and on handhelds like the ROG Xbox Ally--and all Game Pass games are playable via any of those methods. To receive your Crew benefits, you'll need to log in to Fortnite on any of the above-mentioned Xbox platforms at least once each month, and then you can use those benefits while playing on any other platform.But it wouldn't make a lot of sense to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate unless you plan to play some of the other games that are included. It's not a good value to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate just for Crew.What if I already have Fortnite Crew on Xbox?If you sign up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate while you have an active Fortnite Crew subscription through Xbox, the Crew subscription will automatically be canceled. The official FAQs do not say whether you'd receive a pro-rated refund or credit for additional time that might have been remaining on your Crew subscription in that situation, but it would be standard practice to do so.What if I already have Fortnite Crew on a different platform?If you're subscribed to Fortnite Crew through, say, the PlayStation Store, you won't get any additional bonuses in Fortnite from being subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate until the subscription on PlayStation ends. So you may want to cancel your existing Crew subscription and let it run out before signing up for Game Pass Ultimate, if the Crew subscription is one of the deciding factors in your purchase.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Normally $100, the mClassic Retro Edition is on sale for only $45.15, the all-time best price for the HDMI accessory. The Retro Edition is designed for gamers who want to improve the visual experience of older games originally designed for 4:3 aspect ratio displays when playing on modern HD and 4K TVs.The Retro Edition is one of three different models of the mClassic manufactured by Marseille. It launched in 2025 alongside the mClassic Switch Edition, which is discounted to $74.25 (was $100). The mClassic Switch Edition is tailored around upscaling the visuals on Switch and other widescreen platforms like Steam Deck, Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3. The Retro and Switch Editions have one of the enhancement modes found in the mClassic Original Edition, which is currently priced at $89 (was $100), while also offering two new visual modes geared toward retro gaming or Switch/Steam Deck, depending on which model you pick.mClassic Retro Edition - N64, GameCube, SNES, PS2, PS1, other 4:3 platformsmClassic Switch Edition - Switch, Steam Deck, other 16:9 platformsmClassic Original Edition - Switch, Steam Deck, and retro platformsLet's take a closer look at all three options below.                                                                                                       mClassic Graphics Upscaler (Retro Edition)                                                                $45.15 (was $100)                                                                                                                                                                                    The mClassic Retro Edition has three different modes geared toward consoles that released prior to the high-definition era. If you are buying the mClassic to play games on SNES, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64 or any other console designed for 4:3 aspect ratio, the Retro Edition is the one to pick.It has three modes you can switch between:Retro Mode: Display games in original 4:3 aspect ratio with upscaled resolution.Vintage Mode: Replicates CRT TV picture and audio in 4:3 aspect ratio. This mode does not alter the colors, lighting, or sound, as it's geared toward authenticity.Vintage Enhance Mode: A mix of Retro and Vintage Modes, as it balances authenticity with visual fidelity improvements.Note: For game consoles without an HDMI port--like the GameCube, SNES, and N64--you'll need an adapter like one of these $20-$30 models from Amazon.                                                                                                                            mClassic Graphics Upscaler (Nintendo Switch Edition)                                                                $74.25 (was $100)                                                                                                                                                                                    Note: This will not provide any benefits with Nintendo Switch 2.The mClassic Switch Edition focuses solely on modern gaming platforms with widescreen aspect ratios (16:9). When it comes to modern HD consoles, Marseille has always geared the mClassic toward the Switch, which is why Nintendo's console is in the new model's name. But the mClassic Switch Edition can be used with Steam Deck, PS3, Xbox 360, and other devices with widescreen aspect ratios that lack 1440p and/or 4K resolution.Once again, performance on Switch varies by game, but the mClassic Switch Edition is capable of upscaling to 1440p at 60fps.You can toggle between three different visual modes on the mClassic Switch Edition:Enhancement On: This mode offers all of the same benefits as the \"Enhancement On\" mode in the original mClassic.Switch Plus: Recreates Switch handheld mode while playing on TV. If you think Switch games look better in handheld mode--and you aren't alone in thinking that--this mode might be preferred over the original enhancement mode.Switch Enhance Mode: This mode aims to offer some of the key benefits of OLED TVs, namely improved contrast and clarity when dark colors are displayed.                                                                                                                            mClassic Graphics Upscaler (Original Model)                                                                $89 (was $100)                                                                                                                                                                                    The original mClassic Graphics Upscaler offers a combination of the two recently released specialty editions. It has features and modes designed for games that render in 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen) as well as tech created to enhance the picture quality and performance of retro games developed for 4:3 aspect ratio TVs.The mClassic offers noticeable visual upgrades--though the degree to which you notice the differences depends on how discerning you are when it comes to graphics. Switch games can be upscaled up to 1440p at 60fps. It has built-in anti-aliasing tech that smooths jagged edges and sharpens the picture. The exact boost in visual fidelity varies based on the game, in our experience.On consoles with HDMI such as Switch, PS3, and Xbox 360 (besides first-gen 360 consoles), all you need to do is plug it into your console, connect the included power cable, and then reconnect your HDMI cable from your TV into the mClassic dongle.The mClassic substantially improves the overall picture quality and playability of game consoles from the pre-HD era--Super Nintendo, N64, GameCube, etc.--on modern flat-screen 4K and HD TVs. A CRT TV is still clearly the best option for retro gaming, but the mClassic is a great option for those who don't want to deal with the bulk of a box TV or the hassle of finding one in general.There's a switch on the dongle to flip between modern and retro modes. The third \"mode\" on the original mClassic simply turns the device's graphics processor off.Enhancement On: Improves the visuals/performance of widescreen platforms, including Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.Retro Mode: Allows you to play retro games in 4:3 aspect ratio on modern displays. Markedly improves the picture quality of games originally designed for CRT TVs.Note: Game consoles without an HDMI port--like the aforementioned retro Nintendo consoles--require the mClassic to be connected to an adapter, such as one of these $20-$30 adapters for GameCube, N64, and SNES.                         Marseille recommends locking your Nintendo Switch to 720p while docked--the resolution for handheld mode--for the best results. Based on our testing, we agree with that recommendation, but don't forget to turn 1080p back on before you play without the mClassic Original or mClassic Switch.If you're worried about an increase in latency due to your HDMI cable passing through the dongle, we've never noticed any. Marseille claims the device adds an average of 0.2ms on this front, but you'd probably need to be a cyborg to notice. The mClassic also has lossless audio passthrough.Keep in mind you also need to be playing on a TV or monitor with support for 1440p or 4K resolution to take full advantage of the mClassic's features. However, if you are playing on a 1080p panel, the mClassic still offers an improvement in picture quality.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nThe final chapter of DK's latest adventure is a bonanza of nostalgic delight.By \n    Jason Fanelli\n   on January 3, 2026 at 9:00AM PST\n              \n                Note: MASSIVE spoilers for the final section of Donkey Kong Bananza. Read on at your own risk!All throughout Donkey Kong Bananza, DK and Pauline are battling Void Company and its leader Void Kong. However, with each new level, there's a reptilian presence permeating the experience.Some enemies bear a striking resemblance to the Kremlings of DK adventures past, hidden treasure chests are green and bear what look like crocodile teeth, even the Banandium Root--Void Company's main goal in digging through the planet--has a certain familiarity to it I just can't put my finger on.In the moment, they feel like simple winks and nods to the older players (like me) who have adventured with DK before. Then, I reach Chapter 15, and the climactic confrontation with Void Kong.After a tough battle worthy of a final boss encounter, we see what certainly feels like part of the final cutscene. Pauline saves DK just as he saved her in the beginning of the game, completing her journey from stage-frightened child to confident performer, and the two stand smiling at one another, the Banandium Root just out of view. I'm expecting a fade to black… but then Void Kong charges the Root…… he dives toward his prize in order to claim the wish legend says it grants …… the music swells, the screen fades to white …The eye-opening reveal…and then, an eye opens. A massive, vein-ridden, green eyeball fills the screen. Void Kong is punched into oblivion by a scaly green first. The screen shifts to a pair of giant green feet and slowly pans upward, past the massive golden belly that used to be called the Banandium Root, and we see his face, standing in opposition to Donkey Kong, for the first time in 18 years.King K. Rool has returned.He thanks DK for freeing him, and explains that he and his crew had been trapped down there after trying to claim the real Banandium Root for themselves. Now that he's free, he can continue his quest to claim the root. The big croc then jumps one level further into the planet, to its actual core, and the endgame of Donkey Kong Bananza begins.Have you ever seen that old WWE clip of Stone Cold Steve Austin returning to help Mankind in 1999? Substitute the sound of glass breaking with the sight of K. Rool's eye opening, and that wild crowd cheer is what played through my head at that moment.The setup is fantastic, as the game slowly and routinely plants a seed of memory in your head with the previously mentioned casual references. The approach to Void Kong in Chapter 15, as well as the boss fight itself, feels like a fitting climax to Bananza's story. In the blink of an eye, what seemed like an epilogue turned into one final prologue, and I'm still smiling like an idiot thinking about it as I write this, a full five months after seeing it for the first time.The nostalgia pops don't end there, however. The surprise 16th layer of the planet is a gauntlet of classic Kremling enemies, each with their original sound effect from the Super Nintendo Donkey Kong Country games. Kremlings make that \"awh\" sound when you punch them, just as they did when you jumped on them in 1994. The massive bees called Zingers still buzz that staticy buzz, and they still hurt DK if he touches them. The buzzards known as Neckys make the exact same squawking noise when they charge you, which sent me warping back to my childhood like Anton Ego tasting Remy's ratatouille.However, in another clever twist, the Kremling grunts found here attack DK and Pauline just as they had in previous layers, when they were the rock monsters hiding gilded skeletons that bore resemblance to the Kremlings of old. With the facade now lifted, it's even more apparent how much of Bananza was telegraphing the Kremling twist right in front of my eyes, and yet I barely gave the hints a second thought.The returned King K. RoolThis is all before you actually get to K. Rool himself, who battles you with his blunderbuss in a fun matchup that, honestly, ends rather quickly. You claim the Root, a massive pile of bananas emerges to take DK and Pauline back to the surface (just go with it), and the credits start to roll. However, in another callback to Donkey Kongs past, these are fake credits with the names of Kremlings instead of developers, and K. Rool rises and gives chase. Chef's kiss.The next phase of the battle then begins, as DK fends off a jetpack-piloting K. Rool on his way to the surface. This part is backed by a hard rock version of Gangplank Galleon, K. Rool's original boss battle music from Donkey Kong Country, and this version has dethroned the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate version for the title of \"Best Gangplank Galleon rendition of all time\" in my humble opinion.Once DK and Pauline reach the surface, they emerge in New Donk City from Super Mario Odyssey, adding a second and more recent flavor of nostalgia. K. Rool claims the Banandium Root, floods the city with rotten, mushy bananas, and DK must battle through Kremlings and surging banana mush to confront the conniving croc one last time.K. Rool, King of RotFor the final battle, K. Rool uses the power of the Root to transform into a massive, banana-fueled version of himself called K. Rool, King of Rot--which sounds as if K. Rool was researching the works of one Hidetaka Miyazaki in his prolonged absence. Once this version of the rotten reptile is defeated, the adventure finally comes to an end, marked by the actual credits this time.All of this is a master class of mixing nostalgia with new, and creates an experience that will stick with me for a while. Despite the reptilian references sprinkled in every layer of the game, Void Kong is presented as the big bad of the story. He's a constant presence in cutscenes, barking insults at DK while also barking orders at his subjects … much in the same way K. Rool used to do.Then, once Void is defeated, the mask slips off as K. Rool returns, and suddenly it's a trip down memory lane. The previously-mentioned enemies are obvious callbacks, but the different sections of Layer 16 are connected by mine cart rides, while the surrounding golden glow of the Banandium Root's influence has a similar feel to that of running into Kong's Banana Hoard in the original Donkey Kong Country. Seeing K. Rool return in such a wonderfully executed way, and then having that moment enhanced by all of the other callbacks that appear while trying to thwart the returned ruler, is the kind of pure gaming happiness that Nintendo has delivered since the days of my youth.Welcome back, King K. Rool. I look forward to our next encounter, whenever that may be. Hopefully, you'll be around for more than just the final challenge.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

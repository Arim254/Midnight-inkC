How will it do this? With an \"industry-first neurotechnology-powered\" headset that can potentially improve focus and accuracy in competitive games. It's also designed to use \"non-invasive\" neurotechnology, so you don't have to worry about getting a few cybernetic upgrades to be compatible with the device.HyperX and Neurable's headset conceptGallery                                       Neurable and HyperX claim that testing with the in-development headset has resulted in faster reaction times of up to 38 milliseconds, improved accuracy by 3%, and a higher number of targets were hit during FPS training tasks when tested on esports players. The headset uses neural-sensing technology to track metrics like cognitive load and stress from a user's brainwaves.The AI-powered earpad sensors monitor EEG signals from your head, but it's worth noting that this isn't a magic bullet that will instantly improve your performance. You'll need to use the data from your sessions and training exercises to improve your ability to focus better during games.Don't expect the headset to be out anytime soon, as it's still in a very early stage of development. This is just one of several big reveals from the Consumer Electronics Showcase this week, as everything from lightweight 240Hz XR glasses, high-end gaming controllers, and concepts for Alexa-inspired AI anime assistants from Razer have been shown off.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on January 6, 2026 at 1:58AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Grass Pokémon are always a plentiful type to find out in the wild, regardless of what region you're exploring, but this can make it difficult to discern which are a notch above the rest. More often than not, you'll catch a Grass Pokémon to defeat one of the starter gyms or learn some HMs in the early generations. However, a Grass Pokémon rarely stays on your team thanks to its often low stats, many weaknesses, and limited move pools.Of course, as any Pokémon fan knows, the Grass typing can be used to great effect if you utilize the right Pokémon. Today, we'll be looking at the 10 best Grass Pokémon to use in a regular playthrough of the mainline games. For the most part, we'll be excluding legendary and mythical Pokémon as well as Ultra Beasts, as they would simply take over the list. We'll also try to spread out Pokémon from across different regional Pokédexes to showcase what all of the games offer with this type.This list is ranked from the tenth-best to the best Grass Pokémon.BreloomOriginal game: Ruby and SapphireType: Grass and FightingTo kick off the list, we have arguably the best Grass type in the entire Hoenn Pokédex. While Pokémon such as Ludicolo, Shifty, and Cacturne are all fine in their own right, Breloom can completely dominate the Hoenn games.Breloom has the rare Grass/Fighting dual typing, a 460 base stat total, and can be acquired extremely early in most games where it's available. It also has a decently wide move pool that provides plenty of coverage and setup moves. While Breloom won't be as good as a Grass type starter or even some of the other regular Grass types on this list, you shouldn't underestimate the Mushroom Pokémon.AbomasnowOriginal game: Diamond and PearlType: Grass and IceAbomansow makes it onto this list for a couple of reasons. First, its typing; Grass and Ice is a particularly tricky combination, as you need to avoid Fire types at all costs, and the Ice typing adds several additional weaknesses that Grass types usually don't have, such as Fighting, Rock, and Steel. However, as long as you utilize Abomasnow correctly, which usually involves a strategy surrounding Hail, you can turn it into a formidable Pokémon.Of course, Abomansow also has a Mega Evolution, which keeps its same typing but adds 100 points to its base stat total. If you can find a way to use Abomansow's Mega, then you can fight your way through most battles.RoseradeOriginal game: Diamond and PearlType: Grass and PoisonRoserade is a classic Grass and Poison type Pokémon, which you'll see plenty of on this list. However, what some of those other Pokémon don't have is a massive move pool that allows you to turn your Roserade into a frustratingly unstoppable opponent. Roserade has access to a few weather moves, which are great for double battles, and a slew of setup moves that make use of its Poison typing. You'll also be able to learn multiple Grass type attacks that use Roserade's huge special attack stat.Roserade can also learn a surprising number of Normal type moves, which allow you to make it even more versatile. All of this is combined with an impressive 510 base stat total that makes Roserade a highly underrated Grass type. You'll have to do some work to evolve its previous forms, Budew and Roselia, but the end result is more than worth it.VenusaurOriginal game: Red and BlueType: Grass and PoisonIt wouldn't be right to have a list of the best Grass Pokémon without a nod to the OG. Venusaur was the original Grass type starter in Pokémon and still remains one of the best all these years later. Of course, the base Venusaur is always going to be outmatched by its Mega counterpart, which is available in a handful of games. Mega Venusaur is right up there with the best Grass types in all of Pokémon, but even if you're running through Fire Red, base Venusaur will provide a ton of utility.Outside of self-healing and setup moves, Venusaur will usually rely on the combination of Sunny Day and Solarbeam to deal massive Grass type damage, at least in the early generations of Pokémon. You still have access to some lower-tier Grass attacks, but that combination, plus a couple of setup moves, is lethal against most opponents.AmoongussOriginal game: Black and WhiteType: Grass and PoisonOn the surface, Amoonguss might just seem like a standard two-stage evolution Pokémon that uses the common Grass/Poison dual typing. While Amoonguss won't blow you away with its attacks, it can carry a team thanks to the sheer number of setup moves and indirect attacks it can use. From Toxic to Rage Powder to Double Team, Amoonguss can be an absolute nightmare to fight against if you're on the wrong side of a battle.Aside from its moves, Amoonguss has a 464 base stat total with an abysmal 30 speed stat. However, it makes up for that by being pretty tanky and having even attack and defense stats. Amoonguss becomes even tankier with its hidden ability, Regenerator, which is fantastic in a competitive environment.Applin lineOriginal game: Sword and ShieldType: Grass and DragonWhy an apple is a Grass and Dragon type is beyond the entire Pokémon community, but it was about time this dual typing came into play. Applin was introduced in Generation 8 and features one of the most interesting evolution lines ever seen. Applin can evolve into three different Pokémon depending on what kind of apple item you give it. One of those evolutions, Dipplin, can then evolve into Hydrapple, which is a formidable Grass and Dragon type with a 540 base stat total.Hydrapple's speed leaves something to be desired, but its HP, special attack, and defense are all fantastic. That high special attack stat in particular makes it incredible, as you can teach it several high-damage special Grass and Dragon attacks. Speaking of which, Hydrapple has an enormous move pool, and it's still one of the more underrated Grass Pokémon.TangrowthOriginal game: PlatinumType: GrassTangrowth was one of the extra evolutions that was introduced with Platinum in Generation 4. It evolves from Tangela once the move Ancient Power has been learned, which allows you to usually get Tangrowth around the mid-game. Tangrowth excels in every stat except for special defense and speed, which you can certainly use to your advantage in certain situations. It's a pure Grass type, but can learn a wide variety of coverage attacks, such as Shock Wave, Earthquake, Sludge Bomb, Aerial Ace, and the list goes on.Thanks to this wide move pool, interesting stat distribution, and typing, Tangrowth is always going to be one of the best Grass types you can use, especially in Sinnoh.FerrothornOriginal game: Black and WhiteType: Grass and SteelFerrothorn remains the only Grass and Steel type in the entirety of Pokémon, excluding its pre-evolution Ferroseed and Kartana, an Ultra Beast from Generation 7. This dominant typing makes Ferrothorn four times weak to Fire, two times weak to Fighting, and that's it for its weaknesses. Ferrothorn also has a base stat total of 489, but this includes a horrid 54 special attack stat. Fortunately, a majority of its primary STAB attacks are physical, including Iron Head and Power Whip.While Ferrothorn's typing seems like it would limit its move pool, that's not the case at all. Ferrothorn can learn dozens of unique TMs, including great setup moves like Swords Dance, Hone Claws, and Double Team. This makes Ferrothorn one of the best tank Pokémon in Generation V, as well as most games after that.SceptileOriginal game: Ruby and SapphireType: GrassSceptile is the Grass starter from the Hoenn games and has remained one of the most popular Grass Pokémon of all time. While it tends to get overshadowed in Hoenn thanks to the dominance of Swampert, it's no slouch either. Sceptile is a pure Grass type with a blazing 120 speed stat and high special attack. The high special attack means you can take full advantage of Sceptile's signature move in Generation III, Leaf Blade, as well as the classic Sunny Day and Solarbeam combination.We also can't talk about Sceptile without mentioning its Mega Evolution. This gives Sceptile the lethal Grass/Dragon dual typing, making it even stronger, and leaves it with Ice as its main weakness.RillaboomOriginal game: Sword and ShieldType: GrassRillaboom is another pure Grass type, but unlike some of the other pures we've talked about on this list, it utilizes a high physical attack stat to mow down opponents. Boasting a 530 base stat total, Rillaboom allocates 125 of that to physical attack, allowing it to use Grass attacks like Wood Hammer and Solar Blade to dazzling effect.Rillaboom is also extremely tanky and gets even harder to take down in its Gigantamax form. Its signature G-Max move, Drum Solo, will put most enemy Pokémon into submission unless they're four times resistant to Grass. Overall, Rillaboom is the best starter for the Sword and Shield and one of the best starters in the entirety of Pokémon.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's been 12 years since Bruno Mars performed at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, but the musician has found a new big venue where he can sing without even leaving his home. This weekend, the hit Roblox game Steal a Brainrot is going to host a pop up performance by Bruno Mars that's a one-time only appearance.The official announcement went out on Roblox's social media channels. Mars' performance will be held on Saturday, January 17 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.Although musical acts like Stray Kids have performed in Roblox before, Mars will be the first to do so for Steal a Brainrot, which launched in May 2025. He's expected to sing his new single, I Just Might, as well as an older song, Locked Out of Heaven.To mark the occasion, players will have the chance to get a Bruno Mars Brainrot, as well as other related in-game items and traits.Steal a Brainrot, Grow a Garden, and the larger Roblox sandbox were among the top-trending topics on YouTube in 2025. There's even a Grow a Garden movie in development despite the game's lack of any identifiable story elements.However, Roblox has been dogged by accusations that it hasn't done enough to protect kids from child exploitation and grooming. According to a June 2024 Bloomberg investigation, the platform has had major issues with child predators. Florida and Texas even sued Roblox over that issue.Roblox has since introduced initiatives to keep children from talking to strangers, and to limit their interactions to kids roughly their own age. Earlier this month, Roblox continued its global rollout of a facial age-check system, but the results have been mixed at best.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                This Sunday's NFL playoffs divisional round matchup between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans will feature a World of Warcraft-themed attraction for tailgaters, and it's because Blizzard's data shows that its players love sports.The World of Warcraft: Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern, as it's called, is a marketing activation that's meant to promote WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. Inside the tavern, people can get a drink and watch World of Warcraft livestreams. They can also meet cosplayers and influencers; the Orc cosplayers will be inside the stadium for the game itself.The Midnight expansion adds player housing, which is something fans have been requesting for years. Blizzard is also partnering with real estate company Zillow on this branded partnership, according to Sports Business Journal.People can find the Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern outside Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mass. Blizzard Entertainment CMO Monica Austin said the team has been building the tavern at Blizzard's headquarters in Anaheim, California for months, and only just recently decided to host the event in Foxboro as opposed to Denver, where another Divisional round game will take place.But why have this kind of marketing campaign in the first place? Austin said  Blizzard's research has shown that lapsed and active WoW players also enjoy watching sports.\"We've done a tremendous amount of deep dives to understand who are our players, lapsed and active. One of the things we see consistently is that our players are over-indexed in watching sports. And for the NFL, it's top-three over-indexing sport,\" Austin said. \"We know our players are there. We know they're watching. This is a strategic way that we want to use to reach them.\"Midnight launches on March 2, and will revamp the game's nearly two-decade-old Blood Elf zones as well as introduce new areas, dungeons, and raids.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

For a limited time, players can earn Fallout operator skins and other themed rewards by unlocking them in free and paid event passes. Here's a look at all Fallout rewards in Call of Duty and how you unlock them during the event.Call of Duty's Fallout event runs from now until January 29. This adds operator skins and cosmetics themed around Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show. While there are plenty of free rewards to earn, you'll need to purchase the paid \"premium\" pass for 1,100 CoD Points ($10) if you want to unlock all items for the event.There are 20 rewards in total for the Fallout event. There are 10 rewards in the free pass, and 10 more optional rewards can be unlocked with the paid pass. The highlights of the free pass include two vault dweller operator skins and the season's new Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun. The paid pass is required to unlock Maximus and The Ghoul characters from the show.It's also worth noting that the character, Lucy MacLean, will arrive as a shop bundle at a later date. Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.All Fallout event rewards can be seen below. This is an XP-based event, so you'll simply need to grind XP across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. For multiplayer, objective modes like Kill Confirmed and Domination work best, while Plunder and Casual battle royale modes will yield more XP for Warzone. This is also a good time to use double XP tokens if you have them.It's worth noting that this crossover features Fallout-themed game modes and events across multiplayer, Zombies, Endgame, and Warzone.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Grand Theft Auto 6 is still a little over 10 months away, assuming its November 2026 release window holds. Earlier this week, GTA 6 watchers were unsettled when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier noted that the game might not be as \"content complete\" as Rockstar has said in the past, and he didn't rule out another delay. Some fans took that as if GTA 6 was already pushed back again, which is why Schreier has stepped forward to clarify his comments.During a recent appearance on the Button Mash podcast, Schreier said, \"The last I heard, [GTA 6] was still not content complete. That is to say people were still finishing things up, still finalizing levels, and missions, and seeing what is going to make it into the game.\" He added that he doesn't \"think anyone at Rockstar can tell you, with 100% certainty, that they will make it out in November.\"Schreier responded to reports based on his comments by reiterating that he \"wouldn't be shocked if GTA 6 'does' come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as [Red Dead Redemption 2].\" He also characterized some of the reports as, \"a complete misunderstanding of what I said.\"This is a complete misunderstanding of what I said, which is that I wouldn't be shocked if GTA6 *does* come out this fall, following the same delay pattern as RDR2. Of course another delay is possible. It's a video game. But this blog post is very misleading (just reach out to me - it's not hard!)[image or embed]  — Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier.bsky.social) January 8, 2026 at 6:28 AM\n  As Schreier and others have previously noted, Rockstar does have a history of delaying its AAA games, and GTA 6 in particular has already been pushed back twice. It's been reported that the current delay may cost Rockstar upwards of $60 million.Some analysts continue to make the case that GTA 6 could be $100 for its standard edition, which would potentially encourage other publishers to raise their prices as well. For now, Rockstar has yet to commit to a price for GTA 6.Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 19.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on January 8, 2026 at 9:36AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                South Park is coming to Fortnite on Friday, but this is not the sort of Fortnite collab that only adds skins to the item shop--though we're certainly getting a pile of skins. No, South Park is also taking over Fortnite's Battle Royale mode by introducing several major new gameplay overhauls (and we mean major) and taking over one of the major named locations on the map. Also, there's a completely free event pass that'll allow players to earn free South Park cosmetics by completing quests--yes, you'll actually have to play the game to earn these things.And, of course, there will be five skins in the item shop, all of which are the boys from South Park in mech suits--there's Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, and Butters. More importantly, there will also be a Towelie sidekick in the shop for all the sweaty gamers out there.New quad size: QuintsThe single biggest change being introduced with this crossover event is the addition of Quints, a five-player variety of the main Battle Royale mode, playable in both Build and Zero Build. It's the first time Epic has added a new squad size to BR since it added Trios about five years ago, so this is kind of a big deal. We don't know for sure if Quints will stick around beyond this event, though. Epic previously added a six-player version of Blitz Royale earlier this year, but removed it after a few weeks. Kenny TokenThe Kenny token, which you can find as random loot, is an entirely new gameplay concept for Battle Royale. If you have one of these tokens when you die, you'll automatically reboot. That'll be quite a game-changer, depending on how common these end up being.Cheesy PoofsWhile this may seem like just another consumable healing item, Cheesy Poofs are also a weapon--throwing a box at an enemy will damage them. The days of feeling like an idiot because you accidentally threw a shield pot at the other guy when you tried to switch to a different gun are finally over. At least temporarily.The Stick of TruthOnly one Stick of Truth will appear each round, and the person who claims it will become the round's final boss. But not because it turns you into a kaiju or gives you sick abilities--having the Stick of Truth in your inventory will make the storm circle center on you for the remainder of the match. Wonkeeland is now CartmanlandThe Wonkeeland POI in the northwest part of the island has received a South Park-themed makeover and is now Cartmanland, based on the theme park Cartman took over on the show. It's still more or less the same place, just with Cartman's face all over it.Born in Chaos event passFor the first time in almost two years, Fortnite is doing a new event mini-pass. This one is completely free to everyone, and includes 13 tiers of items that you can unlock by completing quests in Battle Royale--meaning this is not the sort of pass that you can passively get through by gaining XP. We don't know what all the pass will include, but among them are Terrance and Phillip dolls as a pickaxe, and a CRED backpack.Final pass reward: Imaginationland GliderThe very last reward on the pass, which requires completing every available South Park pass quest, is the Imaginationland Airship glider, which comes from an epic three-episode story in Season 10 that was originally planned to be a theatrical movie.     \n  \n                      "

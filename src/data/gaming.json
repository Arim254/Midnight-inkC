    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Warhorse Studios has one more DLC coming for its action-RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which we've known since January 2025. Now, though, the Czech developer has not only dropped a new trailer for Mysteria Ecclesia, but also revealed that this last story expansion will launch on November 11 for consoles and PC.Mysteria Ecclesia sees protagonist Henry of Skalitz (played by The Suspect's Tom McKay) become something of a private investigator as he explores the Sedletz Monastery to follow the clues and search for answers about the spread of a deadly disease. You can check out the brief trailer for the DLC just below.          One of the best RPGs of the year, the game received a superb 9/10 in our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review. Critic Richard Wakeling called it a \"triumphant sequel,\" saying, \"This is a massively improved sequel in every other area, with better combat, quest design, and none of the technical issues that plagued the original.\"Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is available now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. You can get Mysteria Ecclesia and the two other add-ons, Brushes with Death and Legacy of the Forge, through the game's $30 Expansion Pass or $90 Gold Edition.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                A new advertisement from Razer is making the rounds on TikTok and proving, yet again, that old-fashioned sexism in gaming is alive and well. Though meant to help promote the tech company's noise cancelling headphones, the ad instead reinforces the stereotype that women--who make up 48% of all gamers, by the way--simply can't stop talking.Accompanied by the caption \"Don't let yapping get in the way of your winning,\" the ad (first noticed by PC Gamer) depicts a man and woman sitting on a couch together. The man, both holding a controller and wearing a headset, awkwardly shuffles as the woman emphatically speaks to him. After a few moments, he decides to activate the headset's Active Noise Cancellation feature. The woman's voice is drowned out, while the text on the video reads: \"Active Noise Cancellation: On, Drama: Off.\" As of October 23, the advertisement is still up on TikTok.Considering Razer's history of making cute accessories geared towards female audiences, the advertisement comes as a bit of a shock. Though the ad might not be intentionally sexist, it plays into long-standing gender roles and is extremely dismissive towards the large population of women who also play video games. Coincidentally, a recent study by the Entertainment Software Association found there is a \"nearly equal gender split\" among video game players.The response to the ad has been primarily negative, with users writing comments like \"welp guess I'm done with razer after 15 years,\" \"I just put my razer headphones in the bin,\" and \"the casual misogyny is INSANE\" in response. Per PC Gamer, TikTok users are also taking to other Razer videos to express their discontent, with the top comment on an ad for the company's Razer Kuromi headset reading, \"razer's sexist btw.\"GameSpot has reached out to Razer for comment.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                During today's DreadXP livestream, a spooky new look at the Paranormal Activity video game was revealed. The gameplay teaser for Paranormal Activity: Threshold showed off a taste of what players can expect, as they find themselves stuck inside a haunted house full of hostile entities and puzzles.The trailer teased an approach similar to the film franchise, as it was full of found-footage shots and a foreboding sense of dread that the film franchise is known for.          DarkStone Digital--the team behind 2022's The Mortuary Assistant--is working on the game, and it'll feature a Haunt System designed to dynamically alter the types and intensity of scares that players will encounter during their sessions.Publisher DreadXP stated that game director Brian Clarke aims to replicate his signature approach to fear and immersion in the Paranormal Activity game, while also expanding on the franchise's infamous found-footage style horror in \"new and nightmarish\" ways.While it doesn't have a release date yet, DreadXP says it will reveal more about Paranormal Activity: Threshold's platforms and launch timing in the months to come. Fans of the film franchise looking for some effective shock treatment can grab a new Blu-ray set of the original movies.The $50 Blu-ray box set includes all eight movies, starting from the original low-budget thriller up through Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

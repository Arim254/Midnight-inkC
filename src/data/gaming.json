It's important to know what guns to use and which situations they work well in. Here we highlight the best weapons to equip in Arc Raiders so you can protect yourself and all your valuable loot. This list includes some powerful high-tier options as well as guns you can craft and use early in your game.The weapons you choose for each raid will depend on your goal for the match. Weapons with heavy ammo are usually better picks for tackling fights with ARCenemies, while medium or light ammo is often enough to down raiders in PvP engagements.Additionally, these guns can be upgraded to become even more powerful to use, and we have a full guide for upgrading weapons and workbenches in Arc Raiders. For more, check out our Arc Raiders quest list and starter tips.FerroThe Ferro is one of the best starter weapons in Arc Raiders. This single-shot battle rifle is a gun of common rarity that you can easily craft or find as loot when you're just getting started with the game. The Ferro makes up for its slow firing and reload speeds with accuracy, long-range damage, and its ability to deal high penetration to ARC armor. This gun is a smart pick for fights against robot and human threats alike, so long as you can hit your shots.Ferro weapon details:Ammo Type: Heavy ammoFiring Mode: Break-ActionARC Armor Penetration: StrongThe weapon allows for mods, and the suppressor can be a handy pick for taking long-range fights without giving away your position.RattlerThe Rattler assault rifle is another great starter weapon in Arc Raiders. This common rarity weapon pairs well with the Ferro battle rifle mentioned above, as this is a full-auto gun that gives you a nice balance for combat. The Rattler is pretty well-rounded in terms of damage, range, and handling. Its high fire rate and moderate armor penetration make it decent for Arc enemies, but even better for PvP encounters.Rattler weapon details:Ammo Type: MediumFiring Mode: Fully-AutomaticARC Armor Penetration: ModerateThe magazine capacity is low for a fully automatic gun, though. Tapping the trigger in bursts instead of spraying a ton of ammo will help you further improve your accuracy as well as conserve your bullets with this gun. Leveling up the Rattler will also increase the ammo capacity of the weapon.AnvilThe Anvil pistol is a weapon of uncommon (blue) rarity. This is a powerful hand cannon, and it works well for most engagements. It doesn't have the same long-range capabilities of the Ferro, but this is another single-shot powerhouse that works great in fights against ARC enemies or raiders. The Anvil being of uncommon rarity means it's not too difficult to loot, craft, or purchase, and you get a lot of bang for your buck.Anvil weapon details:Ammo Type: HeavyFiring Mode: Single-ActionARC Armor Penetration: StrongThe Anvil also has its own unique mod called the Anvil Splitter. This attachment is of legendary rarity, and it allows you to fire three separate projectiles per shot. This mod can make the Anvil feel more like a sawed-off shotgun with a tight pellet spread, but it can reduce your accuracy at longer ranges.BettinaThe Bettina is a weapon of epic rarity. This assault rifle packs a deadly punch, and its strong armor penetration makes it best used against Arc enemies. It does suffer from moderate recoil, but burst firing this gun can allow you to tackle fights against robots at a good range.It's worth noting that the Bettina's weapon durability degrades fast, and it requires valuable resources to repair. However, this is still a fun and powerful gun to use.Bettina weapon details:Ammo Type: HeavyFiring Mode: Fully-AutomaticARC Armor Penetration: StrongYou can also further increase this weapon's power with the gun's unique legendary Kinetic Converter mod, as this will boost the gun's fire rate by 15%. However, this attachment does add more kick with a 20% increase to both horizontal and vertical recoil.TempestThe Tempest is a weapon of epic rarity. This is an assault rifle that is really strong against raiders and decent when fighting Arc enemy types. It's fully automatic and does have some recoil, but the gun's kick is very manageable.Tempest weapon details:Ammo Type: MediumFiring Mode: Fully-AutomaticARC Armor Penetration: ModerateThe mod slots for the Tempest are just the standard variety, but it's worth considering at least throwing on a suppressor to help keep you from drawing too much attention.VulcanoThe Vulcano is a weapon of epic rarity. This is a beefy, semi-automatic shotgun meant for close-range engagements. This is best for when you're clearing buildings and taking out any raiders or small Arc enemies that cause you trouble. Its armor penetration is weak, so it's not the strongest choice for larger Arc robots.Vulcano weapon details:Ammo Type: Shotgun ammoFiring Mode: Pump-ActionARC Armor Penetration: WeakThe Vulcano also lets you equip a suppressor mod, so as always in Arc Raiders, it could be worth adding the attachment to remain stealthy on the map.HullcrackerThe Hullcracker is a special epic-rarity weapon. This is essentially a grenade launcher designed to take down ARC enemies. The Hullcracker doesn't damage raiders, so you'll want a secondary weapon meant for PvP fights, but this launcher's explosive rounds deal massive damage to ARC enemies. It's especially great for bigger threats like the Leaper and Bastion.Hullcracker weapon details:Ammo Type: Launcher ammoFiring Mode: Pump-ActionARC Armor Penetration: Very Strong    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Late last month, the superhero work comedy Dispatch was released by AdHoc Studio. Since then the episodic adventure game has sold 1 million copies in its first 10 days, and the fan response has only grown from there. So much so that AdHoc Studio co-founder Pierre Shorette has acknowledged that the game may not be one-and-done after this week's finale.Shorette and his fellow co-founder Nick Herman were guests on The Friends Per Second podcast (Via Eurogamer) when a question about Dispatch Season 2 came up.\"[I think] that we're going to have to at least think about Season 2 now,\" said Shorette. \"That was a question mark three weeks ago, you know. So, it's a very cool problem to have.\"Shorette reiterated that AdHoc already has a video game project in the works with Critical Role, which will be set in the fantasy world of Exandria. Critical Role's Travis Willingham has said that the game will feature a brand-new story, but characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells campaigns could appear.          The final two episodes of Dispatch Season 1 will premiere on November 12. Dispatch hit a new high on Steam last week with over 131,000 concurrent players. It's possible that the finale will carry the game past that benchmark.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Nintendo is one of the longest-running and best-known gaming companies on the planet, but just how many games and systems has Nintendo sold over the years?The company said today that it's now sold more than 870 million systems and in excess of 6 billion games globally. Nintendo did not provide a breakdown by platform, but Nintendo's public investor relations website shows that the original Switch accounts for a whopping 1.452 billion game sales alone and 154.01 million systems sold. In fact, the Switch is just 10,000 units shy of passing the DS (154.02 million) to become Nintendo's best-selling platform ever. Behind the Switch and DS for hardware sales is the Game Boy (118.69), the Wii (101.63 million), and the Game Boy Advance (81.51 million) to round out the top five best-selling Nintendo platforms.In terms of game sales, the Switch 1 ranks highest by a massive margin. The next closest to the Switch is the DS, which has accumulated 948.76 million game sales, followed by the Wii (921.85 million), Game Boy (501.11 million), NES (500.01 million), and then the 3DS (392.29 million).The Switch 2, meanwhile, launched in June 2025 and has surpassed 10 million unit sales in its first four months; more than 20.6 million games have been sold for the system. Nintendo also recently boosted its sales projections for the Switch 2, raising the sales forecast for the console this fiscal year from 15 million to 19 million, an increase of more than 26%.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

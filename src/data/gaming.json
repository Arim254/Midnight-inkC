    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on December 5, 2025 at 10:14AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The launch of Fortnite Chapter 7 has introduced Surf City, the sixth Reload map since the respawn-focused mode was first introduced during the summer of 2024, and the fourth since April. While other new Reload maps added in 2025 were not directly based on any islands from the main Fortnite Battle Royale, Surf City is largely a shrunken-down version of the new Chapter 7 island, which is based on the southwestern USA--specifically, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, and everything in between.At the heart of the map is Battlewood Boulevard, a massive, sprawling cityscape that covers a much larger area than any previous Reload POI. The Reload version of Battlewood Boulevard is nearly identical to the same POI on the main Battle Royale map--it hasn't been scaled down at all for the smaller island.Several other spots in this island correspond to spots on the BR island as well, but none of the other were transplanted directly--these are more inspired by the big island. Breaker Beach in the south is more or less the same as Ripped Tides on the BR map, Sweaty Shores is similar to Latte Landing, Cashmere Cliffs is actually an expanded version of Humble Hills, and Sus Studios is, of course, Sus Studios.Then up at the north end of the map we've got Divey Dam, which is an original new spot that has no equivalent on any other Fortnite map. Divey Damn has a large, empty mountain above it--but there's more stuff up there than you'd probably think given that it's not a named location.Scroll on for better looks at each of the big spots on Fortnite Reload's new Surf City map.Divey DamBreaker BeachCashmere CliffsSus StudiosBattlewood BoulevardSweaty Shores    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this week, Running With Scissors unveiled a new look at Postal: Bullet Paradise, a Postal spin-off developed by Goonswarm Games as a Vampire Survivors-like shooter. However, fan backlash against the alleged AI elements in Bullet Paradise have led Running With Scissors to cancel the game entirely.          \"After revealing Postal: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing--but not developing--we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community,\" said Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi in a statement. \"The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.\"Desi noted that Running With Scissors has lost trust in Goonswarm Games, which is why the project has now been killed. Subsequently, Goonswarm Games issued a statement to PC GamesN in which the studio denies using AI in either the game or the trailer shown above.\"No generative AI was used for the reveal trailer or for the game,\" reads the statement. \"All assets were created by our human artists using standard tools. We've already shared layered PSDs, work-in-progress files, and other materials to confirm this. Any mistakes or rough spots in those files are being misinterpreted as 'proof' of AI, but they simply reflect the normal, human art-creation process.\"In June of this year, Running With Scissors announced a remake of Postal 2, Postal 2 Redux. That game is being developed by Flat2VR Studios, Team Beef, and Running With Scissors for modern consoles and PC. But for now, that project doesn't have a release date.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Nvidia today is the world's most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion, thanks in large part to the AI boom of the past few years. But Nvidia's success was far from guaranteed.CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang recalled recently how a $5 million gift following a failed business deal with Sega gave the company the lifeline it needed at the time, allowing the fledgling company to stay in business and eventually become what it is today.Appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Huang talked about how, back in the 1990s, he and his two co-founders were trying to drum up business for their start-up PC company. They traveled to Japan and pitched Sega management on the idea that Nvidia could build the company's Dreamcast console.Nvidia wasn't able to get it done, however, discovering that it didn't have the technical ability to give Sega what it needed (Sega would end up partnering with VideoLogic for the Dreamcast). However, Huang still wanted the last $5 million that Sega was due to pay Nvidia for its work on the contract. He told Sega management that Sega could give Nvidia the money as an investment, but Huang frankly admitted that \"it is most likely to be lost\" given Nvidia's lack of business opportunities.At the same time, if Sega didn't give Nvidia the money, Nvidia would go out of business, Huang said. The Sega management team informed Huang that, even with the $5 million investment, Nvidia would likely still go out of business. \"It was completely true,\" Huang said.But a top Sega boss apparently took a liking to Huang and decided to give him the money as an investment because \"Jensen was a young man [the CEO] liked. That's it.\" Huang said there was about a 0% chance that Nvidia would be able to return Sega the money.Nvidia took that money and used it to help build and grow its business in the world of video games, and when Nvidia went public in 1999 at a valuation of $300 million, Sega cashed out. \"If he would have kept that $5 million investment, I think it would be worth probably about $1 trillion today,\" Huang said.Nvidia continues to be a big player in the gaming space with its GPUs and it runs the GeForce Now cloud-gaming platform. How Nvidia makes its money today derives more from sales to AI companies.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The only spooky pumpkins coming your way this year are in Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival, the pumpkin-carving MMO that's back online after its planned hiatusGhost Town Pumpkin Festival was created by Whippoorwill Ltd aka Adam R. & Dawn B., and the game sends players into a literal ghost town where they can take part in the in-game Halloween festival and pumpkin-carving contest. Players can win prize ribbons from other players who dole out awards to their favorite pumpkins. The game also encourages players to wander around the small town and customize their ghost avatar.          Previously, Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival was limited to 200 players at a time. This year, the game has added support for 800 simultaneous players. There are also new areas to find, including the Ghost Town Cinema, which plays classic silent movies. Some of the other activities in town include exploring a haunted and a hayride.Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival can be downloaded at its official site for PC, Mac, and Linux. Players can name their own price, but if they choose to pay $2 or more, they get a version of the game that includes hats for ghosts. According to Adam R., the game has already set a record this year with 24,000 pumpkins created by players since the game's return earlier this month.The team behind the game has also said that Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival will be taken down a week or two after Halloween, presumably before its inevitable return in 2026. If you're looking for something scarier, GameSpot put together a list of the horror games you can play for the Halloween season. Other titles are also having in-game tie-ins for the spooky season.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

If you're a subscriber in the US, you will now be charged $30/month, a $10 bump from the previous $20/month rate. The new price is effective immediately, so you may have already paid the increased rate if you were billed already this month. That said, there is a way to avoid the price increase: prepaid codes. The price of prepaid membership codes hasn't changed--at least not yet. Over at Amazon, you can get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month Membership codes for $55 (was $60), which breaks down to $18.33/month. Based on Microsoft's new subscription price, you're saving $35 across three months.1-Month prepaid codes are sold for $20 at Amazon, so you're saving an additional five bucks every three months with Amazon's deal. Amazon's prepaid codes can be redeemed by existing and new subscribers with a US Xbox account. Once you enter a prepaid code, your next billing date is pushed. So if you redeem a 3-Month Membership in October, you won't be billed again by Microsoft until January.The discount on prepaid codes becomes more glaring if you buy multiple. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate can be stacked up to 36 months. For instance, if you were to buy four prepaid 3-Month codes, you'd save $140 on a full year of Game Pass Ultimate. Here's a breakdown of the savings from buying Amazon's prepaid code deal versus subscribing directly through Microsoft. Note: The numbers in the Amazon column are based on the 3-Month Membership deal, but even if the price jumps back to $60, you're still saving a ton of cash.Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: Microsoft Store vs. Prepaid CodesDuration:Microsoft:Amazon Deal:Savings:3 Months$90$55$356 Months$180$110$709 Months$270$165$1051 Year$360$220$1402 Years$720$440$2803 Years$1,080$660$420It's unclear how long retailers will stick with the old $20/month rate. Amazon's $55 deal is new this week; earlier this month, Amazon was charging $60. For what it's worth, Amazon has historically held out longer than other retailers when prices have changed in the past. The retailer was selling the 3-Month Membership code for $45 long after Microsoft increased the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $17/month. The latest price change for Game Pass Ultimate is by far the biggest of the three price hikes the service has experienced over the years. While this is a disappointing for subscribers, it also means it's more important than ever to take advantage of prepaid code discounts.If you aren't a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, now's a pretty good time to become a member. Multiple AAA games are coming to Game Pass Ultimate on launch day in the coming weeks, including Ninja Gaiden 4 (October 21), The Outer Worlds 2 (October 29), and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (November 14).Additionally, Microsoft and Asus just launched the first Xbox handheld. The ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally are available now for $1,000 and $600, respectively. Check out our buying guide for details on each of these handheld PCs. Both devices can play the Game Pass Ultimate library natively, so members have a built-in catalog of hundreds of games out of the gate.

The Final Fantasy X|X-2 HD Remaster collection and Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age are $25 each. Final Fantasy XII is marked $15 off, but you're saving even more compared to the digital editions, which are $50 each on the Switch eShop. Both games are sold and shipped directly from Amazon.These Final Fantasy remasters aren't always in stock at major retailers. The Zodiac Age, in particular, is often only sold by third-party sellers for higher prices. It's possible that Amazon received a new shipment thanks to the release of Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, which takes place in the same world as Final Fantasy XII.

Final Fantasy X is widely regarded as one of the best games in the series. The Conditional Turn-Based Battle System was arguably the pinnacle of the franchise's turn-based era, as it added new wrinkles to the decision-making process. Final Fantasy X also placed a greater emphasis on summoning with the new Aeon creatures, and players had greater control over character upgrades thanks to the dynamic Sphere Grid system.The world of Spira remains one of the most well-realized Final Fantasy settings, and the main cast, led by Tidus and Yuna, includes some of the best playable characters.Final Fantasy X's 3D graphics showed off the power of the PlayStation 2 when it debuted in 2001. It proved to be such a big success that Square developed the first-ever sequel to a mainline game. Final Fantasy X-2 isn't nearly as highly regarded as its predecessor, but it's still a solid RPG that's worth playing.Both games hold up well, and the HD Remaster looks great on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. Final Fantasy X is on the cartridge, but Final Fantasy X-2 is downloaded from the eShop using the voucher inside the box. Both games are 30-plus hours without including all the side content. You could easily spend well over 100 hours with the remasters.                                                                                                                            Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age for Nintendo Switch                                                                $25 at Amazon | $50 on eShop                                                                                                                                                                                    Final Fantasy XII ushered in a new era of experimentation for the mainline franchise. Square Enix took a big risk by ditching turn-based battles in favor of a real-time, tactical system that was closer to Final Fantasy XI Online than previous single-player entries in the series. Unsurprisingly, FFXII received a wide range of reactions from fans when it launched in 2006.These days, however, Final Fantasy XII is regarded as one of the high points in the series. As mentioned, Final Fantasy XII takes place Ivalice, and the sheer scope of the open world is still impressive today. In many ways, Final Fantasy XII is basically a single-player MMO. It has an excellent quest system, a bevy of secrets to uncover, and massive cast of NPCs to interact with.Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is the definitive version, as it has improved visuals, quality-of-life improvements, and the job system from earlier games in the series. The average playthrough of Final Fantasy XII is roughly 40 hours, but there's so much side content that this number can easily double or even triple.

Both physical editions launch December 9. It's worth noting that the FF7/8 Twin Pack's European edition is available on Amazon for around $35 right now. The Asian edition of Final Fantasy IX, on the other hand, is pricier than the upcoming US edition at $48.

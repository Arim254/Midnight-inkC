    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 30, 2025 at 2:02AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Every new season of Fortnite brings significant changes to the loot pool, but the start of a new chapter is an even more special occasion--each Season 1 brings us a totally new set of weapons and other items. While we usually get to keep the basic stuff--like shield pots and med packs and shockwave grenades--the loot pool is typically pretty unfamiliar. And Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is no different in that regard.In Season 1, we've got a couple weapons we've used before, but the majority of the toys you'll be playing with this season are completely new, and they feel pretty different compared with the guns we've used in the past few seasons.These are the returning items in the loot pool in Chapter 7 Season 1:Tactical PistolEnforcer ARDual Micro SMGsDynamiteGrenadesBeyond those guns and items, you'll be looking at a bunch of totally new stuff. Scroll on to find out more about the new weapons.Forsaken Vow BladeObtained by visiting a training rift and being granted one by Beatrix Kiddo herself, the Forsaken Vow Blade combines elements of both of Fortnite's past katanas, the Typhoon Blade and the Kinetic Blade, with a dash attack that makes it an effective movement item.Arc Lightning GunInstead of bullets, this mini-gun fires off a stream of electrical current that melts anyone at close range. Vengeful SniperSeason 1's only sniper rifle carries three rounds per magazine, and since it's the only gun in the loot pool that isn't hitscan, it features some pretty heavy bullet drop that you'll need to account for.Holo Rush SMGThe Holo Rush is, as the name implies, a scoped SMG with pretty decent range--it can shoot further than the Arc Lightning Gun, for one thing.Deadeye Assault RifleThis scoped assault rifle is best at mid-to-long ranges, though it can hit pretty hard if you need to spray it in an emergency. This one shoots like if Fortnite's old Heavy AR had a scope on it, which makes it very deadly indeed.Twin HammersThese dual pumps actually combine for a fairly healthy fire rate, so you can treat the pair more or less the same way you would a single auto shotgun. Iron Pump ShotgunThis season's pump shotgun handles very smoothly, does solid damage without being overpowered, and it's got a little bit of range. So it may be every sweaty gamer's best friend by the end of the season. WingsuitThis season's new movement gimmick is essentially a weaker version of Iron Man's Flight Kit--it has the same vertical takeoff, but once you're up in the air you'll actually glide back down to the ground instead of being able to fly around willy nilly. Just be warned you trail smoke when you use a wingsuit, and so you'll be visible from pretty far away.Boss kitsInstead of medallions, boss NPCs now drop boss kits that allow you to wear their skin and use their combat gimmick. Just be warned that once you pick one of these up, you're stuck with it until you die or the match ends. And, yes, it does use one of your inventory slots.     \n  \n                      "

The Fortnite-original Melodie Mars skin is unlocked instantly when you purchase the pass, and the Rockstar Lisa skin is the final reward in the pass, she's got a reactive back bling on the pass as well.Those Icon emotes are a pretty surprising inclusion, as there have only been three total Icon emotes included in the previous 11`music passes. To have two of them on one music pass is very unusual. It would be cooler, however, if the emotes actually featured songs that were well known.One of them is called Latata, which is also the name of a well known Kpop song released in 2018--but this emote uses a different, unrelated song called Latata that is not even slightly popular. The other, which uses Can't Get Enough by Krysta Youngs and NiiWHA, is only slightly less obscure. These two tracks have fewer than 5,000 total listens combined on YouTube Music. Of the eight jam tracks included in the Starlux pass, four are licensed and four are Epic-produced tracks. These are the licensed tracks.Get Jiggy by B Jack$, Zeddy WillDashstar* VIP by Knock2Sorry by Justin BieberF*** Up the World (Vixi Solo Version) by LisaIn all, the Starlux music pass includes 30 items, with one reward unlocking each two account levels you earn in any Fortnite experience. The pass costs 1,400 V-Bucks, and is included with a Fortnite Crew subscription. Scroll on to see everything you can collect from this one.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                A new season of Fortnite means a whole new slate of quests to help you grind your way through the battle pass--and you're gonna need it, because progression through the Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass is much slower than it was last season. With these quests to give you a boost, and with this guide to help you get through those quests as quickly as possible, you'll have that Dark Voyager skin at the end of the pass in no time. Relatively speaking.There's a major complicating factor that will make it a little more difficult to complete some quests right now at the start of the season. The new method of arriving at the island by surfing in from the ocean means you don't really get much choice in where you land. Fortunately, there aren't a ton of quests that require you to visit specific places--but there are a couple of them. There's no need to sweat that too much, though, because the battle bus should be back on December 4, at which point you may be able to quest normally once again.With the disclaimers out of the way, let's take a look at the quests.Table of Contents [hide]Battle Bus quests - 10K XPRebuild the Bus questsThe Bride quests - 10K XP eachFortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Weekly Highlights quests - 12K XP eachWeek 1 questsBattle Bus quests - 10K XPThese quests are related to the season story, which began with the battle bus being blown out of the sky. Since the lack of a Battle Bus is just a temporary thing, these quests are time-limited and will go away forever on December 8. A second set of these quests will be added on December 4, when the battle bus is repaired.Battle Bus quests award 10k XP each, and you'll additionally earn an emote for completing three of them, and vehicle wheels for completing six of them.Rebuild the Bus questsSearch containers to find and collect 20 bus partsWhenever you open any kind of loot container, like a chest or an ammo box, there's a chance that a bus part will pop out in addition to the normal loot. Simply collect 20 of them when that happens.Destroy 35 objects of structures while in a vehicleUse a car or golf cart to break stuff. Things like fences and tables are easiest, as Fortnite vehicles aren't great at driving through buildings or trees without a cow catcher.Collect 4 Battle Bus wheels at Pump N Run gas stationsThe gas stations around the island this season have garages attached to them, and it's in those garages where you'll find the wheels you're looking for.Hit an opponent while in a Hot Air BalloonChapter 7 added a new form of public transit to the island in the form of the Hot Air Balloons which rotate between a series of stations. To complete this one, you just need to shoot any enemy, whether player or NPC, a single time while you're in one of the balloons.Talk to Dummy about the Battle Bus destructionThe crash-test dummy NPC is hanging out in Ripped Tides, and he's easy to find because he's standing next to the wreckage of the battle bus. Completing this one requires you to interact with him and click through his quest dialogue.Destroy dumpsters to find and collect Battle Bus piecesYou don't even have to worry about this one. Epic has automatically completed this quest for everyone due to a bug.The Bride quests - 10K XP eachVisit 6 different named locations while in a vehicleThis one is exactly as simple as it sounds. You just need to drive around in a car and visit named spots. Briefly hopping in a car already parked at one of the locations will also count toward your progress.Stage 1: Enter a Forsaken Vow Rift Gate to get a Forsaken Vow BladeThe Forsaken Vow Blade is an unusually rare item, since there can't currently be more than two of them, total, in a round. One of those sources is the Rift Gate, which works the same way as the Star Wars lightsaber portals--just click on the portal to receive the blade.Stage 2: Fight Yuki and GogoOnce you've done that, however, Gogo and Yuki Yubari will spawn and attack you. You'll have to beat them to keep going.Eliminate 10 opponents with a Forsaken Vow BladeOnce you have the blade, you'll need to kill 10 enemies with it. Fortunately, those opponents don't have to be players--NPCs count too. So it's not as daunting as it seems.Hit 6 opponents with the Forsaken Vow Blade's Vengeance DashLike the Kinetic Blade before, the Forsaken Vow Blade has a dash attack that you can use by clicking your secondary fire while you're in the air. Land hits with the dash attack on six opponents--NPC or player--to complete this one.Reach 25 players remaining in 4 different matchesThis one will occur naturally as you play, as you simply have stay alive until the endgame several times to complete this quest.Purchase a service from The BrideThe Bride can be found at the Sandy Strip, and for the moment the only service she provides is a rift for 600 gold bars. However, she's also got a Forsaken Vow Blade that you can get by attacking and defeating her. Doing that won't help with this quest, but it's useful info if you need blade kills for that quest.Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Weekly Highlights quests - 12K XP eachEach week will add six quests to the Weekly Highlights quest list. Each of these quests will be worth 12k XP, with every third completed quest granting an additional 25k. You can earn that bonus XP 12 times. Only the first set of these is available now--Week 2 quests are currently slated to drop on December 11.Week 1 questsTravel 500 distance while flying with a wingsuitThe wingsuit mobility item fires you straight up into the air and lets you glide gently back down to the ground. Depending on your elevation when you first use it, this quest can be done in one or two flights. But since each wingsuit includes ten charges, you shouldn't have any trouble completing this one with a single wingsuit.Travel 500 distance while boosting in a vehicleUse the boost on a car or SUV a lot. Golf carts can't boost, so don't bother with those for this quest.Outlast 40 players without taking storm damageThis is easily done in a single round, as you'll just need to avoid the storm (and death) for the first five minutes or so of a match.Eliminate three opponents with the Iron Pump Shotgun or GrenadesBoth of these items have a chance to drop from any and all sources of loot.Travel 250 distance while sprinting with an assault rifle equippedThis quest requires you to actually have your assault rifle in the equipped slot while you sprint--simply having it in your inventory won't count.Break glass with a pickaxePunch any glass window with a pickaxe to complete this quest.\n                                  "

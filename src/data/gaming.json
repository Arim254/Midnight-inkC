    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Actor Liam Hemsworth takes over the role of Geralt from Henry Cavill for the upcoming fourth and fifth seasons to close the show out, but Hemsworth originally had some reservations about joining the cast.He told RadioTimes that he was feeling \"pretty reluctant\" to sign on after he was first approached for the part. \"[I had] a lot of concerns and questions about it all. I was a big fan of the video game and then I watched the series, and was a fan of the series, and I read the books,\" he said.What specifically was he hesitant about? Hemsworth said it had to do with how the Netflix series already had an established and passionate fan base that enjoyed watching Cavill in the role.\"I think if I wasn't a fan myself, if I didn't care about it, I wouldn't have come on board. The reason I came on board was because I was a fan, and because I thought that I could do justice to this character. I thought that could bring an interesting interpretation to this part of the story,\" he said.          Showrunner Lauren Schmidt-Hissrich is quoted in the piece, too, saying when Cavill stepped away, the team knew it wanted to keep Geralt's look the same, albeit with a new actor.\"We knew there were things that were really important to keep with Geralt--obviously, his look has to stay the same,\" she said. \"He's a different human being, but I think there's so many things that are sort of synonymous with Geralt--the white wig and the yellow eyes and the black leather and not wearing any color, and the way he walks through the world.\"At the same time, Schmidt-Hissrich said Hemsworth did a lot of work to create a version of Geralt that was unique to hom. \"He needed to make Geralt his, and it was really important to let him do that and let him explore it and find it,\" she explained.The Witcher Season 4 debuts October 30 on Netflix, and The Matrix star Laurence Fishburne also joins the cast. A fifth and final season is coming sometime later. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The new Battlefield battle royale game has been officially confirmed. The game, called Battlefield: RedSec, will launch on October 28 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET. As rumored, it will be free-to-play.Battlefield Studios announced a battle royale game or mode based on Battlefield 6 a long time ago, and has allowed testers to play it already, but this is the first time the developer is revealing its name, release date, and business model. All of these key details leaked already.The name RedSec appears to be a shorter version of \"Redacted Sector,\" based on the teaser art.RedSec goes live on the same day as Battlefield 6's Season 1 update, so it's shaping up to be a busy week for Battlefield fans. It's also a busy time for the FPS space in general, as the PvPvE game Arc Raiders launches on October 30, with Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 coming in November.Battlefield 6 got off to a hot start earlier this month, selling 7 million copies right out of the gate, representing the \"biggest opening\" of all time for the storied FPS series.RedSec will come to an already-crowded market for battle royale games, with titles like PUBG, Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and EA's own Apex Legends standing as the heavyweights currently.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                With the reveal of Halo: Campaign Evolved arriving next year for consoles and PC, developer Halo Studios has come forward to say that, while no one on the development team was required to use generative AI, they're not opposed to using it as the \"tool\" that it is.In an October 24 interview with Rolling Stone, executive producer Damon Conn and game director Greg Hermann spoke about the development of Halo: Campaign Evolved. When asked whether Halo Studios used AI in any capacity, whether that be retouching assets or rebuilding environments, Conn explained that AI can streamline workflows, but people create the games.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: 11 Minutes Of Halo Campaign Evolved Gameplay\n      \n\"I want to be very clear … People are creative. People make games. AI can improve workflows. It can do things for the game,\" Conn said. \"But I want to be very specific and clear that the people are the ones who are creating the game, and there’s an opportunity to improve a workflow, or something along those lines, we’ll look at it again. It really should be additive to the creation of a game.\"Hermann echoed Conn's sentiment, explaining that, like other tools developers use when making games--such as Photoshop or Unity--AI is simply the same thing. It's the brush that helps the artist paint. It can aid in the execution, but it's people who hold the creative spark.\"It's a tool in a toolbox,\" Hermann said. \"I may go a little off message here, but some of that gets very challenging when we look at how integrated AI is becoming within our tooling. We use Photoshop. There's generative fill, for example. The boundary lines can get a little fuzzy. I will say, though, again, to Damon's point, it really is about that creative spark that comes from people and improving just overall workflows.\"The question remains of whether Halo Studios was required to use generative AI when making the game. And for that, an Xbox representative told Rolling Stone that no such mandate exists.\"There is no mandate to use generative AI in our game development, and that includes Halo: Campaign Evolved,\" the Xbox representative told the publication in a later statement.This comes at an interesting time for Microsoft/Xbox and the games industry at large. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer recently admitted that the company doesn't always do the best at protecting the creativity of its staff. Meanwhile, Microsoft reached a $4 trillion valuation despite the myriad layoffs, with a report suggesting that the company's astronomical profit goals could be doing more harm to Microsoft than good. And some studios, from EA to Krafton Inc., are going all in artificial intelligence, with prominent developers saying the technology should be embraced or game developers are selling themselves short.Still, it's quite fascinating to see an Xbox exclusive make the jump to PlayStation. It really does seem like Microsoft is leaning into its latest marketing strategy, which purports that everything is an Xbox--even your car.Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

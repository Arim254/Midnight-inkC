    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on December 18, 2025 at 10:36AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The arrival of the holidays in the real world means Fortnite is kicking off Winterfest, which adds a layer of snow and ice to the northern half of the Battle Royale map, introduces a bunch of new collaborations with other IP, and offers tons of new free and paid cosmetics--including two free Fortnite-original skins. Scroll on to take a look at everything Winterfest is bringing us this year--don't wait long to jump in, because this celebration ends on January 5.All the collabsAs is usually the case with Winterfest, there will be lots of new collaboration cosmetics in the item shop. Three entirely new collaborations have already been revealed: Harry Potter, SpongeBob Squarepants, and Bleach. Harry Potter is getting a set of generic Fortnite people wearing Hogwarts uniforms, whereas Bleach appears to include four skins based on characters from the series. We're also getting a car based on the SpongeBob Squarepants Patty Wagon, and that collab will reportedly also feature SpongeBob and Patrick as sidekicks.Meanwhile, the Back to the Future collab from the current battle pass is getting new items in the shop on December 23, with a Doc Brown skin, and a car skin based on the DeLorean time machine. If you already had the time machine in Rocket League, you'll get it in Fortnite without having to pay for it again.Two existing music collabs are also expanding this Winterfest, with both Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter getting new holiday-themed skins, as well as a new jam track for each of them.Lastly, there are a few collabs that are rumored but still unconfirmed, like Home Alone and Batman Beyond. We don't even know for sure if these are happening, but there's still a little bit of room left on the schedule for more things.Free stuffThe Winterfest Cabin is once again available to explore from the Fortnite lobby, and it's full of presents that you can open once per day for the next two weeks. Among these presents are two skins: a frozen crash-test dummy, and a hamster wearing a holiday sweater. There's also two back blings, two pickaxes, two musical instruments, a glider, a weapon wrap, a jam track, and a few sprays and emoticons. These free rewards stack each day even if you don't log in, so it's possible to pop in at the end and redeem all the presents at once.Despite the fact that the cabin is full of Harry Potter references and the movie theme plays while you visit it, none of the free items is related to that franchise.You can get a better look at the free rewards here.Let it snowIn the main Battle Royale mode, the northern half of the island is now covered in snow, and locations all over the map got holiday makeovers with new Christmas trees and holiday lights. While I understand why Epic didn't cover the parts of the map based on Los Angeles with snow, it would have been nice to see Fortnite's version of my home turned into a winter wonderland, since we never get that in the real world.Winter lootFortnite has unvaulted a couple of its traditional winter weapons--the blizzard grenade, and the snowball launcher--for Winterfest, and presents are back as well. But these presents are a little bit different this time, because they don't give items from the normal loot pool. More on this below.Going back in timeThe Back to the Future time machine isn't just a car skin in the item shop--it's also a vehicle parked on the map. Going 88 miles per hour while driving it will give you a brief time-travel animation and add a new plutonium chest to the roof--which is full of weapons from the Fortnite OG loot pool, like the original Assault Rifle and the Lever-Action Shotgun, instead of current BR weapons. This year's presents likewise drop items from the OG loot pool, so they should be fairly plentiful.A new joke bossA fourth boss that you can play as after you defeat him has been added to the island. This one, Yule Trooper, has an extremely impractical ability: You'll have icy feet at all times while playing as this boss. It'll be very difficult to fight that way, and you'll want to stay far away from any ledges--fall damage is one of the leading causes of death for people with icy feet.Less Harry Potter than we expectedEven though the Hogwarts student skins are in the key art, and the Winterfest Cabin is full of references to it, Fortnite's collaboration with the immensely controversial brand apears to consist only of item shop cosmetics and marketing. There are no Harry Potter-themed locations on the Battle Royale island, no free Harry Potter cosmetics in the Winterfest cabin, and no related gameplay items--at least not yet. It's impossible for us to know if Epic planned it this way from the start, or if they scaled the collab back because of the negative response from some players. But it's extremely unusual for a Fortnite collab that has no gameplay component and isn't part of a battle pass to be included in key art.    \n  \n                      "

Winterfest is here, and that means lots of free stuff. As has become tradition in Fortnite, Epic Games has brought back the Winterfest Cabin, which is full of free cosmetics waiting to be opened.There are 14 free gifts available in the cabin, and you can open one each day. These gifts stack--if you log in for the first time on the fifth day of Winterfest, you'll have five presents available to open--so you don't actually need to check in every day if you're busy with family activities.As you can see from the graphic to the left, this year's collection of gifts includes two free skins, two back blings, two pickaxes, two musical instruments, a glider, a weapon wrap, a Fortnite-original jam track based on Carol of the Bells, a contrail, and a few sprays and emoticons for good measure.The skins are in the two large presents in the back on the left side of the room, but you won't be able to open them at the start. You can unlock the Glacial Dummy skin after opening seven other presents, which means he'll be available on Christmas day, And you can get Cheeks, the hamster man, only after you've picked every other present, which means he'll unlock on New Year's Eve.Beyond those two skins, you can unlock the presents in any order you want. And despite the fact there's a Hogwarts student chilling in the cabin while the Harry Potter movie theme plays, none of the free gifts have anything to do with the Harry Potter franchise.For a better look at some of the free rewards, as pulled by fortnite.gg, you can pull from this year's Winterfest Cabin, scroll on.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fortnite's latest Winterfest celebration kicked off with the usual array of map and gameplay changes in Battle Royale and piles of free stuff in the Winterfest cabin. But that's not all there is to care about in Fortnite's latest update--we've also got a pair of new sets of quests that reward XP, and an additional free cosmetic that must be earned by completing a specific one of those new quests. Let's take a look at what we've got here.Table of Contents [hide]Winterfest 2025 questsDrop 1Collect a Perfect Gift from a chestBring a Perfect Gift to any characterDamage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)Squad Up! questsWinterfest 2025 questsThe first of these new quests sets, listed under Winterfest in your quest log, are for Battle Royale. There are four time-gated groups of this set of quests--the first group is available now, and the rest will be added every two days until they're all there. Completing a quest awards 12K XP each, and there may be a reward at the end of the questline--but we don't know for sure yet. These quests expire when Winterfest ends on January 5.Drop 1Collect a Perfect Gift from a chestEvery chest you open during Winterfest has a change to drop an item called Perfect Gift, which triggers a quest to deliver it to any non-hostile NPC on the map within five minutes. But for this quest, you just have to collect the item. Fortunately, the Perfect Gift does not require one of your inventory slots.Bring a Perfect Gift to any characterThis quest requires you deliver one of these Perfect Gifts to an NPC. They all work, so pick whichever is most convenient.Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)You will need to cause 500 points of damage to any boss NPC for this one--and we mean the NPCs specifically. Players who have used a boss token to disguise themselves as bosses don't count for this.Squad Up! questsIn addition to the main Winterfest quests, there's an additional set of very simple quests that simply require you to find Shiny Llamas in the Squads version of Battle Royale, Reload, OG, or Blitz. These Shiny Llamas have a random chance to drop any time you open a rare chest or supply drop, or when you defeat an enemy player or NPC. You'll receive 12K XP for every 100 of them that you collect, until you've collected 1,000 of them. You won't have to compete with your teammates for them, though, because any Shiny Llamas collected by any squad member counts for all four of you.Which is good, because there's also a cosmetic reward for these quests. Collecting 400 of these Shiny Llamas will earn you the Starbrite Slasher pickaxe, which has been sitting in the Fortnite game files collecting dust for nearly two years. You'll want to pay particular attention to this quest if you purchased the Lego starter pack that includes the Brite Agent skin, since this is the first time it's been possible to get the pickaxe that belongs to her set.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

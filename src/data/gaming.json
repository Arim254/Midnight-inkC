    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Sucker Punch Productions' open-world samurai sim Ghost of Yotei runs pretty well on PlayStation 5, but, of course, it's not without its issues. Some problems could block your progress in select missions permanently, but there's a new patch that has addressed many of these random occurrences, so you can keep clashing steel and hunting the Yotei Six without a hitch.The team dropped the patch notes for Update 1.010 on Sucker Punch Productions' official website. The patch stabilizes the game by fixing two rare crashes as well as swapping out placeholder assets during a major story beat. But those are somewhat small potatoes when compared to the myriad gameplay tweaks that make the game even more playable than it already is on PS5.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Which Ghost of Yotei Mode Should You Play?\n      \nFor instance, your progress could be blocked during \"The Way of the Kusarigama\" mission if you warped into it at a specific point. Or your progress could be halted if you ignored the \"armor upgrade\" scene and left the area during \"The Tale of the Oni\" mission. Heck, your progress could be barred if you created a campsite in mission-critical stealth grass during \"The Kusarigama’s Shame,\" didn't have flash bombs during the \"Fighting Fire with Fire\" mission, or--and this is very specific--saved and exited the game after interrogating the enemy but before defeating Saito's goons during the \"Higashi Lumberyard\" mission. There are more, but you get it.In short, many of these very random and very specific \"permanent mission blocking\" bugs have been ironed out. Now, nothing is stopping you from getting your revenge on that dastardly Lord Saito and his cronies.Ghost of Yotei--which received a 9/10 in GameSpot's \"superb\" review--is available now for PlayStation 5.Ghost of Yotei Update 1.010 Patch NotesPerformance and StabilityFixed a rare crash that could happen when ray tracing is enabled.Fixed a rare crash that could occur during “Poison and Lies” if the player backtracked to the fire in the building then walked towards Oyuki with the Nine Tails NPC following Atsu.GameplayFixed a bug that prevented the Black Ghost mask from being granted to players who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of Ghost of Yotei once they completed “To Catch a Spider”.Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “Fighting Fire with Fire” due to the player not being guaranteed to have flash bombs during the flash bomb trainer.Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “The Way of the Kusarigama” if the player warped into the mission during a specific point.Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “The Tale of the Oni” if the player managed to avoid seeing the “armor upgrade” scene and then left the area.Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “A Brokered Trust” if the player managed to complete part of the branching objectives and then goes and completes a different mission allowing the second branch to become available.Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “Higashi Lumberyard” if the player saved and exited the game after interrogating the enemy but before defeating Saito’s soldiers.Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “Broken Horn Garrison” if the player died after killing all enemies and rescuing the prisoner but before the final conversation plays.Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “The Kusarigama’s Shame” if the player created a campsite in mission critical stealth grass.Fixed a permanent game blocking bug that could happen if the player climbed a tower in the Frontier, talked to an NPC, but then restarted from their last checkpoint.Fixed a bug that could happen in “Encounters of the Wild” that would cause the fox to appear stuck if the player had reloaded their game after seeing the bear above the cave near the sanctuary.Fixed a bug that would allow the player to change their loadout during the spar with Kiku in “A Wolf’s Pack”.Fixed a bug where the player could become stuck in a permanent respawn loop if they jumped into a pit and died soon after completing an objective or mission.EnvironmentReplaced a placeholder asset that had been along a major path in “The Kitsune’s Fate”.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                A former God of War producer is raising the alarm on AAA development, saying that big-name publishers like Activision and Sony need to diversify their offerings more as there are great opportunities in smaller games.Speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom Asia, former Sony Santa Monica Studio co-head and director of product development Meghan Morgan Juinio (who served as a producer on 2018's God of War) expressed concern over the games industry's untenable decision-making post-pandemic. In light of the myriad mass layoffs and studio closures plaguing the games industry in the last five or so years, Morgan Juinio believes that while the \"payoff is potentially really large\" for big publishers to continue pursuing franchises such as Call of Duty, there are also opportunities for AA and indie titles inside and outside of these series because gamers are seeking experiences that buck big-game conventions like bloated budgets, massive playtimes, and overwrought developments.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: God of War Ragnarok: The Mythology Behind the End of the World\n      \n\"I do also think there is an opportunity for those big players to also look to diversify into double-A and single-A, and then perhaps indie as well right?\" she said. \"And what size, shape, or form does that take? I don't know [...] but I think we need to look beyond the knee-jerk reaction of the pandemic and post-pandemic couple of years and really think about who do we want to be? What kind of product do we want to put out? We need to plot out intentionally how we're going to get there.\"Morgan Juinio pointed specifically to games such as Astro Bot and Split Fiction--two games that fit comfortably within the AA framework due to their smaller scope, shorter development, and scaled budget. Specifically, she mentioned that these games succeeded not just because of their non-AAA connection but also because they provided captivating and innovative gameplay that was more fascinating than what some (or even most) AAA games are currently offering. Also, these two games--Astro Bot and Split Fiction--are a bit cheaper than, say, Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which was another enticing element toward their commercial success. Consider that some analysts recently claimed that no one wants to spend $100 on a game, let alone one as hyped as Grand Theft Auto 6.\"What I believe is that we have to make great video games,\" she continued. \"It doesn't matter what shape. I think gamers right now are a little bit desensitized to beautiful graphics and size and scale and scope. It's almost a given, right? If a game isn't fun, it doesn't matter how pretty it is. If a game isn't engaging or delivering some hook, then it's not going to connect with players.\"There's a lot of doom and gloom around the games industry as of late. Games are becoming more expensive. Developers are losing jobs. And, oh no, shareholders are unhappy with the sales of their expensive games. It's easy to feel defeated as someone who works in the games industry. Still, Morgan Juinio is \"an eternal glass-half-full type thinker\" and believes that, as long as creativity and innovation continue to persist, there will be structural changes that will benefit everyone writ large--particularly if publishers invest in smaller projects more.\"I think the very nature of who we are, as developers and creators, won't allow it to stay doom and gloom. They won't accept that state of the world,\" she explained. \"Does that mean, though, that we're going to go back to the types of games that came out five years ago or during the pre-pandemic times? No. I think it's going to be something new. We don't know yet what it is, but I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry. And I believe that even if the powers that be structurally change or completely get upended, there is still a demand out there for great games.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 17, 2025 at 10:53AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Are you excited to catch all the Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A? There are three of these magnificent creatures in Lumiose City: Xerneas, Yveltal, and Zygarde. Of course, taking them on is no easy feat, as you truly need to prove your skills as a trainer. We've got all the details for you in our guide, but be forewarned that there are major spoilers, too.How to catch all Legendary Pokemon In Pokemon Legends: Z-A - Zygarde, Xerneas, and Yveltal locations guideTo be clear, the Legendary Pokemon Zygarde does show up several times throughout the campaign. However, you can only catch it, as well as Xerneas and Yveltal, after completing the main story. Here's a quick summary:After beating the campaign, you wake up at Hotel Z. Chat with your buddies and other NPCs to learn that the Infinite Z-A Royale is underway. This event basically allows you to continue earning tickets from the Battle Zone, leading to a face-off against a rival trainer.Go earn your tickets and defeat your first opponent. Surprisingly enough, it's good ol' Zach the Driver, the fella that you faced when you were still Rank Z. Oh, and he still has low-level creatures like Pidgey and Pikachu.After trouncing your foe, claim your reward from Quasartico Inc. and return to Hotel Z. You're then told about two mythical beasts known as \"The One that Gives\" and \"The One that Takes.\" These unlock two main quest arcs.The One that Gives: Part 1 - Alpha PokemonYou can tackle either of the two quests to get a Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. That said, we opted to prioritize \"The One that Takes.\"Initially, you just need to talk to Mable at the Pokemon Research Center. She'll tell you that Alpha Pokemon have appeared in Wild Zones 3, 5, and 9.Wild Zone 3: Steelix (level 70)Wild Zone 5: Gallade (level 70)Wild Zone 9: Pangoro (level 70)Note: As mentioned in our Pokedex guide, some of these creatures are harder to acquire compared to others. For instance, you need to equip an Onix with a Metal Coat, and you also have to trade it away just to evolve it into a Steelix. As such, you're better off using Ultra Balls to capture these opponents after beating them in combat. They're also Alpha variants, which means they're larger and have at least one move that's not normally learned by their species when leveling up.The One that Gives: Part 2 - Xerneas battleAfter eliminating the three Alpha pokemon, it's time to get your first legendary. To catch Xerneas in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, you need to go to Wild Zone 11. There's a glowing marker at the other side of the river, so approach it to make the level 75 Xerneas spawn.Xerneas is a Fairy-type combatant, which means it's weak against Poison and Steel. For the most part, it will buff itself using Geomancy. It also has a lifesteal ability known as Horn Leech, and a high-damage move called Megahorn.Note: Once Xerneas has been incapacitated, you need to catch it. If you fail in the attempt, you have no choice but to redo the encounter.The One that Takes: Part 2 - Mega EvolutionsThe other main quest arc leads you to Grisham and Griselle, former members of Team Flare. They'll accompany you to Quasartico Inc. to chat with Vinnie. He's got a machine that allows you to fight some familiar foes. They're none other than the Mega Evolved versions of Victreebell, Hawlucha, and Tyranitar. We've discussed these opponents in our Mega Evolutions guide, but here are a few tidbits:Mega Victreebell (level 70) - Weak against Fire abilities. Its ultimate causes an eruption of gooey blobs, with poison pools that linger on the ground.Mega Hawlucha (level 70) - Weak against Psychic and Fairy abilities. It will charge its power for several seconds, before performing a dive-bomb attack in the center of the arena. You can make it flinch to cancel the charge-up animation, but it will still its dive-bomb plunge.Mega Tyranitar (level 70) - Weak against Water and Grass. It will send out spiky tremors that travel along the ground. Dismiss your Pokemon so it doesn't get hit, and keep running sideways to avoid the stalagmites.Note: Unlike the Rogue Mega Evolution bouts in the campaign, you don't have any allies assisting you here. Also, if your character takes too many hits and blacks out during an encounter, you'd have to restart the battle.The One that Takes: Part 2 - Yveltal battleIt's time to catch another Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Your next target is Yveltal, who spawns on the rooftop of Galerie de la Lune, the fashion outlets/shops in the northern part of the city.Yveltal is a Dark/Flying type, making it weak against various elements, including Electric and Ice. However, we recommend bringing a strong Fairy-type creature, such as Clefable, to take it on. Offensive abilities like Moonblast and Dazzling Gleam, combined with the heals from the Moonlight spell, should make this encounter a breeze.Note: Similar to Xerneas, you need to catch Yveltal at the end of the battle. Otherwise, you'll have to fight it again.To Keep the World in Balance: Part 1 - L trainer battleAfter capturing both Xerneas and Yveltal, no additional quest marker will appear. But, if you return to Hotel Z, you'll suddenly be approached by Lysandre, also known as L. You have to face him and his squad of Pokemon, too.Pyroar (level 78) - Normal/FireFlorges (level 78) - FairySableye (level 78) - Dark/GhostGarbodor (level 78) - PoisonNoivern (level 78) - Flying/DragonMega Gyarados (level 80) - Water/DarkTo Keep the World in Balance: Part 2 - Zygarde battleWith Lysandre defeated, you'll have an opportunity to challenge Zygarde in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Go to Wild Zone 20 and find it in the middle of the area. Make sure you're well prepared because this upcoming battle has multiple phases. Here's what you need to know:Zygarde is a level 84 Dragon/Ground-type Pokemon. It's slightly weak against Dragon and Fairy moves, but it's also highly susceptible against Ice damage.Your best bets are Charizard with the Mega Evolution X keystone (Fire/Dragon), the aforementioned Yveltal (Dark/Flying), or Clefable (Fairy).Zygarde \"locks\" your active Pokemon. You won't be able to switch it out unless it gets incapacitated.First phase: Zygarde will be at 10% power--i.e. dog form. It will mostly around the arena while casting Thousand Arrows.Second phase: Zygarde will be at 50% power--i.e. serpent form. It will often use Rock Slide, Crunch, and Dragon Pulse. If your Pokemon has abilities that make it automatically move--i.e. Fly, Megahorn, and the like--then they can deftly avoid Dragon Pulse. Also, when Zygarde charges its ultimate, Land's Wrath, be ready to run away from it.After defeating the two forms of Zygarde, it will turn into its 100% robot-like variant. This is going to be a protracted fight, and you definitely need to be careful here. Certain attacks can hit your character multiple times, causing you to black out.Zygarde's basic attacks include Thousand Arrows and Thousand Waves. Since these are all Ground-based abilities, a Flying Pokemon shouldn't have any problems.Zygarde alternates between two ultimate abilities when it glows. Dismiss your Pokemon beforehand just to be on the safe side:  Core Enforcer - When it flies to the edge of the arena, run away from the center to avoid the beam blast. Then, move to a safe spot on the ground before the ensuing explosion.Land's Wrath - Multiple explosions occur in quick succession and you need to dodge them effectively. Try not to get hit several times.To Keep the World in Balance: Part 3 - Zygarde Mega Evolution and combat mechanicsThe fight might be long and arduous but, if you do everything right, you should be able to catch a Zygarde in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. This creature has fairly unique combat mechanics, too:Note that the Zygardite keystone should be in your inventory since it's a reward from the campaign's finale. Make sure Zygarde has it equipped so it can undergo its Mega Evolution.Lysandre will give you the Zygarde Cube. This allows you to freely switch between Zygarde's 10% form and 50% form during a battle.When Zygarde's HP drops below 50%, it will change to its 100% Complete Form. You can only activate Zygarde's Mega Evolution while it's in this form.Zygarde's Complete Form grants boosted stats, and the Core Enforcer ability also changes to Nihil Light.That does it for our guide on how to catch all Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. We hope you enjoy using Zygarde, Xerneas, and Yveltal in more battles ahead. In any case, since we've mentioned the gameplay mechanic a few times already, you might want to check our Mega Evolutions guide.You don't need to face the challenges in Lumiose City all by your lonesome. We've got a Pokemon Legends: Z-A guides hub to help you go from the bottom to the very top of the rankings.    \n  \n                      "

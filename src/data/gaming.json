The friendship mechanic, also known as happiness, determines your teammates' respective affinity toward you, their trainer. This can be improved through various means to help unlock new evolutionary paths.Pokemon can become friendlier toward you through the following methods:Exploring the game world while they're your active buddy.Using various items and equipment.Chilling in cafes and restaurants.Which Pokemon tend to evolve based on friendship levels?Friendship level in Pokemon Legends: Z-A matters to certain creatures whose evolutions are tied to this concept. These include the following:Pikachu - Evolves from a Pichu at high friendship levels.Eevee - Can turn into an Espeon (daytime evolution), Umbreon (nighttime evolution), or Sylveon (evolution with a Fairy-type ability in the moveset).Cleffa - Evolves into a Clefairy.Budew - Evolves into a Roselia during the day.Buneary - Evolves into a Lopunny.Riolu - Evolves into a Lucario during the day.Items that help increase friendship levels: Berries and the Soothe BellVarious items can increase Pokemon happiness and friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. These include different kinds of berries that boost friendship, while also lowering a particular stat. We don't really recommend using these since it's hard to offset the penalties to a Pokemon's stat growth. But if you really want to, you can check unmarked vendor and market stalls all over the city:Pomeg Berry - Lose base points for its HP stat.Kelpsy Berry - Lose base points for its attack stat.Qualot Berry - Lose base points for its defense stat.Hondew Berry - Lose base points for its SP attack stat.Grepa Berry - Lose base points for its SP defense stat.Tamato Berry - Lose base points for its speed stat.Still, one item that's quite viable is the Soothe Bell. It's a reward from Side Mission 36: Some Friendly Competition. Here are a few tidbits:The quest giver NPC is right in front of Cafe Rouleau in Magenta Sector 5. It's in the western part of the map.Defeat the trainer's Clefairy to receive the item.You can have a Pokemon hold the Soothe Bell via the inventory screen. This makes the creature friendlier.Fast friendship boosts via cafes and restaurantsBy far the fastest method of improving friendship and happiness levels involves cafes and restaurants. These are found all throughout Lumiose City:Go to a cafe and purchase a coffee or tea drink. Each option costs roughly 500 gold or more.Do this three or four times to fully max out a Pokemon's affinity toward you. You don't even need to go to a different establishment.You're going to spend 2,000 gold or more each time, but you can still earn a lot of money from the Battle Zone at night.That does it for our guide on how to increase friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. If you're keen on improving the capabilities of your teammates, you can visit our best early-game Pokemon guide and TM locations guide.You don't need to face the challenges in Lumiose City all by your lonesome. We've got a Pokemon Legends: Z-A guides hub to help you go from the bottom to the very top of the rankings.    \n  \n                      \n    "

The first is the Avatar Legends: 20th Anniversary Physical RPG Bundle, which offers $140 worth of Avatar: Legends The Roleplaying Game materials--including the official starter set with rules, premade adventures, character sheets, and more--for just $49. The other bundle is the Magpie Games Extravaganza, which gets you up to 27 digital edition rulebooks and expansions for multiple TTRPGs, including Avatar Legends, for just $25. You can check out the full contents of both bundles below. Both bundles are available until November 1, and a portion of all sales is donated to charity.                                 Avatar Legends: 20th Anniversary Physical RPG Bundle                                                                $49 | Valued at $140                                                                                                                                                                                    Unlike many Humble Bundles, which offer digital products, this one gets you physical products. The Starter Set is the main attraction of the bundle, as it comes with a 32-page rule booklet, 40-page introductory adventure, 10 engraved dice, a full-color map of the Four Nations, 10 character sheets, and six rules reference cards. Along with the starter pack, you'll also get a selection of physical gameplay materials, including even more dice, a cloth map of the Avatar world, journals, and more.

The deal is only available until November 1.                      It's worth noting you can also grab the Avatar: Legends Starter Set at Amazon for just $19 (was $30). While the Avatar Legends: 20th Anniversary Physical RPG Bundle is a great way to add physical editions of the game's essential materials to your collection, digital PDF versions of the Avatar Legends: Starter Set, Core Rulebook, and two pre-made adventure books are available in the Magpie Games Extravaganza. The bundle also features digital books from other Magpie Games-published TTRPGs like Root, Bluebeard's Bride, Masks: A New Generation, and more. It offers multiple pricing tiers starting at $5--though if you want the Avatar: Legends books, you'll need to pay at least $25. A portion of all sales for this bundle is donated to the ACLU. The Magpie Games Extravaganza bundle is available until November 1.For more tabletop RPG deals, Humble is also offering physical and digital edition packs for the World of Darkness TTRPG--which is the tabletop game that the Vampire: The Masquerade series is based on. The physical bundle includes up to eight rulebooks, expansions, and adventures for $150, while the digital bundle gets you up to 57 PDF edition books for $25. Like the Avatar: Legends deals, these are limited-time offers, and a portion of the proceeds goes to charity.Beyond tabletop RPGs, Humble also has plenty of other bundle deals on PC games like the Warhammer WAAAGHtober Bundle that offers up to 12 Warhammer PC games for $12, comics bundles like the Mike Mignola's Hellboy, Witchfinder, And More Book Bundle, and novel collections like the Star Wars: Go Beyond The Films Book Bundle.

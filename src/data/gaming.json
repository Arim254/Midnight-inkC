    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Diego Nicolás Argüello\n   on December 19, 2025 at 9:11AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The best Peak mods expand the creative spirit of developer Team Peak. The vanilla experience is already enticing as is, inviting you and up to three other friends to cruise through biomes filled with hazards and absurd obstacles as you climb toward a volcano's summit. The community, however, has been hard at work coming up with ideas of its own.While Peak's foundation provides no shortage of thrills and can keep you busy for a while, there are multiple mods that add interesting quality-of-life updates, from features that aren't supported officially to gadgets and gimmicks that fit the in-game world.Our list provides a jack-of-all-trades collection of Peak mods to get you started. It's worth mentioning that the game has only had a few months of lifespan, and Team Peak is constantly updating it with fixes and the occasional new biome or item. November, for example, saw the inclusion of the biome Roots, alongside an assortment of new items to play with. But if you'd like to expand the game on your own with the best Peak mods available, here are our top choices gathered in one place.If you're looking for some help, we have guides about doing the scout cannon glitch, where to find the Scoutmaster, and all the items currently in the game.GhostPingCreator: boxofbiscuits97Downloadlink: ThunderstoreGhostPing is the immediate \"I didn't know how much I needed this\" selection of this list. As the title teases, this makes it so you can use the pin feature when you're a ghost. While you can still use voice proximity chat by default even if you're dead, there's always that moment when you want to manually pin at an obstacle, a poisonous flower, or a specific ledge. GhostPing removes that frustration entirely.Peak UnlimitedCreator: glarmerDownloadlink: ThunderstoreOne of the best Peak mods out there, and for good reason. Peak Unlimited increases the multiplayer capacity in a lobby from the default four-player limit. Only the host needs to have this mod installed, which makes the process very easy. And in case you're wondering, yes, there will be marshmallows for the extra players when you're gathered at the campsite, and this also applies to late joiners.StableThirdPersonCameraCreator: LeftOutDownloadlink: ThunderstoreWhether you're not accustomed to first-person views due to motion sickness or you're looking for a different perspective, StableThirdPersonCamera adds a different option. All you have to do is press N, and you'll get to see your character in third person. And hey, you may have a lower chance of stepping on obstacles with this mode on.EverestCreator: StevenDownloadlink: ThunderstoreThe Peak experience tends to be self-contained within a lobby, but Everest presents an intriguing alternative. With this mod, when somebody dies, their location is saved to a server. As you play, your world is populated with skeletons of fellow fallen players, left as a mark. It's similar in nature to a Bloodstain in Dark Souls, albeit with the difference that you won't see an animation of how the player met their demise. You'll have to imagine it, and hopefully avoid recreating it.sPEAKerCreator: onlystarDownloadlink: ThunderstoreIf you're a music person, you're going to love sPEAKer. This mod adds a portable speaker that mimics its real-life counterpart to a painstaking degree. Rather than playing plain music for everyone in the background, it leverages spatial audio to make it part of the experience in an immersive way, adding to the chat proximity aspect of the game. The community has been uploading mixtapes to Thunderstore, but you can also go ahead and add your own music tracks.MorePeakCreator: smckeenDownloadlink: ThunderstoreThe daily map rotation in Peak keeps the game fresh and enticing, but you might not always want to wait 24 hours to mix things up. As part of our best Peak mods list, MorePeak removes the daily wait timer entirely. Instead, every time you start a round, the game will load a new map. It could be a good method to keep in mind if you're trying to find the secret entrance in the Mesa biome.MultiplayerPauseCreator: CodeBurstDownloadlink: ThunderstoreHere's a Peak mod that every multiplayer lobby host should have. MultiplayerPause does what it says on the tin, allowing the host to pause the game for everyone by merely pressing \"P\" on the keyboard. It's perfect for quick breaks, especially as the fog can start to rise quite fast depending on the difficulty.PiggybackCreator: RooseDownloadlink: ThunderstorePiggyback is similar to MultiplayerPause, but it's not as disruptive. Basically, if one player has gone AFK or if they simply want a shortcut, this mod allows players to carry other characters even if they've not passed out. Only the players who intend to carry others need to have the mod installed, so it can happen by surprise if conditions are met.BetterRagdollCreator: LuluberluDownloadlink: ThunderstoreRagdoll is an important aspect of Peak, but the BetterRagdoll mod allows you to manually trigger it with just the press of a button (X on the keyboard). This makes it so you get a little push in the direction that you're moving, making it feel more dynamic, while also speeding up the process of getting back up.PeakClassModCreator: SafronDownloadlink: ThunderstoreAs part of our selection of best Peak mods, this selection is a substantial addition, getting close to an overhaul of how the multiplayer experience works. PeakClassMod introduces eight classes with distinct abilities and playstyles, as well as disadvantages to balance them out. The classes include Scout, Medic, Tech-Priest, Mushroomancer, Great Épée, Rogue, Eddie, and Bill. It's definitely not a mod that takes itself seriously, which is fitting for Peak. If you've already accrued dozens of hours in the game and you've been wanting to try something new with your usual multiplayer group, this is the Peak mod for you.Peak Checkpoint SaveCreator: dominik0207Download link: ThunderstoreThe Roots update of Peak introduced a checkpoint feature via the Checkpoint Flag, making the climb to the summit a little easier. The way it works is that it creates a checkpoint wherever you plant it on the mountain. If you die, you'll respawn back at that point. The Peak Checkpoint Save, however, tackles a different necessity--if you or any of your teammates need to call it a day early, you can now save your progress at every campfire and continue later at the same location. Just make sure everybody playing has the mod installed to avoid issues.Catch PlayersCreator: tony4twentyDownload link: ThunderstoreThe action of extending your hand to help a friend is at the heart of Peak, but Catch Players takes this further. This mod allows you to catch a falling player who is close enough to you to be saved, which will make it so you pull them towards you. It can be great for those moments where somebody offers to try and see if a climb is possible, with the reassurance that the people under them will be able to catch them if things go sour.Compass UICreator: CoomzyDownload link: ThunderstoreWhile some players might prefer for navigation to be as close to the original intent as possible, this Peak mod adds a useful compass to the top of the screen. With it, you'll be able to see the location of friends, as well as suitcases. All markers on the compass show their distance from the player, and there are also up and down arrows to indicate the latitude of each object or friend. There are also options to tweak the compass, such as making it so that suitcases either show all the time or if they require a \"ping\" button press, to tailor to your liking.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's lonely out in space, especially if you're a Starfield player waiting for any word about the next major update coming to the game. Bethesda's space-based game will receive an additional story DLC, it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter.According to Windows Central, Bethesda \"felt more comfortable\" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a \"busy holiday period\" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players.One of the rumored changes is a revamp of the game's space flight systems that will actually make travel feel like a journey instead of a series of loading screens. Other aspects of space travel and exploration are also said to be improved in the new update, and the Creation Engine will reportedly include \"large technical improvements ... that will also carry forward to future games.\"However, a separate report about the Starfield showcase from IGN seemingly walks back the scope of some of those changes and adds that fans shouldn't expect a \"Cyberpunk 2.0-scale update.\" Until the embargo from the event is lifted, further details probably won't be available.Former Bethesda developer Bruce Nesmith recently stated that he felt Starfield fell short of Fallout and Elder Scrolls, despite liking the game himself. There are rumors that Starfield will come to PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 in the future, but Bethesda has yet to confirm the game for either of those systems.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

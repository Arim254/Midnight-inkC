The developer has confirmed that after seven years and 50+ updates, The Sims Mobile will go offline for good on January 20, 2026.At 1:59 PM UTC that day, the game will no longer be playable at all. There is no offline mode, so the game will be gone for good at this time.\"The Sims Mobile and The Sims community as a whole are full of creativity, kindness, and imagination. You've amazed us with your stories, builds, and Sims. We're proud to have shared this journey with you,\" the developer said.There will be a number of events coming to The Sims Mobile ahead of the shutdown, now through January 2026, and you can see a complete rundown on EA's website (via PC Gamer).Say goodbye to The Sims Mobile.The final update for The Sims Mobile went live today, October 20, and from this date forward, players cannot buy any in-game packs or spend real money. Players who have a balance of SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets can continue to use these until the game closes in January 2026. Unspent currency will not be eligible for a refund after January 20, 2026.The October 20 update also added \"unlimited energy\" to The Sims Mobile, which will help players progress more quickly while the game remains online.On October 21, The Sims Mobile will be delisted from mobile game stores. Anyone who has the game installed currently or previously, however, can keep playing until January 2026.EA also announced that on January 6, 2026, all Build Mode and Create A Sim items will be unlocked for everyone. \"We want to give everyone the opportunity to build their dream home, design their perfect Sims, and experience everything The Sims Mobile has to offer before the servers close,\" the developer said.EA regularly closes servers for older titles for a variety of reasons, but the company did not provide any details on why The Sims Online is being taken offline in January 2026. The announcement of the game's upcoming closure came not long after EA announced that it was selling itself to an investor consortium including Saudi Arabia for $55 billion.While The Sims Mobile is coming to an end, EA continues to support The Sims 4 with new content, but it's sold so much DLC for that game that the company doesn't plan to make The Sims 5.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Outer Worlds 2 is launching in early access later this week, and it's going to diverge from some of the standard conventions of action-RPG titles. While Obsidian Entertainment has already established that its six companion characters can't be romanced, the studio has revealed that they can actually turn on the player if you give them enough of a reason.During an interview with Xbox Expansion Pass (via GamesRadar), game directors Matt Singh and Brandon Adler noted that players' decisions can potentially backfire on them by alienating their companions, who may choose to attack or even attempt to kill the player under the right circumstances.\"One of the things that was really important is, we wanted these characters to feel like they're their own people,\" Singh said. \"They have their own goals, their own motivations, and if the player's aligning with them, that's great. They're going to be there for you. They'll fight alongside you. But if you go against their interests, they're going to have something to say about it. That might break out into a conflict. That might mean they leave you or you have to fight them to the death. But if you do build that relationship with them, they'll be there for you in the end.\"As an example, Adler noted that the companion character Inez is aligned with the Auntie's Choice faction. If players ignore Inez's request to stop killing members of her group, she won't just leave your team, she'll also attack the player at various points.However, Adler added that these turns won't happen in a vacuum, and the companion characters will actually warn players about their deteriorating relationships ahead of time with requests or ultimatums. Players will have the option to try to save their relationships, and also suffer the consequences if they choose to do nothing.Obsidian recently introduced a Moon Man plushie called a \"Couch-Panion,\" which is the prize for winning a contest running through November 16. Players don't have to rely on a contest to get a pair of limited-edition, customizable Outer Worlds 2 Xbox Wireless Controllers, though. However, both controllers are more expensive than the game's $70 price.The Outer Worlds 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 29, and will be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release. Obsidian has shared the launch times, while early-access players will get to dive into it on October 24.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

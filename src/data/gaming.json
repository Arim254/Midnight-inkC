    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Roguelite is one of the hottest subgenres in gaming right now. From Balatro to Drop Duchy, developers have integrated cyclical mechanics into all sorts of other genres. Independent studios eSolu and Team Mojo Games are adding another game to the subgenre with Odds Chronicles.Odds Chronicles combines grid-based combat, a roguelite run structure, and dice mechanics to create its overall package. Each roll of the dice will give your team different resources, including attributes like strength and magic.Dice-based roguelites and roguelikes, including standouts like Dicey Dungeons, have been around for some time, but new takes on rolling the dice are welcome. Bringing dice mechanics into a turn-based grid tactics game is a nice way to build off the SOCOM-like percentages that decide whether or not you'll land your attacks.          We don't have much to go on besides the reveal trailer, but the gameplay and visuals look polished enough to make Odds Chronicles stand out among a sea of other roguelites. The tactical roguelite will launch on Steam and Epic Games Store in 2026, with versions for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S arriving later.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Last year, Netflix released a documentary called The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, which followed the story of Mats Steen, a Norwegian gamer who found community and acceptance through World of Warcraft as his body suffered the effects of a rare form of muscular dystrophy. Now, Steen's life is being adapted as a scripted film, which already has a number of stars lined up.According to Deadline, the cast of Ibelin includes Charlie Plummer, Anthony Hopkins, Toni Collette, Stephen Graham, Isabela Merced, and Maisy Stella. The Imitation Game director Morten Tyldum will helm the film from a script by Ilaria Bernardini and Hossein Amini. The story will be based on Steen's blog, Musings of Life, which he wrote until he passed away at 25 in 2014. While Steen lost control of his limbs, he made a name for himself in WoW as Ibelin, where he made friends who helped give him a reason to keep going as long as possible. As noted in the report, Steen was \"admired by thousands for his humor, kindness, and courage.\"Vendôme Pictures and French studio Pathé are teaming up for Ibelin, which doesn't have an American distributor yet. The film distribution rights will likely be sold at the upcoming American Film Market.Earlier this year, WoW fans discovered that Blizzard paid tribute to Steen by placing his character, Lord Ibelin, into the game as an NPC. The game's next expansion, World Of Warcraft: Midnight, will have a beta test on November 11.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                There are a lot of questions about the future of Xbox as a brand, when games like The Outer Worlds 2 and even its signature shooter, Halo, is coming to PlayStation 5. Microsoft is reportedly working on the next generation of Xbox, but the outlook doesn't look promising. However, Xbox's perceived decline doesn't mean that consoles are dead, according a prominent video game analyst.Rhys Elliott's Alinea Insight newsletter has shared the estimated sales for PlayStation 5 games in October 2025, and the two big winners were Battlefield 6, EA Sports FC 26, and Ghost of Yotei, with 3.2 million, 3 million, and 2.7 million in sales, respectively. The trio's nearly combined 9 million in sales led Elliott to remark, \"AAA games, live services, and single-player alike, are still thriving on console. The 'CoNsOlE iS DeAd' narrative is getting annoying. Xbox as a console is dying, yes. But let's not extrapolate that too far, eh?\"Publishing Xbox games on PlayStation 5 has already paid dividends for Microsoft. Several of Microsoft's formerly exclusive titles dominated the PlayStation sales charts earlier this year.Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto 5 both placed in the top 10, at fourth and seventh, respectively. That's thanks in part to a continuous flow of new content via Minecraft expansions and GTA Online. Additionally, EA Sports took three of the top 10 slots between FC 26, FC 25, and Madden NFL 26. Take-Two's NBA 2K26 took the fifth slot with 564,000 copies sold for the month.Alinea Insight's top 10 best-selling PS5 games for October 2025 and their estimated sales are reproduced below.Battlefield 6 - 3.2 millionEA Sports FC 26 - 3.0 millionGhost of Yotei - 2.7 millionMinecraft - 635,000NBA 2K26 - 564,000EA FC 25 - 350,000Grand Theft Auto 5 - 338,000EA Madden NFL 26 - 261,000Little Nightmares 3 - 245,000Digimon Story: Time Stranger - 241,000\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

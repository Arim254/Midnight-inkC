This quick and straightforward quest sends you to Blue Gate to snag one of these honey-filled bee homes from the Olive Grove POI, and we'll tell you exactly where to get your hands on it.You'll need to extract with the beehive in your inventory to get credit for the quest's completion, so you'd do well to bring an augment that possesses a safe pocket so that you can toss this quest item in there for safekeeping--you know, just in case some other raider decides to get fiesty with you. Don't worry--the bees won't sting, though.When you're ready to get your hands sticky with honey, here's how to find a beehive for the Bees! quest.Where to find a beehive for the Bees! questTo collect a beehive, you'll need to visit the Olive Grove POI on the Blue Gate map. This area is located in the southern region of the map and happens to be a very active spot for raiders since Olives are a hot commodity. With this in mind, make sure you wave and ask to be friends if you don't want to catch any fire from folks while you're snagging the beehive here.Find the beehive here.When you arrive to the location on the map above, you'll find a little shack. If you listen closely, you can probably hear the bees swarming nearby. Look under the roof on the side of the shack to spot the beehive and plenty of little bees flying around. Interact with it to add it to your inventory.Interact with the beehive to pick it up.With the beehive acquired, you'll need to extract and take back to Speranza to finish the Bees! quest. The Forest Airshaft is to your northwest, while the Overlook Airshaft can be visited by heading northeast. Head to whichever one is open based on how much time is left in the map, as they're both likely to be equally dangerous. Keep a lookout for rogue raiders and any patrolling ARC, hit the button, drop inside, and interact with the computer to get back to Speranza and finish things up.For more on Arc Raiders, we've compiled a full quest list for you.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

In the Espresso quest in Arc Raiders, you'll need to go topside and seek out an espresso maker from a cafe in Buried City. If you're wondering where exactly to go for this caffeine fix, we've got you covered.You'll need to extract from Buried City and return to Speranza with the espresso machine in your inventory to complete the mission, so it's smart to bring along an augment with a safe pocket to store the quest item in. A good gun and shield for protection can't hurt, either.When you're ready to get the espresso machine, follow the steps below.Where to find the espresso machine in Arc RaidersThe espresso machine is located in a cafe in Plaza Rosa in the southern portion of the Buried City map. This area is often swarming with ARC, so it can be a challenge to get in and out unnoticed, especially if you're also dealing with other raiders questing or looting in the vicinity. Don't be afraid to take things slow when approaching to stay unnoticed.Cafe locationThe cafe is a red building with a \"cafe\" sign just above the door.The cafe is a red building with a cafe sign above the door. Random raider falling out of the window not included.Head inside this building and check the counter for the espresso machine. Pick it up to add it to your inventory. Afterward, feel free to loot the cafe for any additional items before you extract.Pick up the espresso machine.With the espresso machine obtained, you'll now need to successfully extract with it if you want to complete the quest. You're in luck, though, because the Souther Station extraction point is literally right in front of the cafe. Just walk outside and drop (or zipline) down into the broken section of the ground, then press the button, wait for the train, and get out of the Buried City alive. You deserve a cup of coffee for all of that hard work.If you're stuck on anything else, we've got plenty more quest guides in our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fortnite Battle Royale will return to a more typical experience once the current Simpsons mini-season ends at the end of November, according to a blog posted on the Fortnite Status Twitter account, with the game slated to return to 100-player rounds and a much roomier island.The launch of Fortnite's Simpsons-themed mini-season at the beginning of November introduced some dramatic changes to the rhythm of Battle Royale matches, thanks largely to the size of the map. The new Springfield island covers about half the land area that the Chapter 6 island did, with the mode temporarily supporting 80 players instead of 100. That's made the island extraordinarily dense with players, and it's been tough to land in any named location at the start of a match without bumping into an opponent trying to grab the same chest you're going for.The blog said that fundamental shift in the flow of matches was an experiment.\"Here's something different: this season’s BR is 80 players instead of 100 on the more compact map. The vibe so far? Faster rotations, more meaningful fights, and less time running across empty fields. This is an experiment--we plan to return to 100 players next season--but we wanted to see what happens when we concentrate the action.\"That wasn't the only big piece of news we got from this blog. For this Saturday and Sunday only, Epic is adding two Simpsons-themed weapons--the Deodorant Applicator, and Bart's Slingshot--to the Battle Royale loot pool. This is another unusual thing Epic is trying during this mini-season, as the company debuted those weapons last weekend in Delulu mode.Fortnite's Simpsons season is live until November 29, when Chapter 7 will begin.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Since the awards' inception in 2014, the top prize has rarely gone to an independent studio. But that doesn't mean that the biggest publishers always win either.To date, the publisher with the most Game of the Year Awards is Sony, which emerged victorious last year with Astro Bot, The Last of Us Part 2 in 2020, and God of War in 2018.Surprisingly, Nintendo has only won the award once, for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in 2017. Microsoft has yet to win any, although it now owns Activision, which took home the award in 2019 for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.Although the onslaught of trailers tends to overshadow The Game Awards themselves, receiving that honor can be a game-changer. CD Projekt's 2015 win for The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt cemented its status as one of the top independent publishers in the industry. That title has also become one of the best-selling games in history.While there have been winners across multiple game types, RPGs have taken six out of the 12 Game of the Year Awards, and Expedition 33's win is the latest victory for that genre.The complete list of every Game of the Year Award winner from The Game Awards is reproduced below.Game of the Year 2014 -- Dragon Age: InquisitionDeveloper: BioWarePublisher: Electronic ArtsRunners-up:Bayonetta 2Dark Souls IIHearthstoneMiddle-earth: Shadow of MordorGame of the Year 2015 -- The Witcher 3: Wild HuntDeveloper: CD Projekt RedPublisher: CD ProjektRunners-up:Bloodborne Fallout 4Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom PainSuper Mario MakerGame of the Year 2016 -- OverwatchDeveloper: Blizzard EntertainmentPublisher: Blizzard EntertainmentRunners-up:DoomInsideTitanfall 2Uncharted 4: A Thief's EndGame of the Year 2017 -- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildDeveloper: Nintendo EPDPublisher: NintendoRunners-up:Horizon Zero DawnPersona 5PlayerUnknown's BattlegroundsSuper Mario OdysseyGame of the Year 2018 -- God of WarDeveloper: Santa Monica StudioPublisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentRunners-up:Assassin's Creed OdysseyCelesteMarvel's Spider-ManMonster Hunter: WorldRed Dead Redemption 2Game of the Year 2019 -- Sekiro: Shadows Die TwiceDeveloper: From SoftwarePublisher: ActivisionRunners-up:ControlDeath StrandingResident Evil 2Super Smash Bros.

Prime Video has now published the full release schedule for Fallout Season 2, so you can plan and prepare for all eight episodes.Episodes will be released weekly on Wednesdays at midnight PT, and the sophomore season will run through February 4, 2026. Fallout Season 1 also had eight episodes.The Season 2 schedule includes an update to the premiere, which is now coming on Tuesday, December 16, at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET. It was previously expected to debut on December 17. Fallout Season 2 scheduleEpisode 1 - December 16 at 12 6 PM PT / 9 PM ETEpisode 2- December 24 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ETEpisode 3 - December 31 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ETEpisode 4 - January 7 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ETEpisode 5 - January 14 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ETEpisode 6 - January 21 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ETEpisode 7 - January 28 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ETEpisode 8 - February 4 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET          Where to watch Fallout Season 2Just like Season 1, Fallout Season 2 will stream on Prime Video. That means you need to have a subscription to the service to watch. It costs $15/month or $140 year to get the ad-supported version, or an extra $3/month more to remove the ads. This also gets you Prime perks, including free shipping on items purchased through Amazon.Big change from Season 1As mentioned, Season 2 does away with the binge format in favor of having new episodes release weekly. With Season 1, some people enjoyed having all episodes release at the same time so they could binge the series. Others said they wished it was released weekly to give them time to digest.Fallout Season 2 brings on new cast members, including Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani, while the story heads to New Vegas.As for the game series, Fallout 76 just got its Burning Springs update that added The Ghoul, the character from the TV series played by Walton Goggins. Additionally, Bethesda is working on Fallout 5, but it's still very early days.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Yet another video game is getting a movie deal, as a report today states that Netflix has bought a movie idea for a film based on the upcoming game Kingmakers. For anyone unaware, Kingmakers is an action-strategy game set in medieval times that allows players to use AK-47s, grenade launchers, and attack helicopters in battle.The game is developed by Redemption Road Games and published by tinyBuild. It was due to launch in October this year before being delayed indefinitely due to its \"incredibly ambitious\" setup. Kingmakers is among the top five most-wishlisted games on Steam. So far, it's only been announced for PC.          Deadline reported that Netflix bought a movie pitch for the game, with writer Christopher MacBride (Flashback, The Conspiracy) attached to write the script. The report added that Stranger Things director Shawn Levy's production company, 21 Laps, is producing the Kingsmakers movie, while Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg, and Timothy L. Stevenson are also producing. Story Kitchen is also behind the Sonic movie series, along with the upcoming Tomb Raider and Life is Strange TV shows, among other gaming projects.Netflix recently announced a deal to buy many of the Warner Bros. Discovery entertainment assets for more than $80 billion. It's not necessarily a done deal yet, though, as Paramount has launched a hostile bid for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery at a higher price.There are dozens of video game movies in the works currently, but a film being in development does not mean it will get made. You can see the 50+ video game movies in development now in the gallery below.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

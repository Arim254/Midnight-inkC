    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Animal Crossing: New Horizons adds plenty of new features with the latest 3.0 update, including Resetti's Reset Service, which delivers a way for you to tidy up your island without doing all the manual labor yourself. There are some fees and limitations, but this guide will explain everything you need to know about unlocking and using Resetti's Reset Service.Make sure to check out our complete Animal Crossing: New Horizons guide hub to help you make the most of island life. This offers starter tips, guides for upgrades, and highlights major features you don't want to miss.How to find Resetti and unlock his servicesTalking to ResettiResetti's Reset Service gives you an easier way to clean up your island, which can be especially helpful when you're considering redecorating on a bigger scale--or even on an island-wide scale. Resetti can help you tidy up by doing most of the hard labor. First, you'll need to find him to unlock his services.First, you must be on the new 3.0 version of the game to access this content. If you need to check if you're updated, you can check by looking at the upper right-hand corner of the main menu loading screen. Your version should start with a 3.Once you're sure you're playing with update 3.0 installed, Resetti can be found randomly wandering your island. Search your island thoroughly, and you'll eventually find him walking around. You need to talk to him and let him explain his services before you can use them. He can be anywhere, it seems, so if you don't find him so easily, you may need to ensure you've looked everywhere.How to use Resetti's Reset ServiceSelecting an area to resetYou can use Resetti's Reset Service right away after speaking with him, or you can hire him at a later time by speaking with Isabelle at Resident Services. It's free the first time you use it, which you can save for later if you'd rather not use it now., After that first freebie, Resetti's Reset Service costs 60,000 Bells per use.The fee might sound hefty, but he'll tidy up as much as you want before the day ends.Resetti can tackle the entire island all at once, or you can choose to have him focus on specific areas. You can specifically have him clean up the beach area, or a specific highlighted area you select. The highlighted area you can choose looks to be about a 10x10 square. This is great for smaller projects you might want Resetti to tackle for you.If you choose to select a specific area of the island, Resetti will give you a transceiver. This will be in your pocket, so open your inventory and equip it once you've chosen an area to have him reset. The transceiver will let you highlight a 10x10 area in orange, so you can see exactly what part will be reset.What is covered with Resetti's Reset ServiceReset your island with ResettiAs Resetti explains, he can reset decorative things, including:FurnitureFencingLaddersAdditional decor you've placed on the groundThe items he resets for you are placed in storage, so you can redecorate with them later on.Not everything on the island is covered in his service, though. Resetti makes it clear that he won't clean up items washed ashore or buried in the ground, including:ShellsCoralTreesCropsWeedsThere are a few ways you can rid your island of weeds, though. Flowers are an exception to this ground rule. As an optional service, he can reset planted flowers and custom designs you've placed on the ground. You can choose to have him either toss them out with the trash or or place them in your storage.While Resetti is capable of \"resettin'\" for you, he also handles pest control. This will remove all those icky roaches from your home, so you don't have to stomp on all of them.He can be summoned back to your island by speaking with Isabelle at Resident Services. This means, as long as you have the Bells to pay, Resetti can help you out on most days. He doesn't work during festivals, though, so don't expect to summon him to work during a special event.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

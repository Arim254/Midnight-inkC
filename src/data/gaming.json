That's especially true for the Hotel Collection, as right now you can save 50% on select Star Wars scents, candles, and diffusers. This includes everything from premium candles with a burn time of up to 300 hours and tiny diffusers built to keep your car smelling fresh.Many of these scents have names like Rebel Spirit and The Dark Side, but rest assured, they won't smell like the inside of Darth Vader's helmet or the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. Each fragrance was crafted from a blend of ingredients, including Valencia Orange and Bergamot. Many of the scents are shared across product categories, so if you already know how you want your home (or car) to smell, here's a quick rundown of each fragrance in the Star Wars roster.Hotel Collection: Star Wars FragrancesThe Empire: Toasted vanilla, shadow clove, black amberJedi: Bergamot, damask rose, Chinese black teaThe Dark Side: Sinister sage, patchouli, saffronRebel Spirit: Bergamot, amber, Valencia orangeGalactic Hope: Smooth resin, seductive amber, vintage woodThe Force: Bright neroli, oud wood, cardamomSith: Cashmere amber, shadowy violet, bitter orangeThe Duel: Santal, dim amber, muskHere's a look at all the Star Wars fragrances and diffusers that are on sale snow. Many are up to 50% off. If you know you'll be using the scents for a long time, consider picking up a diffuser--it could save you money in the long run. Otherwise, a premium candle is a nice, affordable alternative. Please note that many discounts are only applicable when signing up for monthly subscriptions (not one-time purchases).Once you've browsed all the deals, be sure to check out GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for even more early discounts--and don't forget to check back throughout the month to see the latest price cuts on video games, figures, and beyond.Studio Pro Scent Diffuser (Home Diffuser)Before you can use any of the fragrance oils, you'll need to pick up a diffuser. These come in three different designs, though each one covers up to 600 square feet. They don't use heat or water, making them safe for kids and pets, and you won't find any residue left behind as the scents waft through your room. Their original price of $100 is a bit steep, but since you can snag a cool Star Wars one for just $50 right now, they're definitely worth a closer look.Darth Vader -- $50 ($100)Storm Trooper -- $50 ($100)C-3PO -- $50 ($100)Home Diffuser Fragrance OilA whole lot of fragrance oil for the Home Diffuser lineup is on sale at the Hotel Collection. These come in two styles--Pro and Regular. The Pro Pods are compatible with the Studio Pro Scent Diffusers (including the Star Wars models above). The Regular Pods are compatible with the older Studio Scent Diffuser. We've listed the Pro Pods below, but you'll find Regular variants on each store page if you're working with the older diffuser.The Empire -- $27.48 ($55)Jedi -- $38.46 ($55)The Dark Side -- $27.48 ($55)Rebel Spirit -- $27.48 ($55)Galactic Hope -- $38.46 ($55)Chauffeur Car Diffuser + Fragrance OilRoom SprayJust need a periodic scent refresh? These room sprays work a bit like cologne or perfume. Just give your space a few sprays, and the fragrance should linger around for a while.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was going to embrace games-as-a-service before it shifted to become XDefiant, a game that the publisher shut down not long after release. This is according to Nick Herman, a developer who worked on the game before leaving to start AdHoc Studios, the team that just launched the episodic game Dispatch to great success. Following the publication of this report, XDefiant director Mark Rubin spoke out to react to the report and share his side of the story.\"I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while,\" Herman said told Bloomberg. \"And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.\"The game was in development \"for a few months,\" Bloomberg reported, and Herman confirmed that Ubisoft wanted to have it feature games-as-a-service elements.\"We tried,\" Herman said. \"Let's make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.\"The report said \"Ubisoft had lost interest\" in this Splinter Cell game and shifted to pursue a project that could attempt to compete with Call of Duty. This became XDefiant, a game directed by former Call of Duty boss Mark Rubin. The game shut down after a year and developers were laid off. \"We thought we were going to be able to make something really great,\" Herman said. \"And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don't anymore. It's a common thing in games.\"Rubin, who directed XDefiant and is no longer with Ubisoft, shared his side of the story. He said it is \"not true\" that Ubisoft was working on a Splinter Cell game before switching to XDefiant. \"When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter Cell game. I then canceled that one and let the team pitch any game ideas they wanted,\" he said. \"There were some cool ones but I felt the scope/difficulty was too hard on some ideas so we stuck with an arena shooter and we found the fun quickly. So no we didn't pivot off Splinter Cell to make XDefiant. Now maybe they were thinking about working on Splinter Cell before I got there but it was never a thing while I was there. My experience with Ubisoft was they are very open to whatever the studio wants to do which is great but I do wish we could have used external engines.\"Saw the rumor from Bloomberg that we were working on Splinter Cell game before switching to Xdefiant. I can say that is not true. When I got to Ubisoft they had been working on a game for a year that was very ambitious but was struggling to find the fun. And it was NOT a Splinter…  — Mark Rubin (@PixelsofMark) November 15, 2025\n  While that Splinter Cell game is not coming to market, a Splinter Cell remake is now in the works. Outside of games, the Splinter Cell TV show Deathwatch debuted in October on Netflix and has already been renewed for a second season. A live-action movie was in the works, but apparently no longer is.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this month, Sony and Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda live-action movie began filming in New Zealand. It was only matter of time before clips from the film were leaked, and now it appears that the first footage may reveal that an actress from Severance is playing Impa.The brief footage posted on Instagram shows actress Bo Bragason in character as Princess Zelda as she meets with a performer who seems to be portraying Impa. The other actress in question has been identified by fans as Dichen Lachman, who is known for her role as Ms. Casey in Severance. Lachman has extensive experience in genre film and TV shows, including appearances in Altered Carbon, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Supergirl, The 100, and Jurassic World Dominion. This is just rumor for now, though, as no official casting announcement has been made for the Zelda movie beyond the two main leads.Impa has been a supporting character since the very first Legend of Zelda game, although her role has greatly differed. She has been portrayed as a protector or even a bodyguard for Princess Zelda. A much younger version of Impa is featured in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.This leaked footage has led some fans to speculate that the film will adapt The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It's also possible that the movie will draw from several different eras of Zelda for a streamlined adaptation. But for now, we can only speculate.Benjamin Evan Ainsworth will portray Link in the movie, and his role was revealed in July of this year alongside Bragason's casting as Zelda. For now, they are the only two cast members officially confirmed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures, which is producing the film, alongside Nintendo and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes helmer Wes Ball is directing the film from a script by Pokemon: Detective Pikachu writer Derek Connolly. In June, Nintendo pushed back the release of the Legend of Zelda movie. The current release date is May 7, 2027.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Most Arc Raiders maps have some type of way you can engage with items or areas to unlock specific doors or loot rooms, but Blue Gate takes the cake when it comes to actual puzzles to solve. If you've already figured out the Ancient Fort puzzle in the southern portion of Blue Gate, you may now be wondering how to deal with the Raider's Refuge cellar door puzzle on the western side of this lush green map. That's where we come in. Here's how to open the cellar door at Raider's Refuge.How to open the cellar door at Raider's RefugeIf you've visited Raider's Refuge, you've probably seen the cellar located against the outer wall of the structure there. Notice it has four lights above it, which should give you a pretty good clue about what you need to do to get it open. But let's dive in.When all four buttons have been pressed, the cellar will open.To open the cellar door at Raider's Refuge, you'll first need to press four buttons that are all located in or around the POI. Check the photo below for what to look for.Look for four of these buttons around Raider's Refuge.The four buttons have a set number of possible spawn areas, though the exact location or placement of some buttons can be slightly different. For instance, you can often find a button near the cellar door itself, but sometimes it may have fallen over and be a little less noticeable from a distance. But if you've found a button somewhere before, there's a reasonable chance of finding it there again. Some common spawn areas are listed below:Directly in front of the cellar door.Inside the main structure, often next to or behind furniture.On the roof near the bell tower or on the various ledges up there.In the attic, accessed by dropping off the roof.Along the outer walls of the main structure, such as against a generator or behind panels.Within the smaller ruins in the area surrounding the main structure of Raider's Refuge, including their basements.When you've found all four buttons, the cellar door will open to reveal a ladder you can go down. In the room below is plenty of loot to look through.You'll probably find some decent loot in the cellar.As with any spot on any map, the actual loot you'll encounter in the cellar varies, but you're likely to find some cabinets, drawers, and a Security Breach locker with above average offerings. While it's not the best spot on Blue Gate for loot, it's still worth checking out if you find yourself in the area alone with some time to kill. When you're done with the puzzle, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list, or take a look over the comprehensive Arc Raiders guides hub.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                This year marks the 30th anniversary of Super Mario 64, a game that was designed to be a single-player showcase for the Nintendo 64. This title may not have been built with multiplayer in mind, but at this year's Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) charity livestream, players turned Super Mario 64 into a team sport as 70 different speedrunners joined forces for a single 70-star run through the game.          It was clear pretty early on that all of the speedrunners knew the tricks to getting Super Mario 64's stars in as little time as possible. Under their collective control, Mario pulled off some of the most athletic moves we've seen from Nintendo's iconic plumber. They even made some of the game's trickiest platforming moments seem easy.In total, this speed run lasted just under two hours. There are 120 stars in the game, so it's possible to pull off an even larger Super Mario 64 relay at future AGDQ events. The current AGDQ event also had a Mario Kart World speedrunner complete the All ? Panels category in under 30 minutes.During the last few years, Super Mario 64 players have pulled off an \"impossible\" 1-Up trick and opened an in-game door that was sealed for decades. An adventurous modder even brought Minecraft into Super Mario 64 with a hack that works on the physical N64 game as well.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The Create-A-Sim items coming include the company's Soho sneakers, a varsity jacket, and sleek skirt sets, while Build Mode will receive the heritage trunk and both Tabby and Brooklyn purses.A look at the upcoming Coach collaboration.In addition to these items, The Coach Collection comes with a new family available to move in via The Sims Gallery: The Carriage House. The press release described the family as \"three friends chasing big dreams, big style, and a little bit of drama.\" The gallery will also feature a new room to place named the \"In The Bag room,\" which appears to be a large walk-in closet that will allow Sims to show off their luxury handbags in style.In other The Sims news, developer Maxis recently released a statement assuring players that its \"values are unchanged\" following news that parent company EA is looking to sell itself to the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The team also reiterated that it is committed to creating \"single-player life simulation experiences\" while also teasing upcoming The Sims experiences for PC, consoles, and mobile.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

In Chapter 7, we've moved on to North America, and specifically the southwestern USA. The Chapter 7 map includes major locations based on Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Area 51--in other words, it's Fortnite's San Andreas map.It all starts in Battlewood in the southwest portion of the new island, which has its own version of the iconic Hollywood sign and streets lined with palm trees. Nearby, you'll find the sound stages of Sus Studios, and you can take a ride up the freeway--yes, this map has Fortnite's first four-lane highway--to visit the casinos of the Sandy Strip. And smack in the middle of the map you won't find Tilted Towers or any other city. Instead, the heart of the island holds Innoloop Labs, an Area 51-esque spot where somebody is doing experiments on the Zero Point.But the highlight of the map is in the northeast, where you'll find a theme park called Wonkeeland, where you can ride a roller coaster--the first time Fortnite has had one of those since Chapter 3.There's no train on the Chapter 7 island, unfortunately, but there's something that might actually be better: hot air balloons. You can find several of these balloons floating around the island, and you can ride them to new places or use them as a sniper's nest.Fortnite's Chapter 7 map sure looks like a wild one. Scroll on for a better look at some of the key spots around the island.    \n  \n                      "

The Fortnite-original Melodie Mars skin is unlocked instantly when you purchase the pass, and the Rockstar Lisa skin is the final reward in the pass, she's got a reactive back bling on the pass as well.Those Icon emotes--which feature music from Can't Get Enough by Krystal Youngs and NiihWA, and Latata by I-dle--are a pretty surprising inclusion, as there have only been three total Icon emotes included in the previous 11`music passes. To have two of them on one music pass is very unusual.Of the eight jam tracks included in the Starlux pass, four are licensed and four are Epic-produced tracks. These are the licensed tracks.Get Jiggy by B Jack$, Zeddy WillDashstar* VIP by Knock2Sorry by Justin BieberF*** Up the World (Vixi Solo Version) by LisaIn all, the Starlux music pass includes 30 items, with one reward unlocking each two account levels you earn in any Fortnite experience. The pass costs 1,400 V-Bucks, and is included with a Fortnite Crew subscription. Scroll on to see everything you can collect from this one.    \n  \n                      "

Best Buy has dropped the price of handheld gaming PC to $500 (was $600) as part of its Black Friday 9-Hour Flash Sale. Amazon is matching the $100 discount, so you can secure this deal at either retailer. You will need to be fast, though: This Black Friday deal ends tonight, November 29, at 10 PM PT (1 AM ET on November 30).

A new post from Activision cites Black Ops 7 Season 1 as being the \"cleanest\" Warzone launch in history.The publisher says Call of Duty Season 1 launched with the strongest anti-cheat performance Warzone has ever had, and the majority of players are completing their matches without encountering any cheaters.🛡️ Call of Duty: #BlackOps7 | Call of Duty: #Warzone A message from #TeamRICOCHET:Season 01 launched with the strongest anti-cheat performance Warzone has ever had. The vast majority of players are completing their matches without encountering a single cheater. This our…  — Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) December 12, 2025              \"This our cleanest Warzone launch in Call of Duty history,\" Activision says.In past years, Call of Duty's Ricochet anti-cheat has struggled to keep hackers out of the game, but the team made a few upgrades for the launch of Season 1. The publisher recently outlined Ricochet's major changes, including improved aimbot-detection models and more advanced behavioral detection to stop cheaters early.Activision says this success is also aided by Call of Duty's new TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirement on PC, which is implemented for both Black Ops 7 and Warzone.Of course, the battle against cheaters seems never-ending, but the publisher says it remains committed to keeping the bad apples out of the game.\"We'll keep evolving our defenses, disrupting cheat providers, and protecting fair play so you can stay focused on your matches,\" Activision says.Sales for Black Ops 7 have faltered compared to previous years, and the publisher has announced a major strategic shift for the Call of Duty series. Despite the changes to come, a Call of Duty movie series is still in the works at Paramount.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Heroes and villains swap allegiances, leading to characters such as Darth Jar Jar and Bounty Hunter C-3PO and reskinned starships like the Dark Falcon.The 1,579-piece Dark Falcon playset has a number of interactive features, including spring-loaded shooters, rotating cannons, a removable cockpit, gunner post, and more.The set includes six minifigures:Darth Jar JarBounty Hunter C-3PODarth DevDarth ReyBeach LukeJedi VaderAll six minifigures have their own accessories, four of which are lightsabers. Notably, Darth Jar Jar, the galaxy's new Sith Lord, wields the double-sided red lightsaber that Darth Maul has in The Phantom Menace. There's even a removable throne for Darth Jar Jar. The gunner post and cockpit can fit two minifigures each.The Dark Falcon building set is 17 x 12.5 x 5 inches. It's classified as a playset and is suitable for builders ages 10 and up, but it makes for a nice display piece. Plus, every Lego Star Wars minifigure collection is improved by Darth Jar Jar and Bounty Hunter C-3PO.

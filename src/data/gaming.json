    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nSkate's huge launch paints a hopeful picture, but the once dominating genre still has a ways to goBy \n    Moises Taveras\n   on October 14, 2025 at 3:24PM PDT\n              \n                Maybe you've noticed, but everywhere you look now, skating is back.Though skateboarding games once dominated the gaming scene in the 2000s, the well appeared to all but dry up as the ambitions of the games industry evolved through the decades. Recently, however, there's been a resurgence of skating games, and an audience made up of both oldheads and fresh-faced players alike has been showing up for them. It feels safe to say there's still an appetite for these kinds of titles. With the early-access release of EA's Skate--a revival of a series that once took up a lot of space in this industry--as well as the acclaimed releases of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater remakes, the once-dying genre seems primed for a comeback.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer\n      \nI first clocked this resurgence a while ago while playing an entirely different kind of skate game: a remarkably chill longboarding game called Driftwood. In Driftwood, you take on the role of a pretty cool sloth who carves and bombs--in skating parlance, to \"bomb\" means to ride down a huge hill--picturesque mountainsides. As a guy who longboarded back in high school and primarily cruised through the city, Driftwood brought me back to what first turned me onto skating--the rush of wind in my admittedly unprotected hair as I barreled down derelict roads and hills, and the satisfying (not to mention casual) coolness I'd feel swerving through throngs of walkers and traffic. It feels suiting, then, that the game that reminded me why I loved skating also opened my eyes to just how many skating games had emerged in the past few years.For years now, developers have been producing a remarkable spectrum of titles, from the outlandish SkateBird to simulators like the aptly named Session: Skating Sim. SkaterXL came around a number of years ago, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk landed with all the noise and aplomb of Hawk's first successful 900--and has a sequel on the way--and all the while, the OlliOlli games grew in size, substance, and style with every new release right up until Roll7's unfortunate closure.There's been no shortage of skating games keeping the dream to shred alive, but with Skate's return, it feels like all the sectors of games development--the indie, AA, and AAA space, to be clear--are fully in the throes of a skating game renaissance.So why exactly is this the moment for these kinds of games to re-emerge? What about the gaming landscape of 2025, and the last few years preceding it, has made developers choose to revisit this part of gaming's past?A sloth skates downhill in DriftwoodAccording to Jason Mann, one of the developers who worked on Driftwood, the answer's pretty simple. \"If I had to guess, it's probably that the people who grew up with the Skate and Tony Hawk series are getting old enough to make their own games, or at least have a bigger sway on consumer spending.\" Considering the timing, he's not exactly wrong. The Tony Hawk games first began appearing on the market back in the late '90s and the Skate series began about a decade after them. The average kid who played either is likely in a position to work in the industry and do something about their conspicuous hiatuses, the result of which we're seeing now. Given the industry's penchant for nostalgia and revisiting the touchstones of its past, this seems like the safest bet.By and large, I agree with this opinion. But while I find the resurgence of skating games a welcome one, it also feels a bit like a tactical retreat at times. Maybe it's just the cynic in me, but when surveying the state of the games industry, one has to wonder: What works anymore? At a time when the field is fraught with layoffs and cancellations, it feels natural to see a reflexive nostalgia for the games that developers grew up with--games with legacies defined by their massive success and staying power. It makes ample sense then for something like Skate, which reshapes a beloved property into a new live-service model, to exist--even if it leaves audiences trepidatious.For Jeffrey Spicer, a producer at crea-ture Studios who works on Session, the resurgence is reflective of skating culture's own highs and lows in popularity. Spicer added, however, that regardless of mainstream appeal, \"there is always a core group of individuals that want a game that allows them the freedom and expression presented in real-life skating.\" It's a tough sentiment to deny when so many different skating games have cropped up over the years--a diversity that both he and Mann happily championed. It's especially fun seeing skate mechanics crop up in less-likely places too, like Thirsty Suitors from Outerloop Games back in 2023, the recently released Sword of the Sea (which seems more equivalent to surfing but we'll still take it!), and even last year's GameSpot GOTY, Metaphor: ReFantazio.Amusingly, the latter two of these titles allow players to ride on a sword. If I had a nickel for every time that happened, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.Metaphor: ReFantazio's protagonist skates through Grandtrad on his sword.For Spicer, this sort of looming spectre of skating is likely because \"the desire for skating games [has] never truly dwindled.\" Mann echoed this thought, pointing to how previous Tony Hawk and Skate games have enjoyed \"cult followings that appear to get quite some social media engagement.\" And how many of us haven't seen some wildly popular shortform video of a player hitting an unbelievable Christ Air in Skate 3 set to Pearl Jam's \"Even Flow.\"Still, the uptick in skating games and their popularity is becoming palpable, which Spicer attributes to \"the growing playerbase\" and their demand for more. Fortunately, this moment feels ripe for someone who might want to get into them and clearly there is a desire. Mat Piscatella, a senior director and analyst at the market research company Circana, confirmed that Skate's release for EA seemed to be off to a \"phenomenal start.\" Evidently, the free-to-play revival of the series \"ranked among the top 5 titles in weekly total actives\" over the majority of the platforms for which numbers are reported, putting its starting audience on par with the likes of giants like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto. While it is typical of tentpole releases to see huge numbers out the door, it's a little rarer to see the feat accomplished by a title belonging to a once popular niche in a series that hasn't released a game in 15 years, making Skate's debut a refreshing shock to the system.Speaking of their once dominating presence, Piscatella also shared that when he worked at Activision, \"Tony Hawk games were what games like Call of Duty and Madden are today: annualized releases with a loyal audience that would buy the new version every year.\" The challenge now, as Piscatella puts it, is to turn these \"pulses,\" instances where a sporadic major release spiked interest and sales in skating games, into a flashpoint that translates to more staying power. Maybe Skate can manage that feat, but folks like Mann would also welcome more original games from the genre's other big series, as well as skating games with \"full-fledged story modes\" and a bit more grit.No matter what form or shape it takes, the devs I spoke to seemed enthusiastic. Not just about the mainstream moment skating games are once again having, but at the prospect of their own work keeping a \"torch lit for future generations to find skating,\" per Spicer.\"Be it getting new kids on their first board or getting old skaters to dust off their set ups, skating is for everyone.\"\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    \nTime Stranger propels Digimon forward as a serious contender in the critter-catching genre.By \n    Jordan Ramée\n   on October 14, 2025 at 12:15PM PDT\n              \n                                  When it comes to games about human kids partnering with cute critters that can evolve into powerful monsters, I've always been a bigger fan of Digimon than Pokemon. But most of that preference comes down to what's outside the video games: Digimon has more interesting monster designs, for example, and a far superior anime. Pokemon has always had the video games I prefer to play, usually having more engaging gameplay loops and satisfying battles.Digimon's latest foray, however, Digimon Story: Time Stranger, has finally shifted the needle for me. While its story and characters don't rise to the heights achieved in the best moments of the Digimon anime, Time Stranger is a consistently fun turn-based RPG with great voice acting and rewarding, strategic team-building.Time Stranger has a lot of callbacks to both seasons of Digimon Adventure.In Time Stranger, you play as an agent of a secret organization that works in the shadows of Tokyo to find, study, and confront urban legends, many of which turn out to be a strange lifeform the higher-ups have nicknamed Digimon. During your latest mission, you witness the emergence of a terrifying behemoth that destroys the city and begins spreading devastation across Japan.Somehow, this event mysteriously sends you back in time eight years, where you get tangled up in the lives of a handful of humans and Digimon that seem to have a hand in the catastrophe to come. With no immediate means of traveling back to your own time, you immerse yourself in the lives of these people and digital monsters, hoping to find what or who ultimately dooms the future so that you can change the timeline, all while doing your best to keep your identity as a person from the future a secret.While the start of the game irritatingly focuses on a lot of narrative setup (almost two hours is way too long to get the main plot moving), Time Stranger's story is fairly gripping after that initial hump. There are no immediate emotional stakes in preventing this world-ending plot or continuing the success of the agency your character works for, but getting to know the people and Digimon in the past makes up for that--saving the future becomes less about doing a job, and more about ensuring these new friends of yours make it through an apocalypse they don't know is coming. Time Stranger's personable cast worms its way into your heart, from the aspiring internet streamer Hiroko Sagisaka and somewhat somber Inori Misono, to the sarcastic and surprisingly insightful Kosuke Misono and charmingly naive Aegiomon.Inori is one of my new favorite Digimon characters.My one big gripe with the story is how hand-holdy it is at times. At the start of Time Stranger, you choose whether you're playing as a female or male agent and the other avatar becomes your handler who keeps you on track through your high-tech cellphone, which even allows the two of you to remain in contact across the eight-year difference. The handler's role in the story seems to be to remind you of emotional beats--like the mystery behind the protagonist's father--every two hours or so, just in case you forgot about the main character's backstory that's supposed to be driving them but you, the player, have no ties to because we're being told to care, not shown why we should. Your handler will also often chime in with quick text messages reminding you of information you already know to keep you on track with main objectives. I could see how this repetition of key information might be a helpful reminder in a playthrough spread out over months, but the texts come so close together that unless you're spending weeks between each play session of Time Stranger, it's going to get annoying.Thankfully, Time Stranger does practice restraint when it comes to its more mature material, allowing it to speak for itself without hitting the player over the head with its messaging. Time Stranger doesn't go quite as dark as past stories in the franchise, which have delved into young children and teenagers grappling with suicidal thoughts, mental disorders, traumatic natural disasters, the death of a parent or best friend, messy divorces, slavery, or human trafficking, and then packaging these stories in a manner that the largely kid-aged audience can comprehend. But even if it doesn't go into subject matter as heavy as what's been done in Digimon before, Time Stranger's story doesn't fully skirt away from it, either, respecting its audience with a mature story that touches on the lingering grief from the death of a family member.All Digimon are equally weak to gun.Early into Time Stranger, your character meets a family in which father Kosuke and daughter Inori have largely come to terms with the death of the former's son and the latter's little brother. The introduction of Aegiomon, a satyr-looking Digimon that Inori runs into and bonds with after protecting him, clearly brings some of that pain back to the surface though, as Aegiomon acts toward Inori like her brother Yuu used to, and Aegiomon also fits into Yuu's clothes that Kosuke can't bear to let go. Aegiomon is a reminder for both characters of the lingering hole in their lives, and while you can feel a tinge of sadness emanating from both of them when they speak to Aegiomon, neither shuns the Digimon on account of that reminder. It's a wonderful portrayal of how grief can linger and still affect you years later, but that it's not always completely paralyzing or necessarily negative. Sometimes, grief is just a sad reminder.Time Stranger's voice acting shoulders a lot of this emotional weight. Each character cycles through the same collection of poses, which are admittedly expressive, but the characterization is largely set through the voice acting. Time Stranger doesn't utilize voice acting in every scene, primarily using text boxes, but leans on voice acting in every major emotional beat, all of which are also visualized with beautiful cutscenes. This makes the most joyous, humorous, tragic, and tense moments really pop, bettering the story overall.As you complete side quests, you'll earn points to invest in passive skills or weapons for the main character to use in battle to aid their Digimon partners.The main character is the only voiceless character in the story, but choice-driven dialogue allows you to imbue some semblance of a personality into them. I opted to avoid the overly serious and ditzy answers, for instance, making my agent playful and a little sassy. These choices don't seem to have ramifications on the overall direction of the story, and instead direct the flow and overall tone of individual conversations. Conversing with your character's Digimon partners can influence how their personality develops though, and that in turn can impact how their stats and passive abilities change, as well as what they can digivolve into.Your agent starts with one Digimon partner, choosing between the Vaccine type Gomamon, Virus type DemiDevimon, or Data type Patamon. This choice introduces you to Digimon's type triangle: Vaccine has a type advantage against Virus, Virus against Data, and Data against Vaccine. This type triangle is at the center of Time Stranger's combat and its simplicity makes it very easy to grasp whether you have an advantage in every fight.This simplicity grows more complex as the game goes on, though--you can have up to three Digimon in a battle at a time and keep another three in reserve, and you'll usually face off against two to four enemy Digimon at a time. Each attack tends to have an elemental typing as well, like fire, water, or air, and each Digimon is strong or weak to a handful of elemental types. Then there are moves that don't deal damage but inflict a status effect, like damaging poison or turn-deleting sleep.Digimon can be taught a variety of attacks to help account for their type weaknesses.It's a familiar system for a turn-based RPG, and even Digimon newbies should grasp it fairly quickly. Is that Digimon plant-shaped? Probably weak to fire. Does that Digimon give off major villain vibes? Nine times out of 10, it's a Virus type. If you're still having issues, though, Time Stranger has a scanner that lets you get basic details on unfamiliar Digimon, giving you a good starting point for what moves you should be using. As you use more types of moves, more information about the foreign Digimon will be unlocked until you know everything.You're naturally incentivized to battle Digimon and collect this information anyway. As you defeat enemy Digimon, the percentage of their known data increases in your phone. When it hits 100%, you can convert this data into a Digimon of your own, adding it to your storage (from which you can move it into your roster if you're interested in fighting with it). This is the only way you can add a new Digimon to your party--no ball-catching mechanic here! Unless you just want to avoid fights and get on with the story, it's always worth jumping into a quick battle to either learn more information about a Digimon's weaknesses or gather more data on a Digimon to eventually add it to your roster (or both!).You can wait to convert a Digimon until its data percentage goes even higher, but the benefits are negligible. For every percentage you push a Digimon's data above 100% (up to 200%) before you convert it, the Digimon partner you create will accrue experience points faster in battle. The difference is so small though--especially in the latter half of the game when you'll be getting tons of experience from every battle--that the wait isn't worth it.Each Digimon can digivolve or de-digivolve into a variety of forms.As your Digimon battle, they accrue experience to level up and improve their stats. If their stats fulfill specific requirements, they digivolve into a new form. And this is where Digimon can get a little bit complicated. While each In-Training-level Digimon can usually digivolve into only one to three different Rookie-level Digimon, each Rookie can typically digivolve into four to five Champion-level Digimon, and that Champion usually has four to five Ultimate-level options. Some Digimon can switch between different forms, certain Digimon can DNA-digivolve and combine into one more powerful Digimon, and most Digimon change types and learn entirely different attacks when they digivolve; and then there are Mega-level Digimon. Each new partner is a vast branching tree of possibilities, and each digivolution carries with it its own requirements, most of which require you to carefully train and speak to your Digimon in a specific way to grow certain stats.This system is vast and would be entirely unapproachable to newcomers if Time Stranger introduced it all at once. But Time Stranger restricts your options early on, funneling the plethora of team-building options the game has into only a few dozen. I understand why this is done--it makes Time Stranger a strong on-ramp for folks who might be intimidated at trying a Digimon game for the first time--but it unfortunately restricts the best part about these games. Finding and converting new Digimon, digivolving them, and building your ideal line-up is cool! More options means there are more variables for you to consider and play with, and limiting that scope for the first five or so hours means Time Stranger takes a bit to go from good to great.If you're ever unsatisfied with your team (or mess up and max a Digimon's level before you grow their stats in the way you should for the digivolution you're aiming for), you can de-digivolve a Digimon into its previous form, reverting it to level 1, and then take a different branch. This covers digivolution's greatest weakness: It's largely a guessing game. If you haven't seen a Digimon and that Digimon is one of the options that your Digimon can digivolve into, it's displayed as an extremely zoomed-in black outline on the digivolution screen. Some of these blacked-out images are easy to identify, but only if you have a history with Digimon. Otherwise, you don't really know what you're getting unless you turn to a guide (which I highly recommend).You can have your Digimon passively train, boosting their skills while you focus on your current team.I know the dog-like Salamon can transform into the cat-like Gatomon, and then digivolve into the powerful bow-wielding archangel Angewoman, to one day become the dragon Magnadramon. I also know all four of those are Vaccine types, and that at any time, I could de-digivolve them all the way back to Salamon and then divivolve the digital dog into BlackGatomon, which transforms them into a Virus type and opens up a whole new line of darker forms and abilities. But there's no rhyme or reason to the evolutionary path of a dog becoming a cat (and certainly not an angel or dragon), and Gatomon and BlackGatomon's outlines look virtually the same when they're completely blacked out--a newcomer isn't going to know that Gatomon has a ring on her tail and BlackGatomon doesn't, a small detail that's hard to notice.Without prior knowledge, a lot of digivolution is experimentation (or just luck). De-digivolution eases the frustration of that, allowing you to revert to previous forms if you don't like the direction you're going. It's not perfect, and it's still irritating to digivolve one of your favorite Digimon partners into a new form that has a typing or aesthetic you don't like, de-digivolve them, and then have to grind back up to digivolve them into something else. But at least the option is there, meaning no choice is ever fully locked in.While you can brute-force your way through Time Stranger on its easiest difficulty, you'll need to involve yourself in the vast intricacies of each Digimon to have any sort of chance on the harder modes. I love the level of complexity, especially in how it encourages you to experiment with new Digimon. More than once, I decided to try playing with a recently converted or digivolved Digimon on a whim, only to quickly fall in love with and become dependent on the brand-new strategy it offered.This is the most lively the Digital World has ever looked outside of the anime.So far, my favorite was adding BlackGatomon to my team right before the boss fight with Parrotmon, an Ultimate-level, lightning-wielding, Vaccine-type Digimon. Going into that fight, most of my roster were the weaker Champion level, and my strongest attackers were Virus-type or lightning-wielding Vaccine types. I figured it would be a loss and I'd just have to try again with a different team, but then I remembered: BlackGatomon knew a status move that could reverse every aspect of a Digimon. I used it, and suddenly Parrotmon was weak to lightning damage and Virus types, not resistant. I mopped the floor with the giant bird, and BlackGatomon became a mainstay on the team (eventually digivolving into LadyDevimon and then DNA-digivolving with Angewoman to become the delightfully broken Mastemon, an angel who laughs maliciously as she rips the heart/soul out of enemy Digimon). 10/10 team member. I'd highly recommend them.Digimon Story: Time Stranger is a strong argument that it's high time to give the digital monsters their own space in the critter-catching genre. Strong voice acting and mature themes digivolve this time-traveling tale into an emotionally-rewarding journey of grief and self-acceptance, and a vast array of branching options keeps team-building and the turn-based combat exciting. If you're still ignoring Digimon for its more mainstream pocket monster cousin, you owe it to yourself to at least try Time Stranger. You won't regret it.\n                                \n\n    Back To Top\n      \n\n    \n                                                    "

Lego Fortnite Supply Llama (691 Pieces)                                                                $26 (was $40)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Supply Llama has been Fortnite's main mascot since launch, and this set lets you piece together your own Llama Piñata out of Lego bricks. You probably don't want to smack it with a baseball bat or stick, though.The 691-piece Supply Llama Lego set is 9.5 x 3 x 6 inches and has a saddle compartment to store seven accessories: Grappler, Slurp Juice, Rough Ruby, Good Luck Charm, Slap Juice (two bottles), Dynamite, and Back Pack. The Supply Llama's mouth can move, too.The Supply Llama was a launch set, so you'll get the Operation Brite Starter Pack bonus.Even at its full $40 price, the Supply Llama is cheaper than many licensed sets with around 700 pieces. The current $26 deal price makes it an absolute bargain.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite: Durrr Burger Restaurant (546 pieces)                                                                $52 (was $65)                                                                                                                                                                                    The 546-piece Durrr Burger Restaurant launched in June as the first building from the world of Fortnite to be turned into a Lego set. The completed restaurant--well, it's more like a half-restaurant--measures 10.5 inches tall thanks to the buildable Durrr Burger attached to the restaurant's sign. It's 7 inches wide and 3.5 inches deep.Inside the restaurant, you'll build a cash register, soda machine, and condiment station for your minifigures. The two-story build has an attic with a storage container for accessories like a shovel and dynamite. The build is modular, so you can remove the attic and rearrange/combine with other Fortnite Lego sets. On the outside, there's a drive-thru menu and a decorative spicy pepper plant.Durrr Burger Restaurant includes four minifigures:Beach BomberBeef BossGrimeySkeletonThe bonus in-game item for this set is a Beef Boss Outfit.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite Durrr Burger (193 Pieces)                                                                $8.79 (was $15) | Retiring Soon                                                                                                                                                                                    This 193-piece build recreates the mascot from the in-game fast food restaurant. The Durrr Burger Lego set is 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 inches, so it's substantially smaller than most of the building sets in the Lego Fortnite lineup. That said, it's on sale for only $8.79 and includes Operation Brite Starter Pack. The Durrr Burger is one of two Fortnite Lego sets scheduled to retire soon.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite: Peely & Sparkplug’s Camp (250 pieces)                                                                $18.39 (was $23)                                                                                                                                                                                    Peely & Sparkplug's Camp is a 250-piece set with a buildable workbench and campfire in the remnants of a destroyed structure. The main draw of this budget-friendly playset are the characters. It has a buildable wolf with posable legs, a small Supply Llama, and three minifigures with accessories: Peely with a sword, Skeleton with a pickaxe, and Sparkplug with a torch.The budget-friendly playset includes the Sparkplug rare outfit as a bonus in-game item.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite: Mecha Team Leader (2,503 pieces)                                                                $250                                                                                                                                                                                    Mecha Team Leader is the most complex and detailed build in the Lego Fortnite lineup. The completed 2,503-piece figure is 17.5 inches tall and is chock-full of references to other characters and places in Fortnite. Just like in the game, the formidable robot is an amalgamation of five different styles. The robot's blue left leg features a Durrr Burger foot, while the right leg is inspired by Uncle Pete's Pizza Pit and ends with a Tomatohead foot.Mecha Team Leader's right arm is even more chaotic, as the Rex inspiration makes it look like a dinosaur is wielding the Sword of Singularity with its teeth. The left arm is modeled after the legendary fox Drift. The beautiful absurdity of the design is rounded out by the Cuddle Team Leader-inspired head and chest armor. Mecha Team Leader is basically a killer robot teddy bear. Sid from Toy Story would be impressed.The Lego version of Mecha Team Leader has articulated hips, arms, feet, and a rotating head. A hatch on the robot's chest opens to reveal a cockpit for the included Cuddle Team Leader minifigure. The figure can also be displayed next to the buildable name placard.The set includes two bonus outfits for Lego Fortnite the video game: Mecha Team Leader and Mecha Team Shadow.Despite Mecha Team Leader's many callbacks to Fortnite lore, this set probably has the broadest appeal of any in the lineup. It would probably look cool on a display shelf next to Lego's Optimus Prime Transformers build. Ironically, Mecha Team Leader launched the same day as Soundwave, the latest addition to the Lego Icons: Transformers lineup.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite Peely Bone (1,414 Pieces)                                                                $100 | Retiring Soon                                                                                                                                                                                    Prior to Mecha Team Leader, the Peely Bone buildable statue was the elaborate build in the series. The 1,414-piece display model was one of the four building sets that launched the Lego Fortnite series last fall. Like Mecha Team Leader, Peely Bone is packaged in a black box, which means it's geared toward adult collectors and experienced builders.When fully pieced together and connected to the buildable stand, Peely Bone is over 14 inches tall and wields the Peely Pick Pickaxe and Paint Launcher. A Banana Bag Back Bling attaches to his back.The included stand with a placard on the front may make Peely seem statuesque, but you can move the figures arms and bend the wrists to create different poses.Peely Bone's half-skeleton, half-banana has a practical benefit here for those who enjoy dynamic builds, as you're working with entirely different pieces on each side. Plus, Peely Bone simply looks awesome, and the Lego replica is quite clever from a design perspective.Peely Bone, like all of the Lego Fortnite launch sets, includes the in-game Operation Brite Starter Pack bonus.At 1,414 pieces, the $100 build offers pretty great value, but as mentioned, Peely Bone is retiring soon.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite Battle Bus (954 Pieces)                                                                $100                                                                                                                                                                                    The Battle Bus is a 954-piece set that recreates the game's signature balloon-propelled flying bus. The detailed model of the Battle Bus is 11 x 11 x 5 inches. It wouldn't be the Battle Bus without players to drop on the battlefield, so the playset comes with nine Fortnite minifigures, each of which is armed with a weapon and can be seated in the bus:Adventure PeelyBattalion BrawlerBrite BomberCuddle Team LeaderCube AssassinMeowsclesRavenTrespasser EliteDriftThe cleverly designed balloon is actually an attachment that, along with the roof, can be removed from the bus when you want to access the interior seating. Accessories include Slap Juice, the Grappler, Slurp Juice, and several Pickaxes. The wheels turn, so the Battle Bus  could join your next Lego Mario Kart or F1 race.The Battle Bus comes with the Lego Fortnite Operation Brite Starter Pack to redeem in the video game.                                                                                                                            Lego Fortnite: Klombo (1,084 pieces)                                                                $110                                                                                                                                                                                    Klombo is the largest Lego Fortnite playset so far at 1,084 pieces. Nearly all of the pieces in the box are used to build the six-legged creature that is essentially a dinosaur. It has an impressive number of interactive components. He's essentially an action figure, as he has the following posable features:Mouth opens/closesTurnable headArticulated legs (all six)Adjustable spikes/hairRotating tailKlombo is accompanied by two minifigures, Adventure Peely and Oro. You can connect the figures to Klombo's back, or they can feed the dino with the included Klomberry bush accessory with removable berries.The set includes the Island Adventure Peely in-game outfit as a bonus.

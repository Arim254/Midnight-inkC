    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Treyarch has released its first post-launch Dev Talk video to reveal some major changes the studio is preparing for the launch of Season 1 next month. This discusses the community feedback regarding Black Ops 7's aim-assist, weapon balancing, and more.Black Ops 7's assault rifles feel really powerful in multiplayer, while most of the guns in the submachine class have struggled to feel viable. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce confirms that a buff is coming across the entire submachine gun class. Scronce says no plans are made for adjustments to the marksman rifles or snipers, but the team is monitoring the data.\"The overall goal with those weapons in Black Ops 7 is that they are a bit more present without being too dominant,\" Scronce says.          The developer is also aware of the community debate around Black Ops 7's aim assist, which features reduced rotational aim-assist compared to recent Call of Duty games. \"We have been closely monitoring that conversation and looking at our internal data,\" Scronce says. The developer also reveals the studio is \"fairly happy\" with where the game's aim-assist is at, but there will be a slight increase to aim-assist strength at range. This change will arrive sometime ahead of the Season 1 update.Additionally, Treyarch's planned update includes spawn adjustments for Hardpoint, Free-For-All, and Team Deathmatch modes. A nerf is also coming for the game's overpowered Drone Pod field upgrade.The developer announced that Endgame mode, which players can unlock after completing the campaign, will be available to everyone starting on November 21. Players who unlocked Endgame naturally by beating the campaign will receive a variety of rewards, including XP tokens, GobbleGums, and more.For Zombies changes, Treyarch design director Kevin Drew discusses the difficulty level of the boss fight for Ashes of the Damned. The developer says it was designed to be challenging, but it is more difficult than intended. Adjustments will be made to the barnacle spawns needed to help Ol' Tessie, so players can spend less time repairing the Wonder Vehicle and more time driving. The developer says it's slowing down the speed boss's missile barrage attack.Nuketown arrived to Black Ops 7 today, and this is a new 2025 variant of Treyarch's classic map. Season 1 of Black Ops 7 begins in December, which will add the game's first battle pass, Warzone integration, additional maps, and more.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The United States government has announced that Amazon must pay $2.5 billion to settle claims that the company duped people into signing up for Prime and \"knowingly made it difficult\" for people to cancel--and now, payments for affected users are going out.The Federal Trade Commission said Amazon must pay $1 billion in a civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds to consumers. Also as part of the settlement, Amazon must agree to \"cease unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices for Prime.\"It takes Amazon about 13 hours to make $1 billion, so the penalty isn't likely to hurt the company financially, but the FTC touted the precedent that's being set here.How to get free moneyThe FTC said around 35 million Prime members will be eligible to receive money from the $1.5 billion fund. If you signed up for Prime between June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025 through select offers and used no more than three Prime benefits in a 12-month period, you will get up to $51 as part of the settlement, per court documents.There is no further action required by affected claimants, as refunds will be automatically issued. The refunds started going out on November 12 and will continue to be issued through December 24.If you are eligible, you'll receive an email, and can then accept your refund by PayPal or Venmo. The FTC is asking people to accept the refund within 15 days of it being issued.Alternatively, people can ignore the Amazon email and, after the system shows they did not claim the refund by PayPal or Venmo, Amazon will mail you a check to the address listed as your default on your Prime account. People are asked to cash the checks within 60 daysWhat did the FTC say?FTC chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said, \"The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription.\"\"Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans' pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.\"Also as part of the deal, Amazon is required to make changes to its Prime enrollment policies. The FTC is requiring Amazon to remove the \"No, I don't want free shipping\" button and instead offer a \"clear and conspicuous button\" for people to avoid signing up for Prime if they don't want to.Amazon must also offer disclosures about the Prime enrollment process, including the cost, billing frequency, details about auto-renewal, and how to cancel. On that point, the FTC is mandating that Amazon make it just as easy to cancel Prime as it is to sign up for it. \"The process cannot be difficult, costly, or time-consuming and must be available using the same method that consumers used to sign up,\" the FTC said.As part of the settlement, Amazon did not admit any wrongdoing. A spokesperson, however, told Reuters, \"We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                You'll need to take a trip to the Spaceport map to complete the A Lay of the Land quest in Arc Raiders. This quest tasks you with finding multiple items in a single trip to the map, so you'll want to come prepared to make a long trek and survive for quite some time. Let's take a look at everything you'll need to do to get this quest wrapped up.Knowing that you'll have a lot of traveling and surviving to do on Spaceport for the A Lay of the Land quest, we'd recommend you bring guns you're comfortable with, as well as plenty of healing items. Additionally, it's a great idea to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with a specific item to complete the quest back in Speranza.When you're ready to head out and begin A Lay of the Land, follow the guide below.Where to find the shipping notes in the foreman's officeThe first objective requires you to collect some shipping notes in the foreman's office at the Jiangsu Warehouse. This POI is located on the northwestern side of the Spaceport map. It's not usually a very busy spot, but keep your eyes open for nearby raiders nonetheless.Jiangsu Warehouse locationOnce inside, you'll notice there's really not much to this warehouse. Simply head upstairs into the office to locate the shipping notes on a desk in plain sight.Look for the shipping notes on a desk upstairs.With that out of the way, you'll have a slightly more dangerous location to head to next, so get prepared and set off when you're ready.Locate the scanners on the upper floor of Control Tower A6The second objective requires you to seek out a LiDAR Scanner on the upper floor of Control Tower A6, which is located in the middle of the Spaceport map. This area is among the most contested locations on the map, meaning you'll want to approach it with the mindset that a fight could break out at any moment.Control Tower A6 locationThere are a few ways to enter the first room of the Control Tower A6, but for the sake of this guide, we need to enter from the front left side.Enter Control Tower A6 here.Once you enter the Control Tower A6 building, walk to the door straight ahead. Be mindful that there is sometimes a turret in here, so take it out if necessary. Open the door, then take the stairs all the way up to the next floor.Enter this door.When entering the next floor, take an immediate right.Head right when you reach the next floor.Take another right to wrap around to a cubicle.Let's take one more right.Here, you'll find the LiDAR Scanner. Interact with the objective to cause the scanner to fall out, then be sure to pick it up and add it to your inventory.Interact with this box to get the LiDAR Scanner.Lastly, you'll need to extract with the LiDAR Scanner and return it to Shani in Speranza to complete the quest. As such, you'll want to head to whichever extraction point is closest to your location and play things cautiously until you can get out. If you brought an augment with a safe pocket, make sure the LiDAR Scanner is placed in it in case you don't make it out. It's not that we don't believe in you; we're just looking out for you, raider.For more, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

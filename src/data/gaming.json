    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Darryn Bonthuys\n   on October 31, 2025 at 7:27AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Hot Toys is returning to the world of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, as the toymaker has revealed its take on the sequel's main villain, Higgs. The charismatic antagonist made a grand return in Death Stranding 2, and for the replica sixth-scale figure, Hot Toys is recreating the version of Higgs that tormented Sam Porter Bridges throughout his trek across Australia.Like several other Hot Toys figures, Higgs will have a headsculpt that's equipped with the company's rolling eyeball system, while his body is comprised of various materials and screen-accurate details like his orange armor, translucent plating, gold necklace, and exoskeleton. Three editions of the figure will be available--a Standard Edition with a small selection of accessories, a Deluxe Edition that comes with a diorama base and a dog mine mech, and the Artisan Edition with an expanded selection of accessories and wool-implanted hair for an added layer of realism.The aforementioned accessories can be used to recreate several of Higgs' scenes from the game, as they range from alternate sets of hands, his red mask, and a pistol, to his signature battle-axe guitar--connected via a gut tube--and an Odradek that can be attached to his armor. The Artisan Edition also comes with a gold-colored double-neck battle guitar that can be split in two. The Artisan Edition will be limited to 3,000 pieces and will likely be quite expensive.Even by Hot Toys standards, the recently revealed Sam Porter Bridges is very pricey. Pricing ranges from $400 for the standard version to $500 for the Artisan Edition that also has wool-implanted hair and several accessories, so this should give you a good idea of how much the Higgs figure will cost when official pricing is revealed.If that's a little too rich for your blood, there are more affordable Death Stranding merchandise options, like the Death Stranding 2 Backbone One controller for smartphones or the Death Stranding 2 art book, whicht will be available starting November 11. The PlayStation Store also has stock of the Death Stranding 2 Collector's Edition, and that comes with the game, a Magellan Man statue, Dollman figurine, and several other extras.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Before Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake was released last October, there was a report that the game would be a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5 for at least a year. Now, the year is up and an updated listing by the Entertainment Software Rating Board appears to indicate that a leap to Xbox Series X|S is immanent.The ESRB has slightly modified its Silent Hill 2 page (via Insider Gaming) to state that it's certified for the \"Xbox Series\" consoles. The rating itself hasn't changed, and it's still M for Mature. However, Microsoft and Konami have yet to formally announce the port or set a date for it. We can't even say for certain if Silent Hill 2 will get a physical release on Xbox, or if it will be digital only.For now, there are no signs on the ESRB page that Silent Hill 2 will be coming to Switch 2 any time soon. But it's not out of the realm of possibility for the future.Following Bloober Team's success with the Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami announced that the studio is now working on a remake of the original Silent Hill. That project doesn't currently have a release window.The most recent game in the series, Silent Hill f, was released last month to largely positive reviews. Konami announced that title alongside Silent Hill 2's remake, and Silent Hill: Townfall during the same livestream in 2022. Series producer Motoi Okamoto has said that the team revealed all three projects at once because, \"We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series.\"Outside of the games, a new live-action film, Return to Silent Hill, will be released on January 23, 2026. The movie will be an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, and sees the return of the original film's director, Christoph Gans.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                ModRetro has announced two new games for its Chromatic Classics Collection. After releasing a brand-new version of Rayman for Game Boy Color earlier this year, the company is celebrating Croc and GameStop's mascot, Buck the Bunny with new cartridge releases.Croc: 25th Anniversary Edition celebrates the cute little reptile's Game Boy Color adventure from 2000, and preorders will open on October 31--or Croctober 31 if you're a fan of the franchise--with a planned shipping date of December 2025. Priced at $45, the classic side-scrolling platformer features over 30 levels spread across four worlds. The original game revolved around Croc taking on Baron Dante and his minions, and this version features upgraded controls and enhanced save functions.Croc: 25th Anniversary EditionBuck and the Cursed Cartridge is billed as a fast-paced run-and-gun platformer from ModRetro. After the GameStop bunny picks up the titular cursed cartridge, he finds himself pulled into the game world and forced to fight for his life in this digital frontier. The game will feature multi-phase boss fights, upgradeable abilities, and even cheat codes. Priced at $45, it'll be available starting October 31. Both of these games will be available through the ModRetro store and GameStop.Buck and the Cursed CartridgeOne thing to note about these games is that even though they have ModRetro and Chromatic branding on them, they'll still work just fine on the original Nintendo hardware and other FPGA handhelds like the Analogue Pocket. In case you missed it, the ModRetro Chromatic launched not too long ago and we were very impressed with just how faithfully it created and upgraded the Game Boy Color experience. New stock of the modernized Game Boy also arrived earlier this year, and you can choose between two models: a $200 version with scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass or a $300 version that's equipped with Sapphire Glass and extremely durable materials.ModRetro also announced a modern-day tribute to the Nintendo 64 console a few months back. It doesn't have a release date yet, but it does have an early-bird preorder price of $199.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

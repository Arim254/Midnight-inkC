    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Billy Givens\n   on December 26, 2025 at 10:21AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Arc Raiders has already seen quite a few updates since its launch at the end of October, but developer Embark Studios is closing the year out big. The Cold Snap update brings multiple seasonal events, a new Snowfall map condition, and plenty more for fans to sink their teeth into. Among the fresh additions is the Goalie Raider Deck--the game's second battle pass--which contains a smorgasbord of cosmetics, gear, items, and even Raider Tokens that can be used toward premium purchases in the shop.The Goalie Deck is free for all players, so you won't need to purchase access to these rewards with premium currency. Instead, you'll simply need to work toward completing daily Feats that provide you with Creds, then use those to unlock your preferred items from the deck. This should prove fairly easy to do for most players, as you can complete up to three Feats per match, and you'll even get additional bonus Creds for the first five Feats you finish in a day.Perhaps the best news about the Goalie Deck, however, is that it's a permanent reward track. Unlike battle passes in other games, this deck will stick around forever, meaning you can unlock what you want from it whenever you'd like. With this in mind, you can skip any rewards that just don't matter much to you right now--though it's worth pointing out you will still need to purchase a certain number of items from the deck to unlock subsequent pages.If you're excited to dive into the Goalie Deck and start reaping its rewards--including the new hockey-themed outfit, which is pretty rad--we've got you covered ahead of time. Keep scrolling below for every reward from the Goalie Deck in Arc Raiders.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nAs live-service games go on and on into eternity, the episodic game structure is the perfect way to know just when to put down the controller.By \n    Matt Kim\n   on December 27, 2025 at 1:00PM PST\n              \n                Is there a more infamous monkey-paw wish than the collective dream that all our favorite games could last forever? Well, the finger curled, because it seems like all major game publishers in the world only want to make games that go on to infinity.With the rise of live-service games, it's been a struggle to know when to put the controller down, especially when games like Fortnite release seasonal content like The Simpsons season pass that ask you to play long enough to unlock stupid sexy Flanders. Luckily, for us, episodic games, perfectly portioned into bite-sized morsels, have come back to rescue us from the endless grind.In this case, I am talking specifically about Dispatch, the new episodic superhero game from AdHoc Studio. If the name is unfamiliar to you, AdHoc is a new game company founded by former members of Ubisoft, Night School, and perhaps most notably, Telltale Games, who blew up the episodic gaming scene with 2012's The Walking Dead. The studio would later close due to a variety of factors internal and external, some of which I covered previously as a reporter. But by then, the episodic-games formula was starting to feel a bit played out, and the mood appeared to be shifting towards either more complete single-player experiences, or the early live-service games we know today.But nowadays, the people yearn for games that deliver the sense of accomplishment when hitting credits, but also don't require the kind of time investment most games demand. Dispatch perfectly models itself after the cable TV shows of old, with each episode adhering to a winning formula that never overstays its welcome.Set in a modern-day Los Angeles — except in this version of the city, there are actual superheroes working together at a private security firm — Dispatch is best understood as a workplace comedy. Think The Office crossed over with The Boys. Players are asked to make both small and large choices as the hero, Robert Robertson III, which will not only determine his personality, but have big ramifications for how the story plays out. A short intro sets the stage for the episode's plot, while in the middle is an interactive dispatching sim, followed by a big finale, a needle drop, and roll credits. A little formulaic, but so was television during the pre-prestige TV era.Furthering the TV connection, Dispatch's fully voiced storyline has a wonderful cast of TV alumni including Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, and thanks to a partnership with Critical Role, fan-favorite voice actors like Laura Bailey and Matt Mercer.For the past week, playing Dispatch became a nightly ritual where after dinner, I'd retreat into the office for a single episode's worth of Dispatch before returning to the living room to do something else for the evening. Just like a TV season, Dispatch is broken up into eight episodes, each about an hour, not including end credits. While there is always the urge to keep pushing forward and play right into the next episode, each section felt so perfectly calibrated for a single session of gaming that I could leave the next episode for the next night and not feel a pang of anxiety or FOMO. If anything, I could take the time to think over the choices I made in the previous episode, many of which feel weighty and substantial.I don't want to give the wrong impression about Dispatch by constantly comparing it to TV. Dispatch is first and foremost a game, and a damn good one too. The hero-dispatching sim alone is worthy of praise, and, ironically, something I could play endlessly. But there's a confidence in direction that oozes from Dispatch. They know just when to hit you with the credits, knowing full well you will feel satisfied leaving the game until the next week when new episodes are set to drop.The combination of talent, writing, and production in Dispatch all come together into a potent mix--a truly satisfying one too, which is not a description I've used for many games this year. You should read GameSpot's positive review of course, but Dispatch has seemingly hit the perfect chord with players to the tune of 2 million copies sold. A major success for a new IP from a brand-new studio, and while I could go on about all the ways Dispatch has become a surprise hit of the year for me, the best thing about my time with it has been, well, that I spent a pretty short amount of time with it. Or rather, I spent the perfect length of time with it.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nThe Outer Worlds 2 makes the actually important RPG choices more impactful by not having respecing.By \n    James Carr\n   on December 26, 2025 at 6:00AM PST\n              \n                Earth Directorate Commander Ash was sent to settle a labor strike issue on behalf of Auntie's Choice, in an effort to gain favor with the corporate conglomerate. A bit of an outlaw, and someone who excels in shooting, lockpicking, and smooth-talking, I felt like my character was primed to work out a result that was favorable for the workers without too much of an issue.I was able to enter the closed-off facility and even nab some blackmail on the manager in charge before confronting her directly about the labor strike. I conveyed the workers' demands, and expected to be able to convince her to see things my way--after all, I invested a decent amount of points in speech.It quickly became clear that no amount of talking was going to solve this dispute. As far as the manager was concerned, any concessions she might make would prevent the factory from hitting its quota. Someone with engineering or hacking skills may have been able to solve this issue by messing with the equipment in the factory, but my character wasn't built for that. My character was good at three things, and I'd already exhausted the lockpicking and talking options.So Commander Ash solved the problem the only other way she knew how: shooting the manager in the face and telling the striking workers to take it from there. What could easily feel like a failure of the game--not offering me a more diplomatic solution using whatever skills I had invested in--instead felt right, given the story I had built for myself.The limited number of skill points in The Outer Worlds 2 means you can only build up a handful of skills.In prior games in a similar style to The Outer Worlds 2, including the modern Fallout games, Cyberpunk 2077, and the original The Outer Worlds, I always had trouble resonating with the story. I would neglect the role-playing part of the RPG, not out of some refusal to engage with the story on its own terms, but because of the particular way I like to play games. I have a tendency to want to do everything and see everything, without the need to play through multiple times.I would often end up with a hodgepodge of skills, some points to improve combat skills, a few to increase carry weight to deal with my need to pick up everything I find, and a few skills to get me into locked areas. This would always result in me having a character that was good at a bunch of things, but worthless for high-end skill checks. If I had the option to respec, I would cheat my way through, and if it didn't, I would grind for some extra skill points. Sure, I got to see everything in the game, but that often lessened the chances of something different or odd happening.The Outer Worlds 2 doesn't have the option to respec, outside of one opportunity just after the opening sequence. On top of that, leveling isn't particularly fast, and you are only given two skill points to place into a massive list of skills. My particular playstyle would wreck my adventure here, making me lack the skills for interesting interactions and leaving me to suffer the consequences.So, I made a game plan during character creation. I gave my commander an outlaw background, and focused on guns, speech, and lockpicking. I built her like a smooth-talking space cowboy, someone who could get into places via speech or lockpicking and when the time came, shoot her way out. I even managed to spare two points of medicine, although even that small deviation meant I wasn't high enough level for a lockpick in a main quest area I was definitely overleveled for.Not every door can be lockpicked open.For as often as my speech skills could get me out of a jam, they also couldn't. After all, some people just can't be reasoned with. While I got through plenty of doors without issues, I would regularly run into a door that required hacking or another skill I didn't have. But I could always accomplish my goals in one way or another, I just had to make use of the skills I had chosen to invest in.This resulted in an experience with The Outer Worlds 2 where I felt invested in role-playing. Without the option to run away from or fix my decisions in the level-up screen, I had to work with it. I had satisfying experiences convincing low-level lackeys that their bosses didn't care about them, causing them to run rather than fight me. When a villain started lecturing me about the state of the galaxy, it felt right to choose the attack now option. I'd heard enough and was confident in a duel.It feels a bit silly to point out the benefits of role-playing in a genre with role-playing in the name, but respecing has become a crutch for some similar games. Playing Avowed earlier this year, while I felt like I knew who my character was from a personality standpoint, I regularly rebuilt my combat abilities and other skills, sometimes to use a new weapon or to deal with a situation differently.In The Outer Worlds 2, I often had to deal with an outcome that wasn't what I was angling for, because I had to play with skills I chose. The flaws system adds to this too, with my penchant for reloading constantly being something I could lean further into by getting a damage buff, so long as I didn't empty out my magazine.These thoughtful decisions also resonated with my companions, with Niles turning from a once-dedicated and hopeful Earth Directorate agent into an outlaw of his own. I taught him that large organizations will never have your back, and sometimes the only solution to a problem is a bullet, something that he now believes too.So while shooting that factory manager in the face might feel like a simple or unsatisfying solution in an RPG like The Outer Worlds 2, it was exactly what my character would have done in that moment anyway. Instead of trying to wiggle my way out of the consequences of my choices, undermining my own story in the process, I was forced to do exactly what my character was built to do, making something simple feel impactful.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

So what happens when you merge the two? You get Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, a fun Hades-like game that also happens to be on sale for Black Friday this year. TMNT: Splintered Fate's Deluxe Edition is on sale for only $20 (was $40) at Amazon. The 50% discount is available on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PS4, while the Xbox version is on sale for $25.But before you pick up the Deluxe Edition deal, you'll want to check out the Pipin' Hot Collector's Edition, which has received a Black Friday preorder deal that drops the price to only $80 (was $100) for Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, and Xbox.  The Pipin' Hot Collector's Edition releases December 5, just in time for the gift-giving season.                                                                                                      TMNT: Splintered Fate - Deluxe Edition                                                                $20 (was $40)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Deluxe Edition of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate includes the game, a physical pack of 10 foil trading cards, the Casey Jones DLC that adds the infamous vigilante as a playable character (Goongalah!), new enemies, bosses, and access to the upcoming Junkyard Jam DLC pack.A game that wears its Hades influence proudly on its sleeve, TMNT: Splintered Fate features all the hallmarks of a roguelike game. Across its levels, you'll take on enemies, encounter familiar faces, and power up along the way for a final boss fight.Death is a constant companion, but every time you restart a run, you do so with experience that helps you nail a perfect deathless adventure. Each Turtle has a unique arsenal of weapons and skills, and you can combine them to devastating effect in the game's co-op mode.Switch -- $20 ($40)PS5 -- $20 ($40)PS4 -- $20 ($40)Xbox Series X -- $25 ($40)                                                                                                                            TMNT: Splintered Fate - Pipin' Hot Collector's Edition                                                                $80 (was $100) | Releases December 5                                                                                                                                                                                    As mentioned, the Pipin' Hot Collector's Edition is one of the rare game preorders with a Black Friday discount. To be fair, though, this has been delayed multiple times. It was slated for August, pushed to October, and pushed again to its current December 5 launch date.We were already impressed by the list of collectibles included at the $100 MSRP, so the Pipin' Hot Collector's Edition is even more intriguing at $80. You get a wide array of cool extras, including TMNT-themed dice for tabletop RPGs, a pack of 10 foil trading cards, an art book and retro-style manual, a comic book from IDW Publishing--the team behind the long-running TMNT comic series--two posters, and more. All of the goodies are packaged in a pizza box with a slipcase, of course.Here's the full list:Pizza Box with SlipcaseMutant Ooze Green Tabletop RPG DiceNYC Sewer Manhole Cover Dice Box50-page Art Book & Retro ManualFoil Trading Card Pack (10 Cards)Double-sided Metallic CoinSplintered Fate Comic Book by IDW PublishingTwo Exclusive Posters of Turtles & Casey JonesPhysical copy of TMNT: Splintered FateCasey Jones & The Junkyard Jam expansion                         Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate - Pipin' Hot Collector's Edition\"It’s easy to reduce Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate down to just a Hades clone with a TMNT skin, as I did previously. And while that description is pretty accurate, the sentiment doesn't convey that a well-done take on a fantastic game can be a lot of fun. While the art and story don’t come near the lofty heights of Hades, it is nevertheless a blast to bash heads as one of the titular turtles, especially when you have friends fighting at your side,\" Steve Watts wrote in GameSpot's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate review.

The restored collection of early '90s live-action films is up for preorder for $59.30 (was $100) at Amazon.

Normally $100, Lego Fortnite: Peely Bone is available for only $80 at Amazon and Target. Not only is the 1,414-piece half-skeleton, half-banana on sale for its lowest price yet, but Lego is retiring this set soon. Peely Bone has largely held its MSRP since launching more than a year ago, so it's nice that Fortnite fans have the opportunity to grab it for less before it's no longer sold at major retailers. Amazon notes this limited-time deal is \"selling fast.\"Peely Bone is one of two Lego Fortnite sets from last October's launch lineup that will no longer be produced going forward. The 193-piece Durrr Burger is the other soon-to-be retired Lego Fortnite set. Amazon is all out of Durrr Burgers, but you can still snag one for only $9.40 (was $15) at Walmart or $9.49 at Target.                                 Lego Fortnite: Peely Bone (1,414 Pieces)                                                                $80 (was $100)                                                                                                                                                                                    Peely Bone is the largest Lego Fortnite model from last fall's launch lineup, and it was only recently surpassed by Mecha Team Leader. As shown in the image above, Peely Bone is packaged in a black box, meaning it's a display model designed for adults and experienced builders.Peely Bone measures over 14 inches tall with the included, buildable display stand. A Lego Fortnite nameplate attaches to the front of the stand. Along with the figure and stand, you'll piece together impressively detailed replicas of the Peely Pick Pickaxe and Paint Launcher weapons as well as a detachable Banana Bag Back Bling. You can move Peely's arms and wrists to create different poses.Outside of Mecha Team Leader--the only other black-box Fortnite set--the 1,414-piece Peely Bone model has the most complex build process. The half-skeleton, half-banana frame makes each side of the build a unique and rewarding process. It's one of the most interesting Lego figures/statues I've built over the past few years. Plus, the finished model looks fantastic. The newer Mecha Team Leader model is a fun and challenging project, but I still think Peely Bone is the best Lego Fortnite model yet. And one of the best licensed video game builds, period.If you register Peely Bone or one of the other original four Fortnite sets to your Lego account, you will receive a code to unlock the Operation Brite Starter Pack in the video game.

Most notably, the 691-piece Supply Llama is discounted to $26 (was $40) at Target. Amazon was matching this deal but has since sold out. Over at Amazon, you can also save 20% on the 546-piece Durrr Burger Restaurant and 250-piece Peely & Sparkplug's Camp playsets.If you're interested in the Lego Fortnite: Battle Bus, Walmart has a great Lego Fortnite 2-in-1 bundle deal featuring the 954-piece set with the Supply Llama for $110 (was $140).Supply Llama (691 pieces) -- $26 ($40)Supply Llama & Battle Bus Bundle (1,625 pieces) -- $110 ($140)Durrr Burger (193 pieces) -- $9.40 ($15) | Retiring soonDurrr Burger Restaurant (546 pieces) -- $52 ($65)Peely & Sparkplug’s Camp (250 pieces) -- $18.39 ($23)Peely Bone (1,414 pieces) -- $80 ($100) | Retiring soonCheck out GameSpot's Lego Fortnite buying guide for an in-depth look at the full collection.

Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition collects three PS2-era hits: GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. Rockstar reissued the collection over the summer with a new $30 MSRP. Prior to the rerelease, GTA: The Trilogy sold for $60 in stores. It still sells for $60 in digital format on the Nintendo eShop, so the $10 discount feels more like $40.It's a similar situation with Red Dead Redemption, which sells for $50 on the eShop but is only $30 in physical format. Red Dead Redemption is also included in Amazon's early Black Friday 2025 sale for $25. It's a great time to buy RDR for Switch, as Rockstar is releasing a free Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade December 2 alongside the game's mobile launch.                                                                                                                                                                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition for Switch                                                                $20 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, unlike the Red Dead Redemption physical version, requires a download from the Nintendo Switch eShop. When the reprint was announced, Amazon initially showed a game box without the \"download required\" label on the front, but this is the same physical edition as the original version released three-plus years ago.The physical edition requires a download of roughly 9GB from the eShop, which certainly isn't ideal for those who prefer to collect true physical editions. That said, you're still saving a ton of storage space compared to the pricier digital edition on the Switch eShop. The three games have a combined file size of 25.4GB, so roughly 16GB of data--San Andreas and GTA III--is stored on the Switch game card.                      The collection had some major performance and visual issues at launch, and many of those problems remained unfixed until Rockstar overhauled the experience on consoles last fall. It's by no means perfect for any console, but it's markedly improved and definitely worth checking out now that the physical edition is available for so cheap.Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 users should check out Amazon's other early Black Friday 2025 game deals before they're gone.Nintendo Switch 1/2 Early Black Friday Deals at AmazonAll Nintendo Switch 2 DealsAll Nintendo Switch DealsNintendo Switch Game DealsNintendo Switch 1/2 Controller Deals                                                                                                                                                                               The Best DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Deal Is Back, But Probably Not For Long                         Meta Quest 3S Batman Bundle Is $70 Off, Comes With $50 Amazon Gift Card                         Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 & PC For Only $40                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (5)                 Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut                         Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon                         Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon                         Lego DC Batman Figure & Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else                         Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

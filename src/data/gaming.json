The news was confirmed by Kier's partner Delbert McBride via Variety.With hundreds of film and TV credits spanning decades, Kier rose to fame in horror films like Mark of the Devil, Flesh for Frankenstein, and Blood for Dracula in the '70s. His breakthrough Hollywood role came in 1991's My Own Private Idaho, and he'd go on to appear in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Johnny Mnemonic, Armageddon, and Madonna music videos.In recent years, Kier was one of the actors set to appear in Hideo Kojima's upcoming horror game OD. Game director Hideo Kojima wrote online that new scenes featuring the actor were scheduled to be filmed in 2026, and that he'd kept in touch with him regularly.\"I'm at a loss for words,\" Kojima said in a social media post. \"It all happened far too suddenly. Because of the strike, we weren't able to shoot OD for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year.\"I’m at a loss for words.

Last week it was Soda Jungle Maker, and this week it's Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle. Normally $65, this 738-piece building set is discounted to only $28. Like Soda Jungle Maker, Peach's Castle is retiring soon, so this is likely your last chance to get a massive discount on the set.Amazon has already sold out of this deal once today (November 23), but the deal is back in stock as of 5:55 PM PT.

It doesn't include Peach, who is only available as an interactive figure in the Super Mario Adventures Starter Set, which is on sale for $40 (was $50).The castle's fold-out walls are destructible, so you can easily refortify your defenses after Chain Chomp crashes into them. Toad can sling projectiles at Roy and Chain Chomp with a built-in catapult atop the castle. If you have Interactive Princess Peach, you can tap the Action Tags on the rotating throne, in the small garden where Toad likes to hang out, and in hidden spots. Tapping an Action Tag plays music and sound effects from the Peach figure's built-in speakers.

If you don't own a Switch 2, you can also grab the game on PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X, but like many of the other video game deals in Amazon's event, these Persona 3 Reload discounts could run out fast, so don't wait--it could be Dark Hour on these deals before you know it.                                 Persona 3 Reload (Switch 2)                                                                $40 (was $60)                                                                                                                                                                                    Persona 3 Reload is a full-scale remake of the 2006 classic, introducing new characters, expanded storylines, an all-new voice cast, and a re-recorded soundtrack. The game also features quality-of-life improvements and a redesigned interface that refines the experience while preserving the heart of the cult-classic PS2 original.Note that the Switch 2 version of the game comes on a Game Key-Card, which means none of the game data is included on the cart. Instead, inserting the physical game into your system unlocks the digital version, which you must download to your console before you can start playing. Expect Persona 3 Reload to take up about 25GB on your Switch 2's internal storage or SD card. It's also worth pointing out is that the Episode Aigis DLC expansion is available a separate $35 purchase on the Switch 2 eShop. Episode Aegis adds roughly 30 hours of new story content that takes place after the base game's ending, along with new costumes and music.                      While Persona 3 Reload came to Switch 2 just a few months ago, it originally launched on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and PC back in early 2024. The physical PlayStation and Xbox versions also happen to be on sale at Amazon, and at much lower prices than the Switch 2 version.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 30, 2025 at 2:02AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Every new season of Fortnite brings significant changes to the loot pool, but the start of a new chapter is an even more special occasion--each Season 1 brings us a totally new set of weapons and other items. While we usually get to keep the basic stuff--like shield pots and med packs and shockwave grenades--the loot pool is typically pretty unfamiliar. And Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is no different in that regard.In Season 1, we've got a couple weapons we've used before, but the majority of the toys you'll be playing with this season are completely new, and they feel pretty different compared with the guns we've used in the past few seasons.These are the returning items in the loot pool in Chapter 7 Season 1:Tactical PistolEnforcer ARDual Micro SMGsDynamiteGrenadesBeyond those guns and items, you'll be looking at a bunch of totally new stuff. Scroll on to find out more about the new weapons.Forsaken Vow BladeObtained by visiting a training rift and being granted one by Beatrix Kiddo herself, the Forsaken Vow Blade combines elements of both of Fortnite's past katanas, the Typhoon Blade and the Kinetic Blade, with a dash attack that makes it an effective movement item.Arc Lightning GunInstead of bullets, this mini-gun fires off a stream of electrical current that melts anyone at close range. Vengeful SniperSeason 1's only sniper rifle carries three rounds per magazine, and since it's the only gun in the loot pool that isn't hitscan, it features some pretty heavy bullet drop that you'll need to account for.Holo Rush SMGThe Holo Rush is, as the name implies, a scoped SMG with pretty decent range--it can shoot further than the Arc Lightning Gun, for one thing.Deadeye Assault RifleThis scoped assault rifle is best at mid-to-long ranges, though it can hit pretty hard if you need to spray it in an emergency. This one shoots like if Fortnite's old Heavy AR had a scope on it, which makes it very deadly indeed.Twin HammersThese dual pumps actually combine for a fairly healthy fire rate, so you can treat the pair more or less the same way you would a single auto shotgun. Iron Pump ShotgunThis season's pump shotgun handles very smoothly, does solid damage without being overpowered, and it's got a little bit of range. So it may be every sweaty gamer's best friend by the end of the season. WingsuitThis season's new movement gimmick is essentially a weaker version of Iron Man's Flight Kit--it has the same vertical takeoff, but once you're up in the air you'll actually glide back down to the ground instead of being able to fly around willy nilly. Just be warned you trail smoke when you use a wingsuit, and so you'll be visible from pretty far away.Boss kitsInstead of medallions, boss NPCs now drop boss kits that allow you to wear their skin and use their combat gimmick. Just be warned that once you pick one of these up, you're stuck with it until you die or the match ends. And, yes, it does use one of your inventory slots.     \n  \n                      "

The RDS Industries Game Traveler Deluxe System Case is discounted to $25 (was $30). This case has enough room for the console, dock, and other accessories and is the No. 1 best seller on Amazon. For a more compact travel option, check out PowerA's Slim Case, which is on sale for only $15 (was $20). Both deals are expected to expire at the end of Cyber Monday (December 1).Naturally, these aren't the only Nintendo Switch 2 carrying cases on sale for Cyber Monday. Multiple of the most popular unlicensed cases have also received discounts. The form-fitting Tomtoc Slim is discounted to $25.89 (was $37), and Belkin's Switch 2 Case is available for $22 (was $30) when you click the coupon on Amazon's store page. Belkin's travel case has a built-in stand for tabletop mode, a mesh pocket for small accessories, a padded insert with 12 game card slots, and a dedicated Apple AirTag holder.                                                                                                      RDS Game Traveler Deluxe System Case for Switch 2                                                                $25 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Game Traveler Deluxe System Case is a great option for Switch 2 owners who want enough space for the official Dock Set but aren't interested in the large lunchbox-style form factor. From the outside, the System Case looks like a thicker version of the average Switch 2 travel case.RDS designed the System Case with the Switch 2 in mind, but it can be used with the original Switch and Switch OLED thanks to the cushions on each side that double as brackets to hold the smaller consoles in place. Molded ridges protect the Joy-Con 2 triggers and provide an extra layer of protection beyond the ballistic nylon exterior. A padded, fold-out insert with slots for 16 game cards fully protects the screen.The bottom side of the case has two compartments separated by a padded divider. The larger one has room for the Switch 1/2 Dock, a Pro Controller, or Joy-Con Grip. The smaller compartment is for a removable mesh bag with space for the official AC Adapter, an HDMI cable, and other small accessories. Elastic straps hold the accessories in both compartments in place.The System Case also comes with two game card-size plastic cases for microSD Express and a cleaning cloth. The System Case has a padded handle and a rubberized zipper pull with the red Switch 2 logo.If you want enough storage space for the Dock Set and a controller as well as other accessories, the Game Traveler Deluxe System Case is also available in a larger-size version similar to Nintendo's All-In-One Carrying Case. The larger version is $40 and isn't on sale for Cyber Monday. RDS also has two smaller options as well as a couple of bags--check out the full Game Traveler Deluxe lineup for Nintendo Switch 2.                                                                                                                             PowerA Slim Case for Nintendo Switch 2                                                                $15 (was $20)                                                                                                                                                                                    The PowerA Slim Case is also officially licensed by Nintendo and on sale for Cyber Monday. The Slim Case has an insert with 10 slots for game cards. The insert doubles as a console stand for tabletop mode and protects the screen when traveling. With the exception of cartridges, the Slim Case was designed solely for the console and Joy-Con 2. The form-fitting, molded interior is wrapped in soft fabric.The Slim Case is available in four different colors/themes. The Dark Heather Gray edition shown above is only one that's on sale for $15. A red Super Mario-themed edition with a bunch of Mushroom Kingdom characters on the front is discounted to $16.89. Other options include Metroid Prime 4 and a Pikachu-themed Pokemon edition.                         Nintendo Switch 2 owners should also check out the Cyber Monday deal on Samsung's officially licensed microSD Express Card. Normally $60, the 256GB Super Mario-themed storage expansion is discounted to only $39 at Amazon and Walmart.

Released earlier this year with a $300 price tag, the entry-level Sony 4K Blu-ray player is on sale for only $218 for Cyber Monday. The $82 discount matches the deals we saw during Prime Day and Big Deal Days.                                 Sony UBP-X700U 4K Blu-ray Player (2025 model)                                                                $218 (was $300)                                                                                                                                                                                    Sony Blu-ray players have a solid reputation, and the X700U model on sale offers a number of features found in some of Sony's high-end line of Blu-ray players. It plays 4K Blu-rays in native 4K UHD (2160p) resolution and supports HDR10, which improves picture brightness.It comes with an HDMI cable, but we'd recommend grabbing a second 4K cable if you don't have a spare. That's because the player has two HDMI out ports. The main one is for video and audio, and is the only one you must use, but the second output is dedicated to audio. Separating audio from video output produces a richer, clearer sound, so dual ports are common on dedicated 4K Blu-ray players. It's one of the benefits of using a media player for Blu-rays instead of a game console like the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can grab an Amazon Basics 4K HDMI cable for less than $5 right now.The UBP-X700U also has a Coaxial SPDIF, which can be connected to speakers, soundbars, and TVs. In terms of audio support, the UBP-X700U is equipped with high-end audio enhancements, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.One of the coolest features of dedicated Blu-ray players like the X700U is picture upscaling. The X700U can read 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVDs. When enabled, the built-in tech will enhance the resolution of standard Blu-rays and DVDs.While we haven't tested the 2025 edition of the X700U, the upscaling feature on previous iterations was quite impressive. Standard 1080p Blu-rays can look pretty darn close to 4K resolution, and 480p resolution DVDs are substantially better. Honestly, without upscaling tech, DVDs generally look terrible on modern 4K and HD panels. That said, upscaled output varies, and sometimes there are jagged edges or noticeable oddities that won't be appealing to viewers looking for an authentic experience.                      Naturally, if you buy a new 4K Blu-ray player, you should probably pick up some shiny new 4K UHD discs, too. Amazon's Cyber Monday sale features a wide assortment of movies on 4K Blu-ray for steep discounts. You should also check out the Criterion Collection holiday sale, which runs until December 7 and includes classics and contemporary hits for 50% off.Save 50% on The Criterion Collection:David Lynch MoviesAkira Kurosawa MoviesGuillermo del Toro MoviesStanley Kubrick MoviesWes Anderson MoviesMartin Scorsese MoviesDavid Cronenberg MoviesThe Coen Brothers MoviesGodzilla MoviesAdam Sandler MoviesAnimated Movies                                                                                                                                                                               Lexar Play Pro 1TB MicroSD Express For Switch 2 Gets Black Friday Discount                         DualSense Limited Edition PS5 Controllers On Sale For Black Friday                         Check Out Over 200 Nintendo Switch Game Deals For Black Friday                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (5)                 Eight Nintendo Switch Exclusives Are 50% Off In Walmart's Black Friday Sale                         The First PS5 Pro Deal In Six Months Is Up For Grabs For A Limited Time                         Ghost Of Yotei PS5 Slim Bundles And Collector's Edition Get Huge Discounts                         Save Big On 8BitDo's Stellar Ultimate 2 Controllers In Amazon's Black Friday Sale                         Evercade Retro Handhelds & Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

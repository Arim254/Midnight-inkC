The headliners are a couple of notable sequels: The Outer Worlds 2 and PowerWash Simulator 2. They're joined by six other titles, as well as two games now included with Game Pass Premium.PowerWash Simulator 2 arrives October 23 for the subscription service. One of the nicest new features for the game is the inclusion of shared progression in online co-op. That means when you join a friend's game of cleaning up an area, any work you do is clocked in your own campaign as well. For more, check out GameSpot's PowerWash Simulator 2 review.Meanwhile, The Outer Worlds 2 is set to land next week on the Game Pass Ultimate and PC tiers. Obsidian's follow-up RPG can see companions actually turning on players, if they go against their interests. However, it's noted these characters will provide plenty of warning that they're getting fed up.These aren't the only day-one launch games for Game Pass, either. The others are Bounty Star, Super Fantasy Kingdom, Football Manager 26, and Football Manager 26 Console. Rounding out the new titles coming to Game Pass are Halls of Torment and 1000xResist. In addition, Commandos: Origins and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 are now part of the Game Pass Premium catalog.Earlier this month, Microsoft not only raised the price of Game Pass Ultimate from $20 monthly to $30, but the company also changed tier names. Game Pass Core is now Essential, while Standard is now called Premium. Those two tiers didn't experience price hikes.The changes also led to 94 new games hitting Game Pass to start the month.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                While Pikmin fans might not be getting a new game anytime soon, an upcoming update should give them some reasons to jump back into Pikmin 4.Coming on an unspecified date this November, the update will add some attractive features to Pikmin 4, most notably a camera mode and difficulty modes that will make the Nintendo Switch game easier or harder.With the new Field Camera tool, players can snap in-game photos and fully customize them with stamps, frames, and filters. Pikmin 3 featured a camera tool, but the field camera in Pikmin 4 looks more in line with camera modes in most modern games.          There are also new \"Creature Difficulty Levels,\" which is just Nintendo's fancy phrasing for difficulty modes. The easier Relaxed mode will make it so enemies won't attack unless they're attacked first, and they'll also be less difficult to defeat. On the other hand, Fierce mode will increase the difficulty, which is a great option for veteran Pikmin players seeking a greater challenge.But the cutest addition to Pikmin 4 is the inclusion of Decor Pikmin from Niantic's mobile game Pikmin Bloom. Players can find Pikmin donning some form of decoration, like a ladybug toy costume, a pink doughnut, or an ice cream hat. No, they don't have any special abilities, but they're adorable as hell. These little guys can also be transferred to Pikmin Bloom.A free demo is available for Pikmin 4, and it will be updated the same day as the full game. Unfortunately for Switch 2 owners, Nintendo makes no mention of any technical enhancements for Pikmin 4 on the new console, hindering hopes of a Switch 2 Edition.The announcement for the future update comes on the heels of the bizarre drop of an animated Pikmin short film called \"Close to you.\" The video by Nintendo Pictures was initially released in a cryptic manner without any explicit Pikmin connection. Another version of the short came out not long after, adding Pikmin to the mix.The video led to intense speculation about a new Pikmin game or a feature film, but it appeared to be just a separate project by Nintendo Pictures. In addition to announcing the Pikmin 4 update, Nintendo also released the full \"Close to you\" video, featuring both versions of the short, on YouTube.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Borderlands 4 was one of the most-anticipated titles of 2025, and that helped carry the title to a record launch last month. According to Circana, Borderlands 4 didn't just set a franchise record in September, it also became the third highest-selling video game in the US for 2025.Circana's Mat Piscatellaâ€¬ shared the sales charts for September 2025 in the US, and Borderlands 4 topped the Xbox Series X|S and PC charts, while coming in at No. 3 on PlayStation's list. Specific sales numbers weren't included in the charts, but Piscatella noted that Borderlands 4 \"generated the highest launch month dollar sales of any title in franchise history, nearly 30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3.\"However, it remains to be seen if that momentum was retained in October. PC players have been very vocal about the game's optimization issues. Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford challenged players' negative reviews on social media and even suggested that they should get a refund. Pitchford went on to offer optimization tips, while Gearbox has put forth an unusual step to handle recurring problems on the game's PC port. The company subsequently released a new Borderlands 4 patch to tackle some of the game's stability and performance issues.Pitchford recently noted that the Borderlands franchise is closing in on the 100 million sales milestone across all titles. Borderlands 4 reportedly only needs to sell 6 million copies to reach that franchise mark.Meanwhile, Gearbox has set November 20 as the release date for Borderlands 4's first DLC. For now, Borderlands 4's Switch 2 port has been delayed indefinitely.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

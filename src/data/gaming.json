    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Netflix and Ubisoft are making an Assassin's Creed TV series, and the cast is coming together ahead of the start of production in 2026. The director for the series has also been announced.So far, three stars for the Assassin's Creed TV show have been confirmed, but as of yet, no roles have been announced. For now, here's who we know will appear on the show:Toby WallaceZachary HartLola PetticrewLaura MarcusTanzyn CrawfordWallace is known for his roles in the movies The Bikeriders and Babyteeth, while Hart is perhaps best known for the Apple TV show Slow Horses. Petticrew, meanwhile, starred on the TV series Say Nothing. Marcus previously appeared in Death by Lightning and will be in next year's Hunger Games movie, Sunrise on the Reaping. Crawford will appear in the upcoming Game of Thrones TV show A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Who is directing the Assassin's Creed TV show?Johan Renck, best known for directing HBO's Chernobyl series and winning an Emmy for his work, will direct the Assassin's Creed show, according to Variety. The Swedish filmmaker also directed episodes of Breaking Bad and Bloodline, as well as one episode of The Walking Dead. He was going to direct the pilot for HBO's The Last of Us before he dropped out due to a scheduling conflict. Renck is also known for directing music videos, and for his own music. His 1993 song, \"Here We Go,\" was a chart-topper.Filming for the untitled Assassin's Creed show is expected to begin this year in Italy, which will also be a setting for the show. However, the time period for the series is unknown. The games jump throughout history and the modern day.As announced previously, Roberto Patino (Westworld) and David Wiener (Halo) are the showrunners for the untitled Assassin's Creed show. In 2023, the previous showrunner, Jeb Stuart, quit the show over a \"difference in vision.\"Before this, 20th Century Fox produced 2016's live-action Assassin's Creed movie starring Michael Fassbender, and it made more than $240 million worldwide. It reportedly had a budget of $120 million.In addition to this new live-action series, Netflix is producing an animated series based on Assassin's Creed.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Scott White\n   on January 3, 2026 at 12:00PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                As impressive as the teams of developers that create games are, sometimes I am more blown away by the passion of the communities that build up around them, and what comes out of them. As more and more games are being made with software that is more available for general public use, like Unreal Engine, Blender, and Unity, this means that fans are able to try their hand at making custom creations to add into their favorite games, or even full-blown tools that help others do so.From clever randomizers to giant adjustments to the base game, these are some of the best fan mods and creations released in 2025.Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Integrated RandomizerDownloadWhile the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night randomizer isn't anything new, what modder Mottzilla has managed to do is on another level: It's an integrated randomizer inside the game itself. This randomizer comes with various presets and options to let you customize your randomized experience of SotN, letting you swap around where abilities are, starting items, and more, without having the need to create and download a new seed every time you want to play. As an extra bonus, this mod will also work on original hardware, including PSX and PS2 systems, so long as you have a way to play backups. Enjoy Castlevania: Symphony of the Night in a new way, every time you play with this mod!Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater RandomizerDownloadWhile Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta may be the hot new Snake on the block, that doesn't mean that earlier versions of that classic game haven't gotten some love too this year. Metal Gear Solid 3 in the Master Collection Vol. 1 has received a randomizer mod courtesy of Great0ne. This randomizer shakes up your typical MGS3 playthrough by changing every pickup, including weapons, items, medic supplies, camo, and food, with some other options like random vomit or fake death being possible should you wish. This is a great way to really test those Big Boss skills of yours and whether or not you deserve the title.ArchipelagoDownloadKeeping on the randomizer train, one of the more popular ways to play these sorts of mods is via a unique interconnected method known as Archipelago. This multi-world mod/community has developed ways to tether and let people play multiple different games together, where you can pick up items from a completely different game that someone else in your group is playing, and vice versa. As an example, someone could be playing Pokemon Red and get rewarded with the Super Metroid Morph Ball for beating a gym, letting the person playing Super Metroid now have access to the upgrade. With new games being added all the time to the pool of options and larger groups teaming up to tackle games together, 2025 marked the best year yet for Archipelago.Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite and BeyondDownloadWith a passionate team of almost 40 fans and organized by prominent fighting game YouTuber and streamer Maximilian Dood, this massive mod for Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite overhauls the visuals of the 2017 fighter, giving it a gorgeous comic book look, updates movesets, new outfits, new music, and even adds in a brand-new four-player game mode. This passion project is a must-have for any MVC fans.Route MatriX Randomizer (Mega Man X)DownloadCombining the first three Mega Man X games on the Super Nintendo into a single game, the Route MatriX Randomizer lets you jump between the three to search for armor pieces, weapons, upgrades, and access to new levels. Your goal is to defeat all three versions of Sigma, but first, you will need to discover the keys to his levels. For fans of these classic action platformers, the Route MatriX randomizer is an impressive new way to play.Final Fantasy Legends + Adventure GB ColorizationsDownloadWhile each mod is its own, this slot is actually four mods in one. Created by theadamrippon, this gives the DX color treatment to the original three Final Fantasy Legend games and Final Fantasy Adventure, which were all released on the original Game Boy back in the early '90s. While labeled Final Fantasy Legend in the West, these were actually the original three SaGa entries, with Adventure being the original Mana game, both of which would go on and grow as their own beloved series over the decades, with new releases still coming out today. These beautiful mods present the original games in color, making them really pop.Shade's Beast Mastery - Oblivion RemasteredDownloadOblivion's companions are neat and all, but wouldn't it be cooler if you could hang out around Cyrodiil with a bear or one of those annoying mudcrabs? Mod creator Shadedness thinks so, and thus their \"Beast Mastery - Tame Beast Pets - Permanent Summons\" mod was born for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. With this installed, not only will you have some fuzzy friends tagging along on your adventures, but you will be able to command them to a limited extent, feeding them to gain better buffs with them, and even level them up. Now get out there and get yourself a mountain lion.Fire Emblem LegacyDownloadDesigned around the \"legacy\" philosophy whose goal is to make the perfect version of a game, TheSmithPlays created this mod to help do just that for Fire Emblem 7: The Blazing Blade. It was the first Fire Emblem game to come to the West, where it was referred to simply as Fire Emblem. Fire Emblem Legacy tweaks stages, weapon effectiveness, characters, and a host of other aspects of the classic title, resulting in a product that feels like how we remember Fire Emblem being when American audiences first met Eliwood, Lynn, and Hector back in 2003.Final Fantasy IV Job SystemDownloadThe tale of Cecil Harvey's redemption and struggle against Zeromus has made Final Fantasy IV one of the most beloved entries in Square's legendary franchise, but one thing it has always been missing is a job system. Thankfully, modder S34n4e has rectified this omission with the release of Final Fantasy 4 - Job System, a mod that adds 14 discoverable jobs that give you more flexibility with your party. Each job comes complete with a unique sprite, attributes, abilities, and more to make each one feel worthwhile, resulting in a wildly new-feeling FFIV.Monster Hunter Wilds OverlayDownloadThe Monster Hunter series has always opted to hide numbers from players, such as boss health, stat build-up, and more. This year's Monster Hunter Wilds continues that approach, but this overlay mod pulls back the curtain and gives you all the stats and data you want to help you coordinate your hunts and strategies with your friends.Dragon Ball Sparking Zero - Anime JP Themes and InsertsDownloadThe right track can elevate moments from being exciting to legendary, and this mod from BRYN4444 for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero adds in more than 200 tracks from the Japanese release of the anime and films. Now you can hurl beams and clash with your friends to your favorite tunes from the anime. A similar mod is also available that adds tracks from previous DBZ games if that is more your style.Pokemon LazarusDownloadPokemon Lazarus by Nemo622 is a complete overhaul mod of Pokemon Emerald that features a brand-new region based on Greece--the Illos Region--among many other new goodies to discover, such as a hard mode, a day/night system, and minigames. For trainers looking for more Pokemon goodness after finishing ZA, Pokemon Lazarus is a masterclass in Pokemon fan mods.Silksong Multiplayer ModDownloadThe long-awaited Hollow Knight expansion-turned-sequel, Silksong, finally released this year and has delighted (and infuriated) fans with its tight platforming and tough challenges. In this mod created by XvX, two players can play through the game together, with a cool new revive mechanic that lets you heal your teammate if they go down. Sometimes it's nice to suffer together with a friend.Elden Ring Nightreign - Seamless Co-opDownloadFrom Software's souls-likes are great fun when playing with friends, and this year's Elden Ring Nightreign highlights this fact better than any other. Created by a user named Yui, the Seamless Co-op mod allows up to six players to play together (up from the official max of two or three) and see each other in the Roundtable Hold. It can also adjust enemy scaling to make runs easier or more challenging.Star Wars Genesis - StarfieldDownloadBack when Starfield came out in 2023, in our review, we found that despite its satisfying gunplay and some captivating quest lines, it struggled to deliver a memorable RPG that lives up to the studio's pedigree. Leave it to the passion of the Bethesda modding community, though, to put together mind-blowing, awesome mods--enter Star Wars Genesis. This total conversion modlist, which recently got its eleventh update of the year and which we featured on our list of the best Starfield mods, continues to mold Starfield into what could end up being the best Star Wars RPG out there. With custom storylines, bosses, dungeons, armor, weapons, and more, Star Wars Genesis just continues getting better.Super Metroid: X-FusionDownloadSuper Metroid: X-Fusion from Metaquarium and team feels like an artifact pulled straight out of another reality, one where Metroid Fusion was released on the SNES and was far more difficult. This impressive mod is a total overhaul of Super Metroid, combining aspects of both it and its portable sequel into an all-new retelling of the Fusion story. With cutscenes, new bosses, new areas, and redone Fusion bosses, just to name a few of its features, X-Fusion is an ideal option for Metroid aficionados looking for a challenge.Europa Versalis IV: Anbennar - The Final EmpireDownloadReleased back in July, The Final Empire update for Anbennar--a fantasy total-conversion mod for Europa Versalis IV--brought with it a host of new features and goodies. Special to The Final Empire itself are new mission trees, religions, and a custom UI to add even more personality to this project. If the idea of adding elements of the epic fantasy genre into Europa Versalis--including schools of magic, a world rich in its own lore, and races including orcs, elves, and dwarves--then Anbennar is the mod for you.FFT: Ivalice Chronicle - Dark Knights and Onion KnightDownloadThe updated release of Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles marks the first time in quite a while that players can easily play this tactical RPG masterpiece, and its debut on PC. Being based on the original PSX release, some things were lost that had been introduced in the PSP remake, including the Dark and Onion Knight jobs. Luckily, those jobs are missing no more thanks to TriggerHappy's mod, bringing them back in, complete with their PSP sprites. This mod also adds a page system to the Job menu, which will hopefully allow for new jobs to get added in down the road. Either way, you will now be able to once again add these powerful professions to your roster of heroes.Phantasy Star Generation: 1 Fan TranslationDownloadMany RPGs used to never be localized for Western markets, one of which was the PS2 remake of Sega's original Phantasy Star. This mod is a full retranslation of the original 2012 translation patch that fixes various errors and updates some terms to be more in line with modern terminology for the series. There is no better time than 2025 for English speakers to venture with Alice and crew into space and unravel the mysteries of Phantasy Star.Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 - Unlimited Saving 2DownloadKingdom Come Deliverance 2 from Warhorse Studios is perhaps one of the most immersive and complex RPGs that was released in 2025, but one divisive mechanic was its save system, which Unlimited Saving 2 addresses. Normally, in order to save, players need to craft Savior Schnapps items that would be consumed upon saving. This godsend of a mod by EddieShoe removes the need to spend these items to save, making KCD2 far more welcoming to try out different approaches and gameplay styles without the risk of burning through resources. And, to sweeten the deal even more, using this mod doesn't lock you out from earning achievements, so save to your medieval heart's content!    \n  \n                      "

Normally $100, the mClassic Retro Edition is on sale for only $45.15, the all-time best price for the HDMI accessory. The Retro Edition is designed for gamers who want to improve the visual experience of older games originally designed for 4:3 aspect ratio displays when playing on modern HD and 4K TVs.The Retro Edition is one of three different models of the mClassic manufactured by Marseille. It launched in 2025 alongside the mClassic Switch Edition, which is discounted to $74.25 (was $100). The mClassic Switch Edition is tailored around upscaling the visuals on Switch and other widescreen platforms like Steam Deck, Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3. The Retro and Switch Editions have one of the enhancement modes found in the mClassic Original Edition, which is currently priced at $89 (was $100), while also offering two new visual modes geared toward retro gaming or Switch/Steam Deck, depending on which model you pick.mClassic Retro Edition - N64, GameCube, SNES, PS2, PS1, other 4:3 platformsmClassic Switch Edition - Switch, Steam Deck, other 16:9 platformsmClassic Original Edition - Switch, Steam Deck, and retro platformsLet's take a closer look at all three options below.                                                                                                       mClassic Graphics Upscaler (Retro Edition)                                                                $45.15 (was $100)                                                                                                                                                                                    The mClassic Retro Edition has three different modes geared toward consoles that released prior to the high-definition era. If you are buying the mClassic to play games on SNES, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64 or any other console designed for 4:3 aspect ratio, the Retro Edition is the one to pick.It has three modes you can switch between:Retro Mode: Display games in original 4:3 aspect ratio with upscaled resolution.Vintage Mode: Replicates CRT TV picture and audio in 4:3 aspect ratio. This mode does not alter the colors, lighting, or sound, as it's geared toward authenticity.Vintage Enhance Mode: A mix of Retro and Vintage Modes, as it balances authenticity with visual fidelity improvements.Note: For game consoles without an HDMI port--like the GameCube, SNES, and N64--you'll need an adapter like one of these $20-$30 models from Amazon.                                                                                                                            mClassic Graphics Upscaler (Nintendo Switch Edition)                                                                $74.25 (was $100)                                                                                                                                                                                    Note: This will not provide any benefits with Nintendo Switch 2.The mClassic Switch Edition focuses solely on modern gaming platforms with widescreen aspect ratios (16:9). When it comes to modern HD consoles, Marseille has always geared the mClassic toward the Switch, which is why Nintendo's console is in the new model's name. But the mClassic Switch Edition can be used with Steam Deck, PS3, Xbox 360, and other devices with widescreen aspect ratios that lack 1440p and/or 4K resolution.Once again, performance on Switch varies by game, but the mClassic Switch Edition is capable of upscaling to 1440p at 60fps.You can toggle between three different visual modes on the mClassic Switch Edition:Enhancement On: This mode offers all of the same benefits as the \"Enhancement On\" mode in the original mClassic.Switch Plus: Recreates Switch handheld mode while playing on TV. If you think Switch games look better in handheld mode--and you aren't alone in thinking that--this mode might be preferred over the original enhancement mode.Switch Enhance Mode: This mode aims to offer some of the key benefits of OLED TVs, namely improved contrast and clarity when dark colors are displayed.                                                                                                                            mClassic Graphics Upscaler (Original Model)                                                                $89 (was $100)                                                                                                                                                                                    The original mClassic Graphics Upscaler offers a combination of the two recently released specialty editions. It has features and modes designed for games that render in 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen) as well as tech created to enhance the picture quality and performance of retro games developed for 4:3 aspect ratio TVs.The mClassic offers noticeable visual upgrades--though the degree to which you notice the differences depends on how discerning you are when it comes to graphics. Switch games can be upscaled up to 1440p at 60fps. It has built-in anti-aliasing tech that smooths jagged edges and sharpens the picture. The exact boost in visual fidelity varies based on the game, in our experience.On consoles with HDMI such as Switch, PS3, and Xbox 360 (besides first-gen 360 consoles), all you need to do is plug it into your console, connect the included power cable, and then reconnect your HDMI cable from your TV into the mClassic dongle.The mClassic substantially improves the overall picture quality and playability of game consoles from the pre-HD era--Super Nintendo, N64, GameCube, etc.--on modern flat-screen 4K and HD TVs. A CRT TV is still clearly the best option for retro gaming, but the mClassic is a great option for those who don't want to deal with the bulk of a box TV or the hassle of finding one in general.There's a switch on the dongle to flip between modern and retro modes. The third \"mode\" on the original mClassic simply turns the device's graphics processor off.Enhancement On: Improves the visuals/performance of widescreen platforms, including Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.Retro Mode: Allows you to play retro games in 4:3 aspect ratio on modern displays. Markedly improves the picture quality of games originally designed for CRT TVs.Note: Game consoles without an HDMI port--like the aforementioned retro Nintendo consoles--require the mClassic to be connected to an adapter, such as one of these $20-$30 adapters for GameCube, N64, and SNES.                         Marseille recommends locking your Nintendo Switch to 720p while docked--the resolution for handheld mode--for the best results. Based on our testing, we agree with that recommendation, but don't forget to turn 1080p back on before you play without the mClassic Original or mClassic Switch.If you're worried about an increase in latency due to your HDMI cable passing through the dongle, we've never noticed any. Marseille claims the device adds an average of 0.2ms on this front, but you'd probably need to be a cyborg to notice. The mClassic also has lossless audio passthrough.Keep in mind you also need to be playing on a TV or monitor with support for 1440p or 4K resolution to take full advantage of the mClassic's features. However, if you are playing on a 1080p panel, the mClassic still offers an improvement in picture quality.

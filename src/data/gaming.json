    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Sony has shared its latest update for investors, and it's largely good news for PlayStation 5. According to Sony, an additional 3.9 million PS5 consoles were sold in the last quarter, bringing its lifetime total to 84.2 million consoles sold since the system launched in 2020. That puts the PS5 into a virtual dead heat with its predecessor, PlayStation 4, at the same point in its life cycle.The complete breakdown of Sony's latest fiscal quarter is now online, and its sales chart shows the remarkably similar trajectory of the PS4 and PS5 sales. However, Sony noted that it only projects 15 million additional PS5 console sales during its current fiscal year, which runs through March 31, 2025. If so, that would potentially allow PS4 to retain its crown as Sony's second best-selling console, because it sold 17.8 million systems at that point in its life.Regardless, Sony CFO Lin Tao suggested that the PS5 may have a longer lifespan than the traditional seven-year cycle.Sony CFO Lin Tao says the PS5 is only in the middle of its lifecycle and they want to expand the lifecycle even further!\"Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles. Looking at the PS4 lifecycle it seems to be getting longer and longer. Especially the PS4,… pic.twitter.com/ecrsI3X9xV  — Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) November 11, 2025              Kantan Games CEO Dr Serkan Toto told Video Games Chronicle that Sony's success is at least in part due to the struggles of Microsoft's gaming division and the migration of formerly Xbox-exclusive titles to PS5.\"Life is good if you have a competitor that is not really focusing on hardware anymore and has given up on exclusive games to start selling them on your platform,\" said Toto. \"Sony is now clearly dominating the high fidelity console gaming space, and just watch what happens to their numbers once GTA 6 is out.\"Sony's report also revealed that Ghost of Yotei has sold 3.3 million copies since its debut just over a month ago. Unfortunately, the latest word from Sony about Bungie and Destiny isn't as good. Sony is claiming a loss of $204 million because Destiny 2 didn't reach its sales goals. For now, Sony is hopeful that Destiny 2's next expansion, Renegades, may revive interest in the shooter when it launches on December 2.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Reanimal is an upcoming horror-adventure game developed by Tarsier Studios, the same team behind Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares II. It puts you in control of two children trying to survive and uncover the mysteries of a hostile island that was once their home. With its unsettling visuals and cooperative gameplay, Reanimal will hopefully build on Tarsier’s reputation for creating intimate and atmospheric horror.Reanimal blends puzzle-solving, stealth, and exploration in a world filled with eerie creatures and twisted environments. You play as a brother and sister duo navigating the ruins of a corrupted island, solving environmental puzzles and hiding from monsters that seem to be shaped by their past trauma. The focus isn’t on combat, but survival--the connection between the two siblings is at the heart of the experience.When will Reanimal be released?As of now, no exact release date has been announced. The game is listed on Steam as “coming soon.” The development team has said it wants to emphasize quality and won't rush to a release date. However, a demo recently appeared during Steam Next Fest, which shows the game to be in a state close to fit for release, so we wouldn’t be surprised if it appears within the next few months. Be sure to check out our list of the top survival horror games to play in the meantime.Reanimal Trailers          So far, Reanimal has received three trailers that each highlight different aspects of the game. The first announcement trailer introduced the sibling protagonists and set the tone with eerie island visuals and shadowy figures. A later gameplay trailer expanded on that foundation by showing puzzle solving, stealth, and cooperative movement between the two characters, giving players a better idea of how exploration and tension will unfold.The most recent trailer focused on the story’s emotional weight, teasing new environments and darker creature designs while hinting at the personal history tying the siblings to the island.Reanimal PlatformsReanimal is set to launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and the Nintendo Switch 2. The release date hasn’t been confirmed yet, but the Steam page lists it as “coming soon.”Reanimal Story, Setting and CharactersIn Reanimal you play as two child characters--a brother and sister who head back to an island from their past only to find it corrupted, hostile, and transformed. The setting fuses childhood nostalgia with horror--abandoned amusement parks, homes frozen in time, and creatures that reflect past trauma. The game uses the siblings’ relationship as the emotional core, making exploration and survival something personal rather than purely mechanical.Reanimal aims to make horror more human. Where most horror games focus on powerlessness, this one highlights vulnerability and connection--how two people face fear together. The game’s co-op mechanics, psychological tone, and handcrafted environments set it apart from more action-heavy titles, offering something closer to a playable dark fairy tale.Reanimal GameplayPlayers can explore the world solo with an AI companion or in two-player co-op, either online or locally. The camera shifts between dynamic and fixed angles to build tension, much like classic survival-horror games. Tarsier’s signature use of scale and lighting returns here, making even quiet moments feel unsettling. Every corner of the island hides a piece of the story, from broken toys to forgotten homes, encouraging exploration and reflection rather than speed.Combat is minimal. Your tools are stealth and evasion rather than firearms or brute force. The world design emphasizes hiding, running and reading the environment for clues. Environmental puzzles, exploration of hidden paths, and uncovering story fragments are key components. The game promises a tighter runtime and focused structure rather than an open-ended map.Reanimal Development NewsA Reanimal demo was available during the Steam Next Fest in October of 2025. The demo showcases the grimy world Tarsier Studios has created. It's a major change of pace from both Little Nightmare games the team had created ahead of this project. One of the biggest elements that has enticed us so far is how it feels to explore the world of Reanimal.\"Little Nightmares 3--and even Little Nightmares 2--got away from the first game's especially morbid, skin-crawling monsters, or Residents, as they're called,\" GameSpot's Mark Delaney wrote. \"The Reanimal demo feels like a return to form for Tarsier [...] Reanimal's slithering skin suits, inky black waters, ever-present unease, and air of mystery combine to give me the sense that this is the game that will get us there.\"The Reanimal demo also featured some evolution in how Tarsier approached using camera angles. Little Nightmares, as a series, has mostly utilized a static, side-scrolling angle that sometimes shifted for tense moments.\"Reanimal's demo showed off a lot more dynamism in its perspective. Sometimes the camera pulled far away; other times it was practically a third-person over-the-shoulder experience,\" Delany continued. \"By shifting the dynamics, Tarsier is able to experiment more with puzzle design and exploration, which may help eventually separate it from the Little Nightmares comparisons.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

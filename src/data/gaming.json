    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Josh Broadwell\n   on December 8, 2025 at 8:19PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Red Dead Redemption 2 mods have kept Rockstar's western game alive and changing long after Rockstar itself moved on. After one last holiday update in 2022, Rockstar left Red Dead Redemption 2 behind and, for the most part, left behind Red Dead Online as well, with most of the studio's resources going toward GTA 6. However, Red Dead Online did receive a new update in 2025 that brought new zombie and robot missions to the game. Rockstar might be mostly finished with Red Dead for now, but Red Dead fans certainly aren't. The mod community has dug into nearly every aspect of the game and found ways to make it better, harder, easier, less rigid, more inflexible--if there's something you've wanted to change about Red Dead Redemption 2, you can bet a modder has something out there for you.NexusMods hosts hundreds of Red Dead Redemption 2 mods, but we've gathered 24 of the best together, from new clothes for Arthur to part-time jobs, better bounties, and an expansive reimagining of the game's melee combat system.Bear in mind that, like with most mods, these only work for Red Dead Redemption 2's PC version. If you're after some console fun instead, check out our picks for the best PS5 gamesand best Xbox Series X|S games to play in 2025.Rampage TrainerCreator: RampageDevDownload Link: NexusModsThe Rampage Trainer mod for Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the most popular on NexusMods, and it's not hard to see why. It essentially gives you access that's normally restricted to a debug menu. Rampage Trainer lets you alter character stats and attributes, switch Arthur's model for any other character, generate a companion, or revisit out-of-bounds areas--and that's just the start. However, it's probably not something you'd want to do for your first, or maybe even second, playthrough, since it lets you completely alter any part of the game and experience it in a way you're not really meant to.WhyEm's DLCCreator: WhyEmDownload link: NexusModsWhyEm's DLC has nothing to do with Red Dead Redemption 2's gameplay and everything to do with making Arthur look even more stylish. It adds more than 2,000 new cosmetics, including beard styles and hairdos for Arthur at the barber shop, new clothes from the trapper, more saddles, and even carvings and grips, the latter of which you can collect and customize at any gun store. WhyEm's DLC even lets you customize how clothing looks, with options to remove suspenders, belts, and holsters, and separate menus for customizing other accessories. It's massive, but also a little finicky at first. Among other requirements, you need to make sure Arthur has every main item equipped, including a satchel, when you install the mod, or it won't work.DuelsCreator: ShtiviDownload link: NexusModsRockstar went to impressive lengths to make Red Dead Redemption 2 historically accurate to the real Wild West, and that includes not having people whip out their revolvers anytime someome gives them a sideways glance. As chaotic as the Old West could be, shootouts weren't a daily occurrence in every frontier town, and they aren't in Red Dead Redemption 2, either. At least, until you install this mod. Duels lets you challenge any NPC to a gunfight--literally any NPC you come across--with unique animations, cinematics, conversations, and customizable settings. You have to instigate the duel yourself, too, so you won't just be getting ambushed by anyone who walks by.Crime and Law Rebalance and EnhancementCreator: Blackjack Colver Voltaire - Natsu - SgtJoe - Modifiver - GamerollDownload link: NexusModsCrime and Law Rebalance is a sweeping overhaul of Red Dead Redemption 2's crime system, one that makes it simultaneously easier to get away with a crime and harder to survive once you're hunted. The mod disables minor crimes in all settlements, makes everything legal in the wilderness, and slows down how long it takes for you to earn a wanted status after robbing a train. Lawmen are also less likely to hunt you with dogs. On the other hand, Pinkertons and law enforcement are more cunning and dangerous thanks to improved behavior, and more competent agents are likely to join the hunt when your wanted level is higher. There's a lot more to it, even down to giving Pinkerton agents better horses, but one of the other standout features is that every gang has unique behavior. They'll all fight differently and pose specific challenges that force you to adapt your strategies when you take them on.Bounty Hunting Expanded and EnhancedCreator: ShtiviDownload link: NexusModsBounty Hunting Expanded and Enhanced takes the base game's comparatively tame bounty hunting and turns it into something rather more exciting. For one thing, the mod gives Arthur some bounty hunter rivals who are just as capable as himself and liable to take the reward if you don't act fast enough. You can steal their bounties if you happen upon them in the wilderness and even order a custom bounty wagon for hauling and turning in several criminals at once. Enemy behavior is also smarter and more aggressive, so even regular bounties will pose more of a challenge, and the mod adds dozens of new mission locations, including Annesburg.Enhanced BrawlingCreator: 14N001stDownload link: NexusModsEnhanced Brawling is a collection of several mods that improve fistfighting in an impressive variety of ways, to the point where Arthur is practically a character from a fighting game. The headline addition is a set of six brawling styles, each with unique grapple moves and animations, and new knife attacks and animations. Enhanced Brawling also adds light and heavy attacks, counter moves, grapple escapes, and the option to chuck your opponent over rails or a wall if such a construction happens to be near when you're grappling. It's a refreshing and deep overhaul of what often feels like Red Dead Redemption 2's weakest system, and having more ways to negotiate with your hands means you can save on ammo, too.No Bounty When MaskedCreator: ShtiviDownload link: NexusModsRed Dead Redemption 2's No Bounties When Masked mod makes a small but important change to how the game's bounty system works. Normally, Arthur has a bounty placed on him when he commits a robbery or serious crime, even if no one can see his face--an impressive, nearly impossible feat of identification on the part of his witnesses. No Bounty When Masked lives up to its name and keeps Arthur from having a bounty placed on him if he commits a crime when masked, though he'll still be a wanted criminal. The mask has to be up before he does the deed, and if you take it off before his wanted level drops, then the bounty will appear as usual.Basic Needs: Final CutCreator: BolminDownload link: NexusModsThe Basic Needs mod for Red Dead Redemption 2 expands Rockstar's survival foundation with a selection of new cores to contend with. In addition to stamina and health, you also have to manage hunger, exhaustion, equipment weight, thirst, and, in a twist that makes it a bit like The Sims, urination. Thankfully, Arthur won't die from embarrassment if he has an accident, though. Exhaustion functions like an add-on to stamina and fluctuates depending on what you're doing at a given time of day. Thirst lets you drink from water sources, bathe, or refill your canteen, with a toggle that makes alcohol contribute to Arthur's dehydration, and urination is, well, urination. Hunger, as the mod maker says, is the least developed of the new cores. Failing to eat gives Arthur penalties, but that's about it. The mod lets you toggle any of these cores, so if you only want to impose an equipment weight limit on Arthur, you can ignore the rest.Contracts RemasteredCreator: ShtiviDownload link: NexusModsContracts Remastered adds a stealth game touch to the old west with a special type of bounty. Once you install this mod, Arthur can pick up unique bounties that act almost like puzzles. He gets a photograph of his target and a small amount of information about them--and that's it. Your job is remaining observant and picking out the target from the throng of normal NPCs, before deciding how to approach the hit. You can take them out quietly, make a scene by turning them into a hostage, or do whatever else you think might work. The mod even comes with an in-game tutorial to help get you started.Immersive ScenariosCreator: MaybelleElizabethColterDownload link: NexusModsImmersive Scenarios is one of the quieter Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay mods--one that adds a little extra to Arthur's moment-to-moment actions. These are the little, normal, everyday things that other characters can do, such as playing an instrument or leaning against a wall, but that Arthur usually can't. It's perfect for photo mode--and Red Dead 2 has one of the best photo modes around–or if you just want it to seem more like Arthur belongs in the world, instead of him being a passive observer. Bear in mind that the Immersive Scenarios mod only works if an NPC isn't already performing that action. You can't shove someone off a piano bench and take up their song, for example. You'll have to wait until they finish.Stash That LanternCreator: Juliet GDownload link: NexusModsJuliet G's Stash That Lantern mod seems like a simple thing on the surface, but it fixes one of Red Dead Redemption 2's most persistent minor annoyances. Normally, the game treats the lantern as a held object, which means Arthur can't hold anything else in the hand with the lantern. That'd make sense--if Arthur were actually holding the lantern. Red Dead Redemption 2 lets you clip the lantern to Arthur's satchel, but still acts like he's holding it, which leaves you with just one free hand and makes it impossible to use two-handed weapons, among other things. Stash That Lantern resolves the issue. When you clip the lantern to Arthur's satchel with this mod installed, he's free to use both hands.Perfect PeltsCreator: IMaVeRicKDownload link: NexusModsPerfect Pelts is another Red Dead Redemption 2 mod that makes a finicky, often-irritating system easier to deal with. Normally, Arthur has a chance of damaging pelts when he hunts an animal, which means you have to go back out into the wild, hunt another beast, and repeat the process again with the right weapon and method. It makes sense, as hunting a small animal with a large shotgun will, of course, damage their skin. Perfect Pelts gives you two new ways to deal with this situation and save time, though. The first makes it so every animal that spawns does so in perfect condition, which means you still have a chance to damage it if you hunt it in a careless manner. The second is completely accident-proof, which means you can use any weapon against any animal and still get a perfect pelt.Stagecoach RobberiesCreator: ShtiviDownload link: NexusModsStagecoach Robberies were rather more common in the 19th and early 20th centuries than Red Dead Redemption 2's scant few stagecoach missions would suggest, and this mod aims to fix that imbalance. It generates random stagecoach missions for Arthur to accept in any part of the map, including Tumbleweed, and there's no limit to how many you can tackle. The missions come in two varieties--merchandise that your client wants from the coach and lockboxes for you to empty. Post offices caught up in the robberies will be closed for a time after the mission ends, and like with the game's other robbery missions, if you don't reach the ambush point in time, you fail the mission.Dynamic SeasonsCreator: BolminDownload link: NexusModsDynamic Seasons is another Red Dead Redemption 2 mod that's perfect for photo mode or for those who just want Arthur's world to feel a little more alive. Normally, seasons don't progress in Red Dead 2. Once you finish the prologue, that's it for the snow for a long time unless you explore certain areas. Dynamic Seasons adds a rotation that sees the seasons cycle, with weather effects and color palettes for each. Autumn, for instance, has a higher chance of more-extreme weather, while winter forces you to manage Arthur's temperature more carefully. The mod's latest version adds a widget that shows the current season and how long it'll last, and you can edit the default season length in the mod's files, too.Jobs Expanded and EnhancedCreator: Bolmin and ShtiviDownload link: NexusModsJobs Expanded and Enhanced is an excellent way to earn quite a lot of cash. The mod adds a job board in every major town with a selection of period-appropriate tasks for Arthur to take on. These range from being a carriage driver--Arthur magically gets his own carriage, so you don't have to buy one for the job--to helping out on a ranch and keeping watch over flocks by night. The pay is high, too. The dock hand job, for example, pays $26, so if you're not keen on treasure hunts or just want to stuff some extra money away, this is the mod for you. You'll need the mod tool Scripthook for Jobs Expanded and Enhanced to work, and Scripthook only functions in single-player mode. If you boot up Red Dead Online with Scripthook running, the program shuts Red Dead Redemption 2 down.Buyable PropertiesCreator: Bolmin and Dick_HertzDownload link: NexusModsBuyable Properties lets you purchase a home, as the name suggests, though there are a few caveats. Mod creators Bolmin and Dick_Hertz made home buying and decorating an endgame activity, something to keep you busy after you reach the epilogue and (theoretically) have excess cash on hand. It's for John by default, but if you toggle a setting in the mod's files, you can play as Arthur instead. Whatever the case, once you reach the epilogue, you can shop for one of three homes outside of Red Dead Redemption 2's major settlements or even buy a hotel room in one of the three major hotels or the Rhodes Saloon. Red Dead Redemption 2's Buyable Properties mod lets you customize the interior and exterior as you see fit, and the most recent update adds a weapon locker to every property you own.Bank RobberiesCreator: Unlosing and Jedijosh920Download Link: NexusModsRobberies play a huge role in Red Dead Redemption 2, but you can't just go into any location and rob it. This is especially frustrating when it comes to banks, as the bank robberies during the main story are some of the best pieces of content in the entire game. If you're yearning for more bank robbery action, you can download the Bank Robberies mod. This allows you to rob any of the supported banks on the map. All you have to do is point a weapon at the shopkeeper, steal the loot from inside the bank, and lose the authorities after you exit the bank.Dog CompanionCreator: ShtiviDownload Link: NexusModsYour horse in Red Dead Redemption 2 becomes one of your most trusted companions, as you'll likely travel all over the map with the steed of your choice. However, if you want a change of pace, you can download the Dog Companion mod, which adds the ability to tame a dog and have it follow you around. You can simply find a stray dog on the map, pet it, and it will become your dog. The dog comes with all of the features you might expect; it can be called for, told to wait, attack enemies, and even help out with hunting. Your dog will truly become man's best friend out in the Old West.All Weapons UnlockedCreator: JosefigDownload Link: NexusModsIf you've ever wanted to use a particular weapon in Red Dead Redemption 2 but you don't have it unlocked, then the All Weapons Unlocked mod is what you need. The mod immediately unlocks all weapons in the game at shops and fences, so you can always buy whatever you want, regardless of your progress in the story. Normally, certain guns don't become unlocked until after specific story intervals, but this mod gets rid of that restriction altogether.Custom Gang ModCreator: SergeantJoeDownload Link: NexusModsArthur Morgan's gang in Red Dead Redemption 2 is certainly memorable, but it's not exactly what you'd call a cohesive group. If you want to get out from under Dutch's thumb and avoid Micah at all costs, then you can download the Custom Gang Mod. This allows Arthur to establish his own gang, complete with recruited members, at a location of your choosing. You can control what your camp looks like and who's in it. If that wasn't enough, the mod also adds new custom heists into the game so your gang can score some easy cash to sustain itself.Undead Nightmare IICreator: Dick Hertz and EkiDownload Link: NexusModsOne of the most memorable DLCs in video game history is the original Red Dead Redemption's \"Undead Nightmare.\" This turned the Old West into a zombie-filled hellscape, where John Marston was able to take down hordes of zombies in a new, single-player campaign. Unfortunately, Rockstar Games didn't develop a sequel to this DLC for Red Dead 2, but luckily, you can download Undead Nightmare II to get the experience anyway. The mod features plenty of zombies at overrun settlements, new missions, and animations/textures from the original Red Dead Redemption. The mod allows you to play as John Marston as well, so it's a true sequel to the first DLC.Open All InteriorsCreator: konstantinos96bDownload Link: NexusModsHave you ever wanted to go inside of a building or house in Red Dead 2, but the door is locked? This is the case for a majority of interiors across the various towns in the Western US, but not after you download the Open All Interiors mod. This mod opens every door across the map, giving you free access to explore all of the buildings and see what's inside. While most of the interiors might not be overly exciting to look at, just knowing you can go through the door is enough to make the game more immersive.Companion SystemCreator: BolminDownload Link: NexusModsThroughout the story of Red Dead 2, you'll come across numerous characters that Arthur and his gang interact with or even invite to join them. However, what if you could approach any character and ask them to be your personal companion? The Companion System mod adds this ability, allowing you to recruit over a dozen sidekicks from your gang. These companions come with unique dialogue and interactions, as well as the ability to aid you in combat and exploration.Gun TricksCreator: RampageDevDownload Link: NexusModsIf you're a fan of Red Dead Online, then you likely know the gun spinning tricks that are present in the mode. These tricks add a layer of customization to the game and simply look cool, especially in third-person view or right before engaging with an enemy. While these tricks aren't available in the story mode by default, the Gun Tricks mod adds them in for Arthur, and you have the entire repertoire of gun tricks at your disposal in the story mode.    \n  \n                      "

The Amazon-owned retailer has the 2,500-piece display model for $265 (was $300). Woot's Lego deals tend to sell out fast, especially on pricey models that almost always sell for full price at major retailers. This is the second time Woot has had a deal on Lego's Great Deku Tree, and the previous deal sold out in hours.This awesome Lego set lets Zelda fans build the Deku Tree based on its appearance in Breath of the Wild or Ocarina of Time. The Great Deku Tree launched in September 2024 on the Lego Store and at major retailers in January 2025. It's the first and currently only Zelda Lego set, but Lego recently teased a new release for 2026.Lego Sale at WootThe Great Deku Tree is one of numerous pricey Lego sets on sale at Woot. The deals officially end December 12, but all of the discounted sets will probably sell out before then. You can also save $60 on two massive Lord of the Rings models and four Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series sets, including a $70 discount on Jabba's Sail Barge. A fifth Star Wars USC model, The Razor Crest, has already sold out. Other notable discounted sets include Dungeons & Dragons: Red Dragon's Tale and X-Men: The X-Mansion.The Legend of Zelda: Great Deku Tree (2,500 pieces) -- $265 ($300)The Lord of the Rings: Rivendell (6,167 pieces) -- $440 ($500)The Lord of the Rings: Barad-dur (5,471 pieces) -- $400 ($460)Star Wars UCS Deals  TIE Interceptor Starfighter (1,931 pieces) -- $210 ($230)Jango Fett's Firespray-Class Starship (2,970 pieces) -- $270 ($300)Jabba's Sail Barge (3,942 pieces) -- $430 ($500)Venator-Class Republic Attack Cruiser (5,374 pieces) -- $580 ($650)Dungeons & Dragons: Red Dragon's Tale (3,745 pieces) -- $323 ($360)Marvel: X-Men The X-Mansion (3,093 pieces) -- $300 ($330)Harry Potter: Hogwarts Castle Main Tower (2,135 pieces) -- $226 ($260)Harry Potter: Hogwarts Castle Great Hall (1,732 pieces) -- $180 ($200)Disney: Beauty and the Beast Castle (2,916 pieces) -- $250 ($280)Lego Ideas: River Steamboat (4,090 pieces) -- $290 ($330)Lego Titanic (9,090 pieces) -- $600 ($680)Lego Eiffel Tower (10,001 pieces) -- $560 ($630)                                 Lego The Legend of Zelda: Great Deku Tree 2-in-1                                                                $265 (was $300) | 2,500 Pieces                                                                                                                                                                                    The Great Deku Tree Lego set comes with four minifigures, two from each game. For Ocarina of Time, you'll get Young Link with Deku Shield and Kokiri Sword accessories as well as Link with his magical Ocarina. The Breath of the Wild side of the set includes Link and Princess Zelda minifigures. Link has a sword and the Traveler's Shield, while Zelda has the Sheikah Slate.Plenty of other brick-built characters are included as well: Koroks, Deku Babas, a Deku Sprout, Navi the Fairy, a Skulltula, and a maracas-shaking Hestu. Where things get interesting is in the finished build, as the Breath of the Wild version of the Great Deku Tree has an animated face that can be controlled with a lever on its back, while the Ocarina Of Time version has an opening mouth that reveals a Skulltula monster.When you build the Breath of the Wild version, there's a recreation of the spot in the Lost Woods where Link retrieves the Master Sword. The Master Sword can be removed from its block pedestal and held by a Link minifigure, but this is why the set also comes with a sword that's not the Master Sword.The Master Sword display can be removed and reconnected later if you decide to switch to the Ocarina of Time version. You'll also build Link's house from Ocarina of Time. This cool smaller-scale build and all of the minifigures are pieced together first, so even if you build the Deku Tree as seen in Breath of the Wild, you'll still have the house to display alongside it or separately.                      The Great Deku Tree is part of Lego's display model series, which means it's packaged in a black box and is recommended for experienced builders. It's a fairly intricate build with lots of small and differentiated pieces. I've built all of the Nintendo-themed Lego display models, and I'd say it's slightly more detail-oriented than the other models with similar piece counts (Lego NES and Mighty Bowser).As a longtime Zelda fan, I thoroughly enjoyed both build processes, and the finished product(s) makes for an extremely cool collectible to display.If you haven't built a 2-in-1 Lego set before, you should know that you are building one or the other, not both. The way it works is that the first chunk of the build is the same for both models. About halfway through the process, you need to choose between the Breath of the Wild and Ocarina of Time versions of the Great Deku Tree. The Breath of the Wild build, shown above, is the larger of the two.What I did was build the Ocarina of Time model first, partially dismantled it, and then built the Breath of the Wild version. It's well-designed, so this process of switching between the two styles isn't as bad as it may sound--just make sure you keep the pieces for each in a safe place in case you want to switch at a later date.A Lego link to the past!Gallery                                                                                                                                                                            There are only eight Nintendo Lego sets categorized for adults. Beyond The Great Deku Tree, the other seven kits focus on Super Mario or classic Nintendo hardware. Most recently, Lego launched the 421-piece Game Boy for $60. The Game Boy includes two buildable Game Paks, Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.Two other Nintendo Lego sets for adults are on sale right now. Over at Amazon, you can get the 540-piece Lego Super Mario: Piranha Plant for $36 (was $60). We expected this deal to disappear on Sunday when Walmart's Cyber Deals event finally ended, but it's still available. You can also get the Lego Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi pixel art display model for $105 (was $130).

While some industry trends have been met with negativity, others have become staples that gamers everywhere have come to enjoy. Cross-play or cross-platform support, allowing players to connect with their friends and other players on different systems from their own, has been a very welcome development. 10 years ago, this feature wasn't present in most titles--now, there are hundreds of games that let you play alongside or against other players regardless of their platform of choice.Cross-platform games are still few and far between in the grand scheme of things, so it might be difficult to discern which have the feature andare worth playing. If you have friends with a different system but want to play together, we've assembled a look at the 33 best cross-platform games you can play right now. This list is in no particular order. Be sure to also check out our lists of the best PS5 games, best Switch games, best Xbox games, and best PC games.FortniteDeveloper: Epic GamesRelease Date: July 21, 2017Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Android, Nintendo SwitchGenre: Battle RoyaleFortnite is the game that popularized the cross-platform feature when it was released back in 2017. More specifically, the battle royale mode that took over the gaming community in the late 2010s featured cross-platform play at a time when platform holders were resistant to the idea. Regardless of if you had a friend on PS4 and you were on PC, you could squad up with them by simply adding their Epic Games ID. Developer Epic Games is responsible for many industry standards we see today, but perhaps its most influential work came with adding the cross-platform feature into Fortnite--something that was initially \"accidentally\" added to the game before being pulled.Black Ops 7 & WarzoneDeveloper: Activision (Treyarch, Raven Software)Release Date: November 14, 2025Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: First-Person ShooterCall of Duty has featured cross-platform play for several years at this point, and that didn’t change with the release of Black Ops 7. In addition to Warzone, which continually gets integrated with the mainline series games every year, Black Ops 7 features an extremely seamless cross-platform experience. However, players can choose to only matchmake with other players on the same platform as them, allowing PlayStation and Xbox users to avoid the potential cheating issues on PC. Whichever way you decide to play Call of Duty with your friends, there will always be a title to hop into and plenty to do once you're playing.Sea of ThievesDeveloper: RareRelease Date: March 20, 2018Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Action-AdventureSea of Thieves is a late bloomer when it comes to both the gameplay experience and cross-platform functionality. While cross-play has been available between Xbox and PC for years, the game recently came to PS5 and introduced an entirely new crop of players. PS5 users can take full advantage of cross-play and join up with friends on both Xbox and PC. More players getting to hop in and experience Sea of Thieves only bodes well for a game that has become one of the best co-op games on the market.Apex LegendsDeveloper: EARelease Date: February 4, 2019Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo SwitchGenre: First-Person Shooter/Battle RoyaleEA's battle royale darling, Apex Legends, is one of the best free games on Steam and also lets you play with those on any platform. The free-to-play game came out of nowhere in 2019 and offered cross-platform features right out of the gate. Since its release, the Apex community has only gotten stronger and the game has an almost overwhelming amount of content to consume. There are ranked playlists, different battle royale modes, loads of customization, and new non-BR modes being added all the time. You can experience all of that with friends on any available platform.Helldivers 2Developer: Arrowhead StudiosRelease Date: February 8, 2024Platforms: PlayStation 5, PCGenre: Third-Person ShooterOne of the more recent additions on this list, Helldivers 2 has been an extremely pleasant surprise in 2024. Featuring extremely fun and inventive gameplay, few current games can match the same level of enjoyment Helldivers 2 offers. While the game's not currently available on Xbox, there's full cross-platform functionality between PS5 and PC. You and up to two friends can spread democracy across the universe, blowing away robots and bugs alike. Working together as a team of three is extremely rewarding, especially when your Stratagems are all working in concert. Friendly fire makes the action all the more chaotic and hilarious.Destiny 2Developer: BungieRelease Date: August 28, 2017Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: First-Person Shooter/MMODestiny 2 has become a live-service behemoth, releasing back in 2017 but still pulling in large numbers of players in 2024. While the cross-platform feature wasn't available at launch in Destiny 2, it has since become one of the game's main selling points. You can play with any friend, anywhere, as the game promotes. There's a little something for everyone in Destiny 2, as you can take part in both PvE and PvP modes, with PvE being the game's strong suit, where activities like raids and dungeons require intense cooperation amongst players. Best of all, though, the base game in Destiny 2 is completely free. You can check out our previous list of the best free games in 2024 as well.Rocket LeagueDeveloper: PsyonixRelease Date: July 7, 2015Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo SwitchGenre: SportsOften referred to as \"car soccer,\" Rocket League is one of the longest-running games on this list. Cross-play was added post-launch, and the way it works has slightly changed over the years, especially after Epic Games acquired developer Psyonix, but the functionality is still as seamless as ever. Rocket League features one of the highest skill ceilings of any multiplayer game on the market, but it's incredibly enjoyable to learn and play. You can experience car soccer for yourself at no charge.Dead by DaylightDeveloper: Behaviour InteractiveRelease Date: June 14, 2016Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, iOS, Android, Nintendo SwitchGenre: Survival HorrorDead by Daylight is an online survival game with some horror elements, but nothing too major that you have to play it with the lights on. The premise of the game is simple, as there's one killer in a lobby with four other players. The killer attempts to, you guessed it, eliminate the four players while the players band together to survive. You can use a myriad of tools and equipment to stop the killer, but the killer has access to some lethal weapons as well. There's cross-play available across all of Dead by Daylight's platforms, and the game is a true treat with a full lobby of friends.MinecraftDeveloper: Mojang StudiosRelease Date: November 18, 2011Platforms: PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, iOS, Android, Nintendo SwitchGenre: Sandbox SurvivalIf you're a fan of cross-platform games, you knew this entry was coming. Minecraft is one of the most successful video games of all time, reaching as far as any game can in the modern world. There are dozens of different ways to play Minecraft, and all of them offer cross-platform functionality. Unfortunately, if you're on PS3 or Xbox 360, you won't get to partake in any cross-play features. The rest of the platforms can join up with anyone else, provided you're all on the same edition of Minecraft. The timeless crafting/survival gameplay lets you adventure with friends, building bases, and exploring limitless worlds.Overwatch 2Developer: Blizzard EntertainmentRelease Date: October 4, 2022Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo SwitchGenre: First-Person ShooterOverwatch 2 carried over plenty of features from the original game, and cross-play was one of them. Cross-play in Overwatch 2 works exactly as it did in the first game, allowing you to play in a lobby with any other player. This is a great feature for Overwatch 2, as playing as a team is critical due to the interplay between support characters, tanks, and damage dealers. You and your friends can tackle both unranked and ranked playlists as well as other modes that are available with the various in-game seasons. Having everyone pick their hero and work through a map in unison is a terrific feeling.NBA 2K26Developer: 2KRelease Date: August 29, 2025Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch 2Genre: SportsNBA 2K is another long-running franchise that has featured cross-platform play. Similar to how other online games operate, though, NBA 2K26 only allows cross-platform functionality for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users. If you're on a last-generation console, PC, or Nintendo Switch 2, you won't have any sort of access to cross-platform features. The game features a revamped hub area, The City, where players can engage with their friends as well as random players in a massive online environment.No Man's SkyDeveloper: Hello GamesRelease Date: August 9, 2016Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo SwitchGenre: Open World/SurvivalBefore No Man's Sky launched, the developers at Hello Games promised that you could run into other players when exploring the vast universe. That initially turned out to be untrue but was eventually corrected following a series of updates as No Man's Sky slowly won back the trust of its community. Now, you can run into other players as well as play with any player, regardless of their platform. Cross-play is terrific in No Man's Sky, as you and some friends can roam the galaxy together, build bases on new planets, take part in intergalactic warfare with other players, and complete quests at various space stations.Fall GuysDeveloper: MediatonicRelease Date: August 4, 2020Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo SwitchGenre: Battle RoyaleAt the height of the pandemic in 2020, certain games became instant phenomenons within the community as everyone was gaming at home.

A new take on the battle royale genre, you control a bean as you maneuver different obstacle courses and try to be the last player standing in a lobby of 60. You can party up with any player on any platform and compete against them to prove you're the superior gamer.Among UsDeveloper: InnerslothRelease Date: June 15, 2018Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, iOS, Android, Nintendo SwitchGenre: Social DeductionSpeaking of games that became popular during the pandemic, few games have brought the gaming community together like Among Us did in 2020. Among Us blended strategy and horror with the murder mystery genre to create an experience like few others. You and other players all load into a map, where your main job is to complete various tasks. However, one player has been designated as the impostor, whose job is to blend in and slowly eliminate other players without being caught. Among Us creates some truly hilarious moments, and you can experience it with anyone on any platform, even on mobile.Final Fantasy XIVDeveloper: Square EnixRelease Date: September 30, 2010Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: MMORPGIt was inevitable that one of the best MMORPGs would make this list, and it's only right that Final Fantasy XIV take the spot. One of the most-respected games in its genre, FFXIV is bursting with content and is still receiving regular expansions and updates. While it does cost money to experience the entire game, you can play the full story plus two expansions at no cost. Moreover, you can meet up with players across all of the available platforms. Whether you're completing quests, exploring new lands, training one of the many jobs, or taking part in combat, there's something for everyone in FFXIV.Diablo IVDeveloper: Blizzard EntertainmentRelease Date: June 5, 2023Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Action-RPGDiablo IV has kept a core audience in place with seasonal updates that keep adding content to Sanctuary.

An open-world action-RPG, the title allows you to play as numerous characters and use a wide variety of weapons as you navigate an expansive map. Part of what makes Genshin Impact so popular is the party system, where you can join up on a friend's world and clear Domains or complete quests together. It doesn't matter what system a player is on; if they're playing, you can join their world, provided you're playing on the same Adventure Rank.Mortal Kombat 1Developer: NetherRealm StudiosRelease Date: September 14, 2023Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Fighting GameThe term cross-play is technically spelled \"Krossplay\" in Mortal Kombat 1, but the feature still does everything you would expect it to do. Support for it was added in early 2024, allowing friends to fight each other in online playlists or private matches. However, cross-platform features aren't available for Nintendo Switch players. Mortal Kombat 1 doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to the fighting genre, but it's a highly enjoyable game with a high skill ceiling that's not for the faint of heart.Forza Horizon 5Developer: Playground GamesRelease Date: November 1, 2021Platforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: RacingRacing games aren't as plentiful in the market as they used to be, but it's difficult to beat the experience you can have in Forza Horizon 5.

You play across arenas that are all completely destructible, making each match feel different from the last depending on what you or others decide to destroy. The core feeling of The Finals is an arcade shooter where the goal is to eliminate enemy players, but it features more replayability than many FPS titles on the market today. You can experience the game in full cross-play with any other player regardless of platform.Borderlands 4Developer: Gearbox SoftwareRelease Date: September 12, 2025Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch 2Genre: Action-RPG/ShooterBorderlands 4 is the newest entry in the famed looter shooter franchise, and unlike its predecessor, Borderlands 3, the cross-platform features actually function correctly. All platforms feature cross-platform functionality, and the Shift system makes it fairly simple to use. Players just need to make a Shift account and then link it to their system. After that, other players can add you using that account, and then you can join their party to play through Borderlands 4 together. Ideally, most players in your party are roughly the same level, but you can still play with people who are at different parts in the story than you. Keep an eye on our list of Borderlands 4 Shift codes for an extra helping hand in snagging some sweet loot.Chivalry 2Developer: Tom Banner StudiosRelease Date: April 23, 2021Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: ActionChivarly 2 is a first-person action game that takes place in medieval times.

Like most MOBAs, Smite features a steep learning curve, as you have to understand each character's abilities and how they work on the map. However, with time, you'll start to master the \"deities\" you enjoy playing as and can take that knowledge into several different game modes. It's also worth noting that Smite 2, the upcoming sequel to Smite, is also going to be cross-platform with the current-gen consoles and PC.Deep Rock GalacticDeveloper: Ghost Ship GamesRelease Date: February 28, 2018Platforms: PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5; Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Xbox Store version)Genre: FPS/Action-AdventureDeep Rock Galactic takes players on a solo or co-op adventure to some of the deadliest mining locations across the galaxy. Players are tasked with clearing out mining sites that are infested with enemies, collecting resources and leveling up their character along the way. Deep Rock Galactic isn't technically classified as a looter shooter, so don't expect weapons and items to fall from the enemies you eliminate. However, there are horror elements and tons of randomized levels to clear out. Deep Rock Galactic supports cross-platform, albeit with some limitations: PS4 and PS5 players can join up together, but PC players need to be on the Xbox Store version of the game to link up with those on Xbox consoles. Users on Steam are limited to playing with other Steam players.Split FictionDeveloper: Hazelight StudiosRelease Date: March 6, 2025Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Action-AdventureSplit Fiction is the newest co-op adventure from developer Hazelight Studios, the same team behind former Game of the Year Winner It Takes Two. While Split Fiction isn't a sequel to It Takes Two by any means, it takes many of the concepts from the game and cranks them up a notch. You still have to have a partner to play the game, but the Friend's Pass makes it easy to invite any friend you want, regardless of their platform. It allows them to play with you without even buying the game.In-game, you and your partner take control of two characters and they try to escape a virtual reality experiment gone wrong. You'll travel to cyberpunk-inspired cities and fantasy lands while engaging with a number of different genres along the way.

It's a terrific experience, earning a rare 10 in GameSpot's Split Fiction review.Monster Hunter WildsThe Monster Hunter series is back with Monster Hunter Wilds. The new installment keeps the same formula in place from previous games in the series, but adds in several fan-requested mechanics, a dynamic world, and updates to combat that can change up your style from fight to fight. Some of the new features include a larger and more interactive map, the ability to ride around on a mount, and a secondary weapon that you can swap to at any time.There's no shortage of content in Monster Hunter Wilds, as you can go through a 15-hour campaign and eventually reach the endgame, where dozens of more monsters and quests are awaiting your challenge. One of the best parts of your journey through this content is that you can play with up to three friends during any part of the game. That said, playing with those on other platforms can be unintuitive, so be sure to check out our Monster Hunter Wilds cross-platform explainer for assistance.Marvel RivalsDeveloper: NetEase GamesRelease Date: December 6, 2024Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Hero ShooterMarvel Rivals took the gaming industry by storm at the tail end of 2024, and it's still going strong in 2025. The free-to-play hero shooter utilizes a lineup of nearly 40 Marvel characters that you can use throughout a variety of modes. Each one of these heroes possesses different abilities and has a designated role: Vanguard, Duelist, or Strategist. Every match in Marvel Rivals can only have one of every hero per team, so it's worthwhile to master several characters in case your main gets taken.Aside from the heroes, Marvel Rivals features several maps, casual and ranked modes, and a plethora of events and cosmetics. An important distinction to make with Marvel Rivals is that you can only use cross-platform play in casual modes; ranked modes require you to play with players solely on your platform.Tekken 8Developer: Bandai Namco StudiosRelease Date: January 26, 2024Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: FightingTekken 8 is the first game in the storied franchise to implement any form of cross-platform play. The eighth installment of the long-running series is what fans have come to expect from the fighting game genre. You have access to a huge lineup of fighters that you can use to go through the story mode with or engage in multiplayer fights with online players. There are some quirky game modes as well, such as Tekken Ball, where you're fighting a real opponent but using a beach ball instead of your fists/feet.Also, even a year after its release, Tekken 8 is still delivering impactful updates that change the game on the fly. The recent Season 2 update completely changed several different characters to make them stronger, added a new character, and adjusted combat across the board.FragPunkDeveloper: NetEase GamesRelease Date: March 6, 2025Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: First-Person ShooterThe tactical, first-person shooter genre has started to evolve over the past several years, as games like Valorant have added new spins to change up the formula. FragPunk is the latest game to add a twist on the genre, delivering high-octane gameplay that incorporates both existing and fresh mechanics. Every FragPunk match consists of a team of individual Lancers, who all have unique abilities that need to be purchased through the game's economy system. You can also purchase weapons and equipment with the money you earn throughout the match.However, the major curveball that FragPunk throws is the introduction of Shard Cards. These can be used at the start of a match and implement new twists that every player has to adapt to. Depending on what cards and Lancers are used, matches can play out completely differently. FragPunk delivers cross-platform play across all modes, so you can easily figure out a strategy with your team before each begins.Path of Exile 2Developer: Grinding Gear GamesRelease Date: December 6, 2024Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: ARPGPath of Exile 2 is an ARPG that plays extremely similarly to something like Diablo IV. You can pick from a variety of different classes that offer completely unique playstyles, abilities, and gear preferences. You'll then enter the world that's cut up into levels and different areas within those levels. Each level contains several bosses, side quests, and a main hub town. The main draw of Path of Exile 2 is its extraordinary class design, which allows you to craft thousands of in-depth character builds using passive and active abilities as well as specific gear. You'll often need to design new builds as you progress the story in PoE 2, as the difficulty curve in-game is something ARPG fans might not be used to. Enemies and bosses can be very tough to defeat, and there's no way to lower your difficulty other than playing in a group with friends so you can maximize your damage output.Baldur's Gate 3Developer: Larian StudiosRelease Date: August 3, 2023Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: CRPGAfter a couple of years of waiting, cross-platform play was finally added to Baldur's Gate 3 in one of the game's final updates. You can now play with up to three other players in your party, and all of them can be on different platforms. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best RPGs and video games to be released in recent memory. It's a stunning role-playing experience that allows you to fully create a character from scratch or use an existing pre-made character with their own backstory, abilities, and attributes. Once your character is made, you'll embark on an incredible journey that sees you travel through several massive levels, all of which have dozens of characters to meet and interact with, in-depth quests to take on, and secrets to uncover. The combat in Baldur's Gate 3 is turn-based, so if you're not used to that style, you'll have to take some time to understand it. Once you do, though, every combat situation is enthralling as you try to figure out the best strategy to take out enemies with your party and all of their unique characters.Split FictionDeveloper: Hazelight StudiosRelease Date: March 6, 2025Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo SwitchGenre: Co-Op/Action AdventureSplit Fiction is a co-op game that requires two players to play; there's no solo option or any form of online matchmaking. This means you have to find a friend who's willing to play with you. Fortunately, Split Fiction is fully cross-platform and only makes one person buy the game, as the Friend Pass allows your buddy to join for free. The other player just has to accept an invite code. From there, you and your partner will start your split-screen adventure in Split Fiction. The game follows two author protagonists as they get entangled in a virtual mess that results in them being stuck in the plot of each other's book ideas. Using co-op mechanics and communication, you and your partner will experience jaw-dropping visuals, hilarious moments, and several side stories that will keep you thoroughly entertained as you work your way through the game. Split Fiction also features some varied combat, vehicles, and plenty of other wacky mechanics that always keep you guessing throughout every level.    \n  \n                      "

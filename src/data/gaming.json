This quick and straightforward quest sends you to Blue Gate to snag one of these honey-filled bee homes from the Olive Grove POI, and we'll tell you exactly where to get your hands on it.You'll need to extract with the beehive in your inventory to get credit for the quest's completion, so you'd do well to bring an augment that possesses a safe pocket so that you can toss this quest item in there for safekeeping--you know, just in case some other raider decides to get fiesty with you. Don't worry--the bees won't sting, though.When you're ready to get your hands sticky with honey, here's how to find a beehive for the Bees! quest.Where to find a beehive for the Bees! questTo collect a beehive, you'll need to visit the Olive Grove POI on the Blue Gate map. This area is located in the southern region of the map and happens to be a very active spot for raiders since Olives are a hot commodity. With this in mind, make sure you wave and ask to be friends if you don't want to catch any fire from folks while you're snagging the beehive here.Find the beehive here.When you arrive to the location on the map above, you'll find a little shack. If you listen closely, you can probably hear the bees swarming nearby. Look under the roof on the side of the shack to spot the beehive and plenty of little bees flying around. Interact with it to add it to your inventory.Interact with the beehive to pick it up.With the beehive acquired, you'll need to extract and take back to Speranza to finish the Bees! quest. The Forest Airshaft is to your northwest, while the Overlook Airshaft can be visited by heading northeast. Head to whichever one is open based on how much time is left in the map, as they're both likely to be equally dangerous. Keep a lookout for rogue raiders and any patrolling ARC, hit the button, drop inside, and interact with the computer to get back to Speranza and finish things up.For more on Arc Raiders, we've compiled a full quest list for you.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

In the Espresso quest in Arc Raiders, you'll need to go topside and seek out an espresso maker from a cafe in Buried City. If you're wondering where exactly to go for this caffeine fix, we've got you covered.You'll need to extract from Buried City and return to Speranza with the espresso machine in your inventory to complete the mission, so it's smart to bring along an augment with a safe pocket to store the quest item in. A good gun and shield for protection can't hurt, either.When you're ready to get the espresso machine, follow the steps below.Where to find the espresso machine in Arc RaidersThe espresso machine is located in a cafe in Plaza Rosa in the southern portion of the Buried City map. This area is often swarming with ARC, so it can be a challenge to get in and out unnoticed, especially if you're also dealing with other raiders questing or looting in the vicinity. Don't be afraid to take things slow when approaching to stay unnoticed.Cafe locationThe cafe is a red building with a \"cafe\" sign just above the door.The cafe is a red building with a cafe sign above the door. Random raider falling out of the window not included.Head inside this building and check the counter for the espresso machine. Pick it up to add it to your inventory. Afterward, feel free to loot the cafe for any additional items before you extract.Pick up the espresso machine.With the espresso machine obtained, you'll now need to successfully extract with it if you want to complete the quest. You're in luck, though, because the Souther Station extraction point is literally right in front of the cafe. Just walk outside and drop (or zipline) down into the broken section of the ground, then press the button, wait for the train, and get out of the Buried City alive. You deserve a cup of coffee for all of that hard work.If you're stuck on anything else, we've got plenty more quest guides in our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                One of the last quests you'll receive in Arc Raiders' initial batch of launch quests is called Building a Library. This quest asks you to find and retrieve three books in the library in the Buried City and bring them back to Apollo at Speranza. Since these books are located in a high-traffic area, you'll want to know where to find them so you can quickly get in and get out before things get rough.It's important to note that you need to extract with all three books in a single raid to complete Building a Library. With this in mind, it's in your best interest to come equipped with a good shield, weapon, and plenty of ammo to ensure you're prepared for any engagements that may transpire as you're trying to get in and out of the library.Here's where to find all three books for Building a Library.Where to find the books for Building a LibraryThe three books you need to find are located in the Library POI on the Buried City map. You can find this location just above Marano Park in the northern section of the map.Library locationMarano Park and all of the areas that make up its perimeter are among the most high-traffic areas on any map in Arc Raiders, so it's important to be very alert and prepared for combat when entering the library. Asking other players to be friendly can often be successful here if you're playing solo, as they have as much to lose as you do, but expect a lot more resistance if you're running this quest with a team.Start on the bottom floor of the library and look for a small book cart in front of some taller shelves. Interact with it and it will drop the first book. Make sure to pick it up off the ground to add it to your inventory.Book location 1After picking up the first book, go up the stairs to reach the second floor. You'll find the second book on another small book cart against the back wall.Book location 2Lastly, walk past the second book cart and wrap around to the left a bit and take the third book from a book cart next to some fallen shelves.Book location 3With all of the books obtained, you'll need to extract with them in your inventory to complete Building a Library. The good news, though, is that you're directly beside an extraction point. Head outside the front of the library to run directly into the metro entrance leading to the Northern Station train. Keep an eye out for roaming ARC Pods and Fireballs in the metro station (and other raiders, too), then extract and take the books back to Apollo to wrap things up.For more, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jessica Cogswell\n   on January 9, 2026 at 10:24AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Turns out, 2026 is a huge year for video games. Part of this, of course, is because of all the games coming out this year. From Resident Evil: Requiem to Grand Theft Auto: 6, we've got a lot to look forward to. However, there's another thing to consider when looking at the year ahead: the staggering number of series with major anniversaries.It's hard to believe the first Donkey Kong game was released 45 years ago, and I swear I heard my knees crack as I realized that Pokemon is officially 30 years old. Nintendo in particular has a lot to celebrate this year, with big anniversaries for The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Kid Icarus, and Animal Crossing coming in addition to the games I mentioned previously. That said, both Sony and Xbox have reason to celebrate as well, as Tomb Raider turns 30 and Halo--and Xbox as a brand overall--hit 25.But perhaps the most exciting thing to consider in light of all these anniversaries are the announcements that could be lingering just around the corner. Though we've already received confirmation that a remake of the original Tomb Raider is in the works, and other series such as Donkey Kong, Pokemon, and Resident Evil all have new or upcoming entries, there are a few games on this list that have been dormant for some time. Could 2026 be the year we get a new Kid Icarus or Castlevania? No clue, but a girl can hope, right?So without further ado, is a round up of all the series with milestone anniversaries in 2026:Donkey Kong - July 9, 1981 (45th anniversary)The Legend of Zelda - February 21, 1986 (40th anniversary)Metroid - August 6, 1986 (40th anniversary)Dragon Quest - May 27, 1986 (40th anniversary)Kid Icarus - December 19, 1986 (40th anniversary)Castlevania - September 26, 1986 (40th anniversary)Sonic the Hedgehog - June 21, 1991 (35th anniversary)Persona - September 20, 1996 (30th anniversary)Pokemon - February 27, 1996 (30th anniversary)Resident Evil - March 22, 1996 (30th anniversary)Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons - August 9, 1996 (30th anniversary)Tomb Raider - October 24, 1996 (30th anniversary)Animal Crossing - December 14, 2001 (25th anniversary)Halo: Combat Evolved - November 15, 2001 (25th anniversary)Luigi's Mansion - September 14, 2001 (25th anniversary)Pikmin - October 26, 2001 (25th anniversary)Rune Factory - August 24, 2006 (20th anniversary)    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on January 9, 2026 at 11:02AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Well, this is different. Season 7 of Fortnite OG kicked off in December with a new OG pass--but unlike previous OG passes, half of this one was time-gated until January 9. The back half of the OG finally out now, and it turns out that Epic was just holding back additional styles for the skins in the first half of the pass. Sorry, everybody who got their hopes up (like we did) that a secret Ice King remix was coming.The Season 7 OG pass includes three remixes of skins from the Chapter 1 Season 7 battle pass--Voidwalker Lynx is unlocked instantly with a purchase of the pass, and you can earn Lt. Winter and Wonder Onesie by leveling up. Wonder Onesie has the most customization options of any OG pass skin thus far, as you can decorate her with any of the sprays or emoticons you have in your locker.Notably missing are the Ice King, who was Season 7's hero, and the Prisoner, who served as the season baddie. Midway through the original Season 7, the Ice King projected a gigantic magical phantom of himself standing over the island, and then unleashed a blizzard that coated the island in snow for several weeks. Presuming Fortnite OG will do that event again the way it has all the other Chapter 1 live events, it would make a lot of sense for a new Ice King skin to be on one of those hidden pages.Each of the three skins available in the Season 7 OG pass comes with a back bling, a pickaxe, a weapon wrap, a glider, and an emote. The pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and access to the pass is included while players are subscribed to Fortnite Crew, which costs $12 per month. Scroll on to see what you can unlock on the Season 7 OG pass.Skin: Voidwalker LynxWrap: Cosmic CatastropheBack Bling: Lynx's CatpackBanner IconPickaxe: Void Walker's ClawsSpray: Purrrfect ExecutionLoading Screen: Runic LungeEmote: A-Meow-Zing BeatEmoticon: Gift GrenadePickaxe: Festive CaneSpray: Oh DeerBack Bling: Winter King's BustWrap: Winter's GiftEmote: Llamacorn SleighLoading Screen: Winterfest SkirmishSkin: Lt.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders is all about looting and shooting your way through a map and hoping to make it back home safely to Speranza. Every moment counts, and every container in the game could end up having that item that makes all the stress of the run worth it. So, it makes sense you may be disappointed to come across a Security Breach locker you can't open. Anything at all could be in there just waiting for you to take it home, right? Well, you might need to put in some time to make it happen, but here's how you can get to opening Security Breach lockers in Arc Raiders.How to open Security Breach lockers in Arc RaidersBefore you'll be able to open any Security Breach lockers you stumble across, you'll first need to buy the aptly-named Security Breach skill from the skill tree. You can access the skill tree by selecting Raider > Skill Tree while in Speranza.The Security Breach skill is in the Survival path of the skill tree.The Security Breach skill is the final node in the Survival (red) path on the right of the skill tree. To unlock this skill, you'll need to place at least 36 points into the Survival path, which is a hefty investment. We'll get into whether it's worth it or not a bit further down.With the Security Breach skill unlocked, you can breach and search any Security Breach locker.Once you've purchased the Security Breach skill--presumably with your 37th skill point in the Survival path--you'll be able to breach any Security Breach locker in the game to have a look inside. You'll also now be able to search any of these lockers that have already been opened by other players--though it's not likely they've left much behind for you.Is the Security Breach skill worth it?Security Breach was once an invaluable skill, as Security Breach lockers very often contained purple weapons like Bobcats, Tempests, and Vulcanos. However, developer Embark nerfed this skill soon after launch to bring down the frequency at which these items dropped from the container. As such, it's worth asking whether it's still worth investing 37 total points into the Survival path of the skill tree.Security Breach lockers still often contain worthwhile loot despite the nerf.We'd argue it's still quite worth the investment to buy the Security Breach skill. While you won't find purple rarity weapons with nearly the same frequency, it's still a fantastic way to gain some fast and high-quality resources as you're looting throughout a map. These lockers will usually offer a green or blue gun, a few stacks of ammo, and a solid chance at gun parts or Mod Components. And, of course, there's still always a chance at one of those purple guns, so there's never harm in checking.Additionally, there are a lot of excellent skills in the Survival path that speed up looting, improve your weight limitations, and even allow for in-game crafting. With that in mind, you're not really wasting many skill points along the way to Security Breach.

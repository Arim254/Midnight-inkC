    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Diego Nicolás Argüello\n   on October 30, 2025 at 1:24PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                REPO is one of the biggest surprises of the year for horror fans. The new Monster Update, released on October 30, arrives just in time for the Halloween weekend.Amid the likes of Lethal Company and Peak, REPO offers fun and frights for up to 6 players online. Your task is to retrieve physics-based objects and handle them with care, all while trying to avoid an assortment of terrifying monsters.As the name implies, you can expect a cast of new enemies to contend with. But that's far from the only significant addition available with the update. We've listed all major elements and improvements below, and you can also find the full patch notes at the bottom of the list. In case you're looking for more info, we also have a list covering the best REPO mods and how to install them.New enemiesYes, it is indeed in the name of the patch for a reason. The Monster Update adds a whopping 10 new enemies to REPO. Some highlights include a creepy, tall humanoid with a stretched-out face, a stationary plant-looking creature that can trap you and suck you into its mouth to deal damage, and a dog. No, really. Make sure to pet them, though. You've been warned.New upgradesUpgrades don't make up the bulk of this update, but the additions are definitely relevant. Death Head Battery adds a battery that recharges while you're dead--you can spend its charge to possess your head and interact with the living. Then, Tumble Grab is fairly self-explanatory, as you can now grab objects, items, and weapons while tumbled.New map-specific valuables and roomsIf you were expecting new valuables, you're in luck, as the Monster update adds dozens of them. The update also makes a substantial change in how they work, however--now, all levels have unique valuables, and there's no sharing between levels anymore. In total, Swift Broom Academy gets 24 new valuables, Headman Manor gets eight, and McJannek Station gets 22.Moreover, you'll encounter new rooms: 20 for the Museum of Human Art, two for Headman Manor, and one for Swiftbroom Academy.Lots of smaller settings and additionsAlongside the biggest additions, there are smaller tweaks that will nonetheless impact your experience in various ways. For starters, Truck Chat has more Tax Man messages, and there's a new setting called \"Item Unequip Auto Hold,\" which you can use to toggle auto grab for unequipped items. It defaults to \"on\" for existing players and \"off\" for new players, so check your settings.There's also a new addition to the save menu, called \"Restore from Backup,\" that allows you to recover corrupted save files from the latest backup. Oh, and you can now name your save files.Lastly, some social integrations are now in effect. On Steam, rich presence now shows the current level name and level number, and friends in the same lobby appear as a group. On Discord, you can now see and join your friends' games directly from the app. Neat.Full REPO Monster Update Patch NotesCHANGESValuables - All levels now have unique valuables, no sharing between levels anymore!Music - Updated Main Menu music!Ambience - Many rooms now feature new ambient sounds.Player Damage - Players are now immune during level outro animation.Upgrade Crouch Rest - Now also triggers when in Tumble state and stationary.Truck Chat - Displays remaining Extractions instead of money left when trying to leave early, and hints at multiple Extractions if the next point is inactive.Truck Healer - Now activates after final extraction fully completes.Water - Non-lethal water appears less radioactive.Headman Manor - Added window curtains and new flooring to some modules.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 30, 2025 at 4:35PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Are you baffled by the requirements to complete The Last Voyage of the ACS Free Market in The Outer Worlds 2? This quest takes place in Free Market Station, which houses several vendors with awesome wares. Still, there's a mystery to solve, as well as a rather perplexing segment known as Otto's Puzzle.Investigating Free Market Station and Otto's PuzzleYou'll be able to travel to Free Market Station after completing the main objective in Paradise Island and the Vox Relay. Upon arriving at the location, you'll see two people--Guard Seybold and Archivist Stallworth--having an argument. Chat with them to start the quest.Note: The goal in this particular mission is to collect information for Stallworth regarding a crashed ship. Stallworth has three questions for you, and you'll receive additional dialogue responses if you're able to conduct your investigation thoroughly. All of these tasks have skill checks, too, so make sure you've selected the best skills in the game.Otto's Information: Part 1 - Engineering skill check or purchasesFor The Outer Worlds 2 Last Voyage of the ACS Free Market quest, you'll want to go to the vendor area to find an NPC named Otto Riesling. He's the proprietor of the Oddments and Gubbin stall. There are three methods to get the information that you need:Pass the Engineering 5 skill check.Purchase approximately 1,000 bits worth of items and select the dialogue response.The third and final method also nets you extra rewards, but there's an issue with it. (More on this below.)Otto's Information: Part 2 - Otto's PuzzleOtto's Puzzle in The Outer Worlds 2 is downright perplexing. Here's what you need to know:From your ship's landing area, keep left until you see a Rift Anomaly. Go through the crawlspace, then make another turn and climb the ladder.You'll see a note next to several switches that you can interact with, but you won't actually notice anything out of the ordinary with your naked eye.If you want to see the invisible wirings, you need to acquire the N-Ray Scanner gadget, which comes from the Golden Ridge region. You automatically obtain it as part of the main quest arc in that zone, but it's definitely a long trek.Assuming you already have the N-Ray Scanner, just activate it while looking at Otto's Puzzle. You'll notice the purple wires connecting each of the switches. Here are the steps:You have to make the lights from top to bottom light up in sequence. That means pulling the levers in the correct order--i.e. from right to left--based on how they're connected via the wires.For the topmost row, that means interacting with: 1A and 1B at the top, followed by 1C (the second from the left in the middle row), then 1D (the leftmost switch in the bottom row).Do the same for the two other segments once they light up, all without pressing a switch a second time.There's just one problem: This puzzle seems to be bugged at the moment. We were able to complete it during our initial playthrough a few days ago. Unfortunately, it seems a recent patch has caused issues, as has been reported by other players. In any case, you can make a mental note regarding the Otto's Puzzle location so you can return later on.ACS Free Market Crash Site InformationYou can glean additional information while in the junkyard near the puzzle area. There are two ruined sections that you can investigate:One requires the Brawny trait or Sneak 5.The other requires Engineering 8.Prospero Paolo's InformationYou can also talk to an NPC named Prospero Paolo for The Outer Worlds 2 Last Voyage of the ACS Free Market quest. You'll find him in the 2nd Choice saloon just past the vendor area.Before Prospero Paolo divulges anything, you need to hand over a bottle of Iceberg Aged Whisky. This item comes from a nearby bar with an NPC named Chef de Mechanique. Unfortunately, Chef de Mechanique won't sell the item because Prospero is asking for it.One option is to pass the Hack 3 skill check when talking to Chef de Mechanique.Another option is to go through the crawlspace outside the bar. This allows you to stealthily open the safe behind the NPC as long as you have Lockpick 5.Sub Rosa Archive InformationFinally, you can gather more info from the Sub Rosa Archive, which is in the cellar below the 2nd Choice saloon. This can be accessed by going through the ventilation shaft at the bar/club area. Alternatively, if you've already completed the quest to recruit a companion named Tristan, then this section should be open.Down below, you'll find a Sub Rosa guard who's sleeping next to a locked terminal:You can brute force the terminal password if you have Hack 8.Alternatively, if you selected the Lockpick - Pickpocket perk, you can steal the document from the guard.Lastly, depending on your Sneak skill, you can just waylay the guard while they're asleep.How to respond to Archivist StallworthNow that you've gathered the information that you need, it's time to chat with Archivist Stallworth. Here are some important caveats:Stallworth has three questions:  How did the ACS Free Market meet its end?What occurred in the ship's final moments?Were there any contributing factors to the crash?As mentioned earlier, the info you've collected should add new dialogue options to each of these questions. You can pick any of these options to gain bonus bits and XP.However, you should also avoid the choosing uncertain responses, such as:  Question 2 reply: \"A lot of screaming and running around, probably?\"Question 2 reply: \"[Sickly] I don't want to think about it.\"Question 3 reply: \"Uh, not sure.\"Question 3 reply: \"[Lie] I'm pretty sure the ship was sabotaged by the Order.\"When you're done, Stallworth will thank you for your efforts. There are a couple of dialogue options that yield bonus reputation with the Sub Rosa faction.Note that there's one reply that you shouldn't pick: \"[Attack] Nobody uses me. Prepare to die.\" This causes Stallworth, along with other guards, to turn hostile. This leads to a major reputation drop with the Sub Rosa faction, which is kind of a pointless outcome.What about Guard Seybold's safe?Now, you might be curious as to what happened to Guard Seybold. After all, she's the one being rude to Archivist Stallworth at the start of the quest.Well, if you check the small building to the right of the ship's landing pad, you should see a large safe. Open the adjacent room and crouch/stealthily approach Seybold who has her back turned. If you have the Pickpocket perk, you can grab the key without being detected. Use it to unlock Seybold's Safe to earn additional bits and XP. Oh, and don't forget to take the collectible card on the desk as well.That about does it for our guide on The Last Voyage of the ACS Free Market quest in The Outer Worlds 2. Note that many other quests can be found in various regions. Examples include Pursuit of Purloined Propaganda, Pursuit of the Partite Pentaptych, and Hazard a Gas.Black market smugglers? Autocratic regimes? Rampaging Raptidons? Invisible cultists that can only be seen if you wear special goggles? These shenanigans need not cause any alarm because we've got you covered in our The Outer Worlds 2 guides hub.    \n  \n                      "

This side quest takes place in the Golden Ridge region of Dorado. A chance meeting with an NPC takes you on a trek all across the zone, all to look for tiny items called Compression Coils.Where to find all 15 Compression Coils in the Golden RidgeThe Hazard a Gas quest comes from an NPC named Sr. Contract Medicalist Cormier. You can find him in a camp known as Outpost Opportunity, which is closer to the northern part of the region.Cormier wants you to gather Compression Coils, of which there are 15 in total. These have been left lying around in drop pods/escape pods that have crashed everywhere in Golden Ridge. Now, once you begin the quest proper, only the first location will be marked on your map. The rest won't appear even if you're tracking the mission.Golden Ridge Compression Coil locations mapDon't worry, though, because we've got you covered when it comes to The Outer Worlds 2 Hazard a Gas quest. The map above shows the locations of Cormier/Outpost Opportunity and the 15 Compression Coils.We've numbered these locations accordingly based on the first area that showed up on our map. In some cases, you might find only one item in that particular spot. In others, you could stumble upon clusters of two or more of these items.Compression Coil location #1This will probably be the only Compression Coil location that gets marked on your map as you're tracking the quest. It's inside a pod due north of the Scrappers' Den fast travel point/enemy camp. There's one item that you can pick up here.Compression Coil location #2You can pick up yet another Compression Coil for The Outer Worlds 2 Hazard a Gas quest by heading to the Decommissioned Autonomous Extractorium. It's the facility where you get to recruit a companion named Aza. If you walk to the west, you should see some abandoned camps. Beyond that area is another crashed pod. You can pick up one more item here.Compression Coil location #3To get additional Compression Coils in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll want to check the aforementioned Decommissioned Autonomous Extractorium. To the south of that facility, you'll see a ruined tram railway. Make sure you've already unlocked the double jump ability because you're going to need it.Keep hopping across the gaps until you reach the towering rock formation. At the very top of the structure, you'll spot another pod. Just watch out because there are several Mantiwasp and Mega Mantisaur enemies. Take out the hostile creatures and grab two coils. Note that this location also happens to have a High Security Lockbox that contains a unique item.Compression Coil location #4The next drop pod is due northwest of Alexandra Station, so you have to loop around to reach it. Eventually, you'll stumble upon a cavern that's crawling with Verachnids. Kill them so you don't end up getting attacked while you're looting the three coils from the structure.Compression Coil location #5You'll find two more Compression Coils in a pod just outside Matriarch's Mercy. This settlement is where you progress the main quest in this region.Compression Coil location #6All right, let's go ahead and pick up some extra Compression Coils in The Outer Worlds 2. The next set of items all come from the northern part of Golden Ridge.Make your way to the west of Fort Endurance. You should see some corporate hireling NPCs guarding the pass:Two coils are inside the pod itself.Another coil is next to a cleaner NPC's corpse just outside the pod.Compression Coil location #7If you go east and north of Fort Endurance, you'll notice a section that's covered in murky Zyranium gas. Activate your Gas-Energy Deflection Apparatus gadget, then quickly rush to the pod to pick up two more coils.Compression Coil location #8The last location is well to the northeast. It's fairly close to the Mantisaur Nest and the small camp with scientist NPCs. The pod itself, which contains one coil, has crashed on a small rock formation. You can reach it by going to the back and jumping up the ledges. Beware of Verachnid mobs that have made this area their home though.Hazard a Gas rewardsAssuming you've found all 15 Compression Coils in The Outer Worlds 2, return to Medicalist Cormier and hand over the items. For your efforts, you'll receive a lot of XP and around 1,500x bits/currency. Cormier will also give you the following:1x Trauma Kit1x AC Adreno Infusion Starter Plus (unique primer)1x Light Pistol Plasma Barrel (both the mod and the crafting blueprint)1x Sentience (unique armor) - This has the Regenerative mod, which causes you to restore health from 30% of the damage that you take each time.That does it for our guide on how to complete Hazard a Gas in The Outer Worlds 2. Given the reward, you might be curious as to the locations of other unique armors in the game. Also, since you're already exploring Golden Ridge, you probably want to tackle other objectives, such as Pursuit of Partite Pentaptych and the Alexandra Monastery Riddle.Black market smugglers? Autocratic regimes? Rampaging Raptidons? Invisible cultists that can only be seen if you wear special goggles? These shenanigans need not cause any alarm because we've got you covered in our The Outer Worlds 2 guides hub.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's been a busy week for industry speculation after Geoff Keighley started posting about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later moved into Los Angeles. Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing.Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or Lords of the Fallen 2 were all shot down by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian.A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by MP1st, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3, meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.The logos trademarked bear a striking resemblance to the monolith's imagery.A recent PlayStation Store database leak revealed that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is getting a Definitive Edition release on the PS5, but it's likely that the statue and the new trademark filings relate to a brand new title in the Divinity series.The Game Awards is not far away now, airing on December 11 live from Los Angeles. Despite being over two years old now, Larian's Baldur's Gate 3 is up for an award again, earning another nomination for Best Community Support. This year's frontrunner looks to be Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which earned a record-breaking 12 nominations. Plenty of worthy games also failed to make the cut: check out our list of The Game Awards' biggest snubs for 2025.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n          \n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n    \n              \n          \n                With the latest Roblox craze, The Forge, there is just so much content to dig into that it’s tough to know where to begin. Thankfully, we’re here to mark a big X on the right spot for you, breaking down the best of the best when it comes to weapons and races in this underground escapade. So if you’re yearning to explore further in the mine, then our tier lists covering weapons, pickaxes, and races will help.The Forge Weapon Tier ListAs you explore the depths of The Forge, it is very important to pack a formidable weapon, so you can wipe out enemies and grab yourself even more exclusive ore. Ore what? Well, we wouldn’t like to say. So avoid wiping out and waking up on the surface, with our The Forge weapon tier list below:TierThe Forge WeaponSComically Large Spoon, Crusader Sword, Double Battle Axe, Dragon Slayer, Scythe, Skull Crusher,ABoxing Gloves, Cutlass, Chaos, Great Sword, Hammer, Relevator, TachiBFalchion Sword, Gladius Daggers, Iron Hand, UchigatanaCDagger, Falchion Knife, Hook, RapierThe Forge Pickaxe Tier ListWeapons are just half the battle in The Forge, as when you chip away at the walls, you will need a strong pickaxe if you hope to mine those rare ores. So, get ready to gear up and grab some of the finest minerals this side of the surface with our The Forge pickaxe tier list, below:TierThe Forge PickaxeSArcane Pickaxe, Demonic Pickaxe, Magma PickaxeACobalt Pickaxe, Mythril Pickaxe, Lightite Pickaxe, Titanium Pickaxe, Uranium PickaxeBPlatinum Pickaxe, Stonewake’s Pickaxe, Golden PickaxeCIron Pickaxe, Bronze Pickaxe, Stone PickaxeThe Forge Race Tier ListThe Forge has quite a lot of depth (sorry), and while your weapon and pickaxe are crucial for picking up the best resources and smashing enemies, you also need to consider your race. These determine which buffs you have, which can make all the difference as you explore. Plus, much like real life, we wouldn’t advise being human.TierThe Forge RaceSAngel, DemonADragonborn, Dwarf, GolemBMinotaur, Shadow, OrcCElf, Goblin, Human, Undead, Zombie\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

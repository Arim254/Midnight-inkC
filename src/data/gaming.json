    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jessica Cogswell\n   on January 9, 2026 at 10:24AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Turns out, 2026 is a huge year for video games. Part of this, of course, is because of all the games coming out this year. From Resident Evil: Requiem to Grand Theft Auto: 6, we've got a lot to look forward to. However, there's another thing to consider when looking at the year ahead: the staggering number of series with major anniversaries.It's hard to believe the first Donkey Kong game was released 45 years ago, and I swear I heard my knees crack as I realized that Pokemon is officially 30 years old. Nintendo in particular has a lot to celebrate this year, with big anniversaries for The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Kid Icarus, and Animal Crossing coming in addition to the games I mentioned previously. That said, both Sony and Xbox have reason to celebrate as well, as Tomb Raider turns 30 and Halo--and Xbox as a brand overall--hit 25.But perhaps the most exciting thing to consider in light of all these anniversaries are the announcements that could be lingering just around the corner. Though we've already received confirmation that a remake of the original Tomb Raider is in the works, and other series such as Donkey Kong, Pokemon, and Resident Evil all have new or upcoming entries, there are a few games on this list that have been dormant for some time. Could 2026 be the year we get a new Kid Icarus or Castlevania? No clue, but a girl can hope, right?So without further ado, is a round up of all the series with milestone anniversaries in 2026:Donkey Kong - July 9, 1981 (45th anniversary)The Legend of Zelda - February 21, 1986 (40th anniversary)Metroid - August 6, 1986 (40th anniversary)Dragon Quest - May 27, 1986 (40th anniversary)Kid Icarus - December 19, 1986 (40th anniversary)Castlevania - September 26, 1986 (40th anniversary)Sonic the Hedgehog - June 21, 1991 (35th anniversary)Persona - September 20, 1996 (30th anniversary)Pokemon - February 27, 1996 (30th anniversary)Resident Evil - March 22, 1996 (30th anniversary)Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons - August 9, 1996 (30th anniversary)Tomb Raider - October 24, 1996 (30th anniversary)Animal Crossing - December 14, 2001 (25th anniversary)Halo: Combat Evolved - November 15, 2001 (25th anniversary)Luigi's Mansion - September 14, 2001 (25th anniversary)Pikmin - October 26, 2001 (25th anniversary)Rune Factory - August 24, 2006 (20th anniversary)    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.\"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,\" said Roh via Reuters. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be \"inevitable.\"The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing \"This Is an Xbox\" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.The lone bright spot from Roh's comments is that he mentioned that Samsung is working with its production partners on strategies to minimize the impact of the memory shortages.A recent report suggests that Nvidia may take a different approach to the increasingly high GPU prices by resurrecting its previously discontinued GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs. That has yet to be confirmed by Nvidia, which phased out the GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs in favor of the 40 and 50 series GPUs, both of which were more expensive and more advanced.As for Samsung, the company touted its plans to use Google's Gemini AI in 800 million units this year, which will continue the need for RAM across its family of products.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Electronic Arts' $55 billion deal to sell itself to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake still has to receive regulatory approval before it's finalized. However, some Sims fans and creators have been concerned about how Saudi Arabi's potential control over the company will affect the inclusive nature of the experience. To alleviate those concerns, the developers behind The Sims franchise wants players to know their core values haven't been changed by this deal.\"The values of The Sims are unchanged,\" reads the statement on the franchise's official page. \"Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future.\"Given Saudi Arabi's history of human rights abuses, the worried reactions from The Sims community appear to be understandable. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have both raised their concerns about \"foreign influence\" on EA if the deal goes through. Subsequently, EA has asserted that it will retain creative control of the company following the sale.The Sims team's statement also reaffirmed its commitment \"to single-player life simulation experiences\" while teasing upcoming Sims experiences for PC, consoles, and mobile games. Playtesting for those experiences is expected to begin this year. The team also stated that, \"Project Rene has evolved into a social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game,\" and it's not intended to be a successor to The Sims 4. Instead, it's described as \"a new way to explore and play together within the growing Sims family of games, welcoming Simmers who want to connect directly with other players.\"Last year, EA said that it's sold too much DLC for The Sims 4 to even consider moving on to The Sims 5. The franchise also has a Sims movie in development, which is being produced by Margot Robbie's Lucky Chap production studio.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

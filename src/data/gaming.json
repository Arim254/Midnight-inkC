Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.In a message posted to the official Halo site, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on \"multiple Halo titles in development.\" This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been saying for over a year now that there are multiple new Halo games in development.\"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us,\" reads the statement. \"While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.\"The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of the original Halo that will bring the franchise to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about a live-service Halo game, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed some light on the Halo MMO from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the Halo remake \"warms my heart,\" while another former Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fortnite Battle Royale will return to a more typical experience once the current Simpsons mini-season ends at the end of November, according to a blog posted on the Fortnite Status Twitter account, with the game slated to return to 100-player rounds and a much roomier island.The launch of Fortnite's Simpsons-themed mini-season at the beginning of November introduced some dramatic changes to the rhythm of Battle Royale matches, thanks largely to the size of the map. The new Springfield island covers about half the land area that the Chapter 6 island did, with the mode temporarily supporting 80 players instead of 100. That's made the island extraordinarily dense with players, and it's been tough to land in any named location at the start of a match without bumping into an opponent trying to grab the same chest you're going for.The blog said that fundamental shift in the flow of matches was an experiment.\"Here's something different: this season’s BR is 80 players instead of 100 on the more compact map. The vibe so far? Faster rotations, more meaningful fights, and less time running across empty fields. This is an experiment--we plan to return to 100 players next season--but we wanted to see what happens when we concentrate the action.\"That wasn't the only big piece of news we got from this blog. For this Saturday and Sunday only, Epic is adding two Simpsons-themed weapons--the Deodorant Applicator, and Bart's Slingshot--to the Battle Royale loot pool. This is another unusual thing Epic is trying during this mini-season, as the company debuted those weapons last weekend in Delulu mode.Fortnite's Simpsons season is live until November 29, when Chapter 7 will begin.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                One of the last quests you'll receive in Arc Raiders' initial batch of launch quests is called Building a Library. This quest asks you to find and retrieve three books in the library in the Buried City and bring them back to Apollo at Speranza. Since these books are located in a high-traffic area, you'll want to know where to find them so you can quickly get in and get out before things get rough.It's important to note that you need to extract with all three books in a single raid to complete Building a Library. With this in mind, it's in your best interest to come equipped with a good shield, weapon, and plenty of ammo to ensure you're prepared for any engagements that may transpire as you're trying to get in and out of the library.Here's where to find all three books for Building a Library.Where to find the books for Building a LibraryThe three books you need to find are located in the Library POI on the Buried City map. You can find this location just above Marano Park in the northern section of the map.Library locationMarano Park and all of the areas that make up its perimeter are among the most high-traffic areas on any map in Arc Raiders, so it's important to be very alert and prepared for combat when entering the library. Asking other players to be friendly can often be successful here if you're playing solo, as they have as much to lose as you do, but expect a lot more resistance if you're running this quest with a team.Start on the bottom floor of the library and look for a small book cart in front of some taller shelves. Interact with it and it will drop the first book. Make sure to pick it up off the ground to add it to your inventory.Book location 1After picking up the first book, go up the stairs to reach the second floor. You'll find the second book on another small book cart against the back wall.Book location 2Lastly, walk past the second book cart and wrap around to the left a bit and take the third book from a book cart next to some fallen shelves.Book location 3With all of the books obtained, you'll need to extract with them in your inventory to complete Building a Library. The good news, though, is that you're directly beside an extraction point. Head outside the front of the library to run directly into the metro entrance leading to the Northern Station train. Keep an eye out for roaming ARC Pods and Fireballs in the metro station (and other raiders, too), then extract and take the books back to Apollo to wrap things up.For more, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

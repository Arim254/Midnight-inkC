He's now reacted to receiving that nomination, saying he is thrilled, but also making it clear that the credit ought to go to the performance-capture actor, Maxence Cazorla.\"I am thrilled for this nomination,\" Cox said at the La Conve/Animex event in Mexico recently. \"There is an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game. Any nomination, or any credit I get, I have to give to him. I believe the performance of that character is really down to him and my voice was just a part of that process.\"Cox was nominated for Best Performance alongside two other Expedition 33 actors, including Ben Starr and Jennifer English. Erika Ishii was nominated for Ghost of Yotei, Konatsu Kato for Silent Hill f, and Troy Baker for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.Expedition 33 led all others this year with 12 total nominations, including a nod for Game of the Year. With 12 nominations, that makes it the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards.The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, but it's expected there will be teases ahead of that, so keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The news was confirmed by Kier's partner Delbert McBride via Variety.With hundreds of film and TV credits spanning decades, Kier rose to fame in horror films like Mark of the Devil, Flesh for Frankenstein, and Blood for Dracula in the '70s. His breakthrough Hollywood role came in 1991's My Own Private Idaho, and he'd go on to appear in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Johnny Mnemonic, Armageddon, and Madonna music videos.In recent years, Kier was one of the actors set to appear in Hideo Kojima's upcoming horror game OD. Game director Hideo Kojima wrote online that new scenes featuring the actor were scheduled to be filmed in 2026, and that he'd kept in touch with him regularly.\"I'm at a loss for words,\" Kojima said in a social media post. \"It all happened far too suddenly. Because of the strike, we weren't able to shoot OD for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year.\"I’m at a loss for words.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Bethesda did a shadowdrop for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered earlier this year, and it was a big success. Another Bethesda-published game, Hi-Fi Rush, had a shadowdrop as well. Now, Bethesda Game Studios director Tom Mustaine is openly calling for more releases of this type in the future from other developers across the industry.Speaking to GamesRadar, Mustaine said the shadowdrop approach is a favorite of Bethesda boss Todd Howard, and releasing games like this can be a way to reach players who may have short attention spans.\"We all have short attention spans now,\" he said. \"There's Grand Theft Auto, for example. I want that today, right? So it is an interesting strategy ... I don't have any ideas of what would be next, but I hope it's not the last. Personally, I think it was great to own the internet for that day and, you know, give people exactly what they want the moment we talk about it. I'm a fan of that personally, but I'd love to see more people do it.\"Oblivion Remastered was technically a shadowdrop because it was released on the same day that it was announced, but the game wasn't a total surprise to everyone. After all, the existence of the game had leaked years earlier. The same 2023 leak said a Fallout 3 remaster was planned, and a recent report said this game is still in the works.Speaking to GQ earlier this year, Howard said he's a big fan of announcing games and releasing them shortly thereafter, and this has contributed to people believing the rumored Fallout 3 remaster could be a shadowdrop. He would also like for The Elder Scrolls 6 to \"just appear\" one day.\"I like to just announce stuff and release it. My perfect version--and I'm not saying this is going to happen--is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear,\" he said.Next up for Bethesda is the Burning Springs update for Fallout 76, which releases on December 2. It adds Walton Goggins' The Ghoul from the Prime Video TV series, which itself returns for its second season on December 17.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

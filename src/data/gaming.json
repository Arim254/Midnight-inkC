    "body": "\n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                GameSpot's mothersite, Fandom, released its list of the top franchises of 2025, with Roblox ranking number 1 overall after rising from the number 10 spot in 2024. Gaming continued to take most of the top spots, as fans spent more time in interactive worlds that are constantly updated, like Minecraft and Terraria. In film and TV, long-running franchises like Star Wars and Marvel stayed near the top thanks to new releases like Andor and Thunderbolts.The rankings were determined using Fandom's franchise factor score, which combines five things: worldbuilding, strong reviews, loyal fans, cultural impact, and consistency. It uses Fandom's large fan data to give a full picture of how popular and important a franchise is in entertainment and gaming.Anime also had a big year in large part because of high-profile films and celebrations. Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle brought huge attention as it moved the series toward its finale, while Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc kept momentum high between seasons. There was also the relative newcomer Dan Da Dan, which saw its second theatrical adaptation with Evil Eye.The rankings also show a shift away from single launch moments toward steady output. According to Fandom's study, Roblox's top placement reflects how fans now prefer platforms with constant updates and community-created content. Smaller Roblox games, such as Dandy’s World and Grow a Garden, ranked higher than well-established worlds like Minecraft and Disney by focusing on frequent events and active, niche communities.The same pattern appeared elsewhere with franchises such as Dungeons and Dragons and Cookie Run Kingdom performed well by releasing content regularly, showing that consistency mattered more than occasional peaks in attention."

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nBy \n    Eddie Makuch\n   on December 17, 2025 at 1:13PM PST\n              \n          \n                The Harry Potter game Hogwarts Legacy has now sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it among the best-selling games of all time.Warner Bros. Games made the announcement today, December 17, amid its parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's sale to Netflix, or Paramount. At 40 million sales, the game is a smash hit, but not quite close enough to break into the top 10 best-selling games ever. Hogwarts Legacy was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Games through its Portkey Games label, which handles Harry Potter games for the company.Hogwarts Legacy is set in the 1800s with players coming to Hogwarts as a fifth-year student as they learn spells and tame magical creatures. The game outsold Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III in North America in 2023, and that's a rare thing given how dominant Call of Duty has been.Unsurprisingly, Warner Bros. Games has said making a sequel is a major priority for the company, though the follow-up has yet to be formally announced. Another major fantasy franchise, Lord of the Rings, is said to be getting a Hogwarts Legacy-style game in the future. Hogwarts Legacy has been embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community. In this article, you will also find links to trans creators you can support, as well as charities you can donate to.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this year, Silent Hill f became the first game in the series to ditch the small American town that the series was named for in favor of setting it in Japan decades earlier. That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto.\"We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe,\" Okamoto told Inverse through a translator. \"For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further.\"Okamoto appears to have put the most thought into the Central and South American locations, which he said have \"been affected by a lot of military governments and coups,\" before adding, \"There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There’s also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs.\"However, Okamoto noted that Konami potentially partnering with a development studio in Central and South America for a Silent Hill game may be difficult because the region doesn't have many to choose from. But he didn't rule it out. Okamoto recently credited memes and fan art for keeping Silent Hill f trending months after its release. An update for that game also added a new casual difficulty and a skip feature for new game plus. Meanwhile, the Silent Hill 2 remake appears to have been quietly confirmed for Xbox Series X|S. Microsoft and Konami have yet to announce a release for that port. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

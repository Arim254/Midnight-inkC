    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Is the Nintendo Switch 2 going to see a price increase? Nintendo has said that is possible, but for now, the company believes it can maintain the current level of profitability for the console, and as such, a price hike doesn't sound likely.Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said this during Nintendo's latest earnings briefing, but admitted that if there are \"significant changes in external factors,\" such as new tariffs or \"other unexpected events,\" then the discussion could change.Another part of the equation as it relates to Switch 2 pricing is that, while some manufacturing materials are going up in price, some parts of the production process could get less costly as time goes on and Nintendo's mass production efforts continue to ramp up, Furukawa said.\"Therefore, currently we do not expect the recent rise in material costs to greatly impact profitability. We will continue our efforts to maintain the same level of profitability as we currently have,\" he said.Earlier this year, Nintendo raised the price of the original Switch in the US and warned that the Switch 2 could see a price hike. Meanwhile, the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles saw price increases this year stateside as well, due in part to US President Donald Trump's controversial tariff plan.With more than 154 million units sold, the Switch is about to pass the Nintendo DS to become Nintendo's best-selling platform ever. The Switch 2, meanwhile, is putting up big numbers and has climbed past 10 million sales in four months.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Activision has announced a new perk to help encourage people to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at release. The company is giving everyone five hours of double XP for player progression and five hours of double XP for weapons if they play Black Ops 7 before Season 1.Activision has not announced when Black Ops 7 Season 1 will begin, but it's expected in early December. For comparison, 2024's Black Ops 6 launched on October 25, with its first season arriving on November 14, which was a period of about three weeks.If a similar schedule holds for Black Ops 7, players can expect Season 1 to begin in early December following Black Ops 7's release on November 14. A new season will have more content to unlock, so having double XP is a nice perk to help unlock all the new stuff.Black Ops 7 is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC, and it'll be available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. Those two tiers of the Game Pass subscription service recently saw significant price hikes. Most major retailers have not adopted the price hike, though, as Game Pass Ultimate remains $20 at GameStop, Amazon, Best Buy, and others.For more, be sure to read GameSpot's Black Ops 7 preorder guide to find which version of the game is right for you on your preferred platform.You can also check out GameSpot's breakdown of everything coming to Black Ops 7 multiplayer at launch and a rundown of the PC system requirements.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The entire video game industry is currently preoccupied by Grand Theft Auto 6. Regardless of when it arrives, the next GTA is going to be a blockbuster no matter what Rockstar's competitors do. In fact, Saints Row designer Chris Stockman believes that there is no competing with GTA anymore.\"You have to be something else,\" said Stockman during an appearance on FRVR's podcast. \"You can't compete with them anymore. You can't. It's impossible. You can't make a Western game and try to compete with Red Dead.\"Stockman went on to describe GTA Online's continued success as a \"lifestyle\" that has \"propelled it to be beyond just a game.\" Instead of trying to take GTA's crown, Stockman suggested that there's room for someone to be the No. 2 game like GTA.\"The industry is bigger than its ever been in the sense that people hunger for games,\" said Stockman. \"People hunger for new experiences. I think it's entirely possible to be a number two, there's nothing wrong with trying to be a number two if you play your cards right. You don't go crazy, you be very focused, you don't look at GTA as a North Star and say, 'I wanna be that.' You have a clear identity and this is what you're trying to do. And you don't have to be a 100 hour masterpiece, and you just gotta be smart about it.\"Stockman recently disclosed that he has been asked to pitch a Saints Row sequel, but that project hasn't fully come together yet. The most recent game in the series was the 2022 Saints Row reboot.For the time being, there are no new Saints Row games officially in the works, and the wait for GTA 6 is now much longer, a fact that fans online haven't been happy about. Barring another release date change, Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 19, 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

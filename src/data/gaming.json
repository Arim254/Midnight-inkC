It's not the only Bethesda adaptation coming to Amazon's streaming service--a Wolfenstein show is coming as well--and some fans are hoping to see The Elder Scrolls game follow. Bethesda's Todd Howard--who has worked as a producer on Fallout and Elder Scrolls titles--won't rule out the possibility that it could happen. But don't expect an Elder Scrolls series anytime soon.While speaking with Eurogamer, Howard said that he \"can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future,\" before adding that he thought Fallout was more suitable as an adaptation because it had \"more to say in its genre.\"\"But you never know,\" added Howard. \"I think the impact of the show on Fallout as a franchise has been bigger than I expected, so it does make you think like, 'Hey, is there a path?' But nothing today… [and] I'm willing to say 'no' for a decade.\"Howard related that it took over a decade to bring Fallout to live-action, and \"people were asking to do a movie or show for Fallout\" since Fallout 3 was released in 2008. When asked about Bethesda's live-action Wolfenstein series on Prime Video, Howard said it wasn't his place to talk about it and added that any word will come from MachineGames, the Bethesda-owned developer behind the reboot of the Wolfenstein games.During another recent interview, Howard expressed regret that he announced The Elder Scrolls 6 in 2018. He also stated that the much-anticipated sequel is, \"still a long way off.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fallout Season 2 is just around the corner, and Amazon Prime Video has largely kept this season's storyline a secret. But there's one thing we can be reasonably certain about: Ella Purnell's Lucy won't be having a romance with Walton Goggins' Ghoul now or ever.During an interview with Geek Culture, Purnell was with Goggins and Aaron Moten when she shot down the very idea of a love affair between Lucy and the Ghoul.\"Here's what I would say: you guys need therapy,\" said Purnell. \"You can't fix him. You can't save him. Let it go. Let it go, hon.\"Goggins expressed surprise at the fan-shipping between Lucy and the Ghoul, while Purnell said she's asked about it all of the time.Following the first season finale, the Ghoul and Lucy are heading for New Vegas. He's looking for the location of his wife and child, while Lucy is searching for her father.Purnell reiterated that Lucy and The Ghoul won't be romantic partners, but she did say that their bond is a \"really beautiful thing\" before adding, \"they're both looking for the people that they love. Let's leave it at that.\"Although Goggins recently lent his voice and likeness as the Ghoul to Fallout '76, he added that he has never played the Fallout video games and doesn't want to.Fallout Season 2 will premiere on December 17 on Prime Video, with new episodes released weekly through February 4, 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Game Awards are coming up soon, and now host and organizer Geoff Keighley is hyping the event with some kind of real-world teaser campaign for something people believe is connected to Diablo. Others do not believe it is connected to Diablo. Some think it's for the next God of War game. Still others think it could be for The Elder Scrolls 6 or Lords of the Fallen 2. All of these suggestions may be wrong, however.On November 28, Keighley posted the tex \"regal.inspiring.thickness\" along with an image of some kind of huge carving featuring humanoid people in the middle of a desert. On November 29, Keighley followed up with a Google Maps image showing the location of the marketing monolith in the California desert. People quickly found the spot and posted images and video, including the ones below. Then on December 5, Keighley posted yet another teaser, this one also very puzzling.Here's the message: \"The █████ are silent. █████ bleeds. New █████ stir.\"The █████ are silent. █████ bleeds. New █████ stir.  — The Game Awards (@thegameawards) December 5, 2025\n  Windows Central reporter Jez Corden said the teaser is related to an upcoming Diablo 4 expansion announcement, \"but also, more.\"It was previously confirmed that Diablo 4 will get a new expansion in 2026, so a reveal at The Game Awards would make sense. The imagery of the teaser monolith is hellish as well, which is fitting if it's a Diablo 4 teaser.Reporter Jason Schreier said he has \"no idea where Jez is getting that,\" as it relates to this teaser being about a Diablo 4 expansion.\"No idea where Jez is getting that, but this statue is not teasing the Diablo 4 expansion. (I don't currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it's a good one.),\" he wrote.Another theory is that the monolith is a teaser for the next God of War game, but that may not be true either, according to God of War veteran Cory Barlog.In another post, Schreier said the statue in the desert is not teasing The Elder Scrolls 6, either.\"I'll do this one more time because people are getting out of control: no the statue isn't teasing Elder Scrolls 6. Now I'm gonna stop responding about this. Unless someone finds me at the JW bar next week and asks really nicely, then maybe I'll answer, depending on how many drinks I've had,\" he said.Some are now theorizing that the teaser is for The Elder Scrolls Online. PC Gamer pointed out that the crocodile in the monolith might actually be a Daedroth from The Elder Scrolls lore. The monolith being placed in the desert could be a reference to the Alik'r Desert, people are guessing.Still others believed the teaser was for Lords of the Fallen 2, but it is not, according to the CEO of CI Games.Flattered so many think we’re behind that statue 😅 Can confirm it’s not us, we’re just as hyped as you are. Devs are praying it’s something FROM. Huge respect to them and we dream of reaching that level one day.Big news coming for both Lords of the Fallen and Lords II.We’ve… pic.twitter.com/d9N0pHYOGi  — Marek Tyminski (@tyminski_marek) December 7, 2025\n  Boutique game publisher Devolver posted a cheeky message about the Game Awards monolith, saying it's actually marketing for Skate Story. It is not. But it's pretty funny.If no one else is gonna claim this thing then we will. It’s for Skate Story which comes out December 8 on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Steam.Anyone else that claims it is lying. We made it out of the bones of most of our interns and the remaining interns put it in the desert. pic.twitter.com/8zBpid2h03  — Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) December 2, 2025\n  The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, and we're expecting lots of news and reveals. Of course, the show will also hand out the awards themselves, including Game of the Year.

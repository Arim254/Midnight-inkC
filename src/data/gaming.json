    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Once you make it past the early game in Satisfactory, your production lines will skyrocket in complexity. As the number of items you're producing goes from a dozen to dozens, so will the number of conveyor belts carting all of that around. Mastering Smart Splitters will be a crucial part of advancing in Satisfactory, keeping your production lines navigable and easy to understand.What is a Smart Splitter?The function of a regular splitter is fairly obvious--it splits a single conveyor belt into as many as three belts. That's great for a smelter cranking out more ingots than any single production line needs, such as having one smelter sending ingots to make plates, rods, and screws. There's no configuration needed here, either. It's just plug-and-play.So what makes a Smart Splitter smart? Smart Splitters are programmable, allowing you to determine which items on a belt go where. There are programmable splitters, too, that do the same thing but at a higher level, allowing you to sort more than three different outputs.How to unlock Smart SplittersImage Credit: Satisfactory WikiTo build a Smart Splitter, you'll need Reinforced Iron Plates, Rotors, and AI Limiters. The first two will unlock as part of the normal progression of building the space elevator, but AI Limiters can be unlocked most easily through the MAM Research machine, in the Caterium research tree. You just need to fashion 200 Quickwire and 50 Copper Sheets. Once you've unlocked the AI Limiter, build 10 of those and another 50 Reinforced Plates to unlock the Smart Splitter.How to use Smart SplittersAt their most straightforward, Smart Splitters allow you to send up to three items down the same conveyor belt and have them split up equally across the three outputs. After dropping a Smart Splitter, you can click on it to set the outputs:For example, you could send all the components for a given end product down the same belt and have them split off into the correct machines. This works best in earlier components, but as you progress, ratios can get more complex and you might have to do a bit of math to figure out the best way to split things.Another great way to use a smart splitter is to make sure you're getting the most out of a given production line. For a simple example, let's say you have a concrete production line set up. Once you reach Mk3 miners and belts, you'll be making way more concrete than you can reasonably use and store.In this case, you might use a smart splitter to send the concrete to two different destinations--storage and manufacturing--and still find the lines gummed up. Having full belts isn't the worst thing in the world, but it's hardly the most efficient. Your line might be working at only 20% capacity or something like that.What you can do instead is pipe that third output to an Awesome Sink. Alongside the many specific ingredients you can program into the Smart Splitter, there's a generalized option called Overflow. Essentially, this will ensure that those two main lines are completely full, and then start sending any extra down the overflow path. And so instead of having a machine that's working at low capacity, you can be dumping waste concrete into the Awesome Sink constantly. Concrete doesn't generate many points in the Sink on its own, but when you're sending concrete there every waking moment, it builds up. Put a smart splitter and an Awesome Sink overflow on every production line you can think of, and suddenly your machines are operating at much higher efficiency and you're racking up Awesome Sink points.Smart Splitters are a crucial component in making the most of your production lines, both for streamlining and overall production efficiency. Don't sleep on this useful part.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Factory production lines in Satisfactory will grow to immense sizes the longer you play, and it can be hard to manage. A good friend, though, will cut that work in half. Satisfactory offers both peer-to-peer multiplayer and server-based multiplayer, and each of them has their disadvantages. We'll talk about how to get each of them going here.There are three ways to host games in Satisfactory: Peer-to-peer games, self-hosted servers and rented servers. Peer-to-peer and self-hosted server options are both free, while a rented server option will have a monthly cost associated with it. Meanwhile, peer-to-peer is the easiest to set up, followed by rented servers, and finally self-hosted servers.Peer-to-peerA peer-to-peer session has to be initiated by whoever has the save game you're playing in. Sessions can be private, meaning that you'll need an in-game invite to join, or set to Friends Only, meaning that anyone on your friend list can hop in via Satisfactory's Join Game menu. Each game has a Session ID. If you share this with someone, they can join a Friends Only game regardless of whether they're on your friends list. Each time you initiate a session, though, the Session ID will be reset.This is, by far, the simplest option, and will be sufficient for most players, but it assumes your schedules will line up enough that the host can always be on when you feel like playing.Self-Hosted Dedicated ServerA self-hosted dedicated server is something you set up on a computer you have access to, and leave it to run indefinitely, allowing multiple users to join it whenever they wish. The software itself is free, and comes with the game. This is the most complex option in terms of setup and maintenance, and you'll want to refer to the Satisfactory wiki on Dedicated Servers for the details--it's more than we can reasonably go into here. Your ability to do this can also depend on hosting rules set by your internet service provider, meaning that depending on who supplies your internet connection, this may not even be an option at all.If you have the know-how or the patience, this option will give you the most freedom at the lowest price.Rented Dedicated ServerA rented dedicated server gives you all the freedom of a self-hosted server, but on someone else's hardware. Most people don't just have a computer that sits around left on and unused all the time that they can set a server up on, so this is going to be a better option for most than the self-hosted option. You have a lot of set-up options, so it will take some patience to set up, but if you have a few friends with different schedules who want to play together, this is a great option. Hosting starts at around $10 a month, though reliable and performant hosting will likely be closer to $15. The more people you intend to have playing, the more important that will be. We're not going to call out any specific providers here, but there are many, many options out there through your favorite search engine.This option is expensive, but is ideal for a group with multiple players who don't mind pitching in a few dollars to keep things going.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this week, Battlefield 6's Season 2 launch was pushed back to February 17 to give the development team more time to implement some needed changes. But that doesn't mean there won't be some improvements ahead of time. Electronic Arts has announced that Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.3.5 will arrive on Tuesday, January 20, and it's bringing some good news for anyone who wanted the jet combat to be more refined.Going forward, jet cannon damage against flying vehicles has been greatly reduced, and it will take \"approximately 40% more hits\" to blow targets out of the sky. However, the air radar that was previously announced will not be included in this update.Melee combat was also a priority for this update, which aims to improve \"responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.\" The Assault Ladder should also be more functional after this update, and the patch notes indicate that it has resolved some issues with the user interface and heads-up display in Redsec and Multiplayer, in addition to better stability for the Battle Royale and Gauntlet modes.Since Season 1 has been extended, Battlefield Studios is adding new weekly challenges and a Frostfire bonus path that includes a hardware XP boost, a vehicle skin, and player-card customization items. Season pass owners will also be able to get a weapon package, an XP boost for your entire career, and more cosmetics.The complete patch notes for Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 are below, and they will go live on January 20 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET.Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 Patch NotesMajor Updates for 1.1.3.5Improved responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.Updated jet combat balance by reducing jet cannon effectiveness against other air vehicles.Updated and refined the UI and HUD across Multiplayer and REDSEC, improving armor bar visibility, reticle presentation, and menu navigation.ChangelogVehiclesFixed an issue where vehicles could explode when a takedown was performed on an enemy soldier lying on top of them.Reduced jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, requiring approximately 40% more hits to destroy enemy air targets.WeaponsBipod attachments no longer display as always providing a hipfire accuracy bonus, as this bonus only applies while the bipod is deployed.Fixed an issue where the GRIM 1.50x optic on the DB-12 cost fewer loadout points than intended (15 instead of 25).Fixed an issue where the RPKM iron sights would shoot low when using the short barrel.Fixed an issue where the TR-7 Light Barrel incorrectly improved muzzle velocity.Fixed bipod mount input behaviour for Alternate, Lefty Alternate, Southpaw, and Legacy Southpaw presets so the bipod mount now follows the melee button.Improved attack speed for knife melee attacks.Improved buffering behaviour for knife and sledgehammer attacks.Improved consistency of melee damage timing against enemies and the environment.Improved consistency of recoil modifiers when using a controller across different weapons.Improved how sprint is interrupted when performing melee attacks. Sprint is now only interrupted until the attack reaches its target, rather than for the full duration of the animation.In the Firing Range, target dummies can now take damage while in the process of getting back up.Shooting with a suppressor now emits a small muzzle flash when viewed from close range only.GadgetsFixed an issue where the GDPIS was not destroyed when targeted by the XFGM-6D Recon Drone, Defibrillators, or the Repair Tool.Fixed an issue where the Sniper Decoy did not properly hide scope glints from nearby snipers.Assault LadderFixed an issue where ladders positioned above the player could not be entered.Fixed an issue where soldiers could be launched unexpectedly when attempting to enter a ladder.Improved the soldier animations while climbing ladders.UI & HUDAdded a new option allowing players to customize the reticle color inside weapon and gadget scopes.Fixed an issue where home screen focus navigation could become locked to the bulletin.Fixed cases where weapon menus displayed incorrect Reload Time stats for LMGs.Soldier lightning improvements to the front-endImproved front-end lighting to enhance the visual quality of soldier characters.The Reticle Color option now correctly updates reticle colors for Thermal Scopes and other supported gadgets.VFX & VideoAdjusted explosion particle effects by lowering the shockwave force.RedsecWeaponsFixed an issue where jump landing movement speed reduction behaved inconsistently in Redsec compared to other multiplayer experiences.Map & ModesFixed an edge case in Gauntlet mode \"Data Extraction\" where the drone could disappear permanently if drives were deposited at the exact moment it landed.UI & HUDBattle RoyaleFixed an issue where the armor bar could disappear intermittently.Fixed an issue where the Airburst Incendiary Launcher icon appeared as a grenade in the loot feed.GauntletFixed an issue where the armor bar could disappear after quickly editing a loadout.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

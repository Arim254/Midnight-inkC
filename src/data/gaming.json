    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The chances of the Perfect Dark reboot rising from last summer's cancellation are slim-to-none. But two of the primary developers behind it, studio head Darrell Gallagher and director Brian Horton, have found a new home at Take-Two Interactive.Bloomberg's Jason Schreier broke the story about Gallagher and Horton on Bluesky. According to Schreier, the duo will start their own studio under the Take-Two umbrella. However, there are currently no details about any games that they're working on.Schreier previously reported that Take-Two came close to reviving the Perfect Dark reboot. However, the deal reportedly fell apart over which company would own the rights for the franchise. Regardless, it seems that both Gallagher and Horton made an impression on Take-Two that led to them being hired.Last summer, Gallagher shared his eulogy for the canceled Perfect Black reboot, and added that he \"couldn't be prouder of the talented and passionate team\" that he put together. It's unclear if any of the other employees who were let go from the Perfect Dark team will join Gallagher and Horton at their new studio.Take-Two is also the parent company for the developer of Grand Theft Auto 6, Rockstar Games, a company that's currently under fire for laying off employees for supposedly leaking proprietary intel. That's led to allegations of union busting, which is a battle that's likely to wind up in court.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Since its official launch in 2021, Medieval Dynasty has given players a glimpse of life in the middle ages without any fantasy flourishes. You don't have to worry about dragons, wizards, or orcs killing you in this game, but you still have to survive in some harsh conditions. Now, a free update for Medieval Dynasty is adding some new touches for the game that go beyond mere survival.          There were pregnancies and children in this game prior to the Labor of Love update, but there are now more realistic depictions of it including visibly pregnant women, new animations and conversations, as well as a productivity boost for the player during the pregnancy and while the mother takes care of the child. In this game, players go on to play as their children after the death of their characters. Additionally, pregnant women will stop working during their second term.This free update is also accompanied by a paid DLC called The Exquisite Pack. The cosmetic options include two new outfits: a dress and jewelry for a female character and something resembling formal wear for the men. The DLC also gives players an exquisite sword, new hairstyles and mustache designs, as well 13 emblem patterns for players' settlements.From now through December 18 at 7:00 AM PST, Medieval Dynasty and The Exquisite Pack are on sale on Steam. The core game is available for half of its regular price, which comes out to $17.50, while the DLC is only slightly discounted to $3.99. The previous Medieval Dynasty expansion, Echoes of Nature, is also for sale at the $3.99 price.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

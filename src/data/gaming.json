    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Ratchet & Clank's franchise has been dormant since Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart was released in 2021, but that didn't stop some fans from searching for a game that few remembered. Ratchet & Clank: Clone Home was announced was announced in the mid-2000s as the follow-up to the mobile title Ratchet & Clank: Going Mobile. Although Clone Home was canceled and never officially released, the game has finally been found and a copy has been shared online.The Golden Bolt's YouTube channel (via Engadget) has posted a video detailing the years-long search for Ratchet & Clank: Clone Home. As noted in the video below, several members of the gaming community took part in the search, but college students \"Emily\" and \"Super Gamer Omega Clank\" were credited for finding a Sony Ericsson W880i that had a working copy of Clone Home. Breaking the phone's encryption was the most difficult step, but their efforts paid off.          The title of the game refers to a pair of digital clones of Ratchet and Clank who team up with their counterparts in the real world to foil the plans of Vox, the returning nemesis from Going Mobile. The digital Ratchet and Clank exist in a video game within the game, and the real version of that duo are also transported into the game around halfway through the story.It's believed that Clone Alone was briefly online by mistake before being pulled down. The preserved copy is fully playable, but it's unclear why Clone Home wasn't released. The Golden Bolt believes it was over a possible legal dispute between Sony and Handheld Games, the developer of Going Mobile. He also notes that Clone Home was likely developed by JavaGround, rather than Handheld Games.This isn't the only surprise that fans of the Ratchet & Clank franchise had in 2025. Earlier this year, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart senior designer Grant Parker revealed that he placed a hidden minigame in the title. Although Rift Apart was ported to PC in 2023, there's no word on when or if another sequel will follow.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Pokemon Go is celebrating the arrival of fall with the Harvest Festival event from October 10-16. Fall-themed Pokemon like Miltank, Smoliv, and Combee will be appearing more frequently over the next few days, but most exciting is the arrival of two new Pokemon: Dipplin and its evolved form, Hydrapple.Dipplin is another alternate evolution of Applin, originally introduced as part of the Teal Mask DLC for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Like Applin's other evolved forms, however, you'll need to collect a new type of item--Syrupy Apples--before you can get one, and they're a little difficult to get your hands on. Here are some tips to help you get Dipplin and Hydrapple in Pokemon Go.How To Get DipplinThe easiest way to obtain Dipplin is to evolve one from Applin, but you'll need to collect quite a few items first. Specifically, you need 200 Applin Candy and 20 Syrupy Apples to trigger the evolution.Syrupy Apples are a new type of item introduced as part of the Harvest Festival event, and they can be found at PokeStops. Once you've collected the requisite items, you can evolve Applin into Dipplin right from the Pokemon's detail page.How To Get Syrupy ApplesLike Sweet Apples and Tart Apples (which are required to evolve Applin into Appletun or Flapple, respectively), the primary way to obtain Syrupy Apples is at PokeStops. Set a Mossy Lure Module at one of these waypoints, and apples will periodically appear on the map while the module is active.Once you see an apple, simply tap on the item to collect it. However, not every apple can be picked up; sometimes tapping on one will trigger an encounter with a wild Pokemon, so you'll need patience and persistence while trying to collect them.How To Evolve Dipplin Into HydrappleYou won't need any more Syrupy Apples to get a Hydrapple, but you will need to have a lot of candy saved up. It costs 400 Applin candy to evolve Dipplin into Hydrapple. On top of that, you must catch seven dragon-type Pokemon while Dipplin is set as your buddy before you can trigger the evolution, adding a further complication to the process.It typically takes quite a long time to collect 400 candy, but there are a few ways to expedite the process. Since Applin is appearing more frequently during the Harvest Festival event, make sure to use a Pinap Berry before catching the Pokemon to increase the amount of candy you get as a reward. You can also convert any Rare Candy you have stocked up into Applin candy, which will help you reach the 400 requirement faster.Can Dipplin And Hydrapple Be Shiny?Since shiny Applin has not yet been added to Pokemon Go, you can't yet get a shiny Dipplin or Hydrapple in the mobile game. There's no indication when shiny Applin will make its Pokemon Go debut, but new shiny Pokemon are typically introduced during special events, so it'll likely arrive as part of some future event.The Harvest Festival is underway until October 16, but there are plenty of other events still in store for this month, including a Pokemon Legends: Z-A crossover and the annual Halloween celebration. You can read more about everything happening over the next few weeks in our Pokemon Go October events guide.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

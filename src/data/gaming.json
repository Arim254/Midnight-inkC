    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                I prefer to play my games without mods or console commands to get as close to the intended experience as possible. But sometimes something breaks and you need to reset your character, you have an accessibility need, or maybe you're just 1,000 hours into your game and aren't worried about doing stuff in-engine anymore. That's what console commands are for. Like any big crafting game should, Satisfactory has a variety of console commands available. Continue on for how to use those commands, and what cheats are available.Before we dive in, cheating in Satisfactory isn't as simple and straightforward as we might hope. There are a variety of console commands available, but most of them pertain to user preferences. To use actual cheats, you'll have to install a mod.How to use Console CommandsLook at the upper-right corner of your keyboard. You should see a key that has one or more of these characters: ~, `, or §. That last one is pretty standard on a lot of European keyboard layouts. Pressing this will bring up the console.How to use CheatsWe have a full list of Console and Debug commands further down, but we would be remiss in not mentioning our favorite command: Cheats.For Cheats to work, you'll need to download and install the Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML), with additional information in the Satisfactory Modding Documentation.Some of our favorite Cheats include: NoPower, NoCost, TurboProductionMode, and Teleport. NoPower still requires that you wire up your machines, but you don't have to actually power them. NoCost makes machines and the like free to place. TurboProductionMode turns crafting at the bench into an instantaneous affair. Finally, Teleport puts you wherever you like on the map, which is great for when you manage to get yourself into a precarious position between a big drop and some predators who haven't noticed you just yet.Below, you'll find listings for all console, debug, and cheat commands, per the Satisfactory Modding Documentation page and the Satisfactory wiki on Fandom.All Console, Debug, and Cheat commandsConsole Commands ?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Everybody needs a friend, and that's especially the case in Satisfactory, where it's just you against all of nature and capitalism. Thankfully, the Lizard Doggo is there to keep you company. And even if you prefer your alone time, there's a good reason to keep a pen of Lizard Doggos around.Lizard Doggos are short, friend-sized lizards with dog-like features. They have a physique similar to that of a Beagle, but are scaled and have armor on their back. Untamed, Lizard Doggos are entirely harmless, and will quickly run when approached if done so carelessly.To tame a Lizard Doggo, you'll need a few Paleberries--the raspberry-like fruit found all over the map. If you already have Blade Runners by this point, unequip them before you try to tame one of these little guys, and toggle your movement speed to slow (Shift key). Find a Doggo and wait until it turns and starts staring at you. At this point, open your inventory and drop a Paleberry on the ground in front of you and wait. The Doggo will slowly approach you to eat the Paleberry. Make sure not to move during this process. Once the Doggo has completely eaten the Paleberry, slowly approach it. You should have a prompt to pet it (E). If you're able to pet it, you're golden--you have a new buddy.Make sure to name every single one of your Lizard Doggos.Lizard Doggos are slow, though, and they aren't very smart, either. You won't want to take these guys exploring, because they can't keep up with anything faster than a walking pace. They can be killed by poisonous gas or hostile creatures, too, though they're immune to radiation. They also have a tendency to take a walk off the nearest cliff.To protect them, you'll want to take them right home and build a pen for them. Make sure the pen has a foundation underneath, otherwise they can de-spawn. If you get creative with the builder, you can still give them grassy space to play in with a hidden foundation underneath to keep them from disappearing. They can't jump, and their maximum step height is one meter, so they can't climb very high, meaning that your pen walls can be pretty low.Now that you have a Doggo and a Doggo Park, you'll want to check back every so often. Each Doggo has a one-slot inventory, and will at random intervals generate one of a list of 46 potential items, ranging from Hog Remains to Power Slugs to Nuclear Waste. With a pen full of Doggos, you can generate quite a few items in short order, and some of them can be pretty rare. At the current time there's no way to farm those items automatically, or to breed Lizard Doggos, so this will still be a manual process, but a Purple Power Slug or a Nuke Nobelisk is nothing to sneeze at.Here's the full list at the time of this writing, with the resource linked above:OreS.A.M.Flora and FaunaHog RemainsSpitter RemainsBlue Power SlugYellow Power SlugPurple Power SlugHealing ItemsBeryl NutComponentsIron PlateIron RodWireCableConcreteScrewReinforced Iron PlateRotorCopper SheetModular FrameSteel BeamSteel PipeEncased Industrial BeamStatorMotorPlasticRubberCircuit BoardHeavy Modular FrameComputerQuickwireAlclad Aluminum SheetAluminum CasingCrystal OscillatorSilicaQuartz CrystalElectromagnetic Control RodHeat SinkCooling SystemFused Modular FrameHigh-Speed ConnectorTurbo MotorFuelSolid BiofuelBiomass (Generic)AmmoNuke NobeliskPulse NobeliskNobeliskRifle AmmoIron Rebar\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

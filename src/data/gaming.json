    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this year, Hytale was canceled after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and purchased all of the rights for Hytale from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale will retail for $20. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.\"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible,\" wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. \"I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast.\"Collins-Laflamme added that he wants to attract as many players as possible, even during rough economic times. Hypixel has also released a post detailing how far along the modding feature is. The short answer is there's still a lot of work to be done. For now, Hytale doesn't have a release date, but Collins-Laflamme has implied that the game's early-access period will begin relatively soon.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Catan first launched in 1995, with each new edition slightly tweaking its appearance and gameplay. The fifth edition in 2015 marked a big change for the brand, as it moved from “The Settlers of Catan” to simply “Catan.” This new sixth edition doesn’t do anything quite so radical, but it does offer a more inclusive adventure and an improved eco-friendly design.Here’s a look at everything that’s changed:Updated graphics: You’ll now find brighter artwork and modern designs that make the game easier to parse. This also includes new character illustrations with greater diversity.Premium, eco-friendly components: Components are crafted with less plastic and an eye for sustainability. You’ll also find new textured hex tiles and updated card trays that make it easier to stay organized.Smart storage: The 5-6 Player Extension Pack contents can now fit inside the base game box, so you can more easily transport all your pieces.Improved rulebook: While the rules are the same, the rulebook has been updated with clearer graphics and gameplay examples, helping new players learn the basics.If you own other Catan expansions, you should be able to use them with the new 6th Edition. The rules remain the same across all editions, but you’ll have to deal with conflicting art styles.

There were a lot of great Xbox 360 games during its run. But looking back, it's staggering to see how many of the top-selling Xbox 360 games were from the Call of Duty franchise.Circana's Mat Piscatella has shared the 20 best-selling Xbox 360 games in the US, and 7 out of the 20 were Call of Duty titles. Six of those games were in the top 10, and four out of the top five as well.Three Halo games and two Gears of War titles made the list, as did perennial best-sellers Minecraft and The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. Since the acquisitions of Bethesda, Activision, and Mojang Studios, Microsoft now owns the rights to 17 of the titles on this list.Outside of Microsoft's dominion, Rockstar Games had two of the most-acclaimed titles of that generation: Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto 4. Meanwhile, EA's Battlefield 3 was the publisher's sole title to make the list.Peter Moore--the former Microsoft executive who oversaw Xbox and Xbox 360--recently shared some of the history behind the latter's battle with the PlayStation 3 for the hearts and minds of gamers. The Xbox 360 is one of the biggest hits that Microsoft has ever had in the gaming realm. Although the Xbox 360 store was shut down last year, Microsoft shared an update for the system in June 2025.The complete list of the top 20 best-selling Xbox 360 games in the US is reproduced below. Most of the titles are still available to play on the Xbox Store.20. Gears of War 3Developer: Epic GamesRelease Date: September 20, 201119.

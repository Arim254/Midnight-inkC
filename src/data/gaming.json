His memorable commentary on the game became part of NBA Jam's blockbuster success in arcades. However, Kitzrow has revealed that he was paid a very small amount for his work in the first game.While speaking with The Escapist, Kitzrow disclosed that he was paid $50 an hour for his work on NBA Jam, which was the same amount of money he made recording lines for Bally Midway's pinball machines. It wasn't until after the game was released that Kitzrow realized that he should have charged more.\"I'd go in, do a couple of sessions, maybe 15 hours total, and that was it,\" recalled Kitzrow. \"I wasn't smart enough, savvy enough to know the business, to go, 'Gee, these games make a lot of money, maybe I should make more than $50 an hour.' I didn't have an agent at the time ... When the game came out and I found out it made a billion dollars, that's when I realized I'd made like $800 and change ... I thought, 'Well, I'm probably being underpaid, I might want to raise my rate.'\"Kitzrow returned for the sequel, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, and he became Midway's go-to guy for commentary on NFL Blitz, NBA Showtime, and MLB Slugfest. Kitzrow also recorded lines for EA's NBA Jam reboot and he was the featured announcer in a more recent arcade game, NBA Superstars. Currently, Kitzrow is providing commentary for Mutant Football League 2, which is scheduled to be released in early access on Steam on December 10.In 2021, director Sean Menard signed a deal to helm an NBA Jam documentary, which was optioned from author Reyan Ali's 2019 book NBA Jam. In the four years since, the project has yet to be completed.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                After giving everyone a free Juice WRLD skin a year ago, Fortnite is once again offering a free licensed skin to mark the start of a new chapter. Anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 at 6 AM PT and December 1 at 6 AM PT will receive a skin based on Yuki Yubari, a character from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill who didn't make the final cut of the movie when it was originally released.This Yuki Yubari skin is free to anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 and December 1.Back when Tarantino wrote his massive two-part epic Kill Bill, it included an additional sequence that was cut before filming, in which Yuki seeks revenge for the death of her sister Gogo, whom The Bride had killed during the battle at the House of Blue Leaves. Yuki finally sees the light of day in Fortnite Chapter 7, apparently.The Yuki Yubari skin is not actually in the Fortnite game files yet, so you won't be granted the skin until after Chapter 7 begins on November 29. Yuki is one of at least three Kill Bill-related skins coming to Fortnite in Chapter 7. The Bride herself will be included in the Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass, and a skin based on Gogo Yubari will be sold in the item shop--and you can also earn it by purchasing a ticket in advance for a showing of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair during its opening weekend.With Chapter 7 arriving imminently, that means it's almost time for the Chapter 6 finale live event--which will go down on Saturday, November 29 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The popular Ticket to Ride is 50% off at Amazon during Black Friday, bringing it down to its lowest price ever of $27.49 (was $55). It's sitting at 4.8/5 stars on Amazon with over 27,000 reviews, and most critics agree it's a fantastic strategy game with impressive longevity and replayability. If you're interested in the deal, you'll want to grab it soon--the discount is only available for a limited time, and with how popular the game is, there's a chance it could sell out even before Amazon's Black Friday Sale winds down.                                 Ticket to Ride                                                                $27.49 (was $55)                                                                                                                                                                                    Ticket to Ride supports up to five players and is designed for ages eight and up. You'll be tasked with expanding your rail network across America with several different ways to achieve victory (such as collecting color sets of train cards or building the longest routes on the board). The rules are pretty simple for everyone to learn, but there's enough depth to the action that there's always something new to explore or a new strategy to attempt.                      Ticket to Ride's publisher, Asmodee, has a few other great board games on sale for Black Friday if you're looking to stock up with even more titles for holiday game nights. One of the most popular board games, Carcassonne, is available for $21 (was $42). The classic game sees you building an ever-changing landscape as you attempt to claim various landmarks and score points. This version features eye-catching artwork on the game pieces, and a redesigned rulebook aimed at making it easier to learn the rules. For something totally different, Heat: Pedal to the Metal is $48 (was $75). This is the best price ever for the frantic racing game, which sees up to six players managing a hand of cards and upgrading their vehicles as they seek to be the first across the finish line. The game also includes solo okay rules, allowing you to hone your skills before thrashing your buddies on game night.

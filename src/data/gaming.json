    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Darryn Bonthuys\n   on January 14, 2026 at 9:17AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                A new batch of games has been announced for the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, and this month, subscribers can check out nine games in total. Racing and horror are the prevalent themes this month, with titles like Resident Evil Village and Ridge Racer, but for some goofy--and melodramatic--RPG fun, don't sleep on Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.These games will all be available to play, starting January 20. All PS Plus subscribers can also claim new games in January, as Need For Speed Unbound, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper will be available until February 2.Resident Evil Village (PS5, PS4)The follow-up to Resident Evil 7 dialed up the horror to new first-person heights when it was first released several years back. Once again starring protagonist Ethan Winters and his battered hands, Resident Evil Village shifts the survival-horror to a remote European village teeming with brand-new bioweapons, monsters, and one really tall lady. Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5, PS4)Evolving the turn-based gameplay introduced in 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Infinite Wealth sees new series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga jet to Hawaii to discover the secrets of his past. A game that also serves as a passing of the Yakuza torch, longtime protagonist Kazuma Kiryu lends a helping pair of fists with this grand adventure. Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5, PS4)A vast wilderness of arid deserts and rugged forests await you in Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game, but if you're an optimist, you'll see those obstacles as a puzzle waiting to be solved. With all-terrain vehicles and high-tech tools at your disposal, you'll have to figure out the best way to get from Point A to B as you explore a harsh frontier. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5)Based on the hit movies, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a single-player horror game where you have to survive familial drama, inner fears, and nigh-unkillable space monsters that'll zero in on your location if you make a peep. Darkest Dungeon 2 (PS5, PS4)A combination of roguelike gameplay and road trip action set during apocalyptic times, Darkest Dungeon 2 tasks you with leading a team of flawed heroes into dungeons teeming with all manner of fresh horrors. Not only do you have to keep an eye on your party's physical condition, you also have to help them find redemption on their quest to save the day. The Exit 8 (PS5, PS4)A unique game released several years ago, The Exit 8 has a simple but deviously deceptive setup: stuck in a Japanese underground passageway, you have to look for anomalies as you walk toward the exit. Miss one, and it could spell your end in this game for fans of liminal spaces and unnerving horror.  Art of Rally (PS5, PS4)A rally good game inspired by the golden age of rallying, this stylish gem is an enjoyable romp through stylized environments. Just like the real-life motorsport, you'll compete for gold and glory across dozens of stages spread across the world while mastering each unique car in this top-down racer. A Little to the Left (PS5, PS4)If you enjoy stacking and organizing stuff, then you won't want to miss out on A Little to the Left. The game offers dozens of puzzles, ranging from organizing eggs to arranging batteries into a special compartment, but there's one furry wrinkle to the gameplay in the form of a mischievous cat that's hellbent on causing some chaos. Ridge Racer (PS5, PS4)PS Plus Premium subscription requiredIt's Riiiiiiiidge Raaaaacccceeeer! The first game in the legendary racing game series is coming to PS5 and PS4, and this PS1 classic has been upgraded with several quality-of-life features.     \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It was anything but a wonderful holiday season for Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege players. Following a massive hack that dumped billions of credits into the community, Ubisoft had to shut down the marketplace and roll back accounts. The fixes aren't entirely in place, but Ubisoft is now offering compensation to its players.On social media, Ubisoft announced that any Rainbow Six Siege players who log in between January 16-25 will receive the following gifts.4x battle pass XPTen battle pass levelsMissed daily rewards (Delta Pack, Alpha Pack, Auric Mold skin for the P-10C)According to Ubisoft's update, account rollbacks are still in progress and the marketplace won't return until a later date in Year 11.The most common response to this message on X were questions about when the voice chat feature will be restored. Ubisoft replied, \"Voice chat continues to be a key priority for the team moving forward.\"A separate Rainbow Six Siege X hack occurred earlier this year, which indiscriminately banned players for 67 days in a reference to the 6-7 meme.Last year, Rainbow Six Siege's transition to Siege X brought a lot of players back to the game a decade after its launch. It's been so successful that creative director Alexander Karpazis told GameSpot there's no immediate reason for Ubisoft to move forward with Rainbow Six Siege 2.Former Rainbow Six Siege creative director Xavier Marquis recently returned to Ubisoft, but not to the franchise. Instead, Marquis will be working on a new 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play game called March of Giants.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Hytale is the newest sandbox game on the market, and it's finally in early access after spending years in development. Made by a team of former Minecraft modders, Hytale blends elements of the classic Minecraft formula with an RPG twist and Hytale mods, if you're so inclined to use them once you know how to play Hytale. Even in early access, there's a ton of content to explore, but you don't have to explore it as a solo player.There's full multiplayer support in Hytale, and you have a couple of options when it comes to joining up with your friends. Below, you can see how to add friends, join and invite them to a world, and how worlds work in Hytale.How to add, invite, and join friends in HytaleHytale works a little differently than other sandbox games, as there is no dedicated friends list as of yet. This means you can't add a friend and then choose to invite them to your server or world through a specific menu.Instead, Hytale offers the ability to send server codes, which you can send to anyone. The code allows them to join your server immediately. It should be noted that server codes contain your IP address, so you want to ensure you're only sending codes to trusted friends.To send out a server code, follow these steps:Open the main menu once you've started a world in Hytale and then select the \"Online Play\" tabFind the option for \"Allow other players to join\" and enable itSave this setting, and then you'll see a code appear on your screenCopy this code to your clipboard and then paste it somewhere or send it to a friend directlyThe server code section of HytaleAlternatively, you can join a friend's world using a code by following these steps:Open the main menu and select the \"Servers\" tabChoose the option to \"Join via code\" and paste/type in the code you received from a friendPress \"Connect\" to immediately join that friend's serverOnce you or a friend has a server code, the code isn't required again unless you or a friend is kicked from that world. Then, to be invited back, the code needs to be entered once more.One major element of multiplayer in Hytale is that, in most cases, when the host of a world goes offline, the world can't be accessed by anyone else. This means you can only play on a friend's world when they are online themselves.The only exception to this rule is with servers. Hytale has third-party servers, and you can make and run your own servers, which comes with a massive set of guidelines. No matter which route you take, though, a server is more of a complicated process than simply joining a friend's world. However, the developers have said that servers in Hytale will usually run better and have increased player caps compared to regular worlds, so there are definitely some benefits if you feel like getting into the server side of the game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

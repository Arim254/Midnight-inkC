Anyone who wants a home in Azeroth can claim one, and Blizzard's decorating toolset allows for what feels like close to infinite creative possibilities when it comes to decorating them.Housing in WoW is in many ways a game within a game, and it's clear many players are treating it as such. As players level up their housing level, they gain access to new types of rooms, the ability to place more decoration items, and more. Of course, WoW is now littered with all kinds of housing rewards too, which can be earned by completing dungeons, raids, achievements, bought from special vendors, or even crafted by other players.It's a system that will continue to evolve and expand over time, as Blizzard intends it to be a core pillar of the MMORPG going forward. Players, for example, are already requesting a higher decor placement limit for exterior decorating, and the base homes players have to choose from currently only come in human or orc-themed flavors. But having some limitations can actually be a boon to creativity, as players are using what they have available, and Blizzard's flexible tools, to conjure up some remarkable housing marvels.While it may have taken 21 years to arrive, players have wasted no time building all manner of fantastical homesteads and mind-blowing creations since housing went live on December 2, 2025. From airship homes to giant mechs, cathedrals to Hobbit holes, the creativity levels are off the charts. Here's a roundup of all the best WoW player housing creations we've seen so far, with more sure to come.Pure CinemaFly, Fly AwaySource: XMobile HomeA Long Time Ago...Grocery RunBy The LightIn A Hole In the Ground Live A HobbitAmong The TreesCanceling The ApocalypseHowl's Moving Gnomish CastleViking FeastHome Sweet ArgusSpooky CottageGarden of EluneMy Other House Is A TardisThe Great Pyramid Of ZandalarYou're A WizardGoing To Have Myself A TimeIt's Like Nascar For ParticlesElven Elegance    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Even the most expensive advertising campaigns are nothing without a good Steam review score. A studio that manages to shift a game's review score from \"Mixed\" to \"Very Positive\" can as much as triple its chance of making a sale from a marketing campaign, a new games industry report has shown.Games marketing firm Gamesight published the statistic in its latest Performance Marketing Playbook, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz. Gamesight charted the conversion rates of 30 premium games against their respective Steam review scores, showing that every game with a conversion rate over 2% boasted a Steam review rating over 80% positive.The report also included a case study that followed a single unnamed game's 21-month marketing campaign, charting the campaign's success against its review score at the time. The game generally saw a higher conversion rate when its review score was higher, with the conversion rate peaking at over 7% when the game briefly achieved a rating of \"Overwhelmingly Positive.\"Gamesight says it saw similar patterns in other games it studied, while the firm also identified how studios could improve their review scores. \"Both from this analysis and our experience working with game developers, we consistently see things like game patches, bug fixes, and adding player-requested features tend to be at the center of these sentiment improvements,\" Gamesight data analyst Marlie Tandoc said. The case study game also follows this trend, with its Overwhelmingly Positive spike occurring when the developer added a feature that had been highly requested by players.Overall, the marketing firm concludes that listening to players and taking their feedback on board is just as important to a game's success as the money that goes into marketing it. There is one major exception to this trend, however--Gamesight added that free-to-play games saw \"no measurable impact\" from review scores, as players can simply try the game out with no cost barrier.A number of successful games have already followed this playbook, with games like No Man's Sky and Helldivers 2 both seeing major review score turnarounds by implementing updates in response to player feedback. Steam also recently changed the way it displays review scores, acknowledging the major impact these scores can have on a game's success.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Splitgate developer 1047 Games has reacted to the online commentary regarding the recent re-launch of the shooter Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. The game arrived in mid-December 2025 and hasn't gotten close to the Steam numbers that Splitgate 2 or Splitgate 1 reached, prompting online commenters to wonder if the game will be able to stay online.The developer said in a statement, \"Steam charts don't measure fun,\" adding that Steam player numbers only show \"one number, on one platform, at one given moment.\" Steam numbers do no show the \"full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming.\"1047 Games re-launched Splitgate 2 under the name Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, and Steam numbers spiked to about 2,300 concurrents at launch. In the past 24 hours, the game reached a peak of 952 players on Steam.For comparison, Splitgate 2 had its most-ever players (25,785 concurrents) in early June when the game's battle royale mode arrived. The original Splitgate, meanwhile, achieved a record of 67,724 peak concurrent players back in August 2021.          1047 Games is encouraging people to give Spligate: Arena Reloaded a shot. \"The gameplay's the best it's ever been, and we'd love for you to jump in and form your own opinion,\" the studio said.The game will get a big new mode in the future in the form of Arena Royale, which is a battle royale mode.Steam's player data is public, but the same cannot be said for PlayStation and Xbox, so we do not know how Arena Reloaded is performing on consoles. The game was always likely to face an uphill battle for marketshare, as data shows people may try new games but end up sticking with their established favorites. It's been a bumpy road for Splitgate in the past year. One of the bosses at 1047 Games wore a \"Make FPS Great Again\" hat at Summer Game Fest in 2025, which led to some controversy. Additionally, there were complaints about microtransaction prices. The studio would later lay off staff, while its founders stopped drawing a salary. Splitgate 2 took the unusual move of reverting back to beta in July 2025 before the re-launch in December.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Video games offer their own ways to celebrate, from dazzling fireworks to high-speed races and creative parties with friends. Sometimes, getting together virtually is the only way everyone can be together.In Animal Crossing, you can ring in the new year with a sky full of fireworks over your island. Fortnite Creative lets you throw your own custom parties with friends, complete with music, games, and chaos. Mario Kart brings the celebration to the tracks, where fireworks light up the sky as you race across Rainbow Road as the clock towards the new year ticks down.No matter your style, these games turn the countdown into an interactive, unforgettable experience that's perfect for friends and families who can't be together to ring in the new year.Animal Crossing: New HorizonsPlatform: Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: March 20, 2020Playercount: Up to 8 players onlineCross-platform: NoAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the few games that fully commits to New Year’s Eve as an in-game event. On December 31, the plaza transforms with decorations, party favors, sparklers, and a real-time countdown that syncs with the player’s system clock. Isabelle and villagers gather in the square, music ramps up as midnight approaches, and fireworks cap off the celebration.Because islands are persistent social spaces, players can invite friends over to experience the countdown together. Everyone can dress for the occasion, emote, exchange gifts, and wander the island after midnight. It feels less like a mini game and more like a shared holiday ritual, which is why it remains the gold standard for virtual New Year’s parties.Mario Kart WorldPlatform: Nintendo Switch 2Release Date: June 5, 2025Playercount: Up to 24 players onlineCross-platform: NoWe have Mario Kart World listed here, but nearly any Mario Kart game will work. The series is known for gorgeous tracks that feature stunning visual effects, many of which are fireworks that would fit in on any New Year's Eve parade or celebration.Hop online, hit up a few tracks, and if you're up for it--setup a race along one of those courses that feature fireworks just as the countdown triggers. We're talking Crown City or several iterations of Rainbow Road, among others.Mario Kart World does offer custom lobbies that make it easy to connect with friends, but you can also tout Mario Kart out as part of any in-person New Year's Eve party too!Lunar New Year is just a different type of party!FortnitePlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, mobileRelease Date: July 25, 2017Playercount: Up to four players per squad, bigger lobbies in Fortnite CreativeCross-platform: YesWhile Epic Games has been known to feature fireworks in live battle royale lobbies near the end of the year, the real party kicks off in Fortnite Creative. Here you can find player-made game modes that let you play your own way--including custom trivia night mods, prop hunt, and party royale-like modes.Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with hopping from the battle bus together as the remaining hours in the year grow fewer and fewer. WinterFest takes place in Fortnite around the end of December each year, giving the island a snowy backdrop as you fight for your life.Call of Duty: WarzonePlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: March 10, 2020Playercount: Up to 4 in a squadCross-platform: YesWarzone doesn't have the flexibility of something like Fortnite Creative, but its high-octane action makes for some scenes that feel like a New Year's Eve fireworks show. Blowing up helicopters out of the sky or sending trucks off the ground with explosives are little milestones on the way to battle royale victory.Warzone has become more popular than traditional Call of Duty--and for good reason. Battle royale brings the survival element of war that no other Call of Duty has before. Doing so, with friends, at the end of the year is a blast.Final Fantasy XIVPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: August 27, 2013Cross-platform: YesFinal Fantasy XIV excels at player-driven celebrations. Housing districts, Free Company estates, and public hubs often host New Year’s countdowns organized by the community. Players dress up, set off fireworks, and gather around stages while DJs stream music externally.The game’s strength is how social it feels even without official events. Emotes, glamour, and roleplay-friendly systems allow players to turn the night into a true virtual party. It feels communal, intentional, and uniquely festive.GTA OnlinePlatform: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: October 1, 2013Playercount: Up to 32 players per sessionCross-platform: NoGTA Online offers endless locations for hosting a New Year’s party, from penthouses and yachts to nightclubs and rooftops. Fireworks launchers, champagne animations, and curated music help sell the celebration without much effort.Private sessions make it easy to turn chaos into a controlled party environment. Friends can dress up, take screenshots, and roam Los Santos together at midnight, blending sandbox freedom with a party atmosphere.MinecraftPlatform: PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, mobileRelease Date: May 17, 2009Playercount: Depends on server or RealmCross-platform: YesMinecraft is a blank canvas for New Year’s parties. Players can build stages, countdown clocks, and massive firework rigs, then invite friends to explore and celebrate together. Redstone allows for surprisingly elaborate countdown mechanics.Because it is player-driven, each party feels personal. Whether it is a cozy survival world or a creative server spectacle, Minecraft lets groups define what celebration looks like.RobloxPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PC, mobileRelease Date: September 1, 2006Cross-platform: YesRoblox thrives on social experiences, many of which are designed specifically for events. Player-creators and professionals regularly create countdown rooms, concert spaces, and dance clubs perfect for New Year’s Eve gatherings.Its accessibility makes it easy to invite large groups, even casual players. Jumping between games keeps the party moving, while social hubs provide a place to gather at midnight.Fall GuysPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, MobileRelease Date: August 4, 2020Playercount: Up to 4 players per squadCross-platform: YesFall Guys feels like a party game by design, with colorful characters and short, high-energy rounds. Friends can queue together and treat matches as playful chaos while chatting through the countdown. The lack of downtime makes it ideal for New Year’s Eve. It keeps energy high without demanding focus, letting players celebrate and laugh together.Some minigames offer the perfect backdrop for a New Year's Eve gathering, including Short Circuit and Hex-A-Terrestrial, complete with a night sky and bright lights to get you in the festive mood.No Man’s SkyPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: August 12, 2016Playercount: Four players per partyCross-platform: YesNo Man’s Sky offers a surprisingly calm party atmosphere. The Nexus serves as a shared social hub, while player-built bases can become private celebration spaces complete with fireworks and emotes. The game works well for laid-back New Year’s parties. Players can explore, take group photos, and ring in the new year against alien skies.Sea of ThievesPlatform: Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: March 20, 2018Playercount: Up to 4 per crewCross-platform: YesSea of Thieves turns New Year’s Eve into a pirate celebration. Crews can sail together, play shanties, drink grog, and fire cannons into the sky at midnight. The trick shots people have been able to pull off by launching themselves out of cannons, across the sea, and onto other ships are nothing short of incredible. Drunken-madness induced incredible, though.Sea of Thieves adventures are less about competition or loot and more about the shared memorable moments created. Even just sailing under the stars can make for a wonderful way to ring in the new year.Deep Rock GalacticPlatform: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCRelease Date: May 13, 2020Playercount: Up to 4 playersCross-platform: PartialDeep Rock Galactic leans into rowdy celebration through its Space Rig hub. Players can dance, drink at the bar, and trigger music before or after missions, making it a natural gathering spot. Honestly, the Overwatch-like mining adventure is a blast, but sometimes you don't even need to jump into the action to have a good time.A New Year’s party here feels communal and silly. It is perfect for smaller groups that want something social without leaving co-op gameplay behind.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nAs live-service games go on and on into eternity, the episodic game structure is the perfect way to know just when to put down the controller.By \n    Matt Kim\n   on December 27, 2025 at 1:00PM PST\n              \n                Is there a more infamous monkey-paw wish than the collective dream that all our favorite games could last forever? Well, the finger curled, because it seems like all major game publishers in the world only want to make games that go on to infinity.With the rise of live-service games, it's been a struggle to know when to put the controller down, especially when games like Fortnite release seasonal content like The Simpsons season pass that ask you to play long enough to unlock stupid sexy Flanders. Luckily, for us, episodic games, perfectly portioned into bite-sized morsels, have come back to rescue us from the endless grind.In this case, I am talking specifically about Dispatch, the new episodic superhero game from AdHoc Studio. If the name is unfamiliar to you, AdHoc is a new game company founded by former members of Ubisoft, Night School, and perhaps most notably, Telltale Games, who blew up the episodic gaming scene with 2012's The Walking Dead. The studio would later close due to a variety of factors internal and external, some of which I covered previously as a reporter. But by then, the episodic-games formula was starting to feel a bit played out, and the mood appeared to be shifting towards either more complete single-player experiences, or the early live-service games we know today.But nowadays, the people yearn for games that deliver the sense of accomplishment when hitting credits, but also don't require the kind of time investment most games demand. Dispatch perfectly models itself after the cable TV shows of old, with each episode adhering to a winning formula that never overstays its welcome.Set in a modern-day Los Angeles — except in this version of the city, there are actual superheroes working together at a private security firm — Dispatch is best understood as a workplace comedy. Think The Office crossed over with The Boys. Players are asked to make both small and large choices as the hero, Robert Robertson III, which will not only determine his personality, but have big ramifications for how the story plays out. A short intro sets the stage for the episode's plot, while in the middle is an interactive dispatching sim, followed by a big finale, a needle drop, and roll credits. A little formulaic, but so was television during the pre-prestige TV era.Furthering the TV connection, Dispatch's fully voiced storyline has a wonderful cast of TV alumni including Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, and thanks to a partnership with Critical Role, fan-favorite voice actors like Laura Bailey and Matt Mercer.For the past week, playing Dispatch became a nightly ritual where after dinner, I'd retreat into the office for a single episode's worth of Dispatch before returning to the living room to do something else for the evening. Just like a TV season, Dispatch is broken up into eight episodes, each about an hour, not including end credits. While there is always the urge to keep pushing forward and play right into the next episode, each section felt so perfectly calibrated for a single session of gaming that I could leave the next episode for the next night and not feel a pang of anxiety or FOMO. If anything, I could take the time to think over the choices I made in the previous episode, many of which feel weighty and substantial.I don't want to give the wrong impression about Dispatch by constantly comparing it to TV. Dispatch is first and foremost a game, and a damn good one too. The hero-dispatching sim alone is worthy of praise, and, ironically, something I could play endlessly. But there's a confidence in direction that oozes from Dispatch. They know just when to hit you with the credits, knowing full well you will feel satisfied leaving the game until the next week when new episodes are set to drop.The combination of talent, writing, and production in Dispatch all come together into a potent mix--a truly satisfying one too, which is not a description I've used for many games this year. You should read GameSpot's positive review of course, but Dispatch has seemingly hit the perfect chord with players to the tune of 2 million copies sold. A major success for a new IP from a brand-new studio, and while I could go on about all the ways Dispatch has become a surprise hit of the year for me, the best thing about my time with it has been, well, that I spent a pretty short amount of time with it. Or rather, I spent the perfect length of time with it.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Darryn Bonthuys\n   on December 5, 2025 at 6:33AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Netflix has formally announced its intent to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery for the eye-watering sum of $82.7 billion. While the deal is far from done and will require regulatory approval, the buyout is expected to be completed by Q3 2026 and will give Netflix ownership of numerous movies and TV franchises, as well as Warner Bros.' video games division.While the focus of this proposed deal has been on everything but video games, Netflix could gain a significant foothold in the video game industry by acquiring Warner Bros. Games. The publisher owns several major studios, including those responsible for hit games such as the Batman: Arkham series, Mortal Kombat, and Hogwarts Legacy. Things have been turbulent behind the scenes lately with big flops like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the cancellation of the long-in-development Wonder Woman game, and the closure of Monolith Productions. More recently, the focus has been put on games from four established IP: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC.Next year will see the release of Traveller's Tales' Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, and Avalanche Studios is reportedly working on a sequel to Hogwarts Legacy. Among the big studios are numerous developers under the Warner Bros. Games umbrella, responsible for several big games across multiple platforms. Here's a closer look at the video game developers that Netflix could take complete ownership of next year.Portkey GamesPortkey Games is the publishing label that handles all games set in the Harry Potter Wizarding World franchise.Avalanche SoftwareFounded in 1995, Avalanche Software worked on numerous games like NFL Blitz and the Disney Infinity toys-to-life series. Eventually closed by Disney in 2016, Warner Bros. acquired the studio and reopened it in 2017. Its first release under Warner Bros. Games was Hogwarts Legacy, the No. 1 best-selling game in the US for 2023.NetherRealm StudiosFollowing Midway Games' filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Warner Bros. purchasing all of its assets, NetherRealm Studios was born from the ashes of Midway Chicago. The studio has been a hub for the development of fighting games, as it revived Mortal Kombat for the modern era and the DC Universe fighting game series Injustice.Rocksteady StudiosFamous for its work on the Batman: Arkham series, the last game from Rocksteady Studios was the critically panned Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. It's rumored that the developer is returning to the Arkham series for its next project.TT GamesAcquired by Warner Bros. in 2007, TT Games is the holding company overseeing several other studios that produce PC, console, and mobile games.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The upcoming Tomb Raider TV series for Prime Video will be an \"ambitious reimagining of the Lara Croft universe,\" according to the producers at Story Kitchen.In a post on the production company's website first spotted by Infinity Tomb Raider, Story Kitchen said the series represents a \"landmark partnership\" between Story Kitchen and Amazon MGM Studios. Story Kitchen said this partnership will \"reinvent the franchise on a massive scale.\"The statement added that the aim is to have the live-action show and Tomb Raider video game franchise become interconnected \"into a unified storytelling experience.\" This could mean a lot of things, but Amazon had previously said the TV show was not going to connect to Amazon's new Tomb Raider game. Amazon's statement was made more than a year ago, and the live-action show reportedly underwent significant upheaval prior to its re-announcement with Sophie Turner in the lead role. In addition to Turner as Lara Croft, the show will feature British actor Martin Bobb-Semple as a series regular on the show, though his role was not confirmed. Bobb-Semple is perhaps best known for his recurring roles on All American: Homecoming and One of Us is Lying.As announced previously, Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the creator, writer, and executive producer for the series, with Chad Hodge (Single All the Way, Wayward Pines) joining as co-showrunner and executive producer. Shogun director Jonathan van Tulleken has also come aboard as executive producer and director.Before Turner, the actors Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander brought the character Lara Croft to life in film. For her part, Turner said she is \"thrilled beyond measure\" to play Croft.\"They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking,\" she said.Production on the Tomb Raider TV show is expected to begin in January 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

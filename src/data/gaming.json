    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In February 2023, Wizards of the Coast closed an internal game development studio, and with it cancelled multiple unannounced titles, one of them being Whimpact!, a \"Pokemon meets Fall Guys\" online multiplayer game. Rather than let it die, Leah Hoyer, who was at the time VP of creative for WotC, opened her own studio called Level Headed Games, acquired the rights to Whimpact!, and continued development--and it's set to release in early access soon.Whimpact! drops players into the world of Whims, cute little creatures that pass along magical powers to those who collect and care for them. The more they're cared for, the stronger those powers will be. Up to eight players will be able to join together in co-op arena-style gameplay as they collect Whims, gather mystical energy called Starcane, and navigate obstacles while fighting hordes of robotic invaders trying to steal the energy for themselves.          Gallery                                                                                                There are seven different types of Whims to collect, each with six different color variants. The power each Whim gives the player will depend on its color, with powers including increased speed, increased strength, high jumping ability, longer jumping ability, and more. Players will be able to mix and match powers, including swapping Whims on the fly, during a match as well.Both the player characters and the Whims can also be customized with cosmetics including clothing, weapon skins, and the ability to decorate a home base for their characters called a Home Tile. The debut trailer gives us a look at some of the items players will be able to equip, including clothes, hats, and a watermelon sword.No official release window has been announced for Whimpact! as of this writing, but the game will launch on PC in early access when it does become available.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Krafton has also announced that PUBG Studios will have a closed alpha test for Black Budget in December on PC.PUBG: Black Budget is introducing more sci-fi and fantasy elements by setting the action on Coli, an island that is locked in a repeating time loop while under threat from the Anomaly, a supernatural phenomenon of unknown origin. The game will also place an emphasis on \"exploration and discovery\" instead of relying on non-stop combat. Players are tasked with finding \"top-secret technology\" while attempting to learn more about SAPIENS, a black-budget initiative. The matches will will consist of PvPvE battles.Promo art for PUBG: Black Budget.Gallery                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Info about signing up for the closed alpha test is already on Steam, and the event will last for six days spread across two weeks. The first test period will be held from December 12-14, with the second following on December 19-21.Participating players are invited to share clips and gameplay videos during the test. Players will also be given the chance to earn access keys from Twitch Drops that will be held during the event.Krafton recently shared its desire to turn PUBG into a platform like Roblox or Fortnite. The publisher also invested $70 million towards a stated goal of becoming \"an AI-first\" company. Krafton subsequently accepted voluntary resignations from employees, while PUBG creator Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene expressed his distaste for AI and revealed that he's glad to see the public outcry against it.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Xbox Partner Preview showed off a bunch of cool and interesting projects coming to Xbox consoles and PC in the future, including Armatus, The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu, and Raji: Kaliyuga. However, the event itself bucked an annoying trend that other trailer showcases continue to follow, as each trailer that aired during the event showed the logos for every console the game will launch on, not just Xbox.Traditionally, when a game makes an appearance during one of these events, the final shot confirms the game for the host company's consoles--PlayStation consoles for Sony, the Switch or Switch 2 for Nintendo, and so on. However, in yesterday's event the PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2 logos appeared multiple times throughout the showcase.The final shot from the Armatus trailer that aired during the Xbox Partner Preview.Of the 16 titles shown during the Xbox Partner Preview, 13 of them included either a PlayStation or Nintendo Switch logo in their ending graphic. The three exceptions were Echo Generation 2, Roadside Research, and Cloverpit, but all three of them are, as of this writing, only coming to Xbox consoles.This small detail seems to be another nod toward Xbox's strategy of catering to as many platforms as possible through its \"This is an Xbox\" campaign and Xbox Play Anywhere, where players purchase a game on one platform and have access to it on Xbox, PC, and mobile devices. The Partner Preview yesterday, in fact, began with the confirmation that every game shown during the event would have Xbox Play Anywhere capabilities.The Xbox Partner Preview brought 16 game updates and new reveals, including Vampire Crawlers from poncle, the previously-mentioned Armatus from Godfall developer Counterplay Games, and Tides of Annihilation from Chinese studio Eclipse Glow Games.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The existence of a long-rumored remake of Capcom's Resident Evil 0 is now looking even more likely, with a new report corroborating not only that its existence but also new details about the game's cast and story.As reported by MP1st, the rumored remake of the 2002-prequel is officially being referred to within Capcom as project \"Chamber,\" seemingly a reference to the game's main protagonist Rebecca Chambers. The game has reportedly been in development for several years, with performance-capture work starting sometime in 2024.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Ode to Horror: A Celebration of Resident Evil\n      \nThat same \"Chamber\" codename appears on the resume of actor Jon McLaren, known for playing Star Lord in Square Enix's 2021 Guardians of the Galaxy game. His resume lists \"Project Chamber\" as his most recent video game project, labeling it as an upcoming AAA game in which he plays a lead character. He also lists the project as coming from the motion-capture company Beyond Capture Studios. It's that same motion capture studio that has worked with Capcom on games like Street Fighter 6 and the Resident Evil 4 remake.While it's not confirmed who McLaren is playing in the remake, it's likely Billy Coen, the male lead in Resident Evil 0 who aids Chambers in her mission to uncover more about a zombie outbreak on the outskirts of Raccoon City.Resident Evil 0's opening hours take place on a zombie-infested train, and according to MP1st, the remake will more fully flesh out various plot details and characters only alluded to in the original. That includes making the train's conductor a full-fledged character that interacts with Chambers and Coen rather than only being referenced like in the original.As for when the Resident Evil 0 remake will arrive, it's likely still a few years away. A recent statement from frequent Capcom leaker DuskGolem points towards the Resident Evil 0 remake not releasing until 2028, with another rumored remake, Code Veronica, set for 2027. Neither remake has been officially announced by Capcom.The next mainline entry in the series, Resident Evil Requiem, is coming February 27, 2026. It stars the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft, and will finally return the franchise to Raccoon City.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders is all about looting and shooting your way through a map and hoping to make it back home safely to Speranza. Every moment counts, and every container in the game could end up having that item that makes all the stress of the run worth it. So, it makes sense you may be disappointed to come across a Security Breach locker you can't open. Anything at all could be in there just waiting for you to take it home, right? Well, you might need to put in some time to make it happen, but here's how you can get to opening Security Breach lockers in Arc Raiders.How to open Security Breach lockers in Arc RaidersBefore you'll be able to open any Security Breach lockers you stumble across, you'll first need to buy the aptly-named Security Breach skill from the skill tree. You can access the skill tree by selecting Raider > Skill Tree while in Speranza.The Security Breach skill is in the Survival path of the skill tree.The Security Breach skill is the final node in the Survival (red) path on the right of the skill tree. To unlock this skill, you'll need to place at least 36 points into the Survival path, which is a hefty investment. We'll get into whether it's worth it or not a bit further down.With the Security Breach skill unlocked, you can breach and search any Security Breach locker.Once you've purchased the Security Breach skill--presumably with your 37th skill point in the Survival path--you'll be able to breach any Security Breach locker in the game to have a look inside. You'll also now be able to search any of these lockers that have already been opened by other players--though it's not likely they've left much behind for you.Is the Security Breach skill worth it?Security Breach was once an invaluable skill, as Security Breach lockers very often contained purple weapons like Bobcats, Tempests, and Vulcanos. However, developer Embark nerfed this skill soon after launch to bring down the frequency at which these items dropped from the container. As such, it's worth asking whether it's still worth investing 37 total points into the Survival path of the skill tree.Security Breach lockers still often contain worthwhile loot despite the nerf.We'd argue it's still quite worth the investment to buy the Security Breach skill. While you won't find purple rarity weapons with nearly the same frequency, it's still a fantastic way to gain some fast and high-quality resources as you're looting throughout a map. These lockers will usually offer a green or blue gun, a few stacks of ammo, and a solid chance at gun parts or Mod Components. And, of course, there's still always a chance at one of those purple guns, so there's never harm in checking.Additionally, there are a lot of excellent skills in the Survival path that speed up looting, improve your weight limitations, and even allow for in-game crafting. With that in mind, you're not really wasting many skill points along the way to Security Breach.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                During Fortnite Chapter 6, most every cosmetic you could unlock from a pass or for free was earned simply by gaining XP in any mode. But Epic has returned to the old ways in Chapter 7, with unlockable cosmetics that require completing specific quests. Case in point is the Born in Chaos mini pass for Fortnite's new South Park crossover, which comes with a series of quests that you'll need to complete in order to unlock the otherwise-free cosmetics.That means that if you want to get those Terrance and Phillip doll pickaxes, you'll actually need to pay attention to these quests. Some of them you'll certainly complete by accident if you play Fortnite regularly, but others will require a bit of conscious effort. And we'll make it just a smidge easier by handling the thinking part for you--which is to say that we'll explain each quest in detail below.All of these quests must be completed in Battle Royale or Zero Build, and they provide pass progress only. The quests themselves don't offer XP directly, but there are three level skips you can unlock as you progress the event pass, and you can already earn one of them (worth 80,000 XP) by completing five quests. Completing four quests from a batch will award a Memberberry--collecting six Memberberries awards the Imaginationland Airship glider.Table of Contents [hide]Fortnite Born In Chaos Part 1 questsRide 5 different rides or eliminate 5 players at CartmanlandHit opponents with SMGs 100 timesAfter getting knocked, eliminate a playerBecome a bossUse Flushers in three different matchesDamage opponents (200 points) within 10 seconds of swimmingFortnite Born In Chaos Part 1 questsCartmanland is sure to be a popular landing spot for the duration of Fortnite's new South Park event.Ride 5 different rides or eliminate 5 players at CartmanlandSince Cartmanland will be a hotspot for the duration of this event, you shouldn't have any problem finding victims to try to defeat. But if you'd prefer the nonviolent route, you can ride five rides instead. These are the rides you'll find at Cartmanland:The roller coaster that goes around the entire parkThe ferris wheel in the centerThe big waterslide in the northwest cornerThe lazy river that goes all the way around the parkThe shooting gallery directly north of the park entranceAll you need to do with these is briefly interact with them. For example, simply starting up the shooting gallery game is enough--you don't need to actually play it. You'll need to interact with all five of them for the quest to complete.Hit opponents with SMGs 100 timesThis one is exactly as simple as it sounds. Just use an SMG to hit enemies (NPCs and players both count) with 100 SMG shots. Each bullet that lands on an enemy counts, so it'll take a few fights to complete this one.After getting knocked, eliminate a playerWhat this quest is saying is that you'll need to get a kill at any point during a match after you've been knocked or eliminated yourself. This includes after being knocked and rezzed by your teammates or with a self-res, or even being eliminated entirely and then rebooted, either by your teammates or using the new Kenny token, which gives you one free reboot immediately after you're eliminated. It might be easier in a group, but it's certainly doable in solo as well.Become a bossWhen you defeat a boss NPC around the map this season, they drop a token that allows you to take their appearance and special abilities. This quest requires you to pick up one of those tokens.Use Flushers in three different matchesFlushers are the port-a-potties that are all over the place, often letting players travel through a pipe to another port-a-potty nearby. You just need to use them across several matches.Damage opponents (200 points) within 10 seconds of swimmingShoot the bad guys (NPCs and players both count) right after you jump out of the water. One fully healed and shielded player is enough--if you've got the aim, anyway. But you don't need to get all 200 hit points in one encounter.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders was a breakout hit in 2025, and it's still growing. New data from Alinea Analytics states that the game enjoyed its biggest day ever on Sunday, January 4, when it came to daily active users.It was reported to have had 3.2 million daily active users on January 4 across platforms. Additionally, the research group said Arc Raiders passed 12 million copies sold over the weekend.The number of Arc Raiders copies sold daily began to \"stabilize\" in early December, but the recent 20%- off sale--which brought the price down to $32--along with a boost related to people being off from school and work for the holidays, helped pump up daily sales figures, the report said.Alinea also reported that the $40 Arc Raiders has now reached more than $350 million in estimated revenue across all platforms. On Steam, the game is faring particularly well, accounting for 53.5% of total sales in January so far. Additionally, the game's 24-hour peak concurrent figure of 466,372 is just about 3% off the game's all-time peak of 481,966 players on Steam.Arc Raiders is a big success, but it also has its critics who took issue with the game's use of artificial intelligence systems for its voice lines. Developer Embark recently defended the use of AI, with Embark boss Patrick Söderlund saying, \"People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fans have had over 20 years of the Saw franchise, and John Wick is already celebrating over 10 years, with a fifth installment possibly on the way. Saw has become a contemporary iconic horror series that has spun off into a slew of merchandise, had its own Halloween Horror Nights house, and even a video game back in 2009 and its sequel. While Wick doesn't have the level of crossover appeal--though both Wick and Jigsaw's puppet have appeared in Fortnite--Lionsgate is looking to take both Jigsaw and Wick into video games for a new generation. On a recent earnings call, Lionsgate chairman Adam Fogelson mentioned that there is \"increased interest and increased opportunity\" to make new AAA games based on Lionsgate IPs. Fogelson specifically mentioned Wick and Saw. \"Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities around John Wick and Saw and some others that we'll be announcing soon, we're seeing increased interest and increased opportunity, and we remain on schedule,\" he said (via Seeking Alpha). \"So I think in totality, you are going to see a meaningfully additive financial opportunity coming in the coming years.\"Back in 2023, Lionsgate admitted that it was looking into a video game adaptation for Wick. Lionsgate president Joe Drake said Lionsgate is \"continuing to have those conversations\" about moving the Keanu Reeves-led franchise to games, adding that there was a ton of energy\" around the prospect of making a John Wick video game. Nothing came out of those proposals; instead, the world expanded with the spin-off film Ballerina and the prequel series The Continental. With Saw, both games weren't well-received, and so maybe the third time's the charm for Jigsaw and his macabre puzzles and deathtraps. Lionsgate had previously adapted the Blair Witch franchise into a game as well, with equal tepid fanfare. \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Despite what you might hear online, Microsoft is indeed working on a next-generation Xbox. While it's far too early for the Xbox team to share anything concrete about this upcoming machine, Xbox President Sarah Bond teased some vague details about what to expect.Speaking to Mashable in a video interview, Bond addressed rumors that the next Xbox will function similarly to a gaming PC, saying that \"the next-gen console is gonna be a very premium, very high-end curated experience.\"Bond added that with the recently released handheld ROG Xbox Ally, we're \"starting to see some of the thinking that [the Xbox team has], but I don't want to give it all away.\"          Even with Xbox Series X|S struggling in sales numbers compared to PlayStation 5, it would be shocking if the next console from Microsoft were anything but a \"premium\" and \"high-end\" device. But Bond's comment about a \"curated experience\" should inspire speculation, as she didn't directly address murmurs of the next Xbox being PC-like.Executives on the Xbox team have previously stated that the company is focused on building dedicated devices with optimized gaming experiences, with the ROG Xbox Ally being a big part of that initiative. The new handheld emphasizes the Xbox full-screen-experience UI, which also allows users to access games from other PC storefronts, such as Steam. Bringing this interface and functionality to a console would mark a wholly different approach from the competition.Of course, based on what we've seen of the Xbox full-screen experience, the software needs a lot more work. GameSpot's impressions of the ROG Xbox Ally described the operating system as \"undoubtedly frustrating\" to use.No matter how flexible or functional the next Xbox console might be, Xbox still needs to win back some goodwill from consumers after price hikes for the Xbox Series X|S consoles and Xbox Game Pass.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Following a price hike for Xbox consoles sold to consumers implemented earlier this year, Microsoft is now raising hardware prices for developers. Microsoft has confirmed that it has raised the price of a Xbox Development Kit (XDK), with the price reportedly going up from $1,500 to $2,000. That's a 33% hike.\"The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told The Verge, without confirming the exact dollar amount that the site reported. \"We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts.\"When Microsoft announced the price increase for Xbox consoles sold to consumers, the technology giant also cited macroeconomic concerns. The price increases are likely in response to US President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports from China, which are 30% currently.The Verge said the price hike for XDKs are going up in the US, Europe, and other parts of the world.The XDK's price factors in its 40GB Of GDDR6 memory, compared to 16GB on the Xbox Series X consumer model, along with more compute units. These XDKs also include three USB ports, debugging tools, a front panel display, and other elements not found in consumer models.Microsoft has also raised prices on Xbox Game Pass, with the Ultimate tier going up 50% to $30/month. The company has admitted that price increases are \"never fun for anybody,.\" Microsoft CFO Amy Hood is reportedly mandating increasing margins at all divisions, including Xbox.Microsoft will release its next earnings report on October 29, at which point the company will share an update on how much money it's made over the past three months.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

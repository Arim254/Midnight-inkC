    "body": "\n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                It's only been a couple of weeks since Fortnite introduced a new Stranger Things island for its Blitz Royale mode, but we're already moving on to the next thing. On December 4, Epic swapped out the Stranger Things island for a new island based on the Chapter 5 Battle Royale map. I hope you like Flowberries, because things are about to get fizzy.The Chapter 5 map, for those who don't recall or weren't around for it, was based on the geography and architecture of Mediterranean Europe. It's got a winery in the northwest where you can find lots of flowberries — which give shields and a temporary low-gravity effect — a massive modern mansion on the north end, a pair of towns on the east and south ends, and a small airport in the southwest.While the map is broadly based on the Chapter 5 island, two of these new spots are actually inspired by the new Chapter 7 map that was just introduced on November 29. Holloway House refers to Cat Holloway, a celebrity character on the Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass, and is similar to the homes of Humble Hills. Likewise, Boutique Bay draws inspiration from the retail stores of Latte Landing and Ripped Tides.If you're a Blitz Royale fan who's experiencing a bit of whiplash over the Stranger Things island being removed so quickly after it was added, there are signs that Blitz Royale may soon begin rotating its maps periodically the same way Reload maps do. So it could be that the Stranger Things island will return sooner than you think--which is good, since the series finale is coming at the end of the month.For a better look at the new spots on the Blitz Royale Starfall Island map, scroll on."

This map is set in the same town as Black Ops 6's Zombies mode, but this version of Liberty Falls depicts the locale in its pre-outbreak state, so the map looks like a quaint West Virginia town nestled in Appalachia. In this guide, we highlight the full Haven's Hollow map and main points of interest.In terms of size, Haven's Hollow is bigger than Warzone's Rebirth Island but is slightly smaller than Fortune's Keep. There are nine main points of interest, offering a decent variety of locations to explore.Despite this being pre-outbreak, Black Ops 6 Zombies fans will still recognize several areas. Haven's Hollow includes the church, mansion, motel, bowling alley, and other major locations from Liberty Falls, but the playable space also extends beyond the areas within the Zombies maps. This expansion adds brand-new areas to explore, such as the Lumbermill, Riverboat, and Train Station.The full Haven's Hollow map can be viewed below, including closer looks at main POIs and surrounding areas.Season 1 of Black Ops 7 and Warzone includes a brand-new battle pass, more maps, and new DLC weapons to unlock.Full Haven's Hollow map layoutAll Haven's Hollow main POIs:MansionPondTrain StationBarnResearch CenterMain StreetRiver BoatCoal DepotLumbermillMansionMansion is located in the northern part of the map. This area will be instantly familiar if you played the Shattered Veil Zombies map in Black Ops 6. This lets you loot inside Richtofen's mansion, visit the giant T-Rex fossil, and explore both floors of the building. There is also an ascender to let you reach the rooftop for a better view and vertically.PondPond is a beautiful open area in the northwest portion of the town. The water is shallow, so you can still run through the area, and you'll probably want to keep moving, as this part of the map doesn't provide a lot of cover.Train StationVisit the town's Train Station on the west side of Haven's Hollow, which offers a flat area of land with clean lines of sight. There is a center station to explore and a few small building interiors for close-quarters fights as well. Following the train tracks will take you toward Main Street or to the cliffside that leads to the map's outer edge.BarnBarn serves as a center hub of the map, and this point of interest includes two major areas. There's the town's chapel and a massive barn. Both areas should give you plenty of loot and high, rooftop vantage points. These areas should be great for sniping and getting a lay of the land.Research CenterFound in the northeast corner of the map, Research Center offers you access to Haven's Lab and a smaller data center building. The lab gives you a large three-level structure with an atrium in the middle, which offers plenty of real estate for looting. The area outside is mostly parking lot space and pathways that provide long, open sightlines.Main StreetMain Street is another part of Haven's Hollow that will be familiar if you played BO6 Zombies. This includes the Liberty Falls shops, including the video rental store, ice cream shop, bowling alley, and other locations. This is where a lot of close-quarters action can happen, and there are plenty of loot opportunities as well.RiverboatHaven's Hollow expands Liberty Falls all the way down south to the river, and you can explore the Haven's Gamble luxury paddleboat right on the water, which is south of Main Street. Riverboat has three decks to explore and loot, and if things get dicey, you can always jump in the water and swim around the coast.Coal DepotCoal Depot is on the east side of the map, and you'll find it just below the Research Center. This area has a large main building connected by other small buildings and brick walls. There is plenty of cover for both interior and exterior engagements.LumbermillJust like Coal Depot, Lumbermill offers large building space to loot and fight. There are two large buildings here, plus smaller structures to explore. It also has a large silo outside, which makes a great vantage point for snipers.    \n  \n                      "

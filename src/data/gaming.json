Recently, EA's Battlefield 6 launched on October 10 and reached more than 745,000 peak concurrent players. That makes it the No. 14 biggest Steam game of all time based on concurrent players. It's the second time that Battlefield 6 ranks in the top 20 as well, as the game's open beta stands at No. 2 with more than 520,000 peak concurrent players.In this post, we're rounding up the top 20 most popular games of all time on Steam based on peak concurrent users. The data was supplied by SteamDB.There are some important things to know about this list. It includes both free-to-play and paid games, along with the non-traditional \"game\" called Banana where players continuously click the banana until they get a new one.Another thing to know is that the numbers in this list do not represent a game's entire reach, as the figures pertain only to Steam games on PC. Plenty of the games on this list are available via other PC storefronts, on console, or Game Pass. Finally, the nature of concurrent players means it's only a snapshot of one moment in time. The peak gaming hours in North America and Asia, for example, do not overlap.Finally, you might expect GTA 5 to show up on this list, but it does not, despite being one of the best-selling video games in history. That's because GTA 5 on PC via Steam recently split into two games--GTA V Legacy and GTA V Enhanced. The peak concurrent records for those games are 364,548 for GTA V Legacy and 187,059 for GTA V Enhanced. Combined, this would amount to more than 551,000 people, which would squeeze into the top 20.20. Battlefield 6 Open Beta - 521,079Record achieved on August 9, 2025.19. Path of Exile 2 – 578,569 Record achieved on December 8, 2024.18. Hollow Knight: Silksong - 587,150Record achieve on September 6, 2025.17.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Pokemon Go is celebrating the arrival of fall with the Harvest Festival event from October 10-16. Fall-themed Pokemon like Miltank, Smoliv, and Combee will be appearing more frequently over the next few days, but most exciting is the arrival of two new Pokemon: Dipplin and its evolved form, Hydrapple.Dipplin is another alternate evolution of Applin, originally introduced as part of the Teal Mask DLC for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Like Applin's other evolved forms, however, you'll need to collect a new type of item--Syrupy Apples--before you can get one, and they're a little difficult to get your hands on. Here are some tips to help you get Dipplin and Hydrapple in Pokemon Go.How To Get DipplinThe easiest way to obtain Dipplin is to evolve one from Applin, but you'll need to collect quite a few items first. Specifically, you need 200 Applin Candy and 20 Syrupy Apples to trigger the evolution.Syrupy Apples are a new type of item introduced as part of the Harvest Festival event, and they can be found at PokeStops. Once you've collected the requisite items, you can evolve Applin into Dipplin right from the Pokemon's detail page.How To Get Syrupy ApplesLike Sweet Apples and Tart Apples (which are required to evolve Applin into Appletun or Flapple, respectively), the primary way to obtain Syrupy Apples is at PokeStops. Set a Mossy Lure Module at one of these waypoints, and apples will periodically appear on the map while the module is active.Once you see an apple, simply tap on the item to collect it. However, not every apple can be picked up; sometimes tapping on one will trigger an encounter with a wild Pokemon, so you'll need patience and persistence while trying to collect them.How To Evolve Dipplin Into HydrappleYou won't need any more Syrupy Apples to get a Hydrapple, but you will need to have a lot of candy saved up. It costs 400 Applin candy to evolve Dipplin into Hydrapple. On top of that, you must catch seven dragon-type Pokemon while Dipplin is set as your buddy before you can trigger the evolution, adding a further complication to the process.It typically takes quite a long time to collect 400 candy, but there are a few ways to expedite the process. Since Applin is appearing more frequently during the Harvest Festival event, make sure to use a Pinap Berry before catching the Pokemon to increase the amount of candy you get as a reward. You can also convert any Rare Candy you have stocked up into Applin candy, which will help you reach the 400 requirement faster.Can Dipplin And Hydrapple Be Shiny?Since shiny Applin has not yet been added to Pokemon Go, you can't yet get a shiny Dipplin or Hydrapple in the mobile game. There's no indication when shiny Applin will make its Pokemon Go debut, but new shiny Pokemon are typically introduced during special events, so it'll likely arrive as part of some future event.The Harvest Festival is underway until October 16, but there are plenty of other events still in store for this month, including a Pokemon Legends: Z-A crossover and the annual Halloween celebration. You can read more about everything happening over the next few weeks in our Pokemon Go October events guide.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

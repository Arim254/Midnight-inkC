The friendship mechanic, also known as happiness, determines your teammates' respective affinity toward you, their trainer. This can be improved through various means to help unlock new evolutionary paths.Pokemon can become friendlier toward you through the following methods:Exploring the game world while they're your active buddy.Using various items and equipment.Chilling in cafes and restaurants.Which Pokemon tend to evolve based on friendship levels?Friendship level in Pokemon Legends: Z-A matters to certain creatures whose evolutions are tied to this concept. These include the following:Pikachu - Evolves from a Pichu at high friendship levels.Eevee - Can turn into an Espeon (daytime evolution), Umbreon (nighttime evolution), or Sylveon (evolution with a Fairy-type ability in the moveset).Cleffa - Evolves into a Clefairy.Budew - Evolves into a Roselia during the day.Buneary - Evolves into a Lopunny.Riolu - Evolves into a Lucario during the day.Items that help increase friendship levels: Berries and the Soothe BellVarious items can increase Pokemon happiness and friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. These include different kinds of berries that boost friendship, while also lowering a particular stat. We don't really recommend using these since it's hard to offset the penalties to a Pokemon's stat growth. But if you really want to, you can check unmarked vendor and market stalls all over the city:Pomeg Berry - Lose base points for its HP stat.Kelpsy Berry - Lose base points for its attack stat.Qualot Berry - Lose base points for its defense stat.Hondew Berry - Lose base points for its SP attack stat.Grepa Berry - Lose base points for its SP defense stat.Tamato Berry - Lose base points for its speed stat.Still, one item that's quite viable is the Soothe Bell. It's a reward from Side Mission 36: Some Friendly Competition. Here are a few tidbits:The quest giver NPC is right in front of Cafe Rouleau in Magenta Sector 5. It's in the western part of the map.Defeat the trainer's Clefairy to receive the item.You can have a Pokemon hold the Soothe Bell via the inventory screen. This makes the creature friendlier.Fast friendship boosts via cafes and restaurantsBy far the fastest method of improving friendship and happiness levels involves cafes and restaurants. These are found all throughout Lumiose City:Go to a cafe and purchase a coffee or tea drink. Each option costs roughly 500 gold or more.Do this three or four times to fully max out a Pokemon's affinity toward you. You don't even need to go to a different establishment.You're going to spend 2,000 gold or more each time, but you can still earn a lot of money from the Battle Zone at night.That does it for our guide on how to increase friendship levels in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. If you're keen on improving the capabilities of your teammates, you can visit our best early-game Pokemon guide and TM locations guide.You don't need to face the challenges in Lumiose City all by your lonesome. We've got a Pokemon Legends: Z-A guides hub to help you go from the bottom to the very top of the rankings.    \n  \n                      \n    "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 17, 2025 at 10:53AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Are you excited to catch all the Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A? There are three of these magnificent creatures in Lumiose City: Xerneas, Yveltal, and Zygarde. Of course, taking them on is no easy feat, as you truly need to prove your skills as a trainer. We've got all the details for you in our guide, but be forewarned that there are major spoilers, too.How to catch all Legendary Pokemon In Pokemon Legends: Z-A - Zygarde, Xerneas, and Yveltal locations guideTo be clear, the Legendary Pokemon Zygarde does show up several times throughout the campaign. However, you can only catch it, as well as Xerneas and Yveltal, after completing the main story. Here's a quick summary:After beating the campaign, you wake up at Hotel Z. Chat with your buddies and other NPCs to learn that the Infinite Z-A Royale is underway. This event basically allows you to continue earning tickets from the Battle Zone, leading to a face-off against a rival trainer.Go earn your tickets and defeat your first opponent. Surprisingly enough, it's good ol' Zach the Driver, the fella that you faced when you were still Rank Z. Oh, and he still has low-level creatures like Pidgey and Pikachu.After trouncing your foe, claim your reward from Quasartico Inc. and return to Hotel Z. You're then told about two mythical beasts known as \"The One that Gives\" and \"The One that Takes.\" These unlock two main quest arcs.The One that Gives: Part 1 - Alpha PokemonYou can tackle either of the two quests to get a Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. That said, we opted to prioritize \"The One that Takes.\"Initially, you just need to talk to Mable at the Pokemon Research Center. She'll tell you that Alpha Pokemon have appeared in Wild Zones 3, 5, and 9.Wild Zone 3: Steelix (level 70)Wild Zone 5: Gallade (level 70)Wild Zone 9: Pangoro (level 70)Note: As mentioned in our Pokedex guide, some of these creatures are harder to acquire compared to others. For instance, you need to equip an Onix with a Metal Coat, and you also have to trade it away just to evolve it into a Steelix. As such, you're better off using Ultra Balls to capture these opponents after beating them in combat. They're also Alpha variants, which means they're larger and have at least one move that's not normally learned by their species when leveling up.The One that Gives: Part 2 - Xerneas battleAfter eliminating the three Alpha pokemon, it's time to get your first legendary. To catch Xerneas in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, you need to go to Wild Zone 11. There's a glowing marker at the other side of the river, so approach it to make the level 75 Xerneas spawn.Xerneas is a Fairy-type combatant, which means it's weak against Poison and Steel. For the most part, it will buff itself using Geomancy. It also has a lifesteal ability known as Horn Leech, and a high-damage move called Megahorn.Note: Once Xerneas has been incapacitated, you need to catch it. If you fail in the attempt, you have no choice but to redo the encounter.The One that Takes: Part 2 - Mega EvolutionsThe other main quest arc leads you to Grisham and Griselle, former members of Team Flare. They'll accompany you to Quasartico Inc. to chat with Vinnie. He's got a machine that allows you to fight some familiar foes. They're none other than the Mega Evolved versions of Victreebell, Hawlucha, and Tyranitar. We've discussed these opponents in our Mega Evolutions guide, but here are a few tidbits:Mega Victreebell (level 70) - Weak against Fire abilities. Its ultimate causes an eruption of gooey blobs, with poison pools that linger on the ground.Mega Hawlucha (level 70) - Weak against Psychic and Fairy abilities. It will charge its power for several seconds, before performing a dive-bomb attack in the center of the arena. You can make it flinch to cancel the charge-up animation, but it will still its dive-bomb plunge.Mega Tyranitar (level 70) - Weak against Water and Grass. It will send out spiky tremors that travel along the ground. Dismiss your Pokemon so it doesn't get hit, and keep running sideways to avoid the stalagmites.Note: Unlike the Rogue Mega Evolution bouts in the campaign, you don't have any allies assisting you here. Also, if your character takes too many hits and blacks out during an encounter, you'd have to restart the battle.The One that Takes: Part 2 - Yveltal battleIt's time to catch another Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Your next target is Yveltal, who spawns on the rooftop of Galerie de la Lune, the fashion outlets/shops in the northern part of the city.Yveltal is a Dark/Flying type, making it weak against various elements, including Electric and Ice. However, we recommend bringing a strong Fairy-type creature, such as Clefable, to take it on. Offensive abilities like Moonblast and Dazzling Gleam, combined with the heals from the Moonlight spell, should make this encounter a breeze.Note: Similar to Xerneas, you need to catch Yveltal at the end of the battle. Otherwise, you'll have to fight it again.To Keep the World in Balance: Part 1 - L trainer battleAfter capturing both Xerneas and Yveltal, no additional quest marker will appear. But, if you return to Hotel Z, you'll suddenly be approached by Lysandre, also known as L. You have to face him and his squad of Pokemon, too.Pyroar (level 78) - Normal/FireFlorges (level 78) - FairySableye (level 78) - Dark/GhostGarbodor (level 78) - PoisonNoivern (level 78) - Flying/DragonMega Gyarados (level 80) - Water/DarkTo Keep the World in Balance: Part 2 - Zygarde battleWith Lysandre defeated, you'll have an opportunity to challenge Zygarde in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Go to Wild Zone 20 and find it in the middle of the area. Make sure you're well prepared because this upcoming battle has multiple phases. Here's what you need to know:Zygarde is a level 84 Dragon/Ground-type Pokemon. It's slightly weak against Dragon and Fairy moves, but it's also highly susceptible against Ice damage.Your best bets are Charizard with the Mega Evolution X keystone (Fire/Dragon), the aforementioned Yveltal (Dark/Flying), or Clefable (Fairy).Zygarde \"locks\" your active Pokemon. You won't be able to switch it out unless it gets incapacitated.First phase: Zygarde will be at 10% power--i.e. dog form. It will mostly around the arena while casting Thousand Arrows.Second phase: Zygarde will be at 50% power--i.e. serpent form. It will often use Rock Slide, Crunch, and Dragon Pulse. If your Pokemon has abilities that make it automatically move--i.e. Fly, Megahorn, and the like--then they can deftly avoid Dragon Pulse. Also, when Zygarde charges its ultimate, Land's Wrath, be ready to run away from it.After defeating the two forms of Zygarde, it will turn into its 100% robot-like variant. This is going to be a protracted fight, and you definitely need to be careful here. Certain attacks can hit your character multiple times, causing you to black out.Zygarde's basic attacks include Thousand Arrows and Thousand Waves. Since these are all Ground-based abilities, a Flying Pokemon shouldn't have any problems.Zygarde alternates between two ultimate abilities when it glows. Dismiss your Pokemon beforehand just to be on the safe side:  Core Enforcer - When it flies to the edge of the arena, run away from the center to avoid the beam blast. Then, move to a safe spot on the ground before the ensuing explosion.Land's Wrath - Multiple explosions occur in quick succession and you need to dodge them effectively. Try not to get hit several times.To Keep the World in Balance: Part 3 - Zygarde Mega Evolution and combat mechanicsThe fight might be long and arduous but, if you do everything right, you should be able to catch a Zygarde in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. This creature has fairly unique combat mechanics, too:Note that the Zygardite keystone should be in your inventory since it's a reward from the campaign's finale. Make sure Zygarde has it equipped so it can undergo its Mega Evolution.Lysandre will give you the Zygarde Cube. This allows you to freely switch between Zygarde's 10% form and 50% form during a battle.When Zygarde's HP drops below 50%, it will change to its 100% Complete Form. You can only activate Zygarde's Mega Evolution while it's in this form.Zygarde's Complete Form grants boosted stats, and the Core Enforcer ability also changes to Nihil Light.That does it for our guide on how to catch all Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. We hope you enjoy using Zygarde, Xerneas, and Yveltal in more battles ahead. In any case, since we've mentioned the gameplay mechanic a few times already, you might want to check our Mega Evolutions guide.You don't need to face the challenges in Lumiose City all by your lonesome. We've got a Pokemon Legends: Z-A guides hub to help you go from the bottom to the very top of the rankings.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Aron Garst\n   on October 17, 2025 at 11:40AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                While exploring a spooky house or escaping a killer can be fun on your own, there's nothing quite like playing the best multiplayer horror games and facing off against demons with a few friends by your side. Sometimes screams will be replaced with laughter as you bond over a friend's death or near-death experience. Oftentimes, the fear comes rushing back as soon as you're the last one standing and everyone's survival rests on your shoulders.Quality multiplayer horror games aren't as common as you'd think, though. It's quite difficult to find the right balance between creating fun gameplay and enough scary moments to keep people coming back. Luckily, there are more than enough to keep you entertained during the 2025 spooky season that's taking place right now. Horror is a diverse genre, so be sure to check out the best overall horror games in 2025 and the best horror games on Steam.From gathering evidence to identify ghost types in Phasmophobia, to fighting off hordes of the undead in Left 4 Dead 2, we've compiled a list of the best multiplayer horror games that you can jump into with your friends right now. We're highlighting several cross-play enabled games in this list as well, so you can play with your friends across PC, consoles, and other platforms.PhasmophobiaPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: YesRemember Ghostbusters? Phasmophobia puts you in control of the prep team that goes into haunted locales first. This co-op ghost-hunting simulator tasks players with identifying spirits in haunted locations using a variety of tools. Tension builds as ghosts stalk the team, creating heart-pounding moments. Voice chat integration makes the scares even more immersive, turning every creak and whisper into potential doom.A sensation after its launch in 2020, Kinetic Games' cooperative horror game has received regular updates introducing new maps, ghosts, and items over the past five years. You'll explore haunted lighthouses, high schools, prisons, and even an abandoned psychiatric hospital that made use of some questionable treatments when it was operational. It's no wonder some angry spirits got left behind.Special events bring cosmetics, community-wide scavenger hunts, and decorations throughout the year, and the celebrations include Halloween. Make sure to jump in to see how the haunts are different for the spookiest time of year.Lethal CompanyPlatform: PCOriginally developed in Roblox by solo creator Zeekerss, Lethal Company blends survival horror with chaotic gameplay. Players navigate unpredictable hazards while managing tense objectives, resulting in a mix of panic, strategy, and dark humor. Its multiplayer antics make the scares as entertaining as they are frightening.You are placed under the supervision of The Company, where you're tasked with collecting as much loot as possible from a variety of dangerous planets. You'll land a safe distance away from facilities crawling with creatures of all shapes, sizes, and temperaments--many of which will kill you at a moment's notice. Work together, gather and return loot, upgrade your equipment, and do it all again.Lethal Company, which originally launched in 2023, has seen a handful of updates that have given company employees access to new tools like trucks and teleporters. Those updates have also brought new creatures into the fray, like mischievous kidnapper foxes and protective mother birds.REPOPlatform: PCREPO is all about surviving while collecting. Similar to Lethal Company, players must move quickly to meet quotas while avoiding deadly threats, making every decision crucial. Multiplayer adds an extra layer of intensity, as coordination and quick thinking can mean the difference between life and death.You'll play as one member of a team as you scour different locales for valuable loot. REPO adds another layer of comedy with an even more ridiculous physics system. Much of your cooperative efforts will be figuring out how to lift gigantic statues and carefully navigate them down hallways so they aren't damaged and lose value. The majority of the time you'll probably end up dead while trying, though.Dead by DaylightPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo SwitchCross-play: YesA modern horror classic, Dead by Daylight pits one killer against four survivors in tense, asymmetrical gameplay. A gigantic roster of licensed killers and victims, including everyone from Nicolas Cage (playing himself) to the demogorgon from Stranger Things, will help you live out your wildest horror fantasies--or die trying.Dead by Daylight may not be the first asymmetrical horror game, but it is one that undoubtedly catapulted the popularity of the genre to heights we've never seen before in multiplayer horror. Released in 2016, Behaviour Interactive's creation still boasts tens of thousands of active players at any given moment on Steam. It's proven to be a horror experience with a ton of staying power.The Texas Chain Saw MassacrePlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: YesIn this multiplayer adaptation of the iconic franchise, three players control Leatherface and his family while four others try to escape from various maps with all of their limbs intact. The game balances tense chases with destructible environments, creating a brutally immersive horror experience that captures the film's intensity. It's a memorable spin on asymmetrical horror gameplay, especially as it added to the lore of the films by fleshing out the iconic Sawyer family with new characters from the mind of the original film's writer, Kim Henkel.While no longer receiving regular updates, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre still has a hefty playerbase that can support solo queueing. It's still best to get together with friends and play to enjoy everything the experience has to offer, though.Left 4 Dead 2Platforms: PC, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: NoThis co-op zombie shooter remains a benchmark for multiplayer horror, even 17 years after its predecessor set the standard. It's often been imitated, but never duplicated. Players must work together to survive hordes of infected across sprawling levels. The AI Director dynamically adjusts the game's difficulty, ensuring that every run feels tense and unpredictable. In Versus mode, players can even become the Special Infected themselves, giving the co-op game a PvP twist.While it may lack the slower, quieter moments often found in traditional horror, few experiences match how engaging, adrenaline-inducing, and chaotic Left 4 Dead 2's multiplayer gameplay can be with a team of friends.Aliens: Fireteam ElitePlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo SwitchCross-play: YesAliens: Fireteam Elite pits squads of Colonial Marines against relentless Xenomorph attacks. Teamwork is critical for surviving waves of enemies, with coordinated strategy and positioning often deciding who lives or dies. The game's intense sci-fi atmosphere amplifies the horror. Built in the vein of something like Left 4 Dead, Aliens: Fireteam Elite pits three players against waves of the iconic aliens across various missions and modes, with plenty of new guns and cosmetics to unlock--should you survive.One thing the game absolutely gets right is capturing the look and sound of the Alien universe. From shadowy industrial corridors to sprawling, hive-like chambers, every level feels true to the franchise.Back 4 BloodPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: YesAfter a less-than-stellar launch, this take on Left 4 Dead zombie horde action has steadily transformed into something truly memorable. Turtle Rock Studios, which includes some of the creators of the original Left 4 Dead, has shaped Back 4 Blood into a cooperative experience that trades in the same anxiety-inducing moments that Left 4 Dead created in players nearly 20 years ago.Back 4 Blood is a strong option for multiplayer horror fans who don’t want to return to something as old as Left 4 Dead. It builds on the cooperative zombie-slaying formula with modern systems and a faster pace. Players choose from a diverse cast of “Cleaners,” each with unique abilities that can change the flow of a match, and use a wide arsenal of weapons that range from brutal melee tools to rifles. The game’s card-based system adds a layer of strategy, letting players customize their playstyle with upgrades and modifiers that affect everything from stamina to ammo capacity.Little Nightmares IIIPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Nintendo SwitchWhile the series is best known as a single-player puzzle platformer, Little Nightmares 3 introduces cooperative elements that don't lose the series' touch for dread-inducing encounters with grotesque monsters.. Players must work together to solve puzzles and navigate its dark, atmospheric world, heightening every suspenseful moment.Little Nightmares 3 is relatively short. Most playthroughs will take around five hours to finish. It's especially good for those who haven't played the first two games, because for seasoned players, it may feel a bit samey, but for those who haven't tried a Little Nightmares before, it makes a great introduction to its mysterious world without relying on any prior knowledge of the storyline.Check out our Little Nightmares III review.DemonologistPlatforms: PCSimilar to Phasmophobia, Demonologist turns players into paranormal investigators confronting supernatural threats. Multiplayer intensifies the suspense, as success depends on coordination, quick thinking, and sharing crucial information while confronting increasingly powerful spirits.Rather than have ghosts live in sandbox environments like Phasmaphobia, Demonologist developer Clock Wizard Games has curated an experience where scares are somewhat telegraphed in more detailed environments that elicit plenty of scares. It's not as well-suited for repeated playthroughs, but still a worthy entry in the growing Phasmophobia-like genre.The Outlast TrialsPlatforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SCross-play: YesSet in the universe of the single-player Outlast games, Outlast Trials lets players experience survival horror in a cooperative multiplayer setting. Teams must navigate a series of deadly experiments, solve environmental puzzles, and avoid horrifying enemies that can strike at any moment, making communication and coordination essential for survival. You can't fight back. All you can do is run.This multiplayer approach amplifies the already nerve-wracking tension of the series, as players not only contend with the game's terrifying threats but also rely on one another to make it through each harrowing trial. The combination of unpredictable scares, claustrophobic environments, and high-stakes teamwork creates an intense horror experience that keeps players on edge.Even though it's been over two years since release, The Outlast Trials is still getting new content. A PvP mode is being added to the game in October 2025.    \n  \n                      "

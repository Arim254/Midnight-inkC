    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Fanelli\n   on December 9, 2025 at 12:30PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Time to get wholesome!While big, explosive video games with fast action and heavy drama are fun to play, sometimes you might be in the mood for something a little more lowkey, where you can simply turn on the game and lose yourself in it for a while. That's where the games featured in Wholesome Snack come in, as this showcase is tuned specifically to present games with a cozier, lighter side.Twenty-two games appeared on the menu in this year's Wholesome Snack, ranging from long-awaited sequels like Coffee Talk Tokyo, to new games like Arcane Eats and Fishbowl. The gallery below lists all 22 games shown off during today's presentation.The Wholesome Games initiative, run by a team of just four people, is \"driven by the core values of finding and sharing games that are artistically driven, inclusive, and emotionally resonant.\" The organization also includes a publishing arm, Wholesome Games Presents, with its most recent published games including MakeRoom and Is This Seat Taken?Thrifty BusinessSpellgarden Games began Wholesome Snack 2025 with Thrifty Business, in which players will own and operate a vintage thrift shop straight out of the 1990s. Everything in the store, from shelving arrangements to the decor on the walls, can be customized to the player's liking before customers come in and peruse the wares.Lost and Found Co.Lost and Found Co. stars the adorable Ducky, who works for a company that helps those in need find lost objects hidden in the world. Players will help Ducky find the hidden objects, solve puzzles, and more across multiple maps, from serene river scenes to bustling marketplaces. b-e-e-t-l-e: be right back!Next up was b-e-e-t-l-e: be right back, developed by a two-person team called Paul and Viv, which sees a cute little gator guy set off on a quest to find his pet beetle.

The follow-up to Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, Moomintroll sees the valley covered in snow and ice, and he must set off on a journey to free the land from Lady of the Cold.VerdantThe words \"post-apocalyptic adventure\" don't normally sound cozy, but Verdant's alternate version of 1980s Germany is trying to change that. Players will assume the role of a young adventurer trying to navigate this new world, while also finding their place within it.Spirit CrossingSpirit Crossing, the latest from Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox, is a cooperative life sim where players will build a village in a world of ancient ruins, spirits, and storms. Fishing, exploration, and even a little dancing will all be part of the village-building experience. Travel Pack!Travel Pack is a narrative adventure with an interesting twist: The story is told through board games. As you meet new people and play games with them, you'll begin to learn more about them simply based on the way they use the on-screen tiles and figures to play the games with you.Mirage: Miracle Quest!Mirage: Miracle Quest is a new RPG from the team at the incredibly named Toe Bean Club. Players will control a \"freelance exorcist\" as they travel through a hand-painted world inspired by multiple real-world cultures, including France, Japan, and Madagascar.

Find Your WordsA new project from two members of Capybara Games, Find Your Words is a short and cozy adventure set at a children's summer camp. Players will play at the beach, hike through the forest, and more as they help a new camper find their way to new friendships. Arcane EatsThis roguelike deckbuilder from Wonderbelly Games and Skystone Games puts players in the role of a master chef, who uses cards to concoct new and exotic meals to feed hungry customers. Decks are designed with specific food types in mind, and factors like cooking time and energy output must also be considered when building the perfect meal.CatchMakerCatchMaker mixes bug-catching and matching minigames in a cute and cozy new adventure from Grand Duck Games. Players will befriend a group of indigenous people on a faraway island, while exploring the player-character's past in order to unlock its secrets.PANdemonium: Merge!If you've ever played a merge game like Threes, PANdemonium: Merge takes that familiar setup and throws it into the frying pan, where pan movements will cause the food items within to merge together. Keep flipping to see what sort of wild merges you can make, but don't let your food fall out!ZitifonoZitifono is a light adventure game set on a line of tropical islands. Players will explore the islands using trains, boats, and other modes of transportation, while also solving puzzles to dig deep into the secrets the islands are keeping. Coffee Talk TokyoChorus Worldwide Games brings its popular barista-like Coffee Talk to the shores of Japan with Coffee Talk Tokyo, where the patrons are a mixture of ordinary humans and otherworldly yokai. The clip shown during Wholesome Snack followed a child trying to share some good news, but who keeps getting overshadowed by the adults in the room. MandrakeMandrake is a rural life sim set in a world inspired by British history and folklore and dotted with mystical powers and fantastical creatures. In the Wholesome Snack clip, our hero is greeted by the Yolf, a small creature looking to be repaid for long-standing debts, even though it was the character's ancestors who initially made the deal.  ReStoryThe creators of I Am Future are now in the technology-repair business, as ReStory is a shop-management simulator where players will restore game consoles, computers, and other tech from the era of Y2K. Dialogue-based choices will arise during the game as well, and the way players respond will affect the story's next direction.D-TopiaD-Topia places players in the role of a \"facilitator\" for a world-controlling AI, and his goal is to keep the residents of the titular D-Topia happy, however possible. Players will solve puzzles and interact with the AI in order to \"maximize happiness\" and keep the peace in D-Topia.Bits & BopsThe final announcement from Wholesome Snack 2025 will appeal to rhythm fans, as the showcase gave us a new look at upcoming rhythm game Bits & Bops. Several new minigames were shown off in the new trailer, along with a big surprise: Bits & Bops is available on Steam now.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Game Awards host and organizer Geoff Keighley has opened up on the challenges of running a show that aims to celebrate games and the people who make them while also acknowledging the challenging times people in the industry today are facing. So far in 2025, numerous developers lost their jobs, Microsoft canceled games, and the industry further consolidated with EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia.Speaking to The Game Business, Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this. Amir Satvat was given the prize for his work to support people who were laid off in the gaming industry.Keighley hasn't said if this award is coming back in 2025, but it would be a glaring omission if it did not. In any event, Keighley said walking the line between celebrating games and acknowledging current circumstances is no easy task.\"It's a very difficult needle to thread, because on one level, it is a celebration of the industry. But the games are made by incredible developers, and it’s been a challenging period overall. I don't have all the answers about the right way to [address it].\"Keighley went on to say he feels a \"weight\" on his shoulders to do more because The Game Awards has such a large platform. But at the same time, Keighley said he understands that people watch the show to see their favorite games get celebrated and get hyped for the news and reveals.\"How we square that is something that we think a lot about. Some people online think that we're oblivious to it. We're definitely thinking about the right way to represent the industry to the wider world. Do we always get it right? No. It's a very complex situation to figure out exactly what to do,\" he said.People have also criticized The Game Awards (and numerous other entertainment awards shows, for that matter) for not being more heavily focused on the awards themselves, and instead also serving as a marketing events for games. Each year, people regularly criticize the event for zipping through the awards themselves and giving developers a limited time to speak while time and attention is paid to trailers and advertisements from sponsors.\"There are many different constituents that tune in,\" he said. \"And it is a balancing act. \"There's the awards aspect of the show, there's the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements.\"Keighley said his take is that the promise of exciting announcements help create a \"very wide audience\" for who might want to watch the show. More people watching to see the brand-new reveals--including whatever the heck that scary monolith is--will in turn create increased viewership for when the awards are handed out. Or at least that's how Keighley sees it and explains it, and he shared some anecdotes that back up his claims, to an extent.\"My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show. And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they're seen by a lot of people,\" he said. \"Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. Balatro had a huge boost. So hopefully it's a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don't always get it right.\"The Game Awards takes place on Thursday, December 11, beginning at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET, with a pre-show set to begin 30 minutes prior. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 picked up 12 nominations overall, including a nod for Game of the Year, and is the most-nominated game in the history of the show.For more, check out all the categories and nominees below, along with our roundup of the biggest snubs and our predictions for what will be announced.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Since then, the issue has since been resolved, and EA is giving out free season passes and XP boosts for those who were impacted.The issue affected players who had pre-ordered Battlefield 6 via the EA App launcher on PC. An outage on the app left those players high and dry for a good chunk of launch day on October 10. To make things right, EA has issued 12 double hardware XP boosts and 12 double career XP boosts to players affected by the outage.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Battlefield 6 Essential Starter Guide\n      \nIn addition, EA is throwing in a free premium battle pass for Battlefield 6's upcoming Season 1. Those who already own the premium Season 1 battle pass through the game's pricier Phantom Edition will instead receive the Season 2 battle pass for free.Despite the EA App hiccups, Battlefield 6's launch was surprisingly smooth across platforms, especially compared to previous launches for the franchise, many of which resulted in extended periods of server downtime.That said, some players did run into a few other issues players during the launch weekend. One bug, which saw jump momentum affected while using certain weapons, has already been fixed. A problem that still needs addressing allows players in multiplayer matches to get out of bounds and onto rooftops that aren't supposed to be accessible, creating problems for those in a match who aren't taking advantage of the exploit. It remains to be seen when a fix will be coming.Battlefield 6 saw a huge launch weekend, surpassing 747,000 concurrent players on Steam at its peak on launch day. Factor in those playing through the EA App or on consoles, and Battlefield 6 certainly looks to be off to a strong start overall. Battlefield 6 Season 1 will begin October 28, and will introduce multiple new maps, modes, weapons, and more to the game's all-out-warfare sandbox.In GameSpot's Battlefield 6 review, writer Richard Wakeling gave the latest installment of the franchise an 8 out of 10. He noted that while its campaign is dull and forgettable, there's nothing quite like the multipronged chaos of its excellent multiplayer package, even if Battlefield 6 doesn't feel particularly fresh or new.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The Blu-ray box set is up for grabs for only $53.22 (was $100) ahead of its November 11 launch. Preorders for all four seasons of the Shudder TV horror-comedy anthology were previously discounted to around $68. If you ordered your copy at $68 or even $100 like me, your order total has already been adjusted to reflect the best offer before launch. Amazon is also offering a near-50% discount on Shudder's 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition Box Set, which releases the same day for $62.38 (was $120).Creepshow fans can also save big on Arrow Video's recently released 4K Blu-ray restoration of Creepshow 2, which comes with an exclusive comic book adaptation of an unpublished Stephen King short story. Additionally, Amazon has restocked the collectible 4K Blu-ray edition of the original Creepshow anthology film. Creepshow Limited Edition Steelbook is available for only $23 (was $40).The Creepshow TV series box set leans into the franchise's roots and inspirations with a CRT TV display box containing comic book-inspired disc cases. It looks like an awesome collectible for Creepshow fans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Creepshow: Complete Series (Blu-ray)The Creepshow TV series box set leans into the franchise's roots and inspirations with a CRT TV display box containing comic book-inspired disc cases. As shown above, the CRT TV's display clearly can switch between a red background with the series logo and a picture of The Creep, but it's unclear how this mechanism works. In any case, it's one of the cooler display boxes we've seen this year.All four seasons have their own case modeled after the the in-universe Creepshow comics and Stephen King's graphic novel. You'll also get a real comic book based on \"Skeletons in the Closet,\" one of the vignettes in Season 3, Episode 2.If you love Creepshow, you've come to the right place. Along with details on the pair of new and upcoming releases, we put together lists of Creepshow Blu-rays, making-of books, and the ongoing comic book anthology series. So make sure to creep farther down for some great Creepshow deals--unless you'd rather look for yourself, in which case you can check out the Amazon hubs we created: Creepshow Blu-rays | Creepshow books and comics.

It was undoubtedly a huge subscription seller for Shudder, especially Season 1 was the best take on the franchise since the original movie.The anthology series ran for four seasons and 25 episodes, including two TV specials, before ending in 2023. Episodes of Creepshow include a pair of distinct vignettes, roughly 20-25 minutes each.Franchise creators Stephen King and George A. Romero weren't involved with the production, but a few episodes are based on King's short stories, including the show's very first vignette \"Gray Matter,\" adapted from a story in King's excellent collection Night Shift. The 2020 Halloween special adapted \"Survivor Type\" from Skeleton Crew. The back half of the special was based on \"Twittering from the Circus of the Dead\" from the story collection Full Throttle by Joe Hill, who also happens to be King's eldest son.The 9-disc box set has a total runtime of roughly 18 hours. All 23 episodes and the two specials are displayed in 1080p resolution and support DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. Bonus features include cast and crew interviews, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and photo galleries.If you're interested in the behind-the-scenes content, you should also check out Shudder's Creepshow: From Script to Scream, a 240-page coffee-table book with a foreword by Stephen King.

The on-disc special features for the 4K release largely mirror the Special Edition. The reversible sleeve and cover art by Mike Saputo matches the 2016 release, too.Just like the first printing of the 1080p Blu-ray, the 4K release includes two limited-edition booklets. These are no longer included with the standard Blu-ray and were limited to 3,000 units, but now you have another chance. For reference, the first printing has a red sleeve, but after it sells out, it'll likely switch to a blue sleeve like the Blu-ray edition.Most notably, you'll get a booklet with the comic adaptation of \"Pinfall,\" one of the two stories that were cut from the film. The story was written by Stephen King and adapted into a script by George Romero. Jason Mayoh adapted the story into a comic for the Blu-ray release in 2016. Along with the comic booklet, you'll get an illustrated booklet with commentary from Michael Blyth.\"Pinfall\" has never been published as a short story or filmed, so this is the only way to experience one of Stephen King's unpublished stories.Creepshow 2 4K Limited Edition Bonuses\"Pinfall\" comic booklet (adaptation of unpublished King story)Illustrated booklet with commentary on the filmCollector's sleeve with original artwork and reversible cover artFeaturettes, audio commentaries, and interviewsA full list of on-disc special features can be found at the end of this article. For a deep dive on the sequel, check out The Making of Creepshow 2, a 320-page account of the film's production based on production documents and author Lee Karr's conversations with cast and crew.                                                                                                                            Creepshow Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)                                                                $23 (was $40)                                                                                                                                                                                    Though you can watch Creepshow 2 without watching the original, the 1982 anthology is a more well-rounded collection of horror-comedy stories, so it doesn't really make sense to skip it. Plus, it's already available on 4K Blu-ray. A Collector's Edition released in 2023, and the awesome Steelbook Edition shown above arrived just in time for Halloween last year. The Limited Edition Steelbook is on sale for only $23 (was $40), which is actually cheaper than the standard 4K Blu-ray edition by a few bucks.Both editions include 4K Blu-ray and standard 1080p Blu-rays and the same special features. The film was remastered in 4K using the original camera negatives and supports HDR (Dolby Vision and HDR10), Dolby Atmos audio, and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and 2.0. Special features include three different audio commentary tracks, a roundtable on the making of the anthology, interviews, and a whole bunch more. You can check out the full list at the bottom of this article.                         Creepshow 2 Limited Edition (Arrow Video)Creepshow and its numerous follow-ups blend horror and comedy while paying homage to classic comics like Tales from the Crypt and The Haunt of Fear. Directed by George Romero, the 1982 original is an anthology film with five distinct vignettes. Stories include a murdered man rising from the dead, a mysterious meteor that lands on a remote farm, and a cockroach army that’s hunting a man with Entomophobia.Stephen King made his screenwriting debut with Creepshow, and two of the five tales were adapted from his short fiction. Creepshow wears its comic book influences on its sleeve, and King adapted the film into a graphic novel the same year the movie released.Creepshow 2's screenplay was written by Romero and directed by the original film's cinematographer Michael Gornick. Though originally planned to mirror its predecessor with five vignettes, only three made it into the movie: \"Old Chief Wood'nhead,\" \"The Raft,\" and \"The Hitch-hiker.\" All three are based on King's short stories, but \"The Raft\" is the only one that has been published and collected in the author's heralded collection Skeleton Crew.\"Cat from Hell,\" the other King story that was cut from Creepshow 2, was included in Tales from the Darkside: The Movie in 1990. Shout Factory is releasing a 4K Blu-ray Steelbook Edition of Tales from the Darkside on December 23. The spin-off film was based on a TV series created by Romero in 1983. Given the timing, it should come as no surprise that Tales from the Darkside--also a horror-comedy anthology--existed because of Creepshow's unexpected box office success. Tales from the Darkside: The Complete Series is available on DVD for $27.85.All Creepshow Movie & TV AnthologiesCreepshow franchise 4K Blu-ray and Blu-ray releasesBeyond the collectible editions, the first two Creepshow anthologies are available for $10-$12 each on standard Blu-ray. The Creepshow franchise technically has three film anthologies, but the 2006 straight-to-home-video Creepshow 3 is one that many fans want to forget exists at all (it's quite bad). If you want to be reminded of it, a region-free Blu-ray edition of Creepshow 3 is $22 at Walmart. All three films are collected in a DVD box set for $25.                                                                                                                                               Another box set option is the King of Horror 8-Film Collection on Blu-ray or DVD. This one only includes the first Creepshow movie, but you'll also get The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, the 1990 It miniseries, and more. King of Horror's Blu-ray box set is only $36.30 (was $60) at Amazon.Creepshow Movies on Blu-rayCreepshow (1982):4K Blu-ray Steelbook Edition -- $23 ($40)4K Blu-ray Collector's Edition -- $25.89 ($37)Blu-ray Collector's Edition -- $31.65 ($39)Blu-ray -- $12 ($20)DVD -- $8 ($15)Creepshow 2 (1987):4K Blu-ray Limited Edition -- $33 ($50)Blu-ray Special Edition -- $25 ($35)Blu-ray -- $10.79 ($18)DVD -- $10Creepshow 3 (Blu-ray, region-free) -- $22 ($30)Creepshow 3-Movie Collection (DVD) -- $25King of Horror 8-Film CollectionBlu-ray -- $36.30 ($60)DVD -- $13.79 ($23)Stephen King 4-Film Favorites (DVD) -- $12.59 ($30)Creepshow: Seasons 1-4 on Blu-ray and DVDAll four seasons of Shudder's anthology series are already available on Blu-ray and DVD, though you'll wind up spending more on the Blu-ray editions if you purchased each season separately.Creepshow: TV Series on Blu-ray:Season 1 -- $21 ($35)Season 2 -- $14.49 ($35)Season 3 -- $13.49 ($35)Season 4 -- $12.49 ($35)Complete Series -- $53.22 ($100) | November 11Creepshow Series on DVD:Season 1 -- $10Season 2 -- $14.43Season 3 -- $10Season 4 -- $12.35                                                                                                                                                If you like horror-comedy anthologies, you should definitely check out Tales from the Darkside and Tales from the Crypt. Both TV series are available on DVD for pretty cheap, and Tales from the Darkside: The Movie is nearly 50% off on 4K Blu-ray. Meanwhile, the Tales from the Crypt and Vault of Horror Double Feature is only $10 on Blu-ray. You can also get two other Tales from the Crypt movies on Blu-ray and DVD: Bordello of Blood and Demon Knight. Neither of these films is highly regarded, but Bordello of Blood's overall terribleness makes it fun.Tales from the Darkside: Complete Series (DVD) -- $27.85 ($34)Tales from the Crypt: Complete Series (DVD) -- $50 ($68)Tales from the Darkside: The Movie4K Blu-ray -- $22 ($40)4K Blu-ray Steelbook Edition -- $37.49 ($45) | December 23Blu-ray -- $15 ($30)DVD -- $5 ($6)Tales from the Crypt Movies:Tales from the Crypt / Vault of Horror (Blu-ray) -- $10Demon Knight (Blu-ray) -- $15Bordello of Blood (Blu-ray) -- $17Bordello of Blood + Demon Knight (DVD) -- $8.82Creepshow Comics and Graphic NovelsCreepshow by Stephen King (1982) | Creepshow Deluxe Edition Book One (2024)                                                                                                                                               The Making of Creepshow 2 (Paperback) -- $28 ($30)Shudder's Creepshow: From Script to Scream (Hardcover) -- $48 ($50)Shudder's series also led to the revival of Creepshow in print. Skybound and Image Comics have published 20 Creepshow comics since 2022, and 15 of them have been collected in paperback volumes. Each volume has five standalone comics written and illustrated by a rotating group of big names in the industry, including Garth Ennis and Joe Hill. As a child, Hill appeared in the prologue and epilogue of the original Creepshow film, and over 40 years later he wrote an official Creepshow comic called Joe Hill's Wolverton Station.The first issue in Volume 4 was published September 17. Volume 4 #2 releases October 22, and #3 is scheduled for November 19.If you want to catch up on the anthology series, the first three volumes are available in trade paperback for $10-$15 each. Volume 3 was published in April, and Volume 4's paperback edition is slated for April 14, 2026. Last holiday season, Image Comics published a hardcover Deluxe Edition compiling the first two volumes. Amazon has Creepshow Deluxe Edition for $21 (was $40), which is almost exactly the same price as the two paperback editions combined.Joe Hill's Creepshow comic and three others are one-shots that aren't included in the collected volumes, but you can buy Kindle digital editions for a couple bucks each or collected volumes for $8-$12. All 20 Creepshow comics released publsihed so far are available in a Kindle bundle for $43.80. But before reading the new series, we'd highly recommend Stephen King's original graphic novel, which is available in paperback for only $15 (was $20) at Amazon.Creepshow by Stephen King (Paperback) -- $15 ($20)  Kindle Edition -- $15 ($20)Modern Creepshow Series (2022-Present)Creepshow Deluxe Edition: Book 1 (Vol. 1-2, Hardcover) -- $21 ($40)Creepshow Volume 1 (No. 1-5, Paperback) -- $10 ($15)Creepshow Volume 2 (No. 1-5, Paperback) -- $10 ($15)Creepshow Volume 3 (No. 1-5, Paperback) -- $14.69Creepshow Volume 4 (No. 1-5, Paperback) -- $15 | April 14, 2026Creepshow Digital ComicsCreepshow Volume 1 (No. 1-5, Kindle) -- $8 ($12)Creepshow Volume 2 (No. 1-5, Kindle) -- $9.50 ($12)Creepshow Volume 3 (No. 1-5, Kindle) -- $12Creepshow Comic Book Series (Kindle, 20 Issues) -- $48.79  Includes Volumes 1-3, Volume 4 #1, and the five specials below.Creepshow: Joe Hill's Wolverton Station (Kindle) -- $3Creepshow in Love No. 1 (Kindle) -- $3Creepshow: Holiday Special 2023 (Kindle) -- $2Creepshow: Holiday Special 2024 (Kindle) -- $2Super Creepshow Special (Kindle) -- $5Creepshow 2 reversible cover artCreepshow 2 Limited Edition Special Features\"Pinfall\" comic booklet (adaptation of unpublished King story)Illustrated booklet with commentary on the filmCollector's sleeve with original artwork and reversible cover artNative 4K (2160p) restoration from original camera negativeHDR: Dolby Vision and HDR10Audio: 5.1 DTS-HD surround sound, stereo, and lossless mono (original)English subtitlesAudio Commentary: director Michael GornickScreeplay for a Sequel - Interview with screenwriter George A.

A charming hero who can spout witty one-liners, bloody action, and disposable hordes of undead enemies just waiting to be introduced to the business end of a boomstick? That's the description for roughly half of the video games currently in existence.Ahead of the latest Evil Dead game release, we've gone back in time to look at how Evil Dead has been adapted over the years. From old-school adventures with ancient graphics to cheesy action experiences in the PS2 era, here's a brief history of Evil Dead video games.The Evil Dead (1984)An adventure game that was released on the Commodore 64, BBC Micro and ZX Spectrum, Evil Dead's first foray into digital space was about as scary as a box of kittens. Stuck in the infamous log cabin, Ash Williams had to battle collections of blocks that represented the Deadites, keep an eye on his energy levels, and eventually end the terror by destroying the Necronomicon. Simple, but fun in quick bursts back in the day.Evil Dead: Hail to the King (2000)Evil Dead fans had to wait 16 years for someone to pick up the license, with developer Heavy Iron Studios making its debut with this PlayStation classic. Set up as a sequel to Army of Darkness, Evil Dead: Hail to the King pulled plenty of inspiration from Resident Evil to recreate familiar haunts and enemies for a blood-soaked adventure that ends with a hell of a great twist. Plus, you can't beat hearing Bruce Campbell fire off more one-liners.Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick (2003)Ash Williams would load his boomstick for a new adventure on PS2 and Xbox in this Hail to the King sequel. Down on his luck and ready to kick some Deadite butts once again, the sequel improved on the original and once again recruited Campbell to voice his iconic cinematic hero.Evil Dead Pinball (2003)For the tens of people who had been asking for it, Evil Dead finally entered the realm of pinball on mobile devices. Players had to collect pages from the Necronomicon using their table wizard skills, while also dealing with the realization that a few rounds of Snake were more fun on early-2000s mobile hardware. Evil Dead: Regeneration (2005)Unrelated to the previous two console games, Evil Dead: Regeneration took the franchise in a new direction by reimagining the series through a what-if lens that takes place between Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. What would have happened if Ash had not been thrown back in time? Plenty of blood and campy horror, with this particular game being well-received by fans as an Evil Dead spin-off that kept the cult-classic film's tone intact.Army of Darkness: Defense (2011)With Apple's iPad having entrenched itself as the tablet device to own in the early 2010s, along came this simple but enchanting Evil Dead game. Players were tasked with keeping the Necronomicon out of Deadite hands in this side-scrolling tower defense game, as they threw waves of soldiers and heroes against the army of darkness.Evil Dead: The Game (2011)A top-down twin-stick shooter for iOS, this Evil Dead game was big on boomsticks, Deadite cannon fodder, and Ash's oversized cranium. This game essentially retold the story of the original movie over the course of 30 levels.Evil Dead: Endless Nightmare (2016)Essentially a first-person endless runner that was loosely based on the underrated 2013 remake of Evil Dead, Endless Nightmare was a quick and dirty action experience that recycled Mia's dialogue as she tore through supernatural evil.Evil Dead: Virtual Nightmare (2018)A few years later, Endless Nightmare was resurrected for virtual reality headsets and mobile devices. Same game, same low-budget horror experience, but without any of the indie charm.Evil Dead: The Game (2022)At its best, Evil Dead has always been a sly mix of gory horror and over-the-top ass-kicking, and developer Boss Team Games decided to roll hard with those ideas in this 2022 adaptation. Evil Dead: The Game was a \"somewhat groovy\" take on asymmetrical multiplayer horror, one that faithfully recreated the iconography of the beloved series but which was light on content and story. As with many Evil Dead projects, this one ended in heartbreak: in September 2023, 16 months after release, live content support for the game was cancelled, as was a proposed Nintendo Switch version. In April 2025, the game was delisted from several storefronts. Evil Dead: The Game's servers are still live, but we hear the distant rev of a chainsaw coming for them.Fortnite (2022) Fortnite's 2022 Halloween event, Fortnitemares, officially brought Ash to Epic's long list of crossover characters. Ash--who arrived just before Halloween on October 23--was available as part of a pack, complete with Necronomicon and Boomstick back blings, plus an incredible Chainsaw Hand built-in pickaxe skin. Anyone who achieves a Victory Royale in this skin has a legitimate excuse to shout \"Hail to the king, baby.\"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2022) Ash was busy in Halloween 2022: Along with Fortnite, he also lent his talents (and his boomstick) to the Call of Duty series. Ash arrived as part of The Haunting, a Season 06 event that also added Lilith and Inarus from Diablo 4, Skeletor from Masters of the Universe, and Alucard from Hellsing. This was, again, Evil Dead II Ash, but pre-amputation: he still has his iconic chainsaw, but sadly there's no way of using it on your opponents.RetroRealms: Ash vs Evil Dead (2024) Developer Wayforward's take on the Evil Dead series--a 2D side-scrolling brawler based on the three-season Starz series of the same name--is less flashy than many of the other games on this list, but it's also the best Evil Dead game we've ever gotten. The game features an older, more-seasoned Ash blasting his way through an army of Deadites rendered in a 16-bit visual style, using a variety of guns (and his iconic chainsaw) to rip and tear through his enemies. In GameSpot's review, Mark Delaney praised the game's \"excellent platforming gameplay (and) authentic '90s vibe.\"    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Ubisoft was working on a new Splinter Cell game that was going to embrace games-as-a-service before it shifted to become XDefiant, a game that the publisher shut down not long after release. This is according to Nick Herman, a developer who worked on the game before leaving to start AdHoc Studios, the team that just launched the episodic game Dispatch to great success.\"I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while,\" Herman said told Bloomberg. \"And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.\"The game was in development \"for a few months,\" Bloomberg reported, and Herman confirmed that Ubisoft wanted to have it feature games-as-a-service elements.\"We tried,\" Herman said. \"Let's make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.\"The report said \"Ubisoft had lost interest\" in this Splinter Cell game and shifted to pursue a project that could attempt to compete with Call of Duty. This became XDefiant, a game directed by former Call of Duty boss Mark Rubin. The game shut down after a year and developers were laid off. \"We thought we were going to be able to make something really great,\" Herman said. \"And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don't anymore. It's a common thing in games.\"While that Splinter Cell game is not coming to market, a Splinter Cell remake is now in the works. Outside of games, the Splinter Cell TV show Deathwatch debuted in October on Netflix and has already been renewed for a second season. A live-action movie was in the works, but apparently no longer is.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The story of Concord is a cautionary tale in the age of live-service games. Years of development and millions of dollars went into the game, only for it to fail at launch and get canceled by Sony weeks later. However, Conord had some fans, and a trio of them worked very hard to bring the game back to life on a server.As reported by The Game Post, Concord's partial resurrection is due to reverse engineering by a user called Red, a rebuild of the game's backend API by open_wizard, and an additional assist from a programmer called gwog. The team shared a pair of a gameplay videos to demonstrate their achievement, but noted that Concord is still somewhat buggy.          The trio successfully tested their ability to load the game, pick their characters, and run a full Clash Point match.\"The project is still WIP, it's playable, but buggy,\" wrote Red. \"Once our servers are fully set up, we'll begin doing some private playtesting.\"          When Concord launched in 2024, it debuted to only 25,000 players. Sony subsequently shut down the game's developer, Firewalk Studios. In the aftermath, Sony recommitted to live-service games and shared some of the hard lessons it learned from the ordeal. Sony Interactive Entertainment chief executive of studio business Hermen Hulst attributed its failure to a lack of oversight.Concord's fate was recently cited in a debate in the United Kingdom's House of Commons about the preservation of video games. That session also addressed the Stop Killing Games movement, but lawmakers were unconvinced of the necessity to create laws that prevent games from being taken offline.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Anyone who plays through The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is invited to make a choice between the two great loves of Geralt of Rivia: Yennefer of Vengerberg or Triss Merigold. That decision even informs the game's farewell to Geralt. However, CD Projekt Red has recently disclosed that players didn't always get to choose between Geralt's lovers.CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski told PC Gamer that the option to romance Triss was added late in the game. Until then, the team had been focusing on Geralt's relationship with Yennefer. But adding Triss back into Geralt's heart gave the game more personality .\"[The romance with Triss] wasn't [there] from the beginning,\" recalled Badowski. \"But at some point we understood that this lack of conflict, personal conflict... There was a lack of something... This decision was made pretty late, but it was great. It was a great decision.\"The Witcher video games take place beyond the original stories by author Andrzej Sapkowski, and CD Projekt Red didn't bring Yennefer or Ceri into the narrative until the third game. Conversely, Triss had a much bigger role in the first two Witcher games and she was one of Geralt's primary romance options. If the possibility of romancing Triss had been absent from The Witcher 3, it would have been a missed opportunity to continue that romantic thread.Although the game celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, CD Projekt Red is planning one final patch for The Witcher 3 that will introduce mod support for the game's console ports. CD Projekt Red is also currently developing The Witcher 4, as well as a remake of The Witcher. Both titles will be built using Unreal Engine 5, and The Witcher 4's tech demo offered a glimpse at how that may look when the game is eventually released.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Mark Delaney\n   on October 27, 2025 at 2:55PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Horror is my everything. You'll rarely catch me at a time in my life when I'm not reading, watching, or playing something in the genre. If you can relate, then you surely also love the Halloween season, because it's a time when so many others try to match your vibe, if only for a few weeks. Even for folks too scared to play horror games themselves, many like to watch others play them on Twitch. During the Halloween season, Twitch itself gets in on the action with its annual Fright Fest, which is back for 2025. You can read about everything going on in Twitch Fright Fest 2025 on the official website.With all that in mind, we've put together a list of the six best horror games to watch or stream on Twitch. Whether you are hosting the playthrough for your viewers or letting someone else do the dirty work of facing down the terrors that pursue them, below you'll find a half-dozen scary games that fit snugly in the Twitch world, for both creators and their audiences.For even more horror content, don't miss our lists of the best multiplayer horror games, the best gateway horror games (for genre newcomers), and, of course, the best horror games in general.Silent Hill FPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Silent Hill f is both the newest game on this list and part of the oldest series mentioned herein. Dating back to 1999, Silent Hill has been a household name in horror games for decades. The series once seemed unlikely to ever return, after going quiet following the cancellation of Silent Hills in 2014. But it has since roared back with an incredible remake of Silent Hill 2 last year, followed by this fresh take on the series that moves it out of small-town America to 1960s Japan, which really lets it explore new themes and aesthetics. This is a great streaming pick because the story actually takes multiple playthroughs to fully resolve, so playing this one takes on the vibe of appointment viewing for anyone in your chat looking to piece the tale together.The Outlast TrialsPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Fresh off a major update, The Outlast Trials remains one of my favorite multiplayer horror games. For nearly two years, this was a four-player co-op take on the traditional Outlast formula (running from massive, often naked, killers brandishing sharp objects). It did its duty quite well in that regard, but the recent Invasion update adds a PvP twist to the game, letting you invade the ongoing missions of other teams, turning it into a blood-soaked 4v4 game of deception and stalking. Plus, earlier this year, the team at Red Barrels graciously added a nudity filter to make the game more streamer-friendly. Now the only things you'll see swinging are axes and knives.Hunt: Showdown 1896Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5The way I've long described Hunt: Showdown 1896 is \"a game I love despite being bad at it.\" It's an extraction shooter set in a horror-western world with some of the best character and environmental artwork you'll find, whether you're comparing it to multiplayer games or horror games. It's a standout in either bucket. It can be intimidating, but if you're worried about being bad, don't sweat it. Watching good players play Hunt on stream has helped me immensely. Generally, I find this is always a helpful tip with multiplayer games you're trying to break into: Just watch the game's community tackle it live in front of you.PhasmophobiaPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5Phasmophobia first exploded onto the scene in 2020 during the first Halloween in the COVID era. It was a great alternative for the many people who felt the effects of a stranger-than-usual Halloween that fall. But it has persisted as a major multiplayer horror hit since then, and today it remains one of the most beloved multiplayer horror games to stream or watch. Each round sends up to four players into a haunted house, school, prison, or other locale where one of 24 different types of ghosts have taken up residence. It's the players' job to identify the type of ghost and escape with everyone still alive in the end. The mix of laughter and terror in Phasmophobia is nearly unrivaled, and the game is moving through early access and adding new things all the time.REPOPlatforms: PC We say Phasmophobia is nearly unrivaled, because REPO sure does a great job of offering something a bit similar. More closely linked to Lethal Company in its gameplay loop, REPO sends four goofy little capsule-looking characters into haunted spaces, where they must remove valuables and turn them in for a profit. The game's physics system combines with a laundry list of different monsters with their own habits and abilities, which gives each round a level of unpredictability that makes REPO an obvious candidate for the best horror games on Twitch. This game went viral in early 2025 and with a big Halloween update just about to drop, you can expect another surge in players and viewers soon.Amnesia: The BunkerPlatforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5 Each Amnesia game is at least quite good in its own right, but for streamers, The Bunker is the best of them. That's because its unscripted monster roams the dark corridors of a World War I bunker, hunting for you out while you're tucked into a cupboard or tiptoeing to the safe room, trying not to make a sound. Each time you play the game, vital quest items change their locations, so every run is different. That kind of variety makes for a great streaming candidate, which is only enhanced by just how scary and atmospheric it all is. Whether you're playing for a speedrun, a no-damage run, or maybe just trying to stir the monster into a frenzy, there are a lot of ways to approach this one for your next stream.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In April 2022, developer and publisher Sharkmob officially launched Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt, a battle royale set in White Wolf Publishing's World of Darkness. Players took control of vampires in Prague as they joined rival sects and battled each other with their supernatural abilities and conventional weapons. However, new updates for the game ceased in 2023, and now Bloodhunt's servers are going offline in 2026.Sharkmob announced the news on its site that Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt will have its final death on April 28, 2026. Once the game's servers go offline, the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of this title will no longer be playable.In a message addressed to the Bloodhunt community, Sharkmob shared its gratitude for the game's four-year run.\"When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did,\" reads the statement. \"From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, Bloodhunt has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways. During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to Bloodhunt ... However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable. This has led us to make the difficult decision to take Bloodhunt offline.\"Token purchases have already been disabled, but the in-game store will remain open so players can use the tokens they already have before the game goes offline.Earlier this month, the action-RPG Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 hit PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. There was a 21-year gap between this game and its predecessor, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nCovering the early days of PS1 to the struggles of PS3, GameSpot spoke to Yoshida as he reflected on his legacy at PlayStation, from its very inception until now, nearly four decades laterBy \n    Tom Regan\n   on October 27, 2025 at 2:35PM PDT\n              \n                                        Ever since he was a boy, Shuhei Yoshida dreamed of living outside Japan. Born and raised in Kyoto, Yoshida studied science at his local university and spent his college downtime slaying beasts in Dragon Quest. He yearned to embark on a globe-trotting adventure of his own--and just like in his favorite RPG, destiny soon came calling.Yoshida landed a job at Sony fresh out of college, excitedly joining the company's corporate strategy group. \"With Walkman, TV and video, 80% to 90% of Sony's business was done outside Japan,\" Yoshida recalls, \"So, I thought, at Sony, I might have a chance to live outside Japan.\"Working under Sony's management group, Yoshida's job was to help grow internal businesses. There was one new team that caught Yoshida's eye: a small group, led by Ken Kutaragi, that had just finished developing the audio chip for Nintendo's massively successful SNES console. Although it was one of Yoshida's colleagues who was ultimately assigned to the project, Yoshida says he tried to assist with Kutaragi's project wherever he could. \"Ken's team then started to work on a CD-ROM system for Super Nintendo,\" Yoshida said. \"My colleague was not a big video game fan, so I was giving advice to him.\"Console modder Ben Heck got the Nintendo PlayStation prototype's CD drive running in 2017The Nintendo BetraystationAs Yoshida excitedly gushed about video games to anyone who'd listen, Kutaragi's team worked diligently to provide Nintendo with the SNES CD-ROM expansion. Its working name? The Nintendo PlayStation. As Sony experimented with laptops and PCs, Yoshida kept his head down until 1991, when Sony's relationship with Nintendo suddenly went up in flames.\"At CES, Sony was preparing to announce the original Nintendo PlayStation,\" Yoshida explains. \"But a couple of days before that, Nintendo announced a collaboration with Philips to release the CD-ROM attachment, instead.\"After years of collaboration with Nintendo, it was a move that stunned everyone at Sony. \"I think it was vaporware,\" reflects Yoshida of Nintendo's Phillips CD-ROM console, which ultimately never materialized. \"I think [Nintendo] just made the announcement to get out of the contract with Sony.\" Whatever Nintendo's reasoning, Sony had been very publicly betrayed. \"After that, Sony had two choices,\" Yoshida says. \"Get out of the video game business or create their own console.\"As we all know, Sony opted for the latter. Yet it wasn't enough just to release a rival console--for Sony's furious upper management, their machine had to wipe the floor with Nintendo's upcoming console. \"Ken [Kutaragi] leveraged the anger of Sony management to get the investment that he needed to make a console with real-time 3D graphics,\" reveals Yoshida. \"So it ended up being a much higher performance system than the original [Nintendo PlayStation], which was based on Super NES tech.\"Hell hath no fury like a Sony scornedAfter partnering with Sony Music to help fund the company's ambitious game console, operation PlayStation was a go. In February 1993, Yoshida's years of excitable office video games chatter finally paid off and he was assigned to Kutaragi's PlayStation third-party licensing team. \"Everyone else on my team were engineers,\" Yoshida says. \"I felt incredibly lucky.\"Under Sony Music Japan's tutelage, Yoshida's team approached their new console like a record label, going from door-to-door, vying to convince massive game publishers and indies alike to bring their games to Sony's new system. Yet Yoshida and Kutaragi didn't just have to overcome skepticism in Sony's gaming chops, but publishers' doubts around 3D gaming itself.\"A small number of companies were fascinated by the capability of PlayStation's real time 3D,\" Yoshida says of his initial meetings. \"But at the time, most people were not familiar with 3D graphics.\" Luckily, that same year, Sega revealed Virtua Fighter for arcades, the first true 3D fighting game, and publishers finally began to see 3D's potential.\"As soon as that announcement happened, I got lots of phone calls from companies who were very interested to work with PlayStation,\" Yoshida recalls. \"Sega Saturn was the biggest competition for PlayStation, but Sega really helped to educate the industry that 3D graphics can be used for more than racing or shooting games.\"While Virtua Fighter eventually swayed the 3D skeptics, Yoshida says one publisher believed in PlayStation from the very beginning: Bandai Namco. Yoshida called the company Sony's \"biggest ally for the launch of PlayStation.\" Part of this relationship stemmed from Namco having 3D arcade games ready to go while the current lineup of 16-bit consoles remained unable to run them. Ridge Racer and Tekken ultimately became crucial day-one graphical showcases for Sony's new console.Yet it was winning over Nintendo's former third-party darling, Squaresoft (now known as Square Enix following a merger), that cemented PlayStation's Japanese success. \"Square obviously had a huge hit with Final Fantasy games on Super Nintendo, \" says Yoshida. \"However, Sakaguchi-san, the creator, was very unhappy with the decision that Nintendo made with Nintendo 64 to use cartridges.\" Sakaguchi dreamed of shipping games with full 3D movies--epics that could truly immerse players in his fantastical world. \"The cartridge has such a small memory that they didn't allow him to realize this vision,\" explains Yoshida. \"So, he was very interested to work on a CD-ROM-based system.\"Shmoozing Sake-guchiPlayStation, however, wasn't the only CD-ROM system in town. With Sega also trying to nab Square's newest game, Sony was desperate to sign Final Fantasy VII first. Luckily, Sony had a secret weapon up its sleeve. \"My boss, who came from Sony Music Japan, was a really amazing schmoozer,\" smiles Yoshida. \"He hung out with another vice president of Square who was running the business side. I was taken with them to have dinner or do karaoke so many times, and he schmoozed and somehow convinced them that Sony is easy to work with.\" The secret behind Final Fantasy VII coming to PlayStation? Sake and karaoke. \"That's how business is done in Japan!\" laughs Yoshida.The rest, as they say, is history. PlayStation launched in Japan in December 1994 and was a huge hit, shifting 300,000 units in its first year in Japan before finding success in Europe and the US in 1995. Another factor that Yoshida attributes to PlayStation's success was Sony Music's insistence that game developers were given the spotlight. \"In their mind, game creators are artists like musicians,\" explains Yoshida. \"Some companies didn't allow the game developers to put their real name in the game's credits because they were afraid of other companies stealing these developers. But PlayStation said, 'Let's get the magazine to interview creators;, let's make them stars!'\"The PS3 launched on November 11, 2006 in JapanWith third parties flocking to the console in droves, Yoshida's job was complete. He was soon shifted over to head up first-party projects, where he helped produce games like Ape Escape and The Legend of Dragoon. Yet there was one PS1 classic that got away. \"Another team I put together was not able to finish their game on PS1, which was Ico,\" says Yoshida of the Fumito Ueda classic. \"We had an amazing-looking prototype. However, the game was not performing well on PS1. Ueda-san's ambition was too high and the game was running at 10fps, so I moved the project to PS2.\"Then, in 2000, Yoshida finally realized his childhood dream and moved to the US to become the head of development for Sony's American studios. Sony, meanwhile, was also living out a dream of its own, as its once-unproven gaming upstart had now become the dominant console in the PS2 generation. While Yoshida laments a few missed exclusives--\"Capcom decided to release Resident Evil 4 on GameCube, why?! We had Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3 on PlayStation...\"--as the end of the PS2 generation rolled around, Sony seemed unstoppable.And then, it all went wrong.The PS3 generation, and a cell of Sony's own creationWhen the PS3 arrived in 2006, its prohibitively expensive price point ($499.99) and difficult-to-develop-for architecture turned the PS3 generation into a hubristic disaster. Suddenly, Sony was losing ground to another electronics company that had belatedly entered the console space, Microsoft.\"The PS3 generation was hard,\" recalls Yoshida. \"For the first couple of years it was really tough to see the same games come out on PS3 and Xbox 360, and the Xbox 360 version performing better. In theory, PS3 was going to be much higher performance, but at launch we were not able to show that. We had first-party games like Resistance looking great, but then third-party games were constantly compared side-by-side unfavorably to 360. It was quite shocking.\"By the end of the generation, the PS3 had toughed it out, eventually amassing an enviable lineup of exclusive titles. It's these mature, story-led games that would ultimately set the tone for Sony's enviable PS4 library. The quality of these games is one that Yoshida ultimately attributes to Sony executives' patience; although they weren't happy about it, Yoshida says his bosses allowed him to delay unfinished PS3 games no matter the cost.\"Every year I had to apologize to the business side that we have to delay this game,\" says Yoshida. \"But the company understood that by spending enough time and polishing the game, in the end, the game will sell more than rushing it out.\"One such game that Yoshida had to keep delaying? An ambitious zombie project from the creators of Uncharted. \"It was a bit surprising that Naughty Dog wanted to move on from Uncharted, but also that they were going to create something really mature,\" he recalls. \"Uncharted was like a summer blockbuster movie for a very broad audience, so I was a little concerned that we may be going too niche by going so mature. But in the end, their craft produced such an amazing game that they established an IP even bigger than Uncharted, [The Last of Us]. I'm so excited that they are working on a new IP again with Intergalactic.\"Unifying hardware and softwareThe end of the PS3 generation saw a change of leadership from Ken Kutaragi to Kaz Hirai, and from then, Yoshida focused on helping developers collaborate with the hardware team during the production of the PS4--an effort to ensure that the disaster of the PS3 generation never happened again.\"Kaz asked me to move to Japan to work very closely with the hardware team,\" Yoshida recalls. \"I was able to connect them to the right Worldwide Studio members and that's how PS4 and PS Vita, in my mind, became really good systems for developers to make games for.\"In his final years at Sony, Yoshida moved away from top-level first-party decisions and went back to his PS1 roots. Try as he might, he became less interested in the AAA titles hogging the spotlight and was instead drawn to the quirky indie curiosities beckoning from the shadows.\"I was a huge proponent of indie games,\" smiles Yoshida. \"Every time I went to a games show like E3 or Gamescom, even though we had booths to show our big, first-party titles, I went to the indie area. When I saw a game that I liked, I [took] a photo with the developers and [tried] to help promote these games. We were able to support games like Journey… And that led me to become the evangelist of indie games for PlayStation for the last five years of my career there.\"Yoshida has always been a champion of indie gamesA new chapterAs of January 2025, Yoshida is a freelance consultant, working directly with indie developers. As well as being a notable indie champion, Yoshida is also a huge advocate for VR, working with long-standing VR developer NDreams on the recently launched game Reach. This is hardly a new passion for Yoshida, though, as he reveals that he was pivotal in bringing PSVR to the market. \"I was involved in the hardware development of the first PSVR,\" says Yoshida. \"The project started as a grassroots activity from Santa Monica Studio during [the] PS3 days.\"Using the PS Move's 3D-tracking, Sony Santa Monica jerry-rigged a crude, handmade VR headset together in their spare time. Yoshida was instantly sold. \"They customized a God of War game on PS3 and I tried it, and I was like, 'Wow, I'm in God of War!' I looked down and I was Kratos! It was an amazing experience.\"As he excitedly tells me about his Xbox ROG Ally X preorder and laments the death of the Vita, it's impossible not to leave the conversation charmed by Shuhei Yoshida. There's a sense of playfulness about him--one that you can feel throughout the many of the initiatives he spearheaded at PlayStation, as well. From the quirky curation of games of the PS1 era to the childlike wonder of PSVR, after 39 years, Yoshida's playful spirit will undoubtedly be missed by PlayStation fans.\"The PS1 generation was like an indie scene,\" Yoshida smiles. \"There were so many small teams making interesting new concepts that came out of nowhere. So many hit products that came from non-traditional game creators.\" Now as Yoshida leaves Sony behind and enters a new chapter of guiding independent creators, it seems he's ready to share that playfulness with the wider world.\n                                                              \n                \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

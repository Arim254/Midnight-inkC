    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nLandfall’s multiplayer mountain-climber is steeped in lore that goes in every direction.By \n    Aron Garst\n   on January 2, 2026 at 9:00AM PST\n              \n                Four scouts on an end-of-year trip, flying across the world for what should be a life-changing experience. What could go wrong? An engine malfunction. The squad crash-lands somewhere in the Pacific. They’re the only survivors on a mysterious island that only grows stranger the deeper they venture and the longer they stay. This is Peak.Sound familiar? The stories of Lost, the Emmy-winning 2004 mystery-laden drama series, and Peak feel like two parallel tracks that move in an eerily similar and magnificent way. The mystery only grows--in both depth and complexity--the further you get, whether you’re marathoning episodes or climbing up a volcano in search of rescue.Lost worked because of that mystery. A group that crash-landed on an isolated island runs into underground bunkers, hidden groups of strangers, and a smoke monster as they try to survive and find their way home. Every new discovery widens the gap between what you think you understand and what’s actually happening.What's the meaning behind the temple steps in Caldera?Peak finds some of its own success through that same sense of the unknown. Underground tombs, undead scoutmasters, and magical items that bend the rules of time and space make the mountain feel twisted and storied. The simplicity of the climb draws you in, but it’s the mystery--hidden behind statues, items, and the strange mechanics of Peak--that makes you want to stay on that island. Even if it’s only because your body was never found.One anonymous member of the Lost writing staff said the team would sometimes toss around whatever odd or surprising twist came to mind and add it in without stressing too much about how it might wrap up later. They admitted they knew they were essentially messing with the audience, but for six seasons, it worked--although there are some wide-ranging opinions about how the story ultimately wrapped up.Not having to pay things off later, while definitely a hindrance, helped the mystery of Lost deepen in so many ways. The fact that it became a sensation--finding its way into the homes of millions--made that mystery even thicker in the air of everyday life.While Peak was originally meant to be part of a project to bring its developers a simpler, commercially viable product, its development story has followed a surprisingly similar path since launch. Peak was something Aggro Crab and Landfall planned to make and then move on from. They didn’t have a detailed content roadmap for the future. But once the game launched--and a million copies were sold in a matter of days--the need for a plan for post-launch content became suddenly, overwhelmingly obvious.Who is BingBong?The result is magical underground tombs containing idols that protect scouts from freezing weather and scalding lava, a book that removes your skin and internal organs, and a strange pair of eyes staring at you from behind a distant rock.Even something as simple as the Looker--a mysterious scout who watches from a distance before vanishing--adds another layer to the island’s mystery. Who is this scout? How have they survived here? This small feature--one that can be turned off in the settings--raises even more questions as you make your way up the climb.These elements makes the climb in Peak more enjoyable, while building a world that never quite connects in a logical way. It’s tantalizing to think everything players have experienced so far might be part of some sinister ritual, or that the scouts are already dead, as fan theories keep postulating. The climb--and the peak--might just be an eerie passageway to the afterlife.Nobody knows for sure, but with Peak continuing to expand for at least the foreseeable future with more and more updates, just like Lost's writers, the creators of Peak have a chance to keep building on those mysteries. Hopefully they'll also come up with a satisfying conclusion along the way.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nFallout Season 2 Episode 3 brought back a familiar face.By \n    Reyna Cervantes\n   on January 2, 2026 at 7:17AM PST\n              \n                This week’s Fallout episode traded in personal stories for status updates on fan-favorite factions from Fallout: New Vegas. While we briefly saw the Khans and primary followed the Brotherhood of Steel storyline, we finally got caught up with the NCR and Caesar’s Legion. With this expansion of the Mojave Wasteland, this episode had a healthy dose of easter eggs and callbacks for fans of the video games. Let’s take a look at what this week had to offer.The Mojave’s Favorite SodaThis week’s episode revealed the fate of Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) and his new life as a ghoul. Instead of exploring the wasteland as part of the Brotherhood of Steel, he’s running a bottling plant that employs an army of abandoned children. The drink they’re bottling? Sunset Sarsaparilla, the most popular drink on the west coast in the Fallout games and a common consumable item in Fallout: New Vegas.Roger MaxsonWhen the Brotherhood of Steel are discussing their potential alliance to stand against The Commonwealth, Elder Cleric Quintus mentions a “an ordinary captain was sent to a research center in California” named Roger Maxson, a character Fallout fans should be extremely familiar with. While Maxson is never featured in a Fallout game, his story is told through holotapes that appear throughout Fallout, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 76.War… War Never ChangesPaladin Xander (Kumail Nanjiani) suggests to Maximus (Aaron Moten) that a conflict could send the entire Brotherhood of Steel into chaos. He tells of a time when the Brotherhood was nearly destroyed because of internal strife in the Capital Wasteland. Fans of Fallout 3 will be familiar with this conflict as the time a group of BoS members formed a splinter faction called the Brotherhood Outcasts when they opposed Elder Lyons’ views. This was one of the central conflicts of that game, and we could potentially see a repeat event happen in the Mojave.Well, Howdy Partner!Though set in the same universe as the video games, Fallout has had very little crossover when it comes to characters (Mr. House not withstanding). This week’s episode bucked this trend by bringing back a familiar face in the form of Victor the sheriff securitron. Those who played Fallout: New Vegas will recognize him as the friendly face that saved the courier and served as sheriff of Goodsprings (though he had other motives as revealed later on).A Knight’s WeaponThough Fallout is no stranger to including the artillery from the video games, this week’s episode featured one of the more iconic weapons. When Xander and Maximus are surveying the Mojave they decide to go after hunt rogue securitrons in the area. Though they have the standard issue rifles, Xander brings along a Super Sledge, a powered up melee weapon that's the first choice of super mutants everywhere.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

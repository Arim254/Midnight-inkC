    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had a very strong showing in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii \"problem.\"Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.\"One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,\" Lee told The Game Business. \"Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.\"Lee was very complementary toward Nintendo in his follow-up remarks, but he added that the Wii's model of selling only a few games to certain members of its install base was \"not sustainable.\"\"It's very important that we set ourselves up to serve our customer continuously with new innovations,\" added Lee. \"That is how the whole system can sustain. But it started with Wii. We are standing on a giant’s shoulder.\"Nex Playground reportedly accounted for 14% of all console sales on Black Friday, finishing ahead of the Xbox family of systems.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Darryn Bonthuys\n   on December 20, 2025 at 9:00AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Times and trends may change, but if there's one constant in the gaming industry, it's that shooters are popular. It's an evergreen draw for many players, but these days, shooter games are becoming more experimental as they mingle with other game genres.According to our sister-site Metacritic, several wildly different games were built around a core shooter gameplay component, as we saw guns used for both offense and momentum in Shotgun Cop Man, used them to solve puzzles in games like Revenge of the Savage Planet, and watched adorable ducks go to war. This year also saw several remasters and reborn arcade classics rise to the top, and you can see the complete list below for yourself.You can also check out the Metacritic rankings for the best co-op games and the best RPG games of 2025, as well as several more of GameSpot's best-of lists. For more on this genre, check out our running list of the best shooters and best first-person shooters to play right now.More Best Of 2025:Best of 2025 hubWhy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is GameSpot's GOTY 2025GameSpot's 10 Best Games of 2025The Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2025The Best Nintendo Switch And Switch 2 Exclusives Of 2025The Best-Reviewed Games Of 20252025's Biggest Gaming News: Banned Games, GTA 6 Delayed, Price HikesDeep Rock Galactic: SurvivorWatch out, Vampire Survivors: a new challenger has emerged in the bullet-heaven genre. Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor has used its time in early access well, fleshing out its Survivors-like systems of auto-firing weapons and upgrades to sing with precision destruction, but it's the procedurally generated stages where players can make use of cunning tactics to triumph that helps seal the deal on this fun DRG spin-off.Metascore: 86Heretic + HexenBoomer-shooters have become a popular genre over the last few years, but the original '90s games they're inspired by still have plenty of magic. That's an apt description for Heretic + Hexen, as Nightdive Studios' polished remaster of these classic games is full of thoughtful tweaks, visual upgrades that preserve the retro look, and new content for good measure.Metascore: 86Arc RaidersArc Raiders arrived near the end of 2025 after a busy year and launched into a busy genre already dominated by some titans, and it took over the conversation. With incredibly smart AI enemies, reliable, satisfying third-person gunplay, and a collection of expansive maps that lend themselves to remarkable surprises in every round, it'll be remembered as one of the games that made 2025 what it was.Metascore: 86 | Read our Arc Raiders reviewEarthionFew things in video games are quite as retro as the old-school horizontal shoot-'em-up. Earthion pays tribute to the shmups of yesteryear with its arcade-inspired design, while also adding in a few clever ideas of its own that other games in the genre could learn from. The upgrade system keeps things interesting in each run, boss fights will make you sweat, and each stage has enough variety to keep you on your toes.Metascore: 85System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary RemasterIt might have taken a while to see the light of day, but the 25th-anniversary remaster of System Shock 2 was worth the wait. Another win for Nightdive Studios, the developer makes only a few gameplay changes and adds a light touch to the graphics, but this less-is-more mentality helps highlight just how far ahead of the curve System Shock 2 was all the way back in 1999.Metascore: 84Gradius OriginsAnother charming shmup for fans, Gradius Origins is aimed squarely at those who grew up with these 2D shooters. It's a lovingly crafted tribute to old-school Gradius and its spin-offs, enhanced by a suite of customization options and game prototypes thought to be lost to time.Metascore: 84Battlefield 6It took a few tries, with some relative highs and lows in between, but Battlefield 6 feels like it's the series' return to form. With its huge maps, compelling class-based roles and warfare, and a free-to-play battle royale bringing in new players all the time, Battlefield 6 is Battlefield operating at peak performance.Metascore: 84 | Read our Battlefield 6 reviewDoom: The Dark AgesAs a prequel, Doom: The Dark Ages not only sent the infamous Doom Slayer back in time to slaughter endless hordes of demons, but also radically altered the core gameplay loop id Software's series had used since 2016. It was a bold decision that could have been disastrous, but the new focus on parrying attacks and battling enemies with your boots (mostly) on the ground gives The Dark Ages a unique flavor--and the executions are still violent enough to make Mortal Kombat's developers wince.Metascore: 83 | Read our Doom: The Dark Ages review.The Outer Worlds 2The Outer Worlds 2 checks many boxes for a sequel: It's a bigger and bolder version of the first game, but under the hood, combat has been meaningfully improved, and missions give plenty of excuses to let the lasers fly. Obsidian Entertainment's return to a galaxy on the precipice of ruin thanks to out-of-control corporations feels sharper than ever thanks to its polished design and fine-tuned RPG systems.Metascore: 83 | Read our The Outer Worlds 2 reviewPowerWash Simulator 2Why shoot bullets when you can cathartically blast your troubles away with some high-pressure water instead? PowerWash Simulator 2 is essentially more of the same grime-fighting, but some serious improvements have been made, and it's still a chill experience that's in a class of its own thanks to its fluid gameplay.Metascore: 82 | Read our PowerWash Simulator 2 reviewBorderlands 4While a smidge of an overcorrection to Borderlands 3's formula, Borderlands 4 is altogether an entertaining first-person shooter where you chase loot, craft rewarding builds, and unleash colorful mayhem for hours and hours. The game sees you play as one of four Vault Hunters who are trying to free a planet from the tyrannical rule of The Timekeeper in hopes of finding and looting the treasure-filled Vault that he's guarding.Metascore: 81 | Read our Borderlands 4 reviewReady or NotReleasing in its 1.0 state helped elevate Ready or Not from a sleeper hit on Steam to a mainstream success. In this extremely realistic first-person SWAT sim, you'll be called to active crime scenes and have to put all of your extensive training to the test, minimizing casualties both to your squadmates and innocent bystanders. Each level is incredibly tense, so check those corners.Metascore: 80Metroid Prime 4: BeyondMetroid Prime fans have been waiting a long time for a new entry in the series, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond doesn't disappoint. While there are a few archaic elements to grapple with, Samus Aran's new adventure still sticks the landing with its exciting gunplay, stunning level design, and a soundtrack that pulses with each arm-cannon blast.Metascore: 80 | Read our Metroid Prime 4: Beyond reviewShotgun Cop ManFew things in life are better than a power-fantasy game that tasks you with delivering ballistic kisses to evildoers, and Shotgun Cop Man excels at making you feel you're dual-wielding weaponized fun. It's a short and goofy game where you're asked to chase down the devil, but innovative level design and unique projectile-based movement make it an instant classic.Metascore: 80Neon InfernoNostalgia continues to be one of the most powerful forces of attraction that science can't explain, and with Neon Inferno, you've got a '90s-inspired game that looks and plays like something that would be right at home on an SNES console. A stylish cyberpunk game with a strong blend of 2D shooting and platforming, it's a retro romp that oozes style.Metascore: 80Rainbow Six Siege XTen years later, Rainbow Six Siege is still the gold standard for tactical team-based shooters. This year's big update and the move to a free-to-play model made it the perfect time to jump into Ubisoft's popular shooter, thanks to better onboarding systems, the delightfully engaging Dual Front mode, and polished gunplay honed from a decade of play.Metascore: 79Gears of War: ReloadedJust how good was the original Gears of War? Good enough to still be a blast of cover-based shooting fun 20 years later and with two remasters under its belt. While Gears of War: Reloaded is essentially a marginal improvement over 2015's Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, the few improvements added to this edition still make the classic third-person-action game a slick and smooth experience that'll make you think you've been transported back in time to 2006. Nice.Metascore: 79Dune: AwakeningDune: Awakening isn't the kind of game that encourages you to go in guns blazing when you spot a giant sandworm, but it's still a key component in the grand scheme of things. Existing harmoniously with other aspects of the game, Dune: Awakening is a faithful adaptation of the original Frank Herbert novels and one of this year's best survival-MMO games.Metascore: 78 | Read our Dune: Awakening review Days Gone RemasteredIf Days Gone didn't win you over the first time, it's unlikely that this remastered version will convince you to stick with it. An interesting but flawed exclusive from the PlayStation vault, Days Gone Remastered adds several welcome tweaks, with the big draw being the Horde Assault mode--a wave-based run-and-gun diversion that'll make you spend and sweat bullets.Metascore: 78Escape From DuckovOn the opposite side of the Escape from Tarkov spectrum, there's the delightfully named Escape from Duckov. You'd be forgiven for thinking that it's a quick attempt to cash in on the popularity of Escape From Tarkov, but at its core, Escape from Duckov is a genuinely fun parody of extraction shooters. Its core gameplay loop of raiding and extracting loot is a solid, refined package, adding several ideas of its own to the mix.Metascore: 77R-Type Delta: HD BoostedShoot-'em-up fans have been waiting a long time for R-Type Delta to make a return, as the PS1 classic has been left to gather dust since its last port back in 2009 for the PS3. R-Type Delta: HD Boosted brings the classic roaring back to life on modern consoles and PC, mixing exciting action with a tight gameplay loop, a killer soundtrack, and plenty of ship variety.Metascore: 77BladechimeraBladechimera doesn't rewrite the metroidvania playbook, but this satisfying blast of bullets and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night-inspired action excels at being a rock-solid action game. It's predictable but fun, digital comfort food that features cool cyberpunk themes, nostalgic pixel art, and robust gameplay.Metascore: 77Deadpool VRLast year saw Batman: Arkham Shadow pave the way for surprisingly great virtual-reality superhero games, and this year, Deadpool continued that trend. It's a surprisingly colorful dive into the headspace of Marvel's merc with a mouth--who is expertly brought to life by Doogie Howser himself, Neil Patrick Harris--and the gameplay does a solid job at making you feel like an almost-unkillable smartass armed to the teeth.Metascore: 76Revenge of the Savage PlanetBuilding on the foundation set by Journey to the Savage Planet, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a confident and creative follow-up to the 2019 game. While combat can become chaotic from time to time, it's the exploration, puzzle-solving, and cheeky satire all bundled up in a colorful space-adventure package that makes Revenge of the Savage Planet shine.Metascore: 76  | Read our Revenge of the Savage Planet reviewSniper Elite: ResistanceRebellion has made a name for itself mostly on its series of games that lets you explode the testicles and/or brains of Nazis, and Resistance doesn't stray far from that blueprint other than presenting players with a new playable character. Still, I guess there's something timeless about eradicating Nazis, isnt' there?Metascore: 75 | Read our Sniper Elite: Resistance reviewFragPunkIf Counter-Strike feels like it's passed you by, or maybe you're just looking for a new spin on the tense PvP formula it popularized, look no further than FragPunk. In this team-based PvP game, you'll navigate small, nerve-racking maps to plant or defuse bombs, but with an added twist of card-based modifiers, so no two rounds are ever the same.Metascore: 74Galactic GlitchTwin-stick shooters don't get enough love, but Galactic Glitch makes a strong case for the genre by adding some roguelike ingredients to the recipe. The result is an enjoyable sci-fi odyssey where you gradually increase your power and experiment with an impressive selection of tools.Metascore: 74Bounty StarIt's a scientific fact that mechs make everything better, and that's an idea that comes to life in Bounty Star. A game about catching crooks and tending to your crops, Bounty Star is a surprisingly meditative combination of combat and agriculture that's capped off by a touching story of hope and redemption.Metascore: 74AtomfallTo describe Atomfall as British Fallout would be a disservice to the game. Yes, it's clearly inspired by Bethesda's post-nuclear war series, but Atomfall goes above and beyond to offer a sense of freedom to players who find themselves caught inside a quarantine zone in an alternate-reality England that is still reeling from a mysterious nuclear accident. It rises above the Fallout comparisons with its gripping story, challenging action, and wonderfully weird mysteries.Metascore: 74 | Read our Atomfall review Mafia: The Old CountryThough its gameplay sections can feel a bit dated at times, this prequel set in the Mafia franchise ends up being a serviceable third-person shooter that more than makes up for that faint praise with a story that could stand up to anything else released this year. Marvelously written characters bring old-world Italy to life in this period-set mobster drama.Metascore: 73 | Read our Mafia: The Old Country reviewMetal EdenThe best boomer-shooters excel at making you feel like a one-man army: a sensation that Metal Eden excels at. Featuring some of the best gunplay of the year, the game's combat more than makes up for its shortcomings in the narrative department, making for a short and sweet romp.Metascore: 73WildgateSet in space and inspired by Sea of Thieves' PvP ship battles, Wildgate has you and a ragtag crew of space pirates chasing down rare artifacts and trying to escape with your life--and riches--before other crews can do you in. Wildgate may have been overshadowed by Arc Raiders when it comes to the year's biggest extraction shooters, but it's also quite different and is worth its own investment.Metascore: 72Escape From TarkovOn paper, Escape From Tarkov sounds like an anti-game. It's brutally unforgiving, and its online community won't hesitate to drop a magazine of digital bullets into your back. But that's what makes the game so exciting to begin with: Its survival gameplay and layered approach to preparing for the worst make each hard-earned victory feel that much more meaningful.Metascore: 72RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished BusinessRoboCop: Rogue City was an authentic adaptation of the classic action movies, but also a strangely paced adventure, with challenging levels bookended by boring downtime at the Metro West police precinct. Unfinished Business addresses Rogue City's creative flaws, as it throws players into a skyscraper populated with mercenaries, killer androids that RoboCop 3 fans will recognize, and several new toys with which to violently dispense justice.Metascore: 71AbyssusIn case you aren't tapped out from the roguelite genre, Abyssus is a fast and furious first-person dive into the genre. Set in an underwater kingdom, the game checks all the boxes for a roguelite game, mixing those mechanics with fast-paced gunplay that feels gratifying to unleash when you start to combo it with the right skills.Metascore: 71    \n  \n                      "

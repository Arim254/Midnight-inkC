Even in quick cuts, the teaser gives fans their first look at familiar faces: Andrew Koji's intense Ryu, Noah Centineo's Ken, and Callina Liang's Chun-Li. There's even Cody Rhodes as Guile doing his trademark somersault flash kick.Alongside the heroes, there are also brief looks at David Dastmalchian's M. Bison being theatrical with a cape flick, Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson's beefy Balrog, and Joe \"Roman Reigns\" Anoa'i as the terrifying Akuma, looking like he's powering up. There's also Eric Andre as announcer Don Sauvage and professional fighter Alexander Volkanovski as Joe, from the original Street Fighter game.Here, we've created a gallery to give fans a good look at the cast's costumes, but we're still unclear about the movie's plot, so enjoy these spoiler-free images.Street Fighter is scheduled for release on October 16, 2026."

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                If you want to get your hands on nearly a dozen free Switch games this holiday season, now's your chance. Starting today, No Gravity Games is giving away one Switch title per day through December 19, on which day there will be three free games. However, there is a catch that works out in your favor.          To claim a free game on Switch, players need to have claimed the previous day's title and maintained it in their library. You must also have at least one No Gravity title prior to claiming the first freebie, but there's a trick you can use to get that for free, too. Just visit No Gravity Games' official site and sign up for the newsletter, and you'll receive a free game. If you do this first, it will count as a \"purchased\" game from No Gravity and you're able to then claim the other games for free.If players do miss a day, they can rejoin the giveaway chain by purchasing the previous day's game, which will be available at a greatly reduced price. Each title becomes available for free at midnight PT and they will be available to claim on Nintendo's eShop until 11:59pm PT on the same day.While most of the free games are currently unrevealed, the first one is Bullets & Brains, a top-down arcade-style 3D shooter that pits players against an endless army of the living dead. Wreckin' Ball Adventure, Creepy Tale, Alder's Blood, and Destropolis are all glimpsed in the Switchmas Giveaway trailer above, but not yet confirmed as titles for this year's giveaway.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                From 1999 to 2017, Bruce Straley was one of the key players at Naughty Dog, and the co-director of two its best-selling games, The Last of Us and Uncharted 4. However, Straley essentially left the game industry for several years despite that impressive track record. Now, Straley is sharing more details regarding his departure, following up on comments he made years ago.\"I had been there 18 years. That's a long time for anybody to be anywhere,\" Straley told Polygon. \"I need new problems to solve, I need new creative outlets. I'm not saying there wouldn't be opportunities there, but couple that feeling with the idea that I was working really, really hard at something that wasn’t mine.\"Straley went on to explain that he didn't jump to another AAA studio because he felt Naughty Dog was the \"pinnacle\" of developers that made the games he was interested in. And he didn't want to deal with \"a whole different bureaucratic or cultural system.\"\"It really comes down to: Do you want to continue working for someone else and put in all the effort to build an IP, to build characters, to build things that a franchise could be built out of? I got paid very well there,\" added Straley. \"I got some appreciation there, but it felt like it was time to break out and try it on my own. It felt like it was time to evolve my concepts and build a new team. It might fail miserably, but I thought that it was at least my failure based on my choice.\"During The Game Awards, Straley's new team at Wildflower Interactive debuted their inaugural title, Coven of the Chicken Foot. It's a wordless single-player adventure that's completely unlike the games Straley made at Naughty Dog. Players assume control of a witch named Gertie and her creature companion as they try to fulfill her oath. The game doesn't currently have a release date.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

With over 100 million copies sold since its 1950 debut, there has been no shortage of print editions to pick from, but the brand-new collector's edition may be the coolest, budget-friendly edition yet. In celebration of the C.S. Lewis classic's 75th anniversary, HarperCollins created an eye-catching hardcover omnibus that could make for a lovely gift this holiday. The Chronicles of Narnia Deluxe Edition released October 28 and is now discounted to $55.35 (was $75) ahead of Black Friday 2025. As an added bonus, it's eligible for Amazon's Buy Two, Get One Free Book Sale this week.Amazon also has a fantastic deal on The Chronicles of Narnia Deluxe Hardcover Box Set. The seven-book, slipcase set hit stores in July with a $140 MSRP. As of November 11, you can get the hardcover collection for $51.47 when you click the coupon on the store page.

The book itself has a red cover with foil-stamped gold accents and the wardrobe portal on the cover. The custom red page edges feature an emblem representing each of the seven books in the series. On the interior covers, you'll find new fully illustrated, color maps of Narnia and its surrounding regions.The Deluxe Edition is also available with a faux velvet spine and custom slipcase for $129.56 (was $150).Narnia Omnibus EditionsDeluxe Edition -- $55.35 ($75) | B2G1 FreeDeluxe Slipcase Edition -- $129.56 ($150)Paperback -- $14.32 ($30)Like previous omnibus editions of The Chronicles of Narnia, the seven novels in the series clock in at 768 pages total. The book measures 6.3 x 2.1 x 9.1 inches. The paperback omnibus remains in print today and is available for only $14.32, which is 50% off its list price. We'd recommend looking at the sample pages of the paperback omnibus to see if you're okay with the somewhat small typeface.Here's the list of novels included in the omnibus:The Magician's NephewThe Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeThe Horse and His BoyPrince CaspianThe Voyage of the Dawn TreaderThe Silver ChairThe Last Battle                                                                                                                            The Chronicles of Narnia Deluxe Hardcover Box Set                                                                $51.47 (was $140) with coupon                                                                                                                                                                                    The Chronicles of Narnia Deluxe Hardcover Box Set comes with a slipcase with vibrant artwork featuring Aslan. As mentioned, this hardcover set launched in July with a fairly high $140 list price. The current $51.47 price is an all-time-low for the box set; it was selling for close to $80 last month.You'll miss out on the fancy metallic cover, decorative page edges, and foil-stamped case, but the Deluxe Hardcover Box Set is a better choice for kids and anyone who is concerned about the readability of the omnibus edition's typeface.The individual hardcover editions have similarly sized pages (6 x 9 inches), but together the seven novels are 1,668 pages--more than double the page count of the omnibus. If you compare the sample pages for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to the omnibus, you'll notice the individual hardcovers in this box set use larger fonts.HarperCollins also published a paperback version of the new box set, though it's not much cheaper than the nicer hardcover collection.If you opt for paperback copies, you should check out the Full-Color Collector's Edition, which launched in May with alternate covers and color versions of the illustrations found throughout the series.And for portable, pocket-sized editions, consider the mass market paperback box set, which was also published in May and is eligible for Amazon's B2G1 promotion.Narnia Box Sets (2025)Deluxe Hardcover Box Set -- $51.47 ($140)Paperback Box Set -- $37.74 ($77)Full-Color Collector's Edition -- $44.57 ($91)Pocket-sized Box Set -- $38.46 ($77) | B2G1 Free                         The Chronicles of Narnia Deluxe Hardcover Box SetSign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:                                Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 & PC For Only $40                         Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut                         Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (4)                 Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon                         Lego DC Batman Figure & Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else                         Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount                         Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                For the better part of three decades, Pokemon's creatures have been called upon by their human trainers to do battle with each other at their command. But in 2026, the Pokemon are finally going to have their own paradise in this world in Pokemon Pokopia.This upcoming cozy game isn't about Pokemon knocking the heck out of each other. Instead, the player can offer them the chance to live side-by-side in an environment that's been specifically tailored to their individual needs. There's no need to fight over anything, or even any need for a human to determine their destiny. Players may be guiding the actions of the Pokemon, but Pokopia will be built by a Ditto one brick at a time.When will Pokemon Pokopia be released?Pokemon Pokopia will be released on March 5, 2026. When the game was announced in September 2025, Pokemon Pokopia only had a vague 2026 release window. In November, Nintendo has formally announced that the game would be released just four short months later, in early March 2026.Pokemon Pokopia Trailers          Only the announcement trailer has been released to date, but there's not really a story in this game. Instead of placing a human at the center of the gameplay, Pokopia introduces a Ditto that uses its natural transformation abilities to pass itself off as a human. This Ditto isn't hiding its true nature from the other Pokemon, but its ability to have a human body with Pokemon skills will go a long way towards the shaping the landscape.Pokemon Pokopia PlatformsAlthough Pokemon Pokopia doesn't appear to be too visually taxing for either model of the Switch, it will be exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2. Players who only have the original Switch will have to upgrade before they can move into Pokopia.Pokemon Pokopia Story, Setting and CharactersDitto is the main character of Pokemon Pokopia, but the trailer confirms that other classic Pokemon--including Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander--will be drawn to Pokopia by the choices made by Ditto.There don't appear to be any outside threats in this game. And as long as the Pokemon feel taken care of, it looks like they're going to be very happy in their new home. As for Ditto, it's unclear if its human-facing appearance can be customized by gender. But it seems like a safe bet that there will be some customization options.Pokemon Pokopia GameplayThe gameplay looks like a cross between Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and Dragon Quest Builders. In the trailer, Ditto demonstrates the ability to mimic the powers of other Pokemon to make grass grow or retrieve raw materials to craft objects and dwellings. Ditto can build homes for the Pokemon, transform the landscape, and even divert water to the area for a waterfall and ponds.Ditto can also grow crops and cook food for the Pokemon, and the trailer indicates that other player characters will also be able to visit the home you've made for yourself in the game.Pokemon Pokopia Development NewsPokemon Pokopia is being developed by Omega Force, the studio behind the Dynasty Warrior franchise, Persona 5 Strikers, and Fire Emblem Warriors. Omega Force has also had a lot of success working with Nintendo on the Legend of Zelda spin-offs Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.For now, it's unknown if Pokemon Pokopia will receive any post-launch DLC from Omega Force after the game's release in March 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

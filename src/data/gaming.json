    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 15, 2025 at 9:00PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Are you curious about the best starter Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A? As with the past games in the series, you're given three options to choose from at the beginning of the campaign. This decision is pivotal, given that the creature that you pick becomes your main partner throughout your journey.What is the best starter Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A - Chikorita, Totodile, or TepigThe three starter Pokemon are actually from previous releases: Chikorita and Totodile are from Gen 2--i.e. Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. Tepig, meanwhile, is from Gen 5--i.e. Pokemon Black and White.Naturally, the Pokemon you pick at this stage will end up becoming one of the strongest in your squad as you progress through the game. As such, you need to be mindful of the one that you select.Chikorita vs. Totodile vs. TepigThere are a few factors to consider when talking about the best starter Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Firstly, long-time fans would remember how Cyndaquil was the ideal choice in the older games, with Totodile coming in second and Chikorita falling far behind in last place.Granted, Legends: Z-A has its own campaign progression system and a different assortment of creatures in Lumiose City. In the end, it boils down to your ideal pick depending on their type/element and evolution:Chikorita  Type: GrassEvolution 1: Bayleef at level 16Evolution 2: Meganium at level 32Totodile  Type: WaterEvolution 1: Croconaw at level 18Evolution 2: Feraligatr at level 30Tepig  Type: FireEvolution 1: Pignite at level 17Evolution 2: Emboar at level 36Grass vs. Water vs. FireElemental strengths and weaknesses should also be given importance:Chikorita (Grass) does extremely well against Water, Ground, and Rock. It's mostly ineffective against Fire, Grass, Poison, Flying, Bug, Dragon, and Steel.Totodile (Water) does extremely well against Fire, Ground, and Rock. It's mostly ineffective against Water, Grass, and Dragon.Tepig (Fire) does extremely well against Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel. It's mostly ineffective against Fire, Water, Rock, and Dragon.Sorry, Chikorita fans, but Grass-type Pokemon still draw the short end of the stick here due to weaker output against multiple enemy types. Water and Fire are mostly on par with each other. Just note that several early-game opponents that you face tend to be Normal, Grass, Ground, Flying, and Fighting types, too.Are there starter Pokemon from past generations?Aside from the best starter Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, there are many other creatures that can join your squad. In fact, you can get a Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander--the \"OG\" Pokemon from Gen 1--just a few hours after starting the campaign proper.This takes place during Side Mission 22: A Call from Mable. Visit Mable in the Pokemon Research Center to see the three OGs lounging around in her room. Then, go ahead and choose one to become a permanent addition to your team.Note: The Pokemon that you choose here should complement your main partner. For instance, if you picked Totodile instead of Tepig, then you might want to get Charmander. Once they evolve into a Charizard, they'll become your Fire-based heavy-hitter.Are there any other Pokemon I should look out for?You'll find more options as you continue to explore Lumiose City. Ideally, you'll want to catch the Alpha variants of Pokemon. These creatures are bigger and meaner compared to their counterparts, making them look more ferocious when you bring them out in battles. Shiny variants are also a given since they're a lot rarer than the regular spawns. Of course, there are other early-game creatures that you should catch to fine-tune your team.That does it for our guide on the best starter Pokemon in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Don't forget that several of your teammates undergo unique transformations that make them more powerful. You can learn about this mechanic in our Mega Evolutions guide.You don't need to face the challenges in Lumiose City all by your lonesome. We've got a Pokemon Legends: Z-A guides hub to help you go from the bottom to the very top of the rankings.    \n  \n                      "

These items have a purple glow and they tend to be visible from afar. The goal is to amass a bunch of them so you can obtain Canari Plushies that grant permanent buffs.Where to find all Colorful Screws in Pokemon Legends: Z-AAlmost all Colorful Screws in the game can be found on rooftops or scaffolding/construction sites in Lumiose City. In most cases, they're grouped into clusters--i.e. two or more in the same general location.Do take note that you're going to see these items as you explore the city. However, we suggest progressing further into the campaign until you hit Rank E in the Z-A Royale. This is when Urbain unlocks your Roto-Glide ability. If you press and hold the A button while falling, you'll gain an upward boost, allowing you to reach higher ledges and platforms.Canari Plushie rewards from Colorful ScrewsBefore we discuss the locations of Colorful Screws in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, let's talk about the rewards that are up for grabs: Canari Plushies. The items you collect can be exchanged with an NPC in front of the Racine Construction building at the southeastern corner of the map.The five Canari Plushies have unique effects that are permanent. Their effects can also be improved by purchasing the successive upgrades, which cost more Colorful Screws:Red Canari Plush - Increases the amount of XP earned by your Pokemon. Note that the first tier is automatically granted by an NPC named Tarragon early in the campaign.Gold Canari Plush - Increases the amount of prize money you earn from the Battle Zone.Pink Canari Plush - Increases the amount of Mega Shards you acquire from smashing pink crystals. This currency is used to purchase various Mega Evolution keystones.Green Canari Plush - Makes you less likely to black out--i.e. increases the amount of times you can take successive hits.Blue Canari Plush - Improves your success rate when attempting to catch Pokemon.Colorful Screw locations in southern Lumiose CityThe map above shows the locations of Colorful Screws in the southern part of Lumiose City. We've numbered each cluster accordingly:Location #1: On a scaffolding near the Racine Construction building. There's also another one inside the building itself, which appears once you've beaten Canari as part of your main mission.Location #2: On a scaffolding and the rooftop due west of the Pokemon Research Center.Locations #3 and 4: Several are found on scaffolding and rooftops at the western side of the row of buildings.Location #5 and 6: The first one is directly across a bridge. The second item is off to the side of a garden, but you need to blast an frozen platform with a Fire ability.Location #7: At the top of a construction area in a garden north of Hotel Z.Location #8: On a roof directly west of Wild Zone 2. Location #9: At the top of a construction area north of Wild Zone 2.Colorful Screw locations in northern Lumiose CityThere are several Colorful Screws in the northern section of Lumiose City. As usual, you need to climb higher to reach these areas:Location #1: Due south of Wild Zone 14. Location #2: At the top of the steps across a rooftop cafe.Location #3: On the glass roof of the outlet shops.Location #4: There are three on the scaffolding east of Wild Zone 4. You need to drop down and activate your Roto-Glide to maneuver between the spaces.Location #5: Keep climbing up the scaffolding and roofs west of Wild Zone 8--i.e. the Jaune sectors.Location #6: Several of these items are fairly close to each other. Once you reach the top of the scaffolding, you'll see a glowing item to the left, and another one below the patio. One more item is on the roof of the city hall, but you need to be careful with your Roto-Glide due to the gap.That does it for our guide on where to find Colorful Screws in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. We'll update this article once we discover other items, so stay tuned.

The latest entry in Nintendo's long-running franchise promises more thrills as you duke it out against rival trainers, all while catching numerous creatures. Of course, given that this is a spinoff/sub-series, you probably want to compare it to mainline titles, too. In any case, our guide has all the details, but please note that there are also minor spoilers ahead.On the average, it should take you roughly 22 to 25 hours to beat Pokemon Legends: Z-A if you're just focusing on the main story. This is par for the course when compared to the previous title, Pokemon Legends: Arceus. However, this estimate is still significantly shorter compared to mainline entries--i.e. the ones that take you across multiple zones/regions--as those can take anywhere from 30 to 40 hours to complete.However, the number skyrockets to roughly 70 to 80 hours for completionists. This includes tackling all side quests, filling up your Pokedex, and unlocking all Mega Evolutions.Note: A speedy completion depends on your team setup. If you have a powerful Pokemon companion, then the rest of your squad can just earn XP passively, and you can use them later when they're more effective against certain opponents.

Think of these as boss fights where your foes have ultimate abilities.These bouts reward you with a unique keystones that unlock Mega Evolutions for the Pokemon in your squad.You still need to earn points for your event ticket, though there are more quests that you need to tackle before facing a rival trainer.Basically, the second half of the campaign still follows the same structure, albeit one that's longer and more drawn out.Main mission listHere are the main missions that you need to complete in Pokemon Legends: Z-A:01: Get Your Travel Bag Back02: Escape from the Battle Zone03: A New Life in Lumiose City04: Battling in the Z-A Royale05: The City in the Shadow of the Prism Tower06: Reaching Rank X07: Reaching Rank W08: Reaching Rank V09: Chase that Mysterious Pokemon10: The Secrets of Mega Evolution11: A Rogue Mega Slowbro12: A Rogue Mega Camerupt13: A Rogue Mega Victreebell14: Reaching Rank E15: A Job for Team MZ16: A Rogue Mega Beedrill17: A Rogue Mega Hawlucha18: A Rogue Mega Banette19: Reaching Rank D20: A Request from the Rust Syndicate21: A Rogue Mega Mawile22: A Rogue Mega Barbaracle23: A Rogue Mega Ampharos24: Reaching Rank C25: A Showdown on the Battle Court26: An Invitation from the SBC27: A Rogue Mega Frosslass28: A Rogue Mega Altaria29: A Rogue Mega Venusaur30: Reaching Rank B31: A Summons from Vinnie32: A Rogue Mega Dragonite33: A Rogue Mega Tyranitar34: A Rogue Mega Starmie35: Reaching Rank A36: [REDACTED]37: [REDACTED]After completing Mission 37, you're pretty much done with the campaign proper.

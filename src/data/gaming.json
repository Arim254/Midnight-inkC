    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nSkate's huge launch paints a hopeful picture, but the once dominating genre still has a ways to goBy \n    Moises Taveras\n   on October 14, 2025 at 3:24PM PDT\n              \n                Maybe you've noticed, but everywhere you look now, skating is back.Though skateboarding games once dominated the gaming scene in the 2000s, the well appeared to all but dry up as the ambitions of the games industry evolved through the decades. Recently, however, there's been a resurgence of skating games, and an audience made up of both oldheads and fresh-faced players alike has been showing up for them. It feels safe to say there's still an appetite for these kinds of titles. With the early-access release of EA's Skate--a revival of a series that once took up a lot of space in this industry--as well as the acclaimed releases of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater remakes, the once-dying genre seems primed for a comeback.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer\n      \nI first clocked this resurgence a while ago while playing an entirely different kind of skate game: a remarkably chill longboarding game called Driftwood. In Driftwood, you take on the role of a pretty cool sloth who carves and bombs--in skating parlance, to \"bomb\" means to ride down a huge hill--picturesque mountainsides. As a guy who longboarded back in high school and primarily cruised through the city, Driftwood brought me back to what first turned me onto skating--the rush of wind in my admittedly unprotected hair as I barreled down derelict roads and hills, and the satisfying (not to mention casual) coolness I'd feel swerving through throngs of walkers and traffic. It feels suiting, then, that the game that reminded me why I loved skating also opened my eyes to just how many skating games had emerged in the past few years.For years now, developers have been producing a remarkable spectrum of titles, from the outlandish SkateBird to simulators like the aptly named Session: Skating Sim. SkaterXL came around a number of years ago, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk landed with all the noise and aplomb of Hawk's first successful 900--and has a sequel on the way--and all the while, the OlliOlli games grew in size, substance, and style with every new release right up until Roll7's unfortunate closure.There's been no shortage of skating games keeping the dream to shred alive, but with Skate's return, it feels like all the sectors of games development--the indie, AA, and AAA space, to be clear--are fully in the throes of a skating game renaissance.So why exactly is this the moment for these kinds of games to re-emerge? What about the gaming landscape of 2025, and the last few years preceding it, has made developers choose to revisit this part of gaming's past?A sloth skates downhill in DriftwoodAccording to Jason Mann, one of the developers who worked on Driftwood, the answer's pretty simple. \"If I had to guess, it's probably that the people who grew up with the Skate and Tony Hawk series are getting old enough to make their own games, or at least have a bigger sway on consumer spending.\" Considering the timing, he's not exactly wrong. The Tony Hawk games first began appearing on the market back in the late '90s and the Skate series began about a decade after them. The average kid who played either is likely in a position to work in the industry and do something about their conspicuous hiatuses, the result of which we're seeing now. Given the industry's penchant for nostalgia and revisiting the touchstones of its past, this seems like the safest bet.By and large, I agree with this opinion. But while I find the resurgence of skating games a welcome one, it also feels a bit like a tactical retreat at times. Maybe it's just the cynic in me, but when surveying the state of the games industry, one has to wonder: What works anymore? At a time when the field is fraught with layoffs and cancellations, it feels natural to see a reflexive nostalgia for the games that developers grew up with--games with legacies defined by their massive success and staying power. It makes ample sense then for something like Skate, which reshapes a beloved property into a new live-service model, to exist--even if it leaves audiences trepidatious.For Jeffrey Spicer, a producer at crea-ture Studios who works on Session, the resurgence is reflective of skating culture's own highs and lows in popularity. Spicer added, however, that regardless of mainstream appeal, \"there is always a core group of individuals that want a game that allows them the freedom and expression presented in real-life skating.\" It's a tough sentiment to deny when so many different skating games have cropped up over the years--a diversity that both he and Mann happily championed. It's especially fun seeing skate mechanics crop up in less-likely places too, like Thirsty Suitors from Outerloop Games back in 2023, the recently released Sword of the Sea (which seems more equivalent to surfing but we'll still take it!), and even last year's GameSpot GOTY, Metaphor: ReFantazio.Amusingly, the latter two of these titles allow players to ride on a sword. If I had a nickel for every time that happened, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.Metaphor: ReFantazio's protagonist skates through Grandtrad on his sword.For Spicer, this sort of looming spectre of skating is likely because \"the desire for skating games [has] never truly dwindled.\" Mann echoed this thought, pointing to how previous Tony Hawk and Skate games have enjoyed \"cult followings that appear to get quite some social media engagement.\" And how many of us haven't seen some wildly popular shortform video of a player hitting an unbelievable Christ Air in Skate 3 set to Pearl Jam's \"Even Flow.\"Still, the uptick in skating games and their popularity is becoming palpable, which Spicer attributes to \"the growing playerbase\" and their demand for more. Fortunately, this moment feels ripe for someone who might want to get into them and clearly there is a desire. Mat Piscatella, a senior director and analyst at the market research company Circana, confirmed that Skate's release for EA seemed to be off to a \"phenomenal start.\" Evidently, the free-to-play revival of the series \"ranked among the top 5 titles in weekly total actives\" over the majority of the platforms for which numbers are reported, putting its starting audience on par with the likes of giants like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto. While it is typical of tentpole releases to see huge numbers out the door, it's a little rarer to see the feat accomplished by a title belonging to a once popular niche in a series that hasn't released a game in 15 years, making Skate's debut a refreshing shock to the system.Speaking of their once dominating presence, Piscatella also shared that when he worked at Activision, \"Tony Hawk games were what games like Call of Duty and Madden are today: annualized releases with a loyal audience that would buy the new version every year.\" The challenge now, as Piscatella puts it, is to turn these \"pulses,\" instances where a sporadic major release spiked interest and sales in skating games, into a flashpoint that translates to more staying power. Maybe Skate can manage that feat, but folks like Mann would also welcome more original games from the genre's other big series, as well as skating games with \"full-fledged story modes\" and a bit more grit.No matter what form or shape it takes, the devs I spoke to seemed enthusiastic. Not just about the mainstream moment skating games are once again having, but at the prospect of their own work keeping a \"torch lit for future generations to find skating,\" per Spicer.\"Be it getting new kids on their first board or getting old skaters to dust off their set ups, skating is for everyone.\"\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    James Carr\n   on October 14, 2025 at 5:09PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The Season 4.5 update for Marvel Rivals has arrived, adding another new hero to the ever-growing roster. Daredevil joins the roster, adding to the massive selection of Duelists on the Marvel Rivals roster. While he might not have the same explosiveness as Black Panther or Magik, Daredevil is a dive powerhouse in his own right, and his radar sense can keep your team from getting flanked.Daredevil overviewDaredevil is on the beefier end of Duelists, with a base HP of 300, allowing him to take some hits as he closes the distance on opponents. While playing Daredevil, you will have to deal with a pinkish outline of the map and enemies, with the \"normal\" vision limited to relatively close. Daredevil can see enemies that are moving through walls within a certain distance, whom he can tag with his Sonic Pursuit ability. This gives Daredevil a speed boost when closing in on the target and allows for a dash once they are within range that blinds.As for attacks, Daredevil wields his Billy Clubs, which have a close-range attack pattern and build Fury upon attacking enemies. Daredevil also has the Devil's Latch, which is another movement ability, grappling Daredevil towards either his target or whatever part of the environment he hits, also building Fury. Fury can be used to activate his Infernal Fury, which lets you either use the Devil's Chain, a close-range attack that grants bonus health based on damage dealt, or Devil's Throw, a ranged ability that can ricochet and slow hit enemies. His ultimate, which creates a large AoE, damages enemies within Daredevil's sight and blinds them, while constantly building Daredevil's Fury meter.Daredevil abilities and team-upsJustice Jab (primary): Swing Billy Clubs forward. Gain Fury on hit.Righteous Cross: Cross your Billy Clubs and surge forward. Gain Fury on hit.Objection!: Whirl Billy clubs in a tight guard to block frontal damage and reflect projectiles, becoming immune to all incoming harm during this stance and gain Fury.Devil's Latch: Fire a grappling line that reels Daredevil and his target toward each other. On completion, gain Fury and temporarily enable Cross Interrogation.Infernal Fury: Expend Fury to unleash Devil's Chain or Devil's Throw. Devil's Chain converts damage into Bonus Health, while Devil's Throw Slows enemies on hit and temporarily enables Cross Interrogation.Sonic Pursuit: Locks onto a target, gaining increased Speed and Damage Reduction when attacked. While in range, dash to the target, Blinding them and restore Fury.Radar Sense (passive): Detect enemy movements within a set radius.Blind Ascent: Run along walls and spring off them to reposition.Let The Devil Out (ultimate): Embrace the Beast within. Enemies in Daredevil's line of sight take damage and suffer a ramping Blind effect. Continually gain Fury while active.Blind Verdict (team-up): Daredevil shares the location of his Sonic Pursuit target with The Punisher. At the same time, The Punisher can launch a devil-infused shock grenade to damage and blind enemies.Hand-to-hand combatOutside of Daredevil's ultimate and the occasional favorable ricochet from Devil's Throw, he excels in one-on-one combat the best. The attack combo follows a relatively simple flow. Start with the Sonic Pursuit, use the dash to get in close, and start wailing on them with Infernal Fury into Devil's Chain. In between uses, you'll need to rebuild Fury with basic attacks, but continually using Devil's Chain will give you bonus health, which should make it easy to win a one-on-one fight against most non-Vanguard enemies. If an enemy starts to run, close the distance with Devil's Latch or finish them off with a Devil's throw.A master of defenseDespite being designed with a dive playstyle in mind, Daredevil works well as a defensive counter to a dive-heavy opponent. Because Daredevil can see nearby enemies through walls--as long as they are moving--he can play defense for your Strategists on the backline, intercepting incoming attackers before they have a chance to take out your supports. While he won't replace anti-dive Duelists like Namor fully, he can run enough interference to keep your team moving forward on offense.Let the devil outDaredevil's ultimate ability, Let The Devil Out, is as much about crowd control as it is about finishing off opponents. It does a low amount of damage continuously to enemies within his vision, so it can be used to take out escaping opponents or to take out a bunch of enemies that are low. Since it has a large AoE effect that is visible to opponents, most people will try to flee out of range once you use it, which can be used to push enemies back or to get them off an objective. The damage by itself isn't going to take out enemies by itself, so you will need to keep beating down with your Billy Clubs, but it's enough damage to throw your opponents off temporarily.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Tencent Games and developer Grey State Studio aren't sending players to Hell in their upcoming game, Rules of Engagement: The Grey State. But this free-to-play tactical-horror action-RPG shooter might be Hell-adjacent, thanks to a nightmarish realm filled with monsters and other unspeakable creatures.          The Grey State is the name of an unstable dimension that's too dangerous for humanity, but it also contains alien artifacts that are invaluable. To survive in this hellscape, players assume the role of Striders who remotely pilot their bio-engineered shells from the comfort of their own dimension. Grey State Studios describes The Grey State as a \"graveyard of nightmares\" and a \"Horrorverse\" that includes Lovecraftian creatures, as well as monsters inspired by films, books, and even creepypasta online tales.The gameplay is a PvEvP loop that gives players only a limited time to drop into The Grey State. Striders will have to scavenge for gear inside the nightmarish dimension and ultimately choose between accepting an early extraction for limited rewards or taking a shot at even bigger profits if they can beat their fellow players to an alien artifact.          Grey State Studios is planning an alpha test for Rules of Engagement that will feature four classes of Striders that players can pick. The fourth option is currently being hidden, but the other three are listed below.Sledge, an unstoppable juggernaut that forges a path with shield and hammerPyro, a chaotic madman that controls the battlefield with fire and gasPhantom, a swift assassin that strikes from the shadows with extreme precisionThe studio notes that players who demonstrate talent for buildcrafting and strategy will reap the rewards in this game. It also added that \"Rules of Engagement was built with the future in mind, and we plan to support the game for years to come with content updates, meta shakeups and player-friendly free-to-play business model supported by a cosmetics-only in-game shop.\"Rules of Engagement: The Grey State will hit PC in 2026, and it can be played as a single-player experience or with up to three other players. Additional seasonal content is planned post-launch to explore other aspects of the game's Horrorverse.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

This is a reprint of the 2023 release of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves on 4K Blu-ray--but unlike that older version, the digital streaming key included in the new 4K Steelbook edition will still be valid. Preorders are available for $37 at Amazon.

Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among ThievesA critical hit--but sadly not a commercial one--Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves was praised for its ensemble cast, vibrant worldbuilding, and its faithful adaptation of the tabletop game. Starring Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, and Hugh Grant, the movie tells the story of a band of thieves and adventurers on an epic heist to retrieve a lost relic and save the day.If you're looking for a few bargains ahead of Black Friday, several big Blu-ray box sets have gotten an early discount. The pricy--and artisanal--Wes Anderson 4K Blu-ray Collection has been discounted by 50%, hundreds of movies from the Criterion Collection are also 50% off, and The Shining 4K Special Edition Steelbook has gotten a massive discount at Amazon. You can also save big on the Blu-ray box set of HBO's Succession, get the new reprint of the Indiana Jones 4K steelbook collection, and prep for Predator Badlands with classic films and graphic novels.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:                                Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 & PC For Only $40                         Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut                         Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (4)                 Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon                         Lego DC Batman Figure & Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else                         Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount                         Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

From now until December 2, new and returning subscribers can sign up for an annual plan for only $49 (was $98). Walmart+ is already packed with value at full price, so the 50% discount makes it an absolute bargain. For instance, one of the perks is access to Paramount+ Essential or Peacock Premium. Do you subscribe to either of those streaming services? You are most likely spending more just on one of those services than you would on a Walmart+ annual plan right now.The Walmart+ promotion is timed around the retailer's trio of holiday sales, the first of which kicks off tonight. Members can shop Walmart's Black Friday 2025 and Cyber Monday sales events five hours early. The retailer's first Black Friday Deals Event runs November 14-16, but members can start shopping later today at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET. The three-day sale will be available for everyone at 9 PM PT. Walmart Black Friday / Cyber Monday Deals Events:Black Friday Sale 1 -- Nov. 14-16 | Early Access: Nov. 13 at 7 PM ETBlack Friday Sale 2 -- Nov. 25-30 | Early Access: Nov. 24 at 7 PM ETCyber Monday Sale -- Dec. 1 | Early Access: Nov. 30 at 7 PM ET                                 Walmart+ 1-Year Membership                                                                $49 (was $98)                                                                                                                                                                                    Considering some of the best gaming, tech, and collectible deals routinely sell out during the early access portion of Walmart sales--or within minutes of the official start time--the membership can make it a lot easier to secure the deals you're eyeing. Outside of early access to major sales, Walmart also sometimes hosts members-only restock events for Pokemon and Magic: The Gathering trading cards.But even without early access or first dibs on restocks, the year-round benefits make Walmart+ a great subscription program.Here are the highlights:Free shipping on all online ordersFree same-day delivery from store ($35 minimum)Paramount+ Essential or Peacock Premium  Choose one every 90 days.Save 10 cents per gallon on fuelEarly access to big sales and product restocksFree online pet careFree returns from homeWalmart+ Cash on travel bookingsRotating select of limited-time offersNote: Active subscribers are not eligible for the sign-up promotion.                      The free shipping on online orders is similar to Amazon Prime. Orders are typically delivered within two days, though one- and even same-day delivery are regular occurrences.The free delivery from local stores perk is an even larger benefit, depending on your proximity to a brick-and-mortar store. Many subscribers can get their entire grocery orders delivered. But even if your Walmart doesn't have a full supermarket, it's still nice to be able to get free delivery on random products you'd normally have to drive to the store to buy. Local delivery is often fulfilled the same day you place your order, and you can schedule the time slot when making your purchase.Walmart recently updated its streaming service perk from Paramount+ Essential to the choice between Paramount+ Essential and Peacock Premium. What's cool is that you can switch between the two every 90 days.Other perks include 10 cents off fuel, free pharmacy deliveries, free online pet care via Pawp, free automobile tire repair, 5% back in Walmart Cash on travel via Expedia, and the ability to return unwanted purchases from home. And if you do still find yourself in your local Walmart after getting a subscription, you can use the app to scan your items as you shop, which allows you to skip the normal checkout process.

Released last December, Monopoly: Pokemon Edition is one of the most popular editions of the classic board game you can buy today. We imagine some Pokemon fans have purchased it simply to get the adorable miniature figures of Pikachu, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly that are used as tokens. But it's also a fun, faster-paced take on Monopoly.If you're interested in this deal, you should snag it soon. Target's deal expires on Friday, and if that happens, Amazon's deal will likely disappear, too.                                  Monopoly: Pokemon Edition Board Game                                                                $16 (was $25)                                                                                                                                                                                    In Monopoly: Pokemon Edition, instead of buying and collecting property with Monopoly Money, 2-4 players use Poke Balls to search for Pokemon on spaces around the colorful board. The goal is to catch eight types of Pokemon or be the last trainer with any Poke Balls left in their inventory. It's not all too surprising that this edition of Pokemon Monopoly has been extremely popular. What is somewhat surprising, however, is that sold for only $25 out of the gate. Licensed editions of Monopoly based on huge media franchises routinely sell for around $40.                      Monopoly: Pokemon Edition (Hasbro Gaming)Monopoly: Pokemon Kanto Edition released way back in 2014 for $45. It's been out of print for years, but surprisingly it's available for $45 from a reseller on Amazon (ships from Amazon). The Kanto Edition features metal tokens of Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Eevee, and Jigglypuff. Monopoly: Pokemon Johto Edition is available for $58 from a reseller on Walmart's site. Released in 2016, the Johto Edition comes with six metal game pieces featuring Pikachu, Totodile, Togepi, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Pichu.For another themed version of a classic board game, check out Ravensburger’s Pokemon Labyrinth. Your goal is to navigate through an ever-shifting maze to track down various Pokemon. Matches are quick at around 30 minutes, and you can compete against up to three other players. A cool glow-in-the-dark version of Pokemon Labyrinth launched last fall. Both editions retail for $30.And if you're interested in learning the ropes of the Pokemon Trading Card Game, the 2022 and 2024 editions of Pokemon Battle Academy are available for cheap. Each one comes with three pre-built decks, a playmat, and everything you need to start battling. It's a great way for kids (and adults!) to get started with Pokemon TCG.

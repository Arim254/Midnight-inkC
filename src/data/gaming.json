    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The existence of a long-rumored remake of Capcom's Resident Evil 0 is now looking even more likely, with a new report corroborating not only that its existence but also new details about the game's cast and story.As reported by MP1st, the rumored remake of the 2002-prequel is officially being referred to within Capcom as project \"Chamber,\" seemingly a reference to the game's main protagonist Rebecca Chambers. The game has reportedly been in development for several years, with performance-capture work starting sometime in 2024.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Ode to Horror: A Celebration of Resident Evil\n      \nThat same \"Chamber\" codename appears on the resume of actor Jon McLaren, known for playing Star Lord in Square Enix's 2021 Guardians of the Galaxy game. His resume lists \"Project Chamber\" as his most recent video game project, labeling it as an upcoming AAA game in which he plays a lead character. He also lists the project as coming from the motion-capture company Beyond Capture Studios. It's that same motion capture studio that has worked with Capcom on games like Street Fighter 6 and the Resident Evil 4 remake.While it's not confirmed who McLaren is playing in the remake, it's likely Billy Coen, the male lead in Resident Evil 0 who aids Chambers in her mission to uncover more about a zombie outbreak on the outskirts of Raccoon City.Resident Evil 0's opening hours take place on a zombie-infested train, and according to MP1st, the remake will more fully flesh out various plot details and characters only alluded to in the original. That includes making the train's conductor a full-fledged character that interacts with Chambers and Coen rather than only being referenced like in the original.As for when the Resident Evil 0 remake will arrive, it's likely still a few years away. A recent statement from frequent Capcom leaker DuskGolem points towards the Resident Evil 0 remake not releasing until 2028, with another rumored remake, Code Veronica, set for 2027. Neither remake has been officially announced by Capcom.The next mainline entry in the series, Resident Evil Requiem, is coming February 27, 2026. It stars the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft, and will finally return the franchise to Raccoon City.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The developer has confirmed that after seven years and 50+ updates, The Sims Mobile will go offline for good on January 20, 2026.At 1:59 PM UTC that day, the game will no longer be playable at all. There is no offline mode, so the game will be gone for good at this time.\"The Sims Mobile and The Sims community as a whole are full of creativity, kindness, and imagination. You've amazed us with your stories, builds, and Sims. We're proud to have shared this journey with you,\" the developer said.There will be a number of events coming to The Sims Mobile ahead of the shutdown, now through January 2026, and you can see a complete rundown on EA's website (via PC Gamer).Say goodbye to The Sims Mobile.The final update for The Sims Mobile went live today, October 20, and from this date forward, players cannot buy any in-game packs or spend real money. Players who have a balance of SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets can continue to use these until the game closes in January 2026. Unspent currency will not be eligible for a refund after January 20, 2026.The October 20 update also added \"unlimited energy\" to The Sims Mobile, which will help players progress more quickly while the game remains online.On October 21, The Sims Mobile will be delisted from mobile game stores. Anyone who has the game installed currently or previously, however, can keep playing until January 2026.EA also announced that on January 6, 2026, all Build Mode and Create A Sim items will be unlocked for everyone. \"We want to give everyone the opportunity to build their dream home, design their perfect Sims, and experience everything The Sims Mobile has to offer before the servers close,\" the developer said.EA regularly closes servers for older titles for a variety of reasons, but the company did not provide any details on why The Sims Online is being taken offline in January 2026. The announcement of the game's upcoming closure came not long after EA announced that it was selling itself to an investor consortium including Saudi Arabia for $55 billion.While The Sims Mobile is coming to an end, EA continues to support The Sims 4 with new content, but it's sold so much DLC for that game that the company doesn't plan to make The Sims 5.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

To promote the game with a stunt worthy of Ryu himself, Team Ninja community manager Emmanuel \"Master\" Rodriguez and musician Swae Lee took a ride over Miami in a helicopter while Rodriguez played Ninja Gaiden 4 on a large screen held aloft by another helicopter.          According to Xbox Wire, this stunt set a new Guinness World Record for the largest video game display flown by helicopter. While Rodriguez guided Yakumo through his trials, Lee performed tracks from his record, \"Flammable.\"The stunt was inspired by Ninja Gaiden 4's story, which takes place among the skyscrapers of Tokyo, which have been expanded upon and raised even higher because the lower city has been ruined by toxic floodwaters. The Ninja Gaiden games have had high-flying action before, but it's going to another level in this sequel.Ninja Gaiden 4 will be released on October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PS5, but the official launch times may come a little earlier depending on where you live. This sequel will also be a day-one release for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The famously hard series will have more flexibility with the difficulty settings in this game.Earlier this month, Tomonobu Itagaki, the video game developer behind Dead or Alive and the Ninja Gaiden revival, passed away at the age of 58.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's been a very good year for indie titles on Steam, even in the aftermath of Hollow Knight: Silksong's blockbuster success. Last week, Escape From Duckov somehow briefly outgunned Battlefield 6. Now, another indie game, RV There Yet, has raced past 1.3 million sales in a single week.          RV There Yet is the debut game of Nuggets Entertainment, and up to four players can join this co-op experience as they get behind the wheel of an RV home while attempting a very perilous side route through Mabutts Valley. The goal of the game is to get the RV past obstacles that it would ordinarily be unable to traverse. To pull that off, players will have to leave the RV and creatively use a winch and other tools to get by. As seen in the trailer above, some of those attempts can end very badly. This band of bros also has to deal with wildlife and snakes, which is why an EpiPen is one of their primary tools.According to SteamDB, RV There Yet had over 100,000 concurrent players in its first week. Nuggets Entertainment community manager Jace Varlet subsequently posted the following video, in which he thanks players on behalf of the team. He also explains why the game wasn't marked as \"early access.\"          In short, Nuggets Entertainment didn't expect this game to take off the way it did, and the studio just wanted to finish the title by its internally agreed-upon release date. There weren't originally any plans to add more content to RV There Yet, but that may soon change. Meanwhile, Varlet acknowledged that there are some bugs in the game and he pledged that they will be fixed.There aren't any current plans for RV There Yet to make the leap to consoles, but it's currently on sale on Steam for $7.19 before reverting to its regular price of $8 on October 28. Nuggets has also been concurrently developing another title called Among the Wild, but it just isn't ready for release yet.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

These two franchises having the same owner is about all they have in common.Season 4 of PGA Tour 2K25 will include a \"Mayhem on the Greens\" event that brings Borderlands to the golf sim. \"Mayhem on the green incoming!!\" Borderlands developer Gearbox said.The Mayhem on the Greens event begins Wednesday, October 29, but neither 2K Sports nor Gearbox have provided any details about what to expect from it. The teaser art shows a Psycho character wielding a special type of golf club that looks like it was made in the wasteland.This won't be the first time that PGA Tour 2K25 features new licensed content, as the game offers a multitude of content for purchase based on real-world brands like Adidas, Sun Day Red, and Barstool Sports.Borderlands 4 launched in September and had a huge opening in the US, setting franchise records. The game's first post-launch paid DLC arrives in November, adding new story missions, bosses, and loot.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

But if you were hoping to catch a fresh glimpse at The Witcher 4 at the ceremony than you're going to be disappointed. CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has confirmed that the company isn't bringing any new to The Game Awards this year.\"We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year,\" wrote Nowakowski on X, as spotted by VGC. But we're, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry's great night alongside all of you.\"I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards. Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot of to us.

The most recent look at the game was shared during State of Unreal in June. However, CDPR later explained that it was a tech demo set in The Witcher 4 rather than the actual game. The dev team has also noted that the upcoming game is being developed with a console-first approach.Earlier this week, CD Projekt Red disclosed that Cyberpunk 2077 has passed 35 million sales faster than The Witcher 3. Cyberpunk 2 is currently being developed the company alongside a remake of the original Witcher, and a game produced in partnership with Saudi Arabia.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Schedule 1 is one of this year's biggest surprise hits among the indie crowd, especially since it's a life-sim game about building up your own drug empire. But if the game's subject matter kept it from being sold on Steam, Schedule 1 creator Tyler was going to pivot and make into a farming sim.\"Early during development, I had a plan where, if Steam wouldn't take it for whatever reason, I could just pivot it to be a farming game,\" Tyler told GamesRadar. \"Just strip all the drug stuff out, make it a farming game--but thankfully, it was all right.\"Tyler went on to note that a few other countries \"don't love it,\" including his native Australia.\"We were effectively banned in Australia, which kind of sucked, but we got it there in the end,\" recalled Tyler.Schedule 1 may remind some players of Breaking Bad, as the main character moves into a new city and slowly begins to expand their drug dealing operations. Players can grow cannabis in the game, but only in support of selling and distributing it. It's also possible to cook meth while avoiding unwanted attention from the police and rival dealers.Although the game is still in early access, Schedule 1 recently added cartel wars to its features. TVGS has also invited players to vote about which feature will be added to the game next.The impact of not getting Steam approval was recently shown when the developers of Horses shared a message about the studio's potential closure because of that decision and their inability to make an appeal to Valve.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The nostalgic officially licensed Pac-Man Arcade is available for $189 (was $270). The $81 discount is the best deal yet for the Pac-Man Arcade, which launched in June 2023. This extremely cool Lego building set for adults almost always sells for full price, and the few deals we've seen over the past two-plus years have sold out fast.                                 Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade (2,651 Pieces)                                                                $189 (was $270)                                                                                                                                                                                    Part of the Lego Icons series, Pac-Man Arcade is a brick-built countertop machine model measuring 10 x 7 x 13 inches. Out of all of Lego's gaming system sets, Pac-Man Arcade is probably the most impressive from a design perspective. And it's definitely the coolest when it comes to interactive features. It has a movable four-way joystick, and you can press the two dome buttons. The crank on the side of the cabinet moves Pac-Man through the mechanical maze while Blinky and Clyde chase him.The coin slot uses a light brick that makes it look like the real thing. In addition to the cabinet itself, it comes with buildable Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde figures that attach to a stand that connects to the top of the cabinet.Rounding out the set is a minifigure-scale '80s arcade scene, complete with a tiny brick-built Pac-Man cabinet and a gamer minifigure wearing vintage clothes. You can store the scene inside the cabinet by removing the back panel. This also allows you to watch the mechanical components in motion while turning the crank.

During the event, there are tons of skins that are going to be available for purchase, along with a couple of free skins, like one for Jeff the Land Shark. There are a handful of skins available at the start of the event, with more teased for the coming weeks.Available right now, you can grab Gummy Surprise Venom and Restful Recovery Blade from the shop. The Venom bundle is 2,200 Units and the Blade bundle is 1,600 Units, or you can get them together in a mega bundle for 2,800 Units. Each bundle includes the skin, MVP highlight, emote, spray, and nameplate. Both skins are temporary additions to the shop, leaving shortly after the event ends in late December.As part of the Jeff's Break Time event pass, you can get the legendary Business Shark skin for Jeff for free by completing matches. This skin has customizable parts, like ties, glasses, and even his suit design. If you get the premium version of the pass, it also includes the Dad-tastic Reed Mister Fantastic skin and Disappearing Dessert Invisible Woman skin. There's also a new look for Galacta, which can be seen in the battle pass menu. Jeff's Break Time ends at the same time as the anniversary event, although purchasing the premium version will allow you to unlock rewards past the event's scheduled end.While there are certainly a few surprises coming, we do know that there are two more Legendary skins coming. On December 5, Van Dyne's shop opens, containing the legendary Daring Daifuku Psylocke skin. On the same day, a legendary Luna Snow skin will also be released, although it's unclear if that will be in the typical shop or tied to a specific event. Below you can see every skin released for Marvel Rivals anniversary event so far.Business Shark - Jeff the Land SharkDad-tastic Reed - Mister FantasticDisappearing Desserts - Invisible WomanGummy Surprise - VenomRestful Recovery - Blade    \n  \n                      "

The 1,555-piece Imperial Star Destroyer is on sale for $120 (was $160) while supplies last. This Star Destroyer launched last August as part of the Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary collection. It comes with seven minifigures, including a 25th Anniversary minifigure of Cal Kestis from Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series.The Imperial Star Destroyer is based on the ship from the opening chase scene of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. Once fully constructed, the Star Destroyer measures 18 x 11.5 x 6 inches.It's rather fitting that Amazon added the Star Destroye to its Black Friday sale, because Star Wars fans can also get the Lego version of the ship Darth Vader and his crew were chasing: Princess Leia's Tantive IV. The 654-piece Tantive IV display model is 50% off at Amazon and Walmart. You could pair both of these ships with Lego's Boarding the Tantive IV diorama, which is on sale for $38.49 (was $55) and depicts what happens after the Star Destroyer catches the Tantive IV. It's also worth noting Lego's 630-piece midi-scale model of Darth Vader's Executor Super Star Destroyer from Return of the Jedi is on sale for $40 (was $70) at Walmart.Lego Star Wars: Best Black Friday DealsImperial Star Destroyer (1,555 pieces) -- $120 ($160)Executor Super Star Destroyer Model (630 pieces) -- $40 ($70)Battle Droid with STAP (1,088 pieces) -- $90 ($140)Tantive IV Starship Model (654 pieces) -- $40 ($80)  Also at WalmartBoarding the Tantive IV Diorama (502 pieces) -- $38.49 ($55)  Also at WalmartThe Imperial Star Destroyer has only ever received discounts during major sales events like Prime Day and now Black Friday.

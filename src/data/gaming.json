    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this month, Sony and Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda live-action movie began filming in New Zealand. It was only matter of time before clips from the film were leaked, and now it appears that the first footage may reveal that an actress from Severance is playing Impa.The brief footage posted on Instagram shows actress Bo Bragason in character as Princess Zelda as she meets with a performer who seems to be portraying Impa. The other actress in question has been identified by fans as Dichen Lachman, who is known for her role as Ms. Casey in Severance. Lachman has extensive experience in genre film and TV shows, including appearances in Altered Carbon, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Supergirl, The 100, and Jurassic World Dominion. This is just rumor for now, though, as no official casting announcement has been made for the Zelda movie beyond the two main leads.Impa has been a supporting character since the very first Legend of Zelda game, although her role has greatly differed. She has been portrayed as a protector or even a bodyguard for Princess Zelda. A much younger version of Impa is featured in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity.This leaked footage has led some fans to speculate that the film will adapt The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It's also possible that the movie will draw from several different eras of Zelda for a streamlined adaptation. But for now, we can only speculate.Benjamin Evan Ainsworth will portray Link in the movie, and his role was revealed in July of this year alongside Bragason's casting as Zelda. For now, they are the only two cast members officially confirmed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures, which is producing the film, alongside Nintendo and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes helmer Wes Ball is directing the film from a script by Pokemon: Detective Pikachu writer Derek Connolly. In June, Nintendo pushed back the release of the Legend of Zelda movie. The current release date is May 7, 2027.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

Amazon is offering $250 discounts on the MacBook Air M4, which brings all configurations of Apple's best-selling laptop down to all-time low prices. The MacBook Air M4 13.6-inch model is on sale for as low as $750 (was $999). Meanwhile, the 15.6-inch MacBook Air M4 is discounted to only $950 (was $1,199).The MacBook Air M4 launched in March and has earned excellent reviews from critics and customers. If you're looking for a powerful, reliable, and travel-friendly laptop, it's hard to beat the MacBook Air M4. All four color options for both sizes are included in the promotions: Midnight, Silver, Starlight, and Sky Blue.                                                                                                      MacBook Air M4 13.6\" Laptop (2025)                                                                $750 (was $999)                                                                                                                                                                                    The MacBook Air M4 256GB offers great value at full price, but with a $250 discount? Well, it's arguably the best laptop deal of the year (so far). The base model M4 chip is equipped with 10 CPU cores, 8 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The CPU and GPU cores share 16G of Unified Memory, which offers enough processing power and speed for creatives and developers. It's also an ideal laptop for new college students, as it should be a trusty device through graduation and beyond. Plus, the ultra-slim profile makes it one of the best laptops for travel, and it's extremely efficient in terms of power consumption. The M4 can run for up to 18 hours on a full charge.The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display makes all your videos, pictures, and games look fantastic, while a 12MP camera lets you dive into video chats or virtual lectures. Rounding out the entry-level M4 are two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a MagSafe charging port, a headphone jack, support for Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth, and suppor for up to two external displays.Apple computers still aren't the best choice for gaming, but not because they aren't powerful enough; it's simply due to the comparitively limited library. That said, Apple has made a concerted effort with gaming over the past few years by working with big publishers to bring hit games to the App Store, including Death Stranding, Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and more. The MacBook Air M4 has ray tracing and other advanced rendering tools. The base model runs a wide assortment of visually demanding games wonderfully, and games look incredibl on Apple's Liquid Retina Display.The base model's main downside, especially when it comes to gaming, is the 256GB SSD. It's a high-performing storage drive, but 256GB can disappear quickly if you download a bunch of games or work on big design projects.If you want more storage space and a boost in performance in the video department, the two 512GB configurations are also on sale for $250 off. Both models have two additional GPU cores, and the pricier one offers 24GB Unified Memory.10-core CPU / 8-core GPU / 16GB Memory / 256GB SSD -- $750 ($999)10-core CPU / 10-core GPU / 16GB Memory / 512GB SSD -- $950 ($1,199)10-core CPU / 10-core GPU / 24GB Memory / 512GB SSD -- $1,150 ($1,399)                                                                                                                            MacBook Air M4 15.3\" Laptop (2025)                                                                $950 (was $1,199)                                                                                                                                                                                    As mentioned, if you want more screen real estate, the 15.3-inch model is also on sale for $250 off. It's available in the same four colors, and all three configurations have a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The base model is $950 (was $1,199) and offers 16GB Unified Memory and a 256GB SSD. You can double the storage to 512GB by picking up the $1,149 deal. Once again, the memory can be increased to 24GB by opting for the $1,350 model.16GB Memory + 256GB SSD -- $950 ($1,199)16GB Memory + 512GB SSD -- $1,149 ($1,399)24GB Memory + 512GB SSD -- $1,350 ($1,599)                                                         The Best DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Deal Is Back, But Probably Not For Long                         Meta Quest 3S Batman Bundle Is $70 Off, Comes With $50 Amazon Gift Card                         Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 & PC For Only $40                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (5)                 Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut                         Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon                         Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon                         Lego DC Batman Figure & Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else                         Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition collects three PS2-era hits: GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. Rockstar reissued the collection over the summer with a new $30 MSRP. Prior to the rerelease, GTA: The Trilogy sold for $60 in stores. It still sells for $60 in digital format on the Nintendo eShop, so the $10 discount feels more like $40.It's a similar situation with Red Dead Redemption, which sells for $50 on the eShop but is only $30 in physical format. Red Dead Redemption is also included in Amazon's early Black Friday 2025 sale for $25. It's a great time to buy RDR for Switch, as Rockstar is releasing a free Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade December 2 alongside the game's mobile launch.                                                                                                                                                                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition for Switch                                                                $20 (was $30)                                                                                                                                                                                    Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, unlike the Red Dead Redemption physical version, requires a download from the Nintendo Switch eShop. When the reprint was announced, Amazon initially showed a game box without the \"download required\" label on the front, but this is the same physical edition as the original version released three-plus years ago.The physical edition requires a download of roughly 9GB from the eShop, which certainly isn't ideal for those who prefer to collect true physical editions. That said, you're still saving a ton of storage space compared to the pricier digital edition on the Switch eShop. The three games have a combined file size of 25.4GB, so roughly 16GB of data--San Andreas and GTA III--is stored on the Switch game card.                      The collection had some major performance and visual issues at launch, and many of those problems remained unfixed until Rockstar overhauled the experience on consoles last fall. It's by no means perfect for any console, but it's markedly improved and definitely worth checking out now that the physical edition is available for so cheap.Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 users should check out Amazon's other early Black Friday 2025 game deals before they're gone.Nintendo Switch 1/2 Early Black Friday Deals at AmazonAll Nintendo Switch 2 DealsAll Nintendo Switch DealsNintendo Switch Game DealsNintendo Switch 1/2 Controller Deals                                                                                                                                                                               The Best DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Deal Is Back, But Probably Not For Long                         Meta Quest 3S Batman Bundle Is $70 Off, Comes With $50 Amazon Gift Card                         Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 & PC For Only $40                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (5)                 Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut                         Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon                         Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon                         Lego DC Batman Figure & Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else                         Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

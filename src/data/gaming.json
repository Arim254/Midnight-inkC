    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The newest Nielsen ratings have arrived, showing a gigantic drop-off for Fallout Season 2 compared to Fallout Season 1. However, there is an obvious explanation for the dip.According to The Hollywood Reporter, Fallout viewership reached 794 million minutes on Prime Video for the week of December 15-21, which covers when Season 2 debuted on December 16. Season 1 racked up 2.9 billion minutes of streaming time during its own opening week in April 2024. That's a 72% decrease, but the massive downturn was no doubt attributable to how the two seasons were released.          Season 1, many may recall, was released in a binge format with all episodes arriving at the same time. Season 2, meanwhile, is adopting a weekly release schedule. What's more, just one episode of Fallout Season 2 was released on December 16, compared to two or three that Prime Video does for some of its other shows.Given all this, it only makes sense that Fallout Season 1 would have significantly higher viewership statistics compared to Season 2.According to the Nielsen data--which combines multiple seasons in its ranking reports-- 54% of Fallout streaming minutes on Prime Video for the December 15-21 week were from Season 2, making up about 429 million minutes. The rest came from viewership of Season 1.Fallout Season 2 just recently aired its fifth episode, with three more to come each Wednesday until Season 2 wraps on February 4. A third season will follow sometime later and could start filming sooner than expected.For more, check out GameSpot's breakdown of Fallout Season 2, Episode 5.Beyond the TV series, Bethesda is rumored to be at work on remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, along with the brand-new game Fallout 5.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this month, some Monster Hunter Wilds players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC.Digital Foundry debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself \"checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor\" in less than a minute.Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC. That's slowing everything down, even if there isn't any DLC to be found.Other players have already noticed this and released a less DLC checks mod that helps alleviate the issue. It doesn't solve all of Monster Hunter Wilds' underlying issues on PC, but it can solve this one until Capcom decides to eventually address it.Capcom had previously promised that an update released this winter would directly target the biggest problems with Monster Hunter Wilds on PC. Many of those issues still persist, and it's unknown when or if they will be fixed.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

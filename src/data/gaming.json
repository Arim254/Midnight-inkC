    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Bungie's long in development extraction shooter, Marathon, will launch on March 5, a new gameplay trailer has revealed ahead of preorders opening. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC and cost $40.The trailer introduces players again to Tau Ceti IV, a colony that you, playing as runners, will infiltrate to dispatch armed forces and extract with valuable gear. You'll make use of a variety of Runner Shells that give you different abilities and perks, defining your role in a party or giving you a choice over how to build if you're planning to play solo. The art style remains as striking as ever, with Bungie's signature gunplay being showcased in the action below.          Marathon was initially scheduled to launch on September 23, 2025 before being indefinitely delayed following a series of public tests that drew criticisms over the game's mechanics. Bungie noted key areas that it planned to improve with more development time, namely the game's survival elements, its lore and world building, and better social experiences for solo and duos players.Sony, who will publish Marathon, assured fans that the game would release before the end of March 2026, with Bungie also confirming that a public beta will take place later in February ahead of launch. Development of Marathon has been rife with controversy, with Bungie eventually settling matters with an artist that accused it of stealing assets for the shooter without permission.Since its delay, Arc Raiders has taken the extraction shooter genre by storm, amassing hundreds of thousands of concurrent players and sustaining that in the months since release.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In the lead up to its release on March 5, Bungie has revealed the full voice cast for Marathon--and it is stacked. Featuring fan-favorites from recent hits like Baldur's Gate 3 and Clair Obscur, TV sci-fi stars, and other notable gaming voices, Bungie is clearly going all-in on Marathon's voice acting.In a blog post, Bungie revealed the 33 names that make up the English voice cast for Marathon, many of them instantly recognisable for fans of games and sci-fi. The list includes the voices of some of our favorite Baldur's Gate 3 companions including Jennifer English (Shadowheart), Neil Newbon (Astarion), Samantha Béart (Karlach), and Tracy Wiles (Jaheira). Also from the realm of RPGs are Ben Starr and Rich Keeble, who lent their voices to Verso and Monoco respectively in Clair Obscur.Sci-fi fans might recognise Nika Futterman, who voiced Asajj Ventress in the Clone Wars animated series, as well as Elias Toufexis, the voice of Adam Jensen in the Deus Ex series, who later broke into TV sci-fi with roles in The Expanse and Star Trek: Discovery. Some other notable names include Roger Clark who plays Arthur Morgan in Red Dead 2, Morla Gorrondona who plays Eris Morn in Destiny 2, and Erin Yvette, who has appeared in Dispatch, The Wolf Among Us, Hades 2, and more.Check out the full voice cast below:Krizia BajosSamantha BéartBeau BridglandRy ChaseRoger ClarkDarin De PaulJennifer EnglishDave FennoyNika FuttermanMorla GorrondonaReina GuthrieDonnla HughesKeston JohnSohm KapilaRich KeebleElliot KnightErica LindbeckPiotr MichaelBrent MukaiNeil NewbonAriana Nicole GeorgeEmily O'BrienLee ShortenJason SpisakBen StarrJB TadenaFred TatascioreCraig Lee ThomasElias ToufexisOliver VaquerScott WhyteTracy WilesErin YvetteIt's unusual for a game to reveal its full cast ahead of release, though the move makes sense with all the popular voice actors Bungie has on board. Marathon's latest trailer introduces one of many characters players will meet in the world of Tau Ceti--Gantry, the MIDA faction agent. Marathon will have six factions for players to interact with, each with their own network of characters to interact with and mysteries to untangle.          Marathon is set to release into direct competition with popular extraction shooter Arc Raiders, and its impressive voice cast might just be an important point of distinction for Bungie's entry into the genre. While Arc Raiders has been well received overall, one unpopular element amongst some fans and critics is the game's use of AI-generated voice over.Marathon is set to release on March 5 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and will be priced at $40--the same price point as Arc Raiders. Preorders for Marathon are available now.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Devolver Digital wants to talk about balls. For starters, Ball X Pit just reached a new sales milestone, selling 1 million copies. But that's not all: Developer Kenny Sun is working on brand-new balls for the action-roguelite game, with three free updates on the way next year.The first new content planned for Ball X Pit is set to release in January with the Regal Update. The Shadow Update is scheduled to follow in April, with the Naturalist Update on the way in July. Devolver Digital says that each free major patch will include new balls, evolutions, and characters. A new trailer for the game--seen below--teases the upcoming updates.          In late October, Ball X Pit had sold 400,000 copies, meaning the game has more than doubled its sales over the past six weeks. The sales numbers come from copies sold on Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Ball X Pit is also available on Xbox Game Pass, but the subscription service doesn't count toward traditional sales numbers.Ball X Pit sees players utilizing and fusing over 60 balls to defeat enemies in autoscrolling levels. Think of it as a spin on classic brick-bricking games, with an infusion of Vampire Survivors and Loop Hero. Additionally, when not rolling over baddies with balls, players will work on reconstructing  a town called New Ballbylon.For more, check out GameSpot's Ball X Pit review.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The artist who originally brought the claims against Bungie has now announced that the issue \"has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.\"No further details were divulged regarding the nature of the matter and how this closure came to be. People are theorizing that the artist received a settlement payment, but that is not confirmed.The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.  — N² (@4nt1r34l) December 2, 2025\n  After the art theft claims came to light earlier this year, Bungie responded to say it \"immediately investigated\" the concerns, and \"confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game.\"Bungie also said at the time that it was \"committed\" to doing right by the artist, and that seems to have now happened.In June, Bungie delayed Marathon indefinitely from its previously announced September 23 release date. The game still has no release date.For Marathon, Sony boss Hermen Hulst said the aim is to create a \"very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title.\"\"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game,\" he said.The executive has said Sony now has systems in place to ensure that Marathon won't suffer the same fate as Sony's ill-fated Concord.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

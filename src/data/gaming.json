By the fifth day of the beta, about 98.8% of matches had no cheaters. Now that the beta has concluded, Activision reported that--across the entirety of the beta--nearly 99% of matches were cheater-free. And the median detection time for cheaters was three matches.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer\n      \nüõ°Ô∏èCall of Duty #BlackOps7A message from #TeamRICOCHET:We‚Äôve crunched the numbers for Black Ops 7 Beta, and RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history.Each day, our cheat detections got faster and your matches got cleaner.By the end:‚Ä¢‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/bRLFFAAHyv  ‚Äî Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) October 13, 2025              The publisher went on to say that the anti-cheat tools in Black Ops 7's beta \"adapted and improved\" over time, helping to ensure \"more players experience the clean matches they expect.\"Activision added that it has spent years investing in and refining the anti-cheat tools to get to where things stand today, and it's not the end.

The update is focused on bug fixes and controller-support improvements (especially on PC and Mac), while larger adjustments will likely come in the future. For instance, the patch notes do state that more controller fixes are on the way. Please do be aware that some of the adjustments could be considered spoilers.On Steam, the first change listed for Silksong version 1.0.28891 is the addition of DualSense Edge support, the premium PS5 wireless controller with mappable back buttons. Mac players are also receiving \"improved support for various controllers,\" and Team Cherry has made it where Silksong will pause now when a controller is disconnected.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Hollow Knight: Silksong Review\n      \nA bunch of bugs have been stomped out, such as out-of-bounds situations and an issue with using a Silkeater while swimming. There is a bit of balance tweaking, too. Team Cherry has lessened Hornet's \"Thread Storm damage at higher needle levels,\" for example.Last month, Silksong received its second patch after the first update actually made the game easier with difficulty changes to early bosses. Within weeks of launching, Silksong reportedly sold over 4.2 million copies--and that number wouldn't include the title's inclusion on Game Pass. It's also one of the top 20 most popular Steam games of all time. For more, check out GameSpot's Hollow Knight: Silksong review.The full patch notes are below:Added support for Dualsense Edge controllers.Improved support for various controllers on Mac.Game now pauses when the controller disconnects.Fixed various smaller controller issues (more fixes to come in future).Fixed remaining instance of certain players getting stuck cursed while in the late game.Fixed Curveclaw not reacting to Hunter down-stab.Fixed rare instances of being able to air dash and double jump when not intended.Fixed several out of bounds situations.Fixed Pharlid Divers sometimes sliding on roofs after ambushing in certain scenes.Fixed Eva Hunter Crest upgrades unintentionally clearing tool equips.Fixed rare instances of Harpoon sometimes granting 2 Silk instead of 1.Fixed Cogflies sometimes appearing from odd locations after scene transition and, in rare cases, having their active quantity reduced by 1.Fixed Crafting Kits not increasing the damage of offensive blue tools (eg Sawtooth Circlet).Slight increase to Sharp Dart and Cross Stitch damage.Updated damage scaling on Rune Rage to match other Silk Skills.Slight decrease to Thread Storm damage at higher needle levels.Fixed Surgeon enemies sometimes pulling the hero out of bounds.Fixed instances of some Spool Fragments being permanently missable if a player immediately quit after collecting the item.Fixed Crust King Khann sometimes falling out of bounds during entry, when fought on low-end systems.Fixed rare instance of Second Sentinel becoming rotated when defeated.Fixed additional case of Seth sometimes getting out of bounds and not returning.Fixed Seth sometimes remaining invincible for a moment at the start of a refight.Fixed Vaults slide blocks incorrectly responding to damage sources other than the needle.Changed Fine Pins wish drops from 50% chance to 100%, but raised required quantity.Fixed issues when consuming a Silkeater while in water.Fixed Scuttlebrace sometimes allowing a wall jump when not intended.Fixed a soft-lock during the Grand Gate opening sequence, if the Citadel had been visited and some bellshrines remained inactive.Various smaller fixes and tweaks.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's understandable if Xbox users feel a little skittish about the future of the console, given the recent price increases for Xbox consoles in the US, as well as formerly exclusive titles heading to PlayStation 5. Over the holiday weekend, there were so many anecdotal rumors about Target, Walmart, and other US retailers pulling Xbox consoles and games that Microsoft decided it was necessary to debunk these reports.\"Target and Walmart, among other retailers, remain committed partners for Xbox consoles, accessories, and games,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told Windows Central. The outlet went on to suggest that the rumors may have been born out of Costco's apparent decision to remove everything Xbox-related from its digital storefront ahead of the price hikes.Microsoft has previously fielded rumors that Xbox is abandoning hardware, as exemplified by Asus handling the release of the ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices. However, Xbox VP Jason Ronald told the press that the company remains committed to its next generation hardware.The increasing cost of the Xbox consoles comes just as Microsoft raised prices on Game Pass. Former Microsoft employee and a founding member of the original Xbox team, Laura Fryer, went on to call those increases a \"betrayal\" of the trust that gamers placed in the company. Microsoft subsequently announced that the price hikes won't immediately go into effect for all players. But the more expensive version of Game Pass is losing a fan-favorite Call of Duty perk.Some analysts also believe that an ad-supported Game Pass service will be added in the future. But for now, that remains speculation.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

But Sony apparently considered a mobile game for the post-apocalyptic series with Tencent, a new court filing reveals.PlayStation Studios head of mobile Olivier Courtemanche provided a declaration as part of Sony Interactive Entertainment's lawsuit against Tencent. While the sworn statement revolves around Tencent and its developer Aurora Studios creating Light of Motiram, Courtemanche disclosed that his team met in China last year with those companies to discuss The Last of Us.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: The Last of Us Part II Remastered - Features Trailer\n      \n\"I traveled with members of my team to Shenzhen, China, in July 2024 to discuss a variety of partnership opportunities with Tencent and its game studios, including Aurora Studios. With respect to Aurora Studios, we went into the meeting under the impression that they wanted to do a potential collaboration for The Last of Us,\" Courtemanche said in the filing.No other specifics regarding the possible Last of Us project were disclosed in the document. Instead, Courtemanche says that Aurora presented a slide showing images of a Horizon collaboration in that 2024 meeting, which he argued Sony had already soundly rejected previously.In late 2023, Naughty Dog announced that The Last of Us multiplayer game had been canned, with the developer focusing on single-player games going forward. Since then, Naughty Dog unveiled Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards in December 2024, while earlier this year, The Last of Us creative director Neil Druckmann teased that the team is working on a second unannounced project, too.The Last of Us hasn't had a spin-off game or mobile title, yet. However, the franchise has been adapted into a successful and critically acclaimed HBO series.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The next title from French game developer Quantic Dream isn't what you'd expect. The studio, best known for single-player narrative adventures including Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls, is putting out a multiplayer game called Spellcasters Chronicles, which will debut in a closed beta on Steam before the year ends.Combining action and strategy with elements from MOBAs and deckbuilding games, the free-to-play Spellcasters Chronicles appears to be a unique blend of mechanics and concepts. Two teams of three will face off in 25-minute-long matches, capturing territory and destroying each other's \"Lifestones\" to achieve victory.          Spellcasters are playable characters representing different fantasy archetypes, each with distinct roles and abilities. Matches take place in large arenas that emphasize verticality, with every Spellcaster having the ability to fly freely around the environment.Additionally, the deck-building system of Spellcasters Chronicles includes over 50 unique spells and summons, adding levels of planning, strategy, and experimentation with teammates. Spellcasters can summon armies of creatures like ogres and dragons and unleash \"Titans\" to turn the tide of a match.Despite being the studio's first multiplayer game, it will still feature heavy story elements through what Quantic Dream calls a \"community-driven narrative.\"\"While very different from our previous titles, [Spellcasters Chronicles] builds on what has always driven us: giving players the power to shape stories, this time in a collective manner,\" game director Gregorie Diaconu said in a press release.It's unknown in what form this \"community narrative\" will take, but Quantic Dream promises to share more \"in the coming months.\" In the meantime, those curious about the game can catch a gameplay deep dive, a developer Q&A, and other tidbits on October 17 during TwitchCon San Diego from 11:30 AM PT / 2:30 PM ET to 6:30 PM PT / 9:30 PM ET.Quantic Dream has been rather absent from the news as of late--the studio announced Star Wars Eclipse in 2021 but hasn't shown anything from the narrative adventure since then. In the press release announcing Spellcasters Chronicles, Quantic Dream president David Cage mentioned that his company is \"continuing to develop new experiences including Star Wars Eclipse,\" seemingly proof of life for the project.While the studio hasn't developed a game since 2018's Detroit: Become Human, it has since published a handful of games, including the diving adventure game Under the Waves. Chinese tech company NetEase acquired Quantic Dream in 2022, and the studio claimed that it was unaffected by a shakeup at NetEase that occurred earlier this year.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Although the Predator franchise has been around for almost four decades, it hasn't had a lot of video game adaptations that lived up to the original movie. Dan Trachtenberg--the director of Prey, Predator: Killer of Killers, and the upcoming Predator: Badlands--wants to see that change. And he believes Predator deserves a game on par with two AAA franchises.\"I am desperate for there to be a third-person action-adventure, Uncharted, Assassin's Creed, that kind of open-world thing,\" Trachtenberg told IGN. \"Concrete Jungle was something that I missed unfortunately. And that was a long time ago. And there's just so much fun to be had game wise, I think, with Predator. I hope it could happen.\"Predator: Concrete Jungle was released in 2005, and it put players in control of a Predator who had to reclaim his lost technology from the humans who stole it. While Trachtenberg didn't play that game, he did reveal that he once designed a Predator video game level as part of a contest for the defunct gaming magazine GamePro.\"I used to love GamePro and there was a contest ... to design a level and then you would make it in the magazine,\" recalled Trachtenberg. \"And I submitted, I designed a Predator video game level that I'm sure I was just copying Contra. And I did not make it into the magazine.\"Earlier this year, Trachtenberg noted that Shadow of the Colossus heavily inspired Badlands. In a separate interview, he also cited Half-Life 2, Prince of Persia, and Uncharted as games that helped shape his vision for the story.Predator: Badlands will hit theaters on November 7. The most recent game in the franchise, Predator: Hunting Grounds, was ported to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S last year.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 29, 2025 at 4:36PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Are you baffled by the Alexandra Monastery Observatory riddle in The Outer Worlds 2? This instanced location/mini-dungeon is located in Golden Ridge on the planet of Dorado. And, speaking of planets and other heavenly bodies, the puzzle itself tasks you with discovering the correct numerical sequence based on diagrams and orreries.How to reach the Alexandra Monastery in Golden RidgeThe Alexandra Monastery Observatory puzzle won't be available from the get-go. Here's what you need to do:Upon landing in Golden Ridge, you should have a main quest called \"On the Trail of the Traitor.\" The first step is to visit the settlement of Matriarch's Mercy.From there, you need to complete the key objectives in two locations: Zyranium Manufactory VII in the east and N-Ray Range in the northwest.You can recruit a companion named Marisol in Zyranium Manufactory VII. Later, you can obtain the N-Ray Scanner gadget in, you guessed it, the N-Ray Range facility.With both objectives completed, return to Matriarch's Mercy to gain access to a lift that takes you to Alexandra Monastery.You'll reach the Observatory area much later in your trek. Just proceed at your own pace, all while taking out enemies and gathering loot. Eventually, you'll arrive at a garden area where you have to use the N-Ray Scanner to activate bells. This opens up the Observatory proper.Observatory puzzle and Order Initiate Scavenger Hunt cluesBefore we solve The Outer Worlds 2 Alexandra Monastery Observatory riddle, we should first check the clues in the building:There's a device that lets you set the numerical input in a dial. Don't bother with this for now.There's a large diagram of the system that shows the planets and moons.There are displays and statues on the walls.By far the most important clue comes from the Order Initiate Scavenger Hunt note, which tells you to look at the orrery in front of the Observatory:The first dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit Elysium.The second dial should be set to the number of moons that orbit between Elysium and Dorado.The final dial should be set to the number of times Eden orbits Elysium before Praetor and Cloister complete a single rotation.Orrery moon cluesIf you want to see the clues related to The Outer Worlds 2 Order Initiate Scavenger Hunt, then you should definitely check out the orrery. It's the large structure with rotating heavenly bodies right in the middle of the garden. You'll notice the following:Elysium is the largest heavenly body, and it's in the center of the diagram.Eden and Dorado are both \"linked\" to each other at the top of the structure.Praetor and Cloister are \"linked\" to each other separately.Order Initiate Scavenger Hunt solution and rewardsTo solve the Alexandra Monastery Observatory puzzle in The Outer Worlds 2, you need to input this sequence in the dial: 4-1-4. This is because of the following hints:There are four moons that orbit Elysium: Eden, Dorado, Praetor, and Cloister.There is only one moon between Elysium and Dorado. It's the tiny moon of Eden.Finally, you can focus solely on Eden in the orrery diagram and wait until it's aligned with Praetor/Cloister. Count the number of times it revolves around Elysium until it's aligned once more with Praetor/Cloister. You'll see that it circles around exactly four times.After you input the code, a hidden compartment will open, revealing your rewards. For your efforts, you'll receive over a thousand bits/currency and the Feargus Urquhart card, which permanently adds +1% damage. If you want to know the locations of the other items, you can take a look at our collectible cards guide. Lastly, since you're already in Alexandra Monastery, you might want to grab a mural fragment for The Pursuit of Partite Pentaptych quest, which grants a free/unique perk.Black market smugglers? Autocratic regimes? Rampaging Raptidons? Invisible cultists that can only be seen if you wear special goggles? These shenanigans need not cause any alarm because we've got you covered in our The Outer Worlds 2 guides hub.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The age of AI has barely begun, but there are some in the industry who see it as an absolute necessity for the future. Electronic Arts, for example, has reportedly instructed its employees to treat AI as \"thought partners\" in every aspect of game creation. However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick isn't buying into the hype, and he doesn't believe AI will ever be able to compete with Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto games.\"Let's say there were no constraints [on AI],\" said Zelnick during an appearance on CNBC. \"Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the Grand Theft Auto marketing plan? The answer is no. A, you can't do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn't end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative.\"Zelnick went on to explain that AI can't innovate, because it's \"backward-looking\" by design and its predictive models are built on things that have already been created, rather than anything new.This isn't the first time Zelnick has shared his feelings about AI, and he's been fairly consistent over the years. Earlier this month, Zelnick made a point of saying that people overstate what AI can do.Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently disclosed that his company primarily uses AI for security purposes, but he didn't rule out its role in game creation. Meanwhile, Microsoft is attempting to fully integrate AI and voice commands into Windows 11 machines. Video game developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield have both stated that AI tools should be embraced in game creation. A recent survey also found that over 50% of Japanese game publishers utilize AI in some way.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 29, 2025 at 4:35PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Do you plan on completing The Pursuit of the Partite Pentaptych in The Outer Worlds 2? This side quest takes place in Golden Ridge on the planet of Dorado, which is pretty much the second major/open-world area in the campaign. You do need to look for specific items, and the game doesn't even tell you where they can be found.All five mural locations in The Outer Worlds 2 - Golden RidgeYour goal in The Pursuit of the Partite Pentaptych, as the term sort of implies, is to find the five murals scattered all over the region. At best, you're told that these can be acquired from tram stations. The only problem is that the Golden Ridge is a blasted wasteland, and most of the railways are already destroyed.Golden Ridge mural locations mapIn any case, if you want to complete the Pursuit of Partite Pentaptych in The Outer Worlds 2, then you can check the map above. It shows the locations of all five murals in the region. We've numbered them accordingly starting from Alexandra Station Entrance, which is where your ship lands upon arriving in this zone.Mural location #1: Alexandra Station EntranceThe first mural essentially starts the quest itself. Simply exit your ship and go around to the interior of the station that's adjacent to the landing. You should see the mural on the wall. In front of it is a lore entry that tells you about the events that are being depicted. Anyway, just interact with the mural fragment with a darker hue to pick up the item.Mural location #2: Guardian EstatesSave for the fifth and final item, you can pick up the next Golden Ridge murals in The Outer Worlds 2 in any order. For now, though, we recommend doing the following:Go to Matriarch's Mercy to continue the main quest. Don't forget to pick up the bounties at the terminal outside the main building.Head to the southwestern part of the map. It's where you'll be able to tag the Guardian Estates fast travel point. If you picked up the bounties, you should have a mission called \"Battle with the Beastly Brigands.\" It requires you to kill the Dunsany Brothers in the same area.Keep going up the hill until you see a tram station just before the large building. You'll find another mural inside. Don't forget to take out the Dunsany Brothers for the bounty reward, too.Mural location #3: Decommissioned Autonomous ExtractoriumFrom the previous location, head north until you arrive at the Decommissioned Autonomous Extractorium. You can actually recruit a companion named Aza inside the facility. As for the mural, it's inside a small building that's adjacent to the Extractorium.Mural location #4: N-Ray RangeIf you keep going north from the Extractorium, you'll come across the N-Ray Range. Venturing deeper into this facility is actually part of the main quest in this region, which is why we encouraged you to visit Matriarch's Mercy earlier. Here's a quick summary:You can find the N-Ray Scanner gadget in this facility. It allows you to see enemies, objects, and wiring through walls.The aforementioned companion, Aza, actually has a personal quest that you can undertake in this area.Dealing with the head honcho, Victor Clemens, is a key objective. Finishing this task eventually grants you access to the location of the fifth mural. (More on this shortly.)Now, for the item in this location, you need to continue exploring until you reach sub-level 2. Next, ride the elevator back to the top. The mural is in the chamber with the tramway. There's also a High Security Lockbox in the same room.Mural location #5: Alexandra MonasteryOnce you've finished the main objectives in Zyranium Manufactory VII and N-Ray Range, you should be ready for the next step in the main story:Return to Matriarch's Mercy and access the lift. This will take you to an instanced location/mini-dungeon called Alexandra Monastery.Proceed through the facility as normal, taking out enemies along the way. Eventually, you'll stumble upon a large garden area.The mural is inside the station at the right-hand side. Pick it up, and you should have all the Golden Ridge murals in The Outer Worlds 2.The Pursuit of Partite Pentaptych rewardsWhile you're tackling this quest and collecting murals, you've probably noticed a certain perk that pops up. This is the Art Enthusiast perk, which grants bonus XP to your character whenever companions defeat an enemy.At the conclusion of this quest, you'll have Art Enthusiast V--i.e. +10% XP from companion kills. It's a pretty decent way to gain levels quickly, especially if you also picked the Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome flaw. Oh, and all five mural pieces will also appear as decorations in the Incognito.That does it for our guide on how to complete The Outer Worlds 2 Pursuit of the Partitie Pentaptych quest. While you're at it, you might want to check these related topics:Alexandra Monastery puzzle - If you're still in Alexandra Monastery, you can solve a riddle to obtain a nifty reward.Character perks - Art Enthusiast is an additional perk, which means you don't need to spend a point to unlock it. Still, you might be curious about all the others that you can obtain in the game.Science Weekly Volumes - This is another collectible-type quest that you might've missed while exploring Eden/Paradise Island.Black market smugglers? Autocratic regimes? Rampaging Raptidons? Invisible cultists that can only be seen if you wear special goggles?

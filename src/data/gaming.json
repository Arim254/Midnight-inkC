The update adds operator skins for characters from Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show, and there are plenty of limited-time game modes and events themed around the series.This Fallout event includes free and paid event passes filled with rewards, and you can see all the skins and more details here. Nuketown also gets a special \"Vault Town\" map variant, which includes a Nuka Cola bus, vault suits for the mannequins, and other decor themed around Fallout. Make sure to check out all the details for Season 1 Reloaded in Black Ops 7 and Warzone, including more weapons, multiplayer maps, and new Zombies content.Below, we highlight all the new Fallout-themed game modes players can enjoy. This includes modes for multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and even the campaign's Endgame.S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Mayhem - Multiplayer LTMIn the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Mayhem playlist, Black Ops 7's multiplayer maps are irradiated with toxic particles. These are 6v6 matches of Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint, and they feature \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs\" to help players keep their radiation at safe levels. The HUD features a Geiger counter to display exposure levels, and players will want to collect the buffs to avoid taking too much radiation damage.The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. buffs include:Pumpkin Pie: Increased healthNuka-Cola Cranberry: Score multiplierJet: Increased overall speedPsycho: Improved hip fire accuracy and headshot damageRadAway: Cut down your current radiation level. An essential item for curbing the effects of the Wasteland’s irradiated air. Rad levels also drop after eliminating enemies and are further mitigated when engaged with the objectiveLuck Bobblehead: Increases the odds of finding better power-ups and RadAway from fallen enemies. Secure one early for a big advantage. (NOTE: All players wearing a Fallout-themed operator skin, including the two free skin rewards from the Fallout event pass, will start the match with this buff active automatically.)The Ghouls - Multiplayer LTMThe Ghouls is a spin on Call of Duty's Infected mode. In this mode, players spawn into the match as Vault Dwellers on irritated multiplayer maps. They must scavenge for perks and RadAway to help them survive, and each eliminated Vault Dweller returns to the match as a ghoul fighting against the dwellers. Players must survive as Vault Dweller or infect everyone as a ghoul to win.Project RADs - Zombies LTMThe Feral Ghouls and Deathclaws of Fallout invade both the Ashes of the Damned and Astra Malorum maps in this themed limited-time mode. In Project RADs, players are also exposed to increased levels of radiation with each passing round.This changes the mode's usual means of healing and earning Essence. Instead, these are replaced with a system of drops given by fallen enemies that assist the crew in keeping rad levels at bay and gaining vital resources.These drops include:Food Items: Hold your nose and take a bite out of some food to replenish health. But beware, some snacks are irradiated! Eating them will increase your radiation levelBottle Caps: Instead of earning Essence for eliminating enemies, players collect dropped bottle caps to gain resources to purchase map itemsRadX: Take a swig of this to reduce your current radiation levelRadAway: Remove all radiation from all playersDeathclaw Hunt - Endgame eventWhile it's not exactly an LTM, players can hunt down Fallout's infamous Deathclaws in Endgame. Deathclaws can be found in matches as a limited-time world event. For this event, a bomb blast reduces a portion of Avalon into a Fallout-inspired wasteland with toxic air. Players can fight through hordes of feral ghouls to take on a Deathclaw hunt for rewards.Power Armor Royale - Warzone LTMPower Armor Royale is a Fallout-themed spin on battle royale. This features 66 players in trios on Verdansk, where power armor can be obtained from air drops. Players will need to charge up Fusion Cores in order to use any power armor, but the suit will grant the user a health boost, jetpack thrusters, upgraded weaponry, and the ability to eject and detonate the suit.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                More than a decade after launch, The Elder Scrolls Online will finally get cross-play, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios has confirmed it's actively working on the feature. However, it might still \"be a while\" until the feature is ready.While cross-play has long been something ZeniMax Online has said it wants to do and has explored options for, this is the first time the developer has confirmed it's actually happening, though there is not yet a clear idea of when, exactly, the feature will arrive.\"Cross-play is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while,\" ESO executive Susan Kath said as part of a virtual Q&A attended by GameSpot ahead of the game's 2026 preview livestream. \"Just to set the stage on that. We are working on it. It is a complex problem for a game like ESO--it was not ever built with this in mind. There are a lot of considerations we have to make.\"Though it might still be a bit of a wait, Kath said players could potentially see some tests related to the feature by the end of the year.The news came as part of recent livestream previewing the year ahead for the nearly 12-year-old MMORPG, which is moving to a seasonal content release model in 2026 in contrast to the yearly chapter (expansion) releases that have defined the game for most of its life.Currently, ESO players can only play with other players on their respective platforms, with separate servers for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation players. ZeniMax Online has previously outlined the technical problems that have prevented cross-play up to this point, including issues stemming from the game being built without cross-play in mind, concerns surrounding each server's separate economies, problems around performance, and the fact that PC players can play with game-modifying add-ons that console players can't.Cross-play was just one of the big announcements ZeniMax Online shared for its long-running MMO, as it also detailed what else players can expect in the months and year to come.After a transitional 2025 that also saw the ZeniMax Online team hit by Microsoft layoffs and its unannounced MMO project Blackbird canceled, 2026 is the year ESO is going-all-in on seasons, complete with the introduction of a battle pass system called Tamriel Tomes. The year will also see the introduction of several class reworks, new experimental zones and activities, the introduction of solo dungeons, and the addition of previously paid DLC content like the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild into the base game for free.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The long-rumored Fortnite collab with South Park is now official, as Epic Games dropped a new short film that shows how the boys are going to get sucked into the metaverse. We also got some specifics about what the collab will entail: a new five-player mode for Battle Royale, a free mini-pass through which players can earn South Park cosmetics, and at least five skins in the item shop. Oh, and Wonkeeland on the BR map will become Cartmanland.Using a short film to reveal the collab is something that Fortnite recently also did for its Simpsons-themed season in November--a Fortnite collaboration being something else that The Simpsons did before Butters could. The brief video, which includes a gameplay teaser at the end, shows us that the boys are avid Fortnite players, but Butters never gets to play with them since squads are capped at four players. So he tries to use the Stick of Truth to make them play with him, but it doesn't go quite the way he thought it would.          South Park's intrusion into Fortnite will come with several changes for Battle Royale. Wonkeeland is now Cartmanland, there will be a Cheesy Poofs healing item and a Stick of Truth mythic weapon, and for the first time you'll be able to play Fortnite's main mode in a group of five. Beyond that, this collaboration will also include an event pass--something Fortnite used to do regularly until the end of Chapter 5. This pass will be free to everyone, and we don't know anything about what it will include.In the item shop, you'll find skins for Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, and Butters--all in mech suits, judging by the teaser. There will also be a Towelie sidekick, though we don't know if that will be in the shop or on the event pass.The Fortnite x South Park event runs through February 5.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

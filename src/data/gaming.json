That's because it's the first of them to take place on a completely new and original island. While the other November mini-seasons took place on updated versions of old maps, and Star Wars season just added Star Wars places to the Battle Royale map, Simpsons season is introducing a totally new, cel-shaded island based on Springfield and various iconic locations from the series for us to fight over in November.At least one sacrifice was made to make this map happen. This island is a little bit smaller than the current Battle Royale map, and as a result, it uses a smaller player cap than usual at 80 players instead of 100. But that's not necessarily the worst thing, as the smaller island should mean faster and more exciting rounds, and also they might be able to keep it around as a Reload map after the season ends, which would make all this effort a little more worthwhile.The new island includes nine major, named locations, like the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and it's filled with gimmicks, like how each round will have one randomly activated event that players can race to complete for great loot. These are the new map spots:Springfield Nuclear Power PlantCletus' Corn HoleKamp KrustyBurns ManorSpringfield Town SquareMayor's MunchiesDonut DistrictEvergreen TerraceSpringfield SlurpworksAs you can see, Epic essentially broke Springfield up into several smaller pieces and spread them around. I shudder to think of how many Easter Eggs this map must be filled with. Scroll on for closer looks at some of the major locations and landmarks you'll find around the map. And before you ask--yes, these are all actual Fortnite screenshots.    \n  \n                      "

It's similar to the situation back in May when Star Wars season replaced all the Fortnite guns with Star Wars blasters, but since The Simpsons is a sitcom and not a movie franchise about wars, Epic is going about things a little differently, by replacing most of the health and shield items with Simpsons food and drinks, while unvaulting a bunch of Fortnite weapons that have not been in the Battle Royale loot pool in a while.But there are at least a couple of Simpsons-themed weapons, even so. To start the season, we'll have the Mr. Blasty revolver, with an exotic variant that drops from the roaming Krusty the Clown boss NPC. Later on, we're expecting to see some other wacky Simpsons weapons, including Moe's absurd combo gun, the Deodorant Applicator, and the Makeup Gun, though none of those are confirmed yet.As I previously teased, The Simpsons season also includes a number of health and shield consumables that are based on stuff from the Simpsons, like Super Squishees and Krusty Burgers. Scroll on to learn more about the new items in the Simpsons season loot pool, as well as a rundown on the Fortnite guns you'll have at your disposal this season.Super SquisheeThis frosty beverage increases your health and/or shields and gives you an improved Slap effect, which makes you run fast, gives you unlimited sprint, and makes you glow.Blinky FishThe Blinky Fish provides health and grants a dash ability for a short period of time after you eat one.Mr. BlastyWe'll start the season with the highly accurate Mr. Blasty revolver, which has impressive range for a snub-nosed pistol. There's also an exotic version, which attaches balloons to the people you shoot with it, that drops from the Krusty the Clown boss.Jebediah's Protective HelmYou can steal this item--which grants complete protection from a single headshot, after which it falls off your head--from the statue of Springfield's founder, Jebediah Springfield, which is found in the Springfield Town Square.Krusty BurgerThe most unhealthy burger in the world grants, ironically, both health and shield regeneration when eaten.Returning weaponsThe returning arsenal of Fortnite weapons is relatively small, with two assault rifles (including a modless version of the well-liked Striker AR from Chapter 5, pictured) three shotguns, two SMGs/auto pistols, and one scopeless sniper. Epic referred to this as a \"back-to-basics\" loot pool, which sounds about right. Though, of course, the loot pool will get a lot more complicated as they add goofy Simpsons weapons over the course of the season. Meanwhile, Shockwave Grenades will once again be this season's staple movement item. You can check out the rest of the existing Fortnite guns in the new loot pool below.Suppressed Assault RifleCompact SMGTactical ShotgunThunder ShotgunRanger ShotgunInfantry RifleSuppressed Pistol    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The day has finally arrived--after months and months of leaks and rumors, Fortnite's Simpsons season launches today. Just not quite yet, because Fortnite is offline for maintenance following the \"Welcome, Our Alien Overlords\" event, during which players were treated to a Simpsons short film that explained how they ended up being a part of the Fortnite omniverse.As is standard operating procedure for Epic, Fortnite goes offline when it's time for a major update. While this usually happens during the middle of the night on a weekday, this season launch is a special event, and as such, it'll kick off on a Saturday evening. That's why it's offline for maintenance now--Epic wants the launch of Fortnite x Simpsons to arrive during primetime on a Saturday night.          When is Fortnite Simpsons season expected to launch?Epic is planning to bring Fortnite back online for The Simpsons season at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET, though that time is an estimate and not set in stone. In reality, Fortnite maintenance rarely ends on schedule, as it's simply done when it's done--which actually often means sooner than expected. Fortnite maintenance usually lasts between four and seven hours, and the planned start time here splits the difference exactly at 5.5 hours of downtime. So don't be surprised if the season starts a little before or a little after that time.When the season does start, everything will be different. This Fortnite x Simpsons event is introducing an entirely new cel-shaded map based on Springfield from the series, and it'll have a Simpsons-themed battle pass and revamped loot pool. This may just be Fortnite's most thorough collaboration ever.

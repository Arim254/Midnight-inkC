    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                James Ohlen, the Bioware veteran who led development on upcoming sci-fi RPG Exodus, has stepped down from his position as the head of Archetype Entertainment. Ohlen's exit comes just after the studio debuted a flashy new trailer at The Game Awards, as he says he feels his work on the game is done.Ohlen has headed up the Wizards of the Coast-owned studio since its founding in 2019, working on the studio's debut title Exodus. \"At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team,\" Hasbro said in a statement given to Bloomberg.Exodus is still fairly far from release, which is currently scheduled for early 2027. This is an unusually long window if the game is already up to the polishing and tuning stage. Just last week, Exodus received an epic new trailer at The Game Awards, focused on the journey of protagonist Jun Aslan.          While stepping down from his position at Archetype, Ohlen is staying on with Wizards of the Coast as a creative consultant in the realm of tabletop RPGs, with the Hasbro saying he had \"asked to shift his creative focus.\" Ohlen intended to retire from the video games industry altogether in 2018 when he left Bioware, and even formed his own tabletop company. After refusing multiple offers of work from various video games companies, he accepted a compelling offer from Wizards to lead Archetype in 2019, promised a higher level of creative freedom.With Ohlen gone, Archetype still boasts a number of ex-Bioware employees on its team, including VP and general manager Chad Robertson, and lead writer Drew Karpyshyn. Exodus looks to share a lot of DNA with beloved sci-fi RPG Mass Effect, and both studio and fans are hoping the game will have a similar appeal to the Bioware classic.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Nintendo has been known to vigorously defend its interests and intellectual properties in court, and one of its longest-running legal battles may be nearing its conclusion. In 2010, the Japanese video game publisher filed a suit in Germany against BigBen Interactive--the previous incarnation of Nacon--over its third-party Wii Remote controllers. Now, the latest ruling has unequivocally gone in Nintendo's favor.As reported by Games Fray, the Mannheim Regional Court has reaffirmed the ruling that Nintendo is owed damages of over €4 million plus interest. Because Nacon fought the ruling, that interest has increased the total fee to just under €7 million.Nintendo's contention was that Nacon's Wii Remote infringed on its patents for the sensor technology and camera needed to track player movements, as well as an acceleration sensor, and \"the ergonomic features characteristic of Nintendo's Wii Remote.\" The initial verdict came down in 2011, but Nacon has consistently appealed the judgment and come up empty each time.This may seem like the end of the story, but Games Fray is reporting that Nacon has filed yet another appeal. So it's not quite over yet.Nintendo has had considerable success in court when going after users who pirate or infringe on its properties. In October, streamer Jesse \"EveryGameGuru\" Keighin was ordered by the court to pay Nintendo $17,500 in damages for livestreaming pirated games and sharing links to the Yuzu and Ryujinx emulators. Keighin had previously mocked Nintendo's efforts to go after him.However, the money Keighin has to pay Nintendo pales in comparison to the $4.5 million that James \"Archbox\" Williams may be on the hook for. Nintendo accused Williams of running a Switch pirates page on Reddit, operating multiple Switch piracy sites, selling hardware hacks, and offering modified Switch consoles with pirated games.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

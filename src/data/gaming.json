It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC and cost $40.The trailer introduces players again to Tau Ceti IV, a colony that you, playing as runners, will infiltrate to dispatch armed forces and extract with valuable gear. You'll make use of a variety of Runner Shells that give you different abilities and perks, defining your role in a party or giving you a choice over how to build if you're planning to play solo. The art style remains as striking as ever, with Bungie's signature gunplay being showcased in the action below.          Marathon was initially scheduled to launch on September 23, 2025 before being indefinitely delayed following a series of public tests that drew criticisms over the game's mechanics. Bungie noted key areas that it planned to improve with more development time, namely the game's survival elements, its lore and world building, and better social experiences for solo and duos players.Sony, who will publish Marathon, assured fans that the game would release before the end of March 2026, with Bungie also confirming that a public beta will take place later in February ahead of launch. Development of Marathon has been rife with controversy, with Bungie eventually settling matters with an artist that accused it of stealing assets for the shooter without permission.Since its delay, Arc Raiders has taken the extraction shooter genre by storm, amassing hundreds of thousands of concurrent players and sustaining that in the months since release.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

If you love the world of Pokemon and have a soft spot for games like Minecraft and games like Animal Crossing, this one is for you.Instead of following the traditional Pokemon formula of knocking about various towns, bumping into trainers and doing battle, Pokopia offers a cozy, open-ended experience where you play as a Ditto that has transformed into a human-like form, tasked with turning a blank landscape into a thriving Pokemon paradise. The game looks set to feature plenty of exploration, crafting, and world-building. You’ll gather materials such as wood, rocks, and crops, and learn moves from the Pokemon you befriend--such as Bulbasaur’s Leafage to grow plants or Squirtle’s Water Gun to water fields. Using those abilities as tools will help shape and improve your environment. The game features dynamic day-night cycles and weather, multiple biomes, and a relaxed pace that encourages creativity and discovery over competition.Pokopia looks like a fresh, mellow way to engage with the world of Pokemon beyond the traditional RPG format. Here's everything we know about Pokémon Pokopia.OrbitalsDeveloper: ShapefarmPlatform: Nintendo Switch 2Release Date: 2026Orbitals is a cooperative adventure game built from the ground up for two players, and it's basically a retro anime you can play. Set to launch exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026, this intergalactic puzzle-adventure puts you and a friend in the roles of explorers Maki and Omura, who must work together to save their crumbling space station home from a supernatural cosmic storm threatening the galaxy.The game's asymmetrical co-op gameplay pushes players to coordinate with unique tools and actions that only succeed when both teammates collaborate closely. A trailer released at The Game Awards in 2025 showed some of this co-op action, with one character piloting a spaceship while another operates the ship's turret. It also showed one player using a levitating beam to help transport an important piece of a puzzle, while the other navigated a series of dangerous platforms. You can expect retro anime-inspired cinematic cutscenes and action-packed cosmic co-op play when Orbitals releases in 2026.AwaysisDeveloper: 17-BITPlatform: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/SRelease Date: 2026If you're a fan of dungeon brawlers, Awaysis might just be your most anticipated game of 2026. The crunchy, satisfying slashing action shown in small preview snippets of combat, combined with its always-forward momentum, makes it look like an incredibly tactile and rewarding arcade-style experience. It's a beautiful-looking game that allows you and your friends to become various adorable creatures, wielding swords bigger than themselves to take on the Dark Lord of Darkness.Awaysis is packed with enchanted loot and enemies to hack away at, propelling you forward while you enjoy a rousing soundtrack from legendary composer Hip Tanaka (Metroid, EarthBound, Super Smash Bros. Brawl). Emphasis is on sliding around, pushing enemies off ledges and watching them fall into the abyss--a smart fighting style befitting of your small stature. The game will support both couch co-op and online play, and even has a Fight Party PvP mode for when your friends get on your nerves.The DuskbloodsDeveloper: FromSoftwarePlatform: Nintendo Switch 2Release Date: 2026FromSoftware is at it again with The Duskbloods (and apparently, another unannounced title), a vampiric RPG set to launch exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026. It represents a notable shift for the studio best known for single-player experiences such as Dark Souls and Elden Ring, with The Duskbloods placing multiplayer at the core of its design, although director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said this isn't a trend the studio is committed to.In The Duskbloods, up to eight players compete in the arena, vying for supremacy against both other players and their environment. Players take on the roles of powerful vampire-like combatants known as Bloodsworn--beings who have transcended humanity through their bloodlines--and battle within a dark, gothic-themed world. While details about specific modes, progression systems, and story elements are still emerging, we've collated all the info we can about The Duskbloods in our trailer breakdown.ReanimalDeveloper: Tarsier StudiosPlatform: PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/SRelease Date: 13 February, 2026Reanimal is a cooperative horror-adventure game from Tarsier Studios--which we're taking as a good sign, considering they're the team behind the original Little Nightmares titles--and it’s set to arrive on February 13, 2026. Here's everything we know about Reanimal so far.Blending survival horror, cinematic platforming, and puzzle-based exploration, Reanimal places players in the shoes of a brother and sister duo, stranded on a twisted, nightmarish island. Together they must work to rescue their missing friends, solve environmental puzzles, and evade grotesque enemies that wander the island’s haunting environments. It's all topped off with a presentation that uses the classic Tarsier shared camera and trademark cramped, oppressive horror.The game is intentionally built around co-op play, allowing two players to tackle it together--either locally or online. Solo players aren’t left out either: an AI companion can step in when you’re facing the horrors on your own. With its mix of surreal scares, integrated cooperative mechanics, and atmospheric worldbuilding, Reanimal might end up being one of the best co-op horror games of 2026.Ikuma: The Frozen CompassDeveloper: Mooneye StudiosPlatform: PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox Series X/SRelease Date: 2026Narrative adventure fans and those who like slow, atmospheric tales should keep an eye out for Ikuma: The Frozen Compass, an upcoming 2026 game that blends emotional storytelling with survival exploration in an icy Arctic world. Developed and published by Mooneye Studios, the team behind Lost Ember and Farewell North, Ikuma is a coming-of-age tale of resilience and companionship that'll keep you cozy.In Ikuma, players follow cabin boy Sam and his loyal sled dog Ellie after their expedition becomes stranded on an uncharted Arctic island in 1864. Facing brutal cold, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, Sam and Ellie must work together to survive the harsh environment while uncovering the mystery behind a lost expedition that left only eerie traces behind. Each player takes their own role and responsibility in the survival of the pair, as well as uncovering a mystery hidden by frost but yours to thaw.While Ikuma does technically support solo play, in which you can switch between Sam and Ellie’s unique abilities yourself, two-player cooperative play is how you get the most out of it, letting you share the adventure with a friend as you tackle it's icy challenges and unravel the island’s secrets together.Hold Your KingDeveloper: Next Big Game StudioPlatform: PCRelease Date: 2026We love a physics-based platformer, especially one you and your less-coordinated pals can grapple with together, and Hold Your King looks like a hilarious challenge. In it, you and a friend team up to carry a demanding King on a stretcher, while navigating challenging medieval courses packed with deadly obstacles. You'll need to keep momentum, speed, and balance in check, so communication will be key in keeping the stubborn king from rolling down a hill or into a river. A royal challenge for 2026, and one we're sure will contribute to plenty of shouting matches.Scott Pilgrim EXDeveloper: Tribute Games Inc.Platform: PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/SRelease Date: 2026Scott Pilgrim EX is an action-adventure, retro co-op beat ’em up set to arrive in early 2026. Developed by Tribute Games in collaboration with the graphic novel's creator Bryan Lee O’Malley, the game is set in a time-twisted version of Toronto and includes everything you might wish for from a new Scott Pilgrim game. Players pick from a roster of seven fan-favorite fighters as they battle through streets overrun by bizarre and quirky foes. We got a hands-on preview of Scott Pilgrim EX, so we know this is one to watch out for.The game supports up to four-player local and online co-op, making it the perfect adventure for a close gang of comic-loving comrades. Scott Pilgrim EX will feature new pixel art from artist Paul Robertson, as well as new music from Anamanaguchi, who provided the soundtrack to the previous game, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. BenDavid Grabinski, director of the recent Scott Pilgrim Takes Off movie on Netflix, is also part of this new project as a creative adviser, so we're expecting big things.HelaDeveloper: WindupPlatform: PlayStation 5, PC, Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/SRelease Date: 2026You can't go wrong with an enchanting open‑world adventure game, and the adorable-looking Hela, where you play as a tiny-but-brave mouse hero, is scheduled for release in 2026.

It's already looking like a gorgeous, cozy co-op game and we can't wait to give it a go.Forza Horizon 6Developer: Playground GamesPlatform: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/SRelease Date: 2026It seems like just about everyone is going to Japan this year, and the world of gaming is no different.

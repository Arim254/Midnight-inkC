The lineup of January 2026 Lego Star Wars sets features notable starships and transport vehicles like the Venator-Class Attack Cruiser and AT-AT Walker as well as the return of the most popular droid from the recent Star Wars film trilogy. That's right, BB-8 has returned to the Star Wars Lego lineup following a lengthy hiatus. The 569-piece BB-8 Astromech Droid is available now for $90 at Amazon, the Lego Store, and other major retailers.See all new Lego sets at: Lego Store | Amazon | Best Buy | TargetLego Star Wars New Releases (January 2026)Here's a list of all eight brand-new Star Wars Lego sets as well as the massive UCS Death Star, which is no longer exclusive to the Lego Store. The AT-AT Walker and Venator-Class Attack Cruiser are part of the Lego Star Wars mid-scale display model series for adults.AT-AT Walker (525 pieces) -- $65BB-8 Astromech Droid (569 pieces) -- $90Venator-Class Attack Cruiser (643 pieces) -- $80UCS Death Star (9,023 pieces) -- $1,000Clone Shock Trooper Mech (151 pieces) -- $15Cobb Vanth's Speeder (207 pieces) -- $35Siege of Mandalore Battle Pack (116 pieces) -- $23The Mandalorian & Grogu's Speeder Bike (58 pieces) -- $10Grogu's Homestead (107 pieces) -- $20                                 Lego Star Wars: BB-8 Astromech Droid (569 Pieces)                                                                $90                                                                                                                                                                                    The 569-piece BB-8 buildable figure looks like a great recreation of the lovable Astromech Droid from the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy. The model comes with a display plaque and information card. A small BB-8 figure connects to the end of the stand.Interactive features include an openable front hatch with a burner arm in his chest cavity, just like in The Force Awakens, and a movable head that rotates in random directions when you slide BB-8 across a flat surface.Just be aware that this BB-8 model is much smaller than the one Lego released back in 2017. The new BB-8 (model No. 75452) is just over 3 inches tall, whereas the 1,106-piece build (model No. 75187) was over 10 inches tall.On the positive side, the smaller-sized BB-8 is a more detailed replica of the droid. Plus, there's a practical reason for this BB-8 to be smaller. Lego designed BB-8 to be accurate in terms of scale when compared to other buildable droids released over the past two years, including R2-D2, C-3PO, and Chopper.

Longtime fans of the franchise will want to pay special attention to the 25th Anniversary sets. To mark the anniversary of the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone film adaptation, Lego designed five models and playsets that call back to the 2001 movie.The star of the lineup is the Lego Harry Potter 25th Anniversary Sorcerer's Stone Collector's Edition, a 1,571-piece display model featuring iconic characters, objects, and scenes from the movie. The new $170 Collector's Edition set is already on backorder at the Lego Store, but it's in stock at Amazon and Best Buy. If you have a My Best Buy Plus/Total membership, you'll save 10%, which drops the price to $153.The Sorcerer's Stone Collector's Edition will remind fans of the Hogwarts Icons Collector's Edition from Lego's 20th Anniversary celebration in 2021. Both models feature Hedwig and numerous objects fro the first movie. The 3,010-piece Hogwarts Icons set is officially retired and regularly sells for well above its original $300 price, so it's worth keeping that in mind if you're interested in the new model.Lego Harry Potter 25th Anniversary Collection (January 2026)New Harry Potter Lego setsThe 25th Anniversary lineup also includes four playsets, each of which comes with minifigures and an exclusive Patronus figure. The 764-piece replica of Luna Lovegood's House includes her Hare Patronus. The Hogwarts Castle: Hospital Wing playset comes with seven minifigures as well as a buildable spider and Remus Lupin's Wolf Patronus. Hermione Granger's Otter Patronus is included with the 652-piece Cauldron: Secret Potions Classroom. The smallest 25th Anniversary set recreates the Sorting Hat Ceremony for $15. The 124-piece set features four minifigures as well as Professor McGonagall's Cat Patronus.Sorcerer's Stone Collector's Edition (1,571 pieces) -- $170Cauldron: Secret Potions Classroom (652 pieces) -- $60Luna Lovegood's House (764 pieces) -- $90Hogwarts Castle: Hospital Wing (907 pieces) -- $100Hogwarts Castle: Sorting Hat Ceremony (124 pieces) -- $15See all new Lego sets at: Lego Store | Amazon | Best Buy | Target                                 Lego Harry Potter 25th Anniversary Sorcerer's Stone - Collector's Edition (1,571 Pieces)                                                                $170                                                                                                                                                                                    The 25th Anniversary Sorcerer's Stone diorama measures 11.5 x 8.5 x 9.5 inches and is one of the most affordable Harry Potter Collector's Edition sets.The base is the game board for Wizard's Chess. Fittingly, the Ron Weasley minifigure is posed on the back of the Knight game piece (a horse). There's also a buildable version of the Queen from Wizard's Chess and minifigure versions of Harry and Hermione wielding wands. The model also includes Harry's school trunk and two buildable books. Perched atop the stack is Harry's owl Hedwig. Two smaller builds are next to Hedwig on the top book: an Albus Dumbledore card from a Chocolate Frog and a replica of the shiny red Sorcerer's Stone. A candle and two Galleons rest on the edges of the trunk.The model also has a few interactive elements and hidden micro-scale scenes from the movie. The book Hedwig stands on has a removable back panel concealing the Hogwarts Express boarding platform and a small recreation of the train. You can also remove the back panel on the trunk to see a recreation of the five trials Harry completes to reach the Sorcerer's Stone. If you pull the handle on the side of the trunk, you'll see the Halloween scene from the movie where the trio fight a mountain troll in a Hogwarts bathroom.The left side of the trunk features three dials. The middle dial turns Hedwig's head with 360 degrees range of movement; the left dial swings the troll's club; and the right dial moves the Queen across the chessboard.                                                                                                                                                                     More New Lego Harry Potter SetsThere are three new Lego Harry Potter sets outside of the 25th Anniversary lineup. You can build an 868-piece replica of the Flying Ford Anglia Car from the Chamber of Secrets. The latest magical creature figure is the 320-piece Cornish Pixie for $30. Rounding out the lineup is Hagrid & Harry's Privet Drive Escape for $20. We've included the 3,228-piece Hogsmeade Village Collector's Edition in the list below, because it just launched at major retailers. The $400 model was exclusive to the Lego Store when it initially released in September.Flying Ford Anglia Car (868 pieces) -- $80Cornish Pixie (320 pieces) -- $30Hagrid & Harry's Privet Drive Escape (124 pieces) -- $20Hogsmeade Village Collector's Edition (3,228 pieces) -- $400January 2026 is a big month for some of Lego's most popular themes.

The newly released Blu-ray collection is up for grabs for $46.79 (was $60). The Golden Era Anthology compiles over 100 classic animated shorts starring the iconic duo. The six-disc box set also comes with a wealth of bonus features and a physical sketchbook. The Golden Era Anthology is also available on DVD for $46.79 (was $55), though it doesn't include the bonus content disc or sketchbook.Warner Bros. released The Golden Era Anthology on December 2 to celebrate Tom and Jerry's 85th anniversary. Unsurprisingly, this awesome collection quickly became a bestseller when preorders opened in September. Though Amazon's store page notes a $60 MSRP, the retailer has listed the collection for as high as $66.49. Amazon previously offered the $46.79 deal in mid-December, but it disappeared within a day.                                 Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era Anthology (Blu-ray)                                                                $46.79 (was $60)                                                                                                                                                                                    Part of the Warner Archive Collection, The Golden Era Anthology features 114 theatrical shorts across six discs. The shorts were restored in 1080p resolution and support DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Three of the shorts have stereo audio, while the rest are mono.The box set collects nearly 20 years of Tom and Jerry history. The animated shorts, which played before feature films, originally appeared in theaters from 1940 through 1958. All 114 shorts are presented in chronological order, and three of them--Casanova Cat, Mouse Cleaning, and His Mouse Friday--were completely remastered for the first time.The Golden Era Anthology's sixth disc is loaded with bonus content, including audio commentaries narrated by animation experts, featurettes, and extra shorts. Two of the featurettes are exclusive to this release: Lady of the House: The Story of Mammy Two Shoes and Animal Hijinks: The Friends and Foes of Tom. The included physical sketchbook features archival character art and designs.Special Features20 audio commentaries9 classic featurettes2 new featurettes3 bonus animated shorts32-page sketchbookAll told, The Golden Era Anthology includes approximately 20 hours of content. The cover art features Tom in his Zoot suit from the 1944 animated short The Zoot Cat.                      Tom and Jerry: The Golden Era AnthologyThe Golden Era Anthology is notable for including two remastered shorts that had never received home media releases in the US: Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat. These are controversial Tom and Jerry episodes due to them being racially insensitive, and while they were scheduled to appear in Tom and Jerry: The Golden Collection Volume Two, that release was ultimately canceled. Older--and extremely dated--content like this has appeared in several other Warner Archive releases over the years, as the company has added disclaimers to these shorts to indicate their historical context, problematic nature, and racially insensitive jokes.                                                                                                                                               The Golden Era Anthology is the biggest Tom and Jerry Blu-ray collection yet, but Warner Bros. has released other jam-packed DVD and Blu-ray box sets over the years. You can read about a few of the newer ones as well as older classics below. Make sure to check out the Tom and Jerry Amazon store page we created, as it features even more Blu-ray and DVD collections.Another great recent release is Tom and Jerry: The Complete Cinemascope Cartoon Collection. Launched in February 2025, this $28 Blu-ray collection includes all 23 of Tom and Jerry's Cinemascope widescreen adventures and a trio of bonus cartoons. The widescreen cartoons are wonderfully animated and feature some of the funniest moments in Tom and Jerry history.The Blu-ray editions of these shorts have more vibrant color palettes and markedly improved audio compared to old VHS and DVD releases. The three extra cartoons from Tom and Jerry creators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera include Good Will to Men (1955), Give and Tyke (1957), and Scat Cats (1957).Warner Bros. released a few other Tom and Jerry Blu-rays and DVDs in 2025, including a budget-friendly Tom and Jerry 85th Anniversary Kids Collection on DVD in May. This 3.5-hour compilation is available for only $8 at Amazon. Warner Bros. also reissued Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes on Blu-ray, which you can buy for $23.49 at Amazon.We'd also recommend the three-volume Tom and Jerry: The Spotlight Collection on DVD. This four-disc set collects 112 cartoons and is on sale for only $14.58 (was $38). Covering everything from the original Tom and Jerry short--when Tom was still named Jasper--to later classic cartoons, this is a comprehensive collection featuring the enduring cat-and-mouse team. The one thing to note here is that this version of the Spotlight Collection doesn't include the audio commentary tracks, but several special features like behind-the-scenes featurettes, documentaries, and additional scenes are still here.Warner Archive Collection: Upcoming ReleasesMultiple cartoon box sets are joining the Warner Archive Collection in January. The Woody Woodpecker & Friends Golden Age Collection releases on Blu-ray January 20 and is up for preorder for $25. Flintstones fans can preorder The New Fred and Barney Show: The Complete Series for $27.33 ahead of its January 27 launch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Peanuts 75th Anniversary Blu-ray Box Set & Deluxe BookPeanuts: Ultimate TV Specials CollectionCharles Schulz's Peanuts franchise celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2025 with multiple cartoon and comic strip box sets. The Peanuts: 75th Anniversary Ultimate TV Specials Collection released in October and is discounted to $71 (was $85) at Amazon. This great Blu-ray set features 40 animated specials that aired on television from 1965 through 2011, including the very first Peanuts special. Each cartoon was remastered in 1080p, and the five-disc set also comes with a 28-page collectible booklet featuring artwork and background details about the specials.

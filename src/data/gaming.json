It was written and produced in collaboration with the sponsor.\n\n              \n                                        In The Outer Worlds 2, who you are is reflected in every decision, skill, and flaw that defines the way you move through the galaxy. Obsidian Entertainment’s long-awaited sequel takes character customisation to a new level, letting players shape their own commander from the ground up and experience a story that reacts to their unique approach.From the moment you begin your mission as an Earth Directorate agent sent to investigate catastrophic rifts across the Arcadia colony, The Outer Worlds 2 makes it clear--there’s no “right” way to save humanity. Every choice, from your dialogue style to your combat strategy, builds toward a version of the story that’s entirely your own.Build your perfect commanderCharacter creation in The Outer Worlds 2 lets players sculpt their commander’s appearance, background, and strengths--while flaws, which shape how others perceive you, are assigned by the game as it observes your playstyle. Want to play a silver-tongued diplomat who can talk their way out of any firefight? Invest in Speech and Charm to unlock persuasive dialogue options that can shift entire faction dynamics. Prefer the subtle route? Focus on Stealth and Engineering to sneak through conflict zones, hack terminals, and strike from the shadows before anyone knows you were there.Or maybe subtlety’s overrated. For those who prefer a louder approach, the game fully embraces chaos. A commander who leans into raw combat--pouring points into Guns, Melee, or Leadership--can turn skirmishes into explosive showcases of strength, rallying companions mid-battle or charging headfirst into danger.Every decision matters--even the bad onesOne of The Outer Worlds 2’s most compelling features is how it weaves your choices, skills, and even flaws into the narrative itself. Ignore diplomacy and you might find your reputation preceding you in ways you didn’t plan for. Accept a flaw--say, a tendency to panic when outnumbered--and you’ll gain unique buffs that change how you approach high-pressure encounters. Every attribute adds dimension to your commander, whether you’re a meticulous planner or a risk-taking wildcard.Companions that evolve with youYour playstyle doesn’t just affect your missions--it shapes your crew, too. Companions react to your decisions, learn from your leadership, and may even challenge your values. A logical strategist might earn loyalty from disciplined allies, while a morally flexible commander could attract a more unpredictable bunch. No matter your build, the relationships you form add another layer of depth to your personal story.The best part? The Outer Worlds 2 offers so much variety that you’ll want to explore multiple playthroughs to see how different character builds shape the story and gameplay. Available day one with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, subscribers can dive in immediately and experiment with new approaches--whether that’s a silver-tongued negotiator, a stealthy tactician, or a grenade-loving troublemaker--discovering just how differently Arcadia can unfold each time.With its flexible character system, reactive storytelling, and signature Obsidian humour, The Outer Worlds 2 makes every choice feel personal--and every version of your commander worth exploring. So pick your skills, choose your flaws, and get ready to see what kind of hero (or chaos agent) you’ll become when the fate of the galaxy is in your hands.The Outer Worlds 2: Available now with Game Pass | Xbox\n                                                                  \n    \n                                                    "

Fortunately, there's a wide range of accessories that you can equip to your phone, and this new magnetic case from MCon looks like it'll hit the Goldilocks zone for functionality and compact design. Now available to preorder for $145 (was $150), the MCon is designed to fit \"most\" phones using its magnetic clamps.                                 MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller                                                                $145 (was $150)                                                                                                                                                                                    In addition to being a pocket-friendly device, the MCon features some high-end technology inside it. It has deployable grips for ergonomic comfort, Hall-Effect analog triggers, GameSir anti-stick drift joysticks, and a built-in gyroscope for motion controls. Another cool feature with this controller is that it has a button-activated slider that raises your phone into playing position with a single smooth motion. Kickback Mode allows you to remove the control cover and prop your phone up for tabletop play.The controller also supports games that are played in Portrait Mode, and it features all the inputs you'd expect for modern-day gaming. The device also has silent face buttons, and it attaches to your phone with two magnetic pucks to keep your camera bumps away from the controller, ensuring a level fit. When not in use, the MCon measures just 5.67 inches long, 2.67 inches wide, and under three-quarters of an inch thick, to make it easy to store in your pocket. It's available to preorder in white or black.                      The MCon was originally funded through a Kickstarter campaign that blew past its initial funding goal of $25,000, earning over $1.7 million in crowdfunding. Part of the appeal for the device is that it has a user-friendly design, as manufacturer Oh Snap designed it to be moddable, upgradeable, and repairable. Smartphone controllers have become popular over the last couple of years, thanks in part to subscription services like Netflix and Crunchyroll offering a library of games for members to access, and there are several brands out there that offer high-quality add-ons like this.One of the biggest is Backbone, as it currently sells controllers that are also portable and make mobile gaming a more pleasant experience. The company recently announced a collaboration with Hideo Kojima's studio to produce a Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Backbone controller, but if you're in a rush, the Backbone One with a USB-C connection is available for $100, and for older iPhones, the Backbone One with a Lightning connection is available at the same price.The Backbone Ones have a solid design, but if you're looking for a more premium controller with better parts inside, the company's premium smartphone controller--the Backbone Pro--is worth considering, with Hall Effect triggers, quiet face buttons, and full-sized ALPS analog sticks.

Role-playing games have always offered that rare kind of escapism: the chance to step into a different life, shape your own story, and lose yourself in a universe that feels alive.With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian Entertainment captures that feeling again--the thrill of exploration, the satisfaction of choice, and the joy of seeing a world shift around your actions.Every corner of Arcadia tells a story worth discovering.Arcadia, the colony at the heart of The Outer Worlds 2, feels like a place built for wandering. Every outpost, settlement, and alien landscape tells its own story. The conversations you overhear, the missions you stumble into, even the way the sky shifts above you--it all makes the world feel lived-in. There’s a sense of texture to everything, like the game wants you to slow down and take it in rather than rush to the next objective.Every build tells a different story about the kind of player you arePart of what makes RPGs so magnetic is the chance to decide who you’ll become. In The Outer Worlds 2, you build your commander from the ground up--their look, their skills, their attitude. Some players might choose a smooth-talking diplomat who navigates danger through dialogue, while others prefer a stealthy tactician or a fearless brawler. However you play, your approach changes how the story unfolds and how the world responds.The story evolves around the paths you choose to takeEvery decision in The Outer Worlds 2 feels like it matters. The alliances you form, the people you help, and the promises you break all ripple through Arcadia. Sometimes the effects are immediate. Other times they echo hours later, catching you off guard in ways that feel human. It’s that balance of consequence and curiosity that makes RPGs so rewarding -- the sense that your version of the story truly belongs to you.The Outer Worlds 2 captures what makes immersion feel so specialAt their best, RPGs give you space to disappear for a while--not to avoid reality, but to explore new ones. The Outer Worlds 2 understands that pull completely. It builds a world worth escaping into, filled with choices that challenge you, characters that surprise you, and moments that stick long after you’ve logged off.For anyone who loves rich storytelling and total creative freedom, The Outer Worlds 2 is a must-play. It’s available day one with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving subscribers instant access to Arcadia and everything it holds. Whether you’re an Obsidian loyalist or new to the series, this is the kind of game that reminds you why RPGs have always been the most rewarding way to play--because they give you the space to explore, to imagine, and to make every world your own.The Outer Worlds 2: Available now with Game Pass | Xbox\n                                                                  \n    \n                                                    "

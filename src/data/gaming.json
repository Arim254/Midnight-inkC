    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Darryn Bonthuys\n   on November 12, 2025 at 9:58AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                It's the fifth anniversary of the PS5 console, but right now, it's time to dig into the list of new games headed to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers. Available starting November 18, subscribers can look forward to a varied--but interesting--collection of games that cover old-school tomb-raiding, spine-tingling horror, and a classic of the open-world genre. Rumors this week of GTA 5 coming back to PS Plus are indeed true, and you can also explore a zone full of weird science in Pacific Drive, or go on effortlessly charming romp through a quaint British village in Thank Goodness You're Here.In case you missed it, the November free games for PS Plus subscribers--Stray, EA Sports WRC 24, and Totally Accurate Battle Simulator--are also available to claim, so make certain to do so before December 1. Here's a closer look at everything coming to the PS Plus Game Catalog this month.Grand Theft Auto 5 (PS5, PS4)GTA 6 won't be out for another year, but at least you can pass the time with GTA 5 until then. The game has popped up several times on PS Plus over the years, and if you still haven't checked it out yet, then you've missed out on one of the best open-world games of all time. In addition to its sprawling single-player campaign, exploring Los Santos in GTA Online is also a great way to experience the game.Pacific Drive (PS5)A first-person driving survival game, Pacific Drive puts you behind the wheel of a station wagon as you explore a stretch of the American coast plagued by anomalies and other weird phenomena. One of our favorite games of 2024, traveling along the Olympic Exclusion Zone and keeping your wheels in working order while soaking up the atmospheric scenery makes for a surprisingly zen-like experience. If you like the base game, you'll want to also grab the Whispers in the Woods expansion that recently launched.Still Wakes the Deep (PS5)Developer The Chinese Room knows a thing or two about crafting first-person narrative horror game--just look at Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs for an unnerving example--and Still Wakes the Deep sees the studio flex its muscles with a tense and terrifying tale set on an oil rig. With the platform under siege by a malevolent force and no hope of rescue, you'll have to run, climb, and swim your way out of danger in this well-crafted thriller.Insurgency: Sandstorm (PS5, PS4)Not interested in Battlefield 6 or Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this month? Then check out Insurgency: Sandstorm for some contemporary conflict set in war-torn environments. A solid action with co-op and PvP multiplayer modes, the game leans harder into realism with is resource management, teamwork, and vehicular combat gameplay mechanics.Thank Goodness You're Here (PS5, PS4)A very British game, Thank Goodness You're Here is a \"slapformer\" in which you guide an odd little fellow through the streets of Barnsworth, helping out locals and solving problems. Each successfully completed task opens up more of the town to explore, and with many colorful personalities, this charming game featuring hand-drawn animation will quickly worm its way into your heart.The Talos Principle 2 (PS5)Are you in the mood for a cerebral challenge? Then you'll want to download The Talos Principle 2 this month. The puzzle game builds on the philosophical themes of its predecessor, adding more challenges and and environments to explore in a world where humanity has gone extinct. A game that asks big questions about life, the cosmos, and the purpose of civilization, The Talos Principle 2 is a thought-provoking journey about building a better tomorrow.Monster Jam Showdown (PS5, PS4)Once you're done wrapping your head around questions that might give you an existential crisis, you can unwind with a few sessions of Monster Jam Showdown. The arcade-inspired racing and stunt game does a great job at replicating Monster Trucks as beastly machines with unique handling characteristics, and you can test your skills in races and showcase modes.MotoGP 25 (PS5, PS4)With the current MotoGP season coming to a close on November 16, you can keep the two-wheeled action going with MotoGP 25. Like the previous officially licensed games, MotoGP 25 features all the riders, teams, and liveries of the sport, as well as finely tuned motorcycles as you battle for first place across the globe.Tomb Raider: Anniversary (PS5, PS4)PlayStation Plus Premium subscription requiredFinally, the Classics section of the PS Plus Game Catalog gets a visit from Lara Croft in Tomb Raider: Anniversary. Retracing Croft's original adventures as she tracked down the legendary Scion artifact, Anniversary was originally released for the PS2 almost 20 years ago, and this is the first time that the game will be playable on PS5 and PS4.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                As part of Valve's big hardware announcements today, the company did not disclose a price for the new Steam Machine device. Hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat was asked in an interview about what Valve's position is, at a high level, regarding pricing, and Aldehayyat said the aim is to land at a \"competitive price\" that matches up with the value provided. This is what most companies say about their new products, and Valve is following suit. The aim, he said, is to make it \"affordable.\"\"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it,\" he told IGN.Aldehayyat said affordability is a key concern for many today, maybe more than ever, as inflation ticks up and concerns remain ongoing due to the impact of tariffs.\"The affordability piece you mentioned is one of the reasons why we think a Steam Machine makes a lot of sense right now. So it's just something that we thought about every time we made a hardware decision, a feature decision, is to make sure that we keep it as approachable, as affordable as possible,\" Aldehayyat added.          That's a lot of nebulous talk, but it's as much as Valve was willing to say at this juncture. The system is set to be released in Spring 2026, with preorders presumably opening beforehand.Valve also did not disclose the prices for the new Steam Controller and Steam Frame virtual reality headset. You can read more about the new Valve devices in GameSpot's extended coverage. Beyond the new hardware, Valve is working on a MOBA game called Deadlock. The secretive game has been available for testing, but still has no release date or full details.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

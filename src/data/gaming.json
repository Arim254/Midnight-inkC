    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Communication Workers of America has announced that a \"majority of video game developers\" for the Hearthstone team have decided to unionize. More than 100 Blizzard Entertainment employees are joining the union, following in the footsteps of the Overwatch 2 crew earlier this year.The unionization includes Blizzard employees who worked on Warcraft Rumble, a game that went into life-support mode in July. Around the same time, Microsoft announced mass layoffs that included a reported 100 Blizzard workers.\"Whether we are fighting for layoff protections, security for our remote workers, or reduced wage gaps, the pressures we face are making it harder to create the high-quality work we care about,\" said organizing committee member and senior 2D artist Uriah Voth in the CWA press release. \"Organizing gives us the opportunity to empower ourselves and challenge the instability and unfair conditions that undermine us.\"The CWA notes that \"Microsoft has recognized the union.\" In 2024, the World of Warcraft team started the unionization efforts at Blizzard and inspired the Hearthstone developers, per CWA. Not even two months ago, the Diablo team voted to unionize, as well. There are now over 1,900 Blizzard employees who are part of the union.Meanwhile, Hearthstone will introduce the Across the Timeways expansion on November 4. There will be 145 new cards added to the game, alongside time travel. Blizzard's fan expo BlizzCon skipped this year but will be back in September 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

While Epic Games has yet to make a formal announcement about adding characters from TV's longest-running animated sitcom, a new rumor suggests that The Simpsons' hometown of Springfield will get its own map during the event.According to Insider Gaming, numerous leakers have disclosed that a Springfield map will be included in Fortnite's Simpsons season. However, the only location confirmed by multiple leakers is Springfield's nuclear power plant, which employs Homer Simpson himself.The Simpsons has been running on Fox since 1989, and the town of Springfield has been fleshed out over 37 seasons and nearly 800 episodes. It's unclear how big the Springfield map will be in Fortnite, but it's possible that it may be a scaled-down version of the city from the show with a handful of its iconic locations.Epic is going to drop a short Fortnite season on November 1, and it's widely believed that it will be the Simpsons-themed season. For now, that has yet to be confirmed by Epic. Earlier today, Fortnite, Roblox, and other prominent sites went dark due to a massive Amazon Web Services outage.The current Halloween-themed event is Fortnitemares 2025, which added skins for Ghostface, Scooby-Doo, Art the Clown, and more. It will run through the end of October.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                A Fall Guys player has officially claimed the Guinness World Record for the most overall wins in Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, marking the end of a years-long obsession that saw him pour thousands of hours into the game show battle royale.According to Guinness World Records, the player, who goes by the name Magic_Bigos, achieved an unprecedented 150,000 crowns after nearly five years of dedication.\"I started playing in 2020 casually,\" they told GameSpot via message. \"Then in late December 2021, when I had like 550 crowns, I started grinding a show called Finals Marathon [...] I was playing every single minute of my free time, refusing to play other games even if a friend wanted to.\"By April 2022, he had achieved the game’s Golden Knight costume, a symbol of prestige among fans. He quit the game several times throughout his journey, only to come back to the grind.\"I wanted to reach top 1 Europe or top 10 world,\" they wrote. \"But deep down I was really dreaming of claiming the top-1 spot.\"That dream turned into a grueling marathon of near-constant play. During one stretch in 2023, he played Fall Guys for 15 hours a day across the entire summer. His parents even grounded him after he went without sleep for two school nights. He came back to keep playing.After submitting screenshots, videos, and leaderboard evidence, his Guinness record was confirmed on September 10, 2025. Yet when he shared the achievement on the Fall Guys subreddit, the reaction wasn’t all celebratory--many accused him of using in-game glitches. The post includes a picture of his certificate and a number of comments that accused him of cheating.\"I used glitches,\" they wrote. \"My main opponent who was #1 at the time used them too, so I had no other choice if I wanted to surpass him.\"Though he says he’s since quit the game, he calls the journey \"a phenomenon,\" adding that he's never been motivated like this before.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

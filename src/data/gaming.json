    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Cheri Faulkner\n   on January 9, 2026 at 9:45AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Hytale is a sandbox-meets-RPG that has seen its fair share of development woes. Formed by Hypixel developers, who run one of the most successful Minecraft servers of all time, Hytale formerly had funding from Riot Games who then went on to purchase the studio outright in 2020. Riot canceled Hytale in June 2025, but its original founder repurchased the game in mid November 2025 and recommenced development. Now, the game is entering early access in what the Hypixel team admits will be laced with \"bugs, rough edges, and unbalanced content.\" As part of Hypixel's dedication to its potential playerbase, it allowed modders to get their hands on the game ahead of release to identify, plan, and develop the best mods possible. From increased luck during mining, custom plots, new items, and intriguing game modes, here are the best Hypixel mods to use from launch. Hypixel has confirmed that it has partnered with Curseforge to host mods, and this should lead to a pretty seamless installation process thanks to the Curseforge launcher.Hytale SkyblockAnyone who's played Minecraft's player-created custom modes will be familiar with Skyblock. You're placed on an amount of terrain high in the sky, with limited resources. It's your job to expand your Skyblock, increase your well of resources, and proceed through the game. While Hypixel's storyline will differ from Minecraft's, obviously, transferring the Skyblock concept seems to be one of the more obvious mods you should try out. It's created by Cinder Stone Studios, and will be available via Curseforge at launch.Gone Fishing Mrbysco and their partner ShyNieke have been working on the Gone Fishing mod, which pretty much does what it says on the tin. While fishing is a vanilla inclusion in Minecraft, Hytale doesn't feature the mechanic at launch. By installing the mod you can spend all day fishing in Hytale if that's your dream, and from a short clip posted to Mrbysco's X page, we know that the user interface in the lower left corner will even identify the type of fish you've caught.Simply Trash The Simply Trash mod by Jaredlll08 adds a trash can to quickly get rid of unwanted items. If you've ever found yourself with a full inventory of items you don't care about in Minecraft, you've probably created a lava bin to burn them--but this can be timely and frustrating. Jared's trash can seems to remove that problem, making inventory management even easier.AutoHammer When building a structure, village, or even just decorating some paths, switching between various blocks to add texture and interesting patterns is a necessity in vanilla Hytale. With the AutoHammer mod from tr7zw, select from variants of the same block type and AutoHammer will randomize which one is placed down.Macaw's ModsThis is technically a group of mods from one creator, but Sketch Macaw's mods are infamous in the Minecraft community, with hundreds of millions of installations. Macaw adds various paintings, paths, bridges, windows, lighting options, and more. Their paintings mod means you can easily switch between which paintings appear on the canvases you place, while their multiple furniture mods make customization more varied than you can imagine. We'd argue the bundle of Macaw's Mods are almost essential to install for your Hytale world. Check out Macaw's showcase to see the mods in action. They've even developed NEP - Not Enough Poops. We're in the dark about why poop is so important in Hytale, but it's good to see Macaw thinks we'll need even more.WhereThisAt? If you're anything like me, inventory management is an ongoing struggle in most sandbox and survival games. I start off with the best of intentions, manually organizing my loot into easy-to-find locations. If I'm feeling particularly organized, they might even be in alphabetical order. Before long though, I've been on so many adventures and acquired so much random loot that my system goes out of the window completely. That's why Buuz135's WhereThisAt? mod will be one of the first that I install for Hytale. Search nearby inventories using the Inventory Lectern to find the item, and even pull it into your inventory. Immersive MelodiesImmersive Melodies is another mod that's popular in Minecraft, which creator Conczin has managed to port over to Hytale. A bundle of 25 songs is playable on seven instruments, or you can upload your own melodies. It works in multiplayer, meaning you can form a band with your friends or just annoy them as you chase them around your base yelling Blink-182's All The Small Things in their headsets. Hours of fun ... for you, probably not for them.Lucky MiningAnother mod from Buuz135 is Lucky Mining. It gives a small chance for ores to spread to adjacent blocks while mining. You'll know whether this has happened by a helpful particle effect and accompanying sound effect. It's a simple mod, but in those early stages where resources are limited and you're trying to progress, it can prove invaluable.Better ModlistA simple UI and quality-of-life improvement mod, the Better Modlist is another contribution from Buuz135. This modlist combines mods and packs and shows information about them in-game. It's a handy way to see everything you've got installed at once, as well as their effects.Item Magnet If you're out on a long expedition to get materials, the last thing you want to do is run around the world chasing down the drops. In Jaredlll08's Item Magnet mod, anything you chop down, mine, or drop will be automatically magnetized to you and added to your inventory. It might feel simple, but it'll shave valuable time off your resource-gathering missions.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.\"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,\" said Roh via Reuters. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be \"inevitable.\"The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing \"This Is an Xbox\" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.The lone bright spot from Roh's comments is that he mentioned that Samsung is working with its production partners on strategies to minimize the impact of the memory shortages.A recent report suggests that Nvidia may take a different approach to the increasingly high GPU prices by resurrecting its previously discontinued GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs. That has yet to be confirmed by Nvidia, which phased out the GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs in favor of the 40 and 50 series GPUs, both of which were more expensive and more advanced.As for Samsung, the company touted its plans to use Google's Gemini AI in 800 million units this year, which will continue the need for RAM across its family of products.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

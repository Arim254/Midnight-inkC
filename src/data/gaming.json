Additionally, there is no PS Plus or Game Pass Essential requirement to play online, the developer said in a blog post.GTA Online became a standalone game in 2022, and it normally costs $20. To be sure, after this free week wraps up, people will have to buy the game to keep playing. Alternatively, they can subscribe to GTA+ ($8/month) to get GTA Online, Red Dead Redemption, and a bunch of other games, along with GTA Online perks, for as long as their membership stays active. GTA 5, meanwhile, was recently re-introduced to PlayStation Plus.Next big GTA Online update in DecemberRockstar has steadily updated GTA Online over the years, and the next big update in December will add mansion properties that people can buy.\"There's a new entrant in the Los Santos high-end real estate scene, and they're making moves into some of the most exclusive neighborhoods. Prix Luxury Real Estate has ambitious plans, bringing new unrivaled mansion properties to this lucrative market in December,\" Rockstar said.Prior to the December update, people can take on three new missions related to the update that will pay out double GTA$ and RP, or quadruple those rates for GTA+ members. People who complete the missions will be able to buy the new mansion properties for a discount of GTA$ 2 million off what they will cost for people who don't do the missions.People who complete all three missions also get a cash injection of GTA$ 1 million, along with cosmetics for their character. And anyone who simply logs in to GTA Online between now and December 7 will earn \"Black Tier VIP\" status, which entitles them to a free Ubermacht Revolter car.The GTA Online freebie offer comes just after Rockstar delayed GTA 6 to November 2026. And in other Rockstar-related news, the ESRB just recently posted a rating for Red Dead Redemption for modern consoles, sparking speculation about a possible remaster.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Rockstar's 2010 game Red Dead Redemption has been rated for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The ESRB recently posted a rating for the game on these platforms, and this has led some to believe a remaster of the game is in the works and that it could possibly launch soon. Nothing is confirmed, however.This is all separate from the ongoing rumors of Red Dead Redemption II coming to Switch 2 and getting updated versions for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The ESRB database has no rating for Red Dead Redemption II on those platforms, however.The ESRB rating for Red Dead Redemption mentions zombies, which suggests the possible upcoming re-release could feature the game's popular Undead Nightmare expansion.Red Dead Redemption came to the Switch in 2023 and PC in 2024, some 13 and 14 years after the game originally debuted on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010. The follow-up--which is a prequel to the events of the first game--launched in 2018 for PS4 and Xbox One and came to PC in 2019.The rumored RDR2 ports for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S are said to be in the works for a 2025 release, while a GTA 4 remaster could come out this year as well. Whether or not the rumored new versions of RDR and RDR2 could be packaged together is unknown.Rockstar owner Take-Two recently said it had eight new iterations of previously released titles in the works that will be released by the end of its 2028 fiscal year, meaning by March 31, 2028. These will be remasters and ports; only four have been confirmed so far, and some are speculating that the possible re-releases of RDR and RDR2 could be among the announced projects.As for Rockstar's biggest upcoming release, GTA 6 has been delayed yet again and is now set for release in November 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The Marvel Cinematic Universe star filmed a video in May at the grand opening of Super Nintendo World in Orlando about getting to play the cosmic princess in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.On Instagram, Larson shared the video--along with a few pictures--showing her excitement about becoming Rosalina. \"I'm hiding inside a warp pipe right now. I'm going to be in the next Super Mario movie,\" the actress said with a smile. \"It's called Super Mario Galaxy, and I play Rosalina. It is an absolute dream come true.\"Nintendo and Universal announced Larson's casting during a Nintendo Direct earlier this week. The presentation featured the first trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, which also sees the introduction of Uncut Gems co-director Benny Safdie as the voice of Bowser Jr. The trailer offers a ton of Easter eggs for Mario fans.Even though she's in the movie, Larson is one of those fans, too. The Captain Marvel actress has talked in the past about throwing a boyfriend out of her house after he complained that she was taking the final level in Super Mario Galaxy too seriously. Larson has also been part of an ad campaign for the Switch in the past.For more, check out everything we know about The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.

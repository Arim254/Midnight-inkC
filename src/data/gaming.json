Doster\n   on November 24, 2025 at 11:36AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The first season of Black Ops 7 and Warzone arrives on December 4, and Activision has revealed the full roadmap of content players can expect for this new season of Call of Duty. Season 1 adds Black Ops 7's integration into Warzone, a new battle pass, DLC weapons to unlock, and more maps across all modes. Seasonal holiday events are also included, and the campaign's Endgame mode gets new world events with massive bosses to fight.Call of Duty Season 1 start timesCall of Duty Season 1 arrives to Black Ops 7 and Warzone on December 4, and the update will go live at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM BST across all platforms.New seasonal eventsSeason 1 kicks off with the Rally Point event, which is a community-based event that will unlock several cosmetic rewards for everyone who participates. This event is available across all game modes, including the campaign Endgame.Later in the season, a Naughty and Nice holiday event will allow players to earn festive rewards.Seasonal battle passBlack Ops 7 gets its first battle pass, and it includes both free and premium tiers of content. In total, the Season 1 battle pass offers up more than 100 pieces of new content to unlock. Alden Dorne serves as the main battle pass operator players can unlock in the paid pass, and a variant skin is unlocked for Dorne if the full battle pass is completed.The premium $30 BlackCell pass also returns. The BlackCell pass includes the \"Scorn\" operator unlock and several additional cosmetics to unlock.More weapons to unlockSeven weapons are coming in Season 1. Two are available in the free tiers of the battle pass, while others will arrive later in the season as rewards for various in-game challenges.The battle pass weapons are the Kogot-7 submachine gun, which looks like a re-named MP7, and the fan-favorite Maddox assault rifle from Black Ops 4 returns as the Maddox RFB.Later in the season, players can unlock the ballistic knife, Sokol 545 light machine gun, the NX Ravager crossbow, HX sniper rifle, and the Sturmwolf 45 submachine gun.Multiplayer mapsSeason 1 adds seven more maps for multiplayer, and this will be a mix of new and remastered maps. Some maps will arrive at launch, while others are saved for the midseason update.Fate is a brand-new map inspired by the game's campaign mission called Time and Fate, and the setting features a trippy setting of fractured and floating building pieces from a city in Nicaragua. Odysseus is another new map based on a campaign mission, and Utopia is a futuristic Guild facility based in Australia. Yakei is a small-size map for 6v6 and 2v2 modes. This map setting takes place on the rooftops of a neon-lit Japanese city.Additionally, Meltdown and Standoff arrive as remastered maps from Black Ops 2, and Fringe returns from Black Ops 3. Players can also expect a holiday-themed makeover for Hijacked.New MP game modesFor game modes, several of Call of Duty's popular party modes return. Prop Hunt, One in the Chamber, and Sharpshooter are included with the launch of Season 1, while Sticks and Stones and Gun Game will appear post-launch.Treyarch is also introducing a brand-new mode called Takeover for the midseason update. This sounds like a mashup of Domination and Hardpoint, as two teams of six fight over three neutral territories, earning a point for each zone they control. When all three of the zones are captured, there's a brief cooldown before all three territories move to a new set of locations within the map. The team with the highest score at the end wins the game.Holiday-themed limited-time mode will arrive later in the season, including a snowball fight game mode that arms players with snowballs instead of guns.New MP loadout equipmentSeason 1's midseason update will add plenty of items from Black Ops 6. This includes the Shock Charge tactical equipment, Impact and Thermal lethal equipment, and the Tactical Insertion field upgrade.Several Black Ops 6 scorestreaks are also included with the update:Archangel LauncherCombat BowDeath MachineDreadnoughtGrim ReaperSAM TurretStrategic BomberWar MachineZombiesSeason 1 adds a brand-new Zombies map called Astra Malorum, which takes the Zombies crew to a skull-shaped rock in space to fight zombies. The map introduces a new robot enemy called O.S.C.A.R. and a new LGM-1 Wonder Weapon, which shoots UFO-shaped projectiles.In addition to Astra Malorum, Season 1 includes the smaller survival maps for Exit 115 and Zarya Cosmodrome. Directed mode also arrives for Ashes of the Damned, which will allow players to have assistance with completing the story quest for this map.The popular Mule Kick perk returns in Black Ops 7 Zombies. The Shatter Blast, Tesla Storm, Mr Peeks, and Frost Blast field upgrades return from Black Ops 6.EndgameSeason content is also included for the game's Endgame campaign mode. There are new world events coming to Avalon with the big update, including the Zombie T-Rex boss from Black Ops 6 Zombies, the iconic Origins robot from Black Ops 2 Zombies, and one that requires players to take down a powerful VTOL warship.WarzoneSeason 1 adds the Haven's Hollow resurgence map for warzone. Haven's Hollow is set in the same town as Black Ops 6's Zombies mode, but this version of Liberty Falls is designed pre-outbreak.Verdansk remains as Warzone's big map for battle royale. The Season 1 update will add two POIs: Factory and Signal Station. Factory is a large factory-style building next to Superstore, and it's a very forgettable location. Signal Station is a little more interesting as it offers objectives you can complete in order to get rewarded with extra intel.Players can expect Black Ops 7's weapon and attachment pool to arrive, and Warzone perk changes will be included in the big update.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's coming up to a decade since Nintendo released Star Fox Zero for the Wii U in 2016. But if Nintendo won't get around to it, someone else has something very similar. Giles Goddard--one of the programmers of the original Star Fox--is working on Wild Blue Skies, a new on-rails sky shooter that looks and feels a lot like his former franchise.IGN debuted the new gameplay video for Wild Blue Skies, which covers the entirety of the second stage, Hurricane. It's enough to give you Star Fox 64 flashbacks as Bowie Stray, an anthropomorphic pilot dog, leads his squadron--Chuck, Roe, and Thorne--into battle during a raging storm. And it gives us enough of the new team's personalities that we can say Thorne is definitely the Slippy Toad of this group.          Goddard and his team at Chuhai Labs keep up the banter between Bowie and his group throughout the stage. And when Boss--that is his name--shows up to fight them at the end of the level, even he gets in on the chatter. The final version of the game will feature multiple biomes for the team to fly over, and Bowie can already do a Fox McCloud-style barrel roll.Wild Blue Skies, formerly known as Wild Blue, is being published by Humble Games, and it's currently only planned to be released on PC through Steam, though there's no confirmed release date as yet. It's also not the only Star Fox tribute game on Steam. Whisker Squadron: Survivor was released in its final version on Steam earlier this year.Although the Star Fox franchise is currently dormant, comedian Adam Conover has revealed that Nintendo was planning to team up with his former employer, CollegeHumor, for a Star Fox stop-motion animated series. That series, and a proposed live-action Legend of Zelda show on Netflix, fell apart after the projects were leaked, according to Conover.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Anime is real in Assassin's Creed Shadows' version of feudal Japan, with the game's latest free title update introducing a quest based on Attack on Titan. Players only have a limited time to experience the eerie Crystal Cave and discover its secrets, however, as the AoT quest is only available from November 25 to December 22.The new mission brings protagonists Naoe and Yasuke to the mysterious Crystal Cave, where dark experiments threaten to unleash a new type of threat on feudal Japan. Explore the cave's depths and stop a mysterious cult from turning their kidnapped Titan-Shifter into a major problem.          The new quest is available to all players who have unlocked Yasuke as a playable character, and can be unlocked by talking to quest-giver Ada in the Yamashiro region, North of Hanazo Tower. Players will be able to loot new cosmetics for their hideout throughout the quest, and will be rewarded upon completion with a new crystal katana for Naoe.The other Attack on Titan cosmetics, including a Mikasa-themed outfit for Naoe, a Titan-themed armor for Yasuke, a Survey Corps mount, and more weapons, will be available to purchase in the in-game store.The collaboration and its associated quest will only be available for a limited time, so players only have until December 22 to play through the new quest and unlock its cosmetics.The AoT collab is dropping as part of AC Shadows' latest title update, which is also bringing a handful of balance tweaks and bug fixes, along with a new story quest called A Puzzlement. In contrast to the dramatic AoT quest, A Puzzlement is meant as a light-hearted story moment, asking players to discover who would win in a fight between Yasuke and Naoe, and challenging them to open a puzzling door.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

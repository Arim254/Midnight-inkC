Your journey throughout the Arcadia system will eventually come to a close. Your allies, rivals, and even some foes-turned-friends will be there at the culmination of your adventure. Once you make a final crucial decision, there's really no going back. Our guide has all the details for you but, given the topic at hand, do expect major spoilers ahead.Sins of the Past on the Precipice of the Future finaleThe finale mission in the game is called \"Sins of the Past on the Precipice of the Future.\" It takes place aboard a reconstructed Horizon Point Station, the very same place where you began the campaign dozens of hours prior. More rifts have erupted all over the Arcadia system, and it's up to you to save humanity's far-flung colony. The endings all follow a certain theme: Who gets to sacrifice themselves to end the threat of the rifts?The commander/player characterA companionAugustine de Vries if you spared herConsul Emory Thoreau--i.e. the final boss--if you can convince himEveryoneNote 1: If you want to see all or most of the potential endings in the game, keep a backup save just before entering the Consul's chamber aboard the Providence.Note 2: There's no New Game Plus or a means of continuing the campaign after the end credits roll.Meeting Consul Emory ThoreauWhen discussing all endings in The Outer Worlds 2, it's worth knowing that the finale branches out into a couple of outcomes based on how you interact with the Consul aboard his ship known as the Providence:The encounter starts with a fairly length back-and-forth where you attempt to dissuade the Consul from his plans. We'll have all the details for you later in our guide, but it is possible to convince the Consul to sacrifice himself instead. This requires you to have all the necessary information, as well as a maxed out--i.e. level 20--Speech skill.Alternatively, if you're out of options or you want to finish off your foe, then you can attack the Consul.How to defeat the ConsulIf you prefer a more violent route, you can go ahead and attack the Consul once the dialogue options appear:Thoreau is surrounded by other Protectorate goons. Several enemies will also periodically appear via rifts and reinforcement pods.Prior to reaching this area, you can enter a hidden passageway in one of the side rooms if you have Hack 20. At the very top of the small nook, there's a lever that lets you disable the turret.Depending on how you handled the Auntie's Choice vs. Order dilemma, a faction leader might help you during this battle. For instance, we negotiated a peace between both factions and we found a mech body for Auntie Cleo. This caused her to join the fray during this segment of the finale.If you spared Augustine de Vries midway through the campaign, then she'll also aid you here.Killing the Consul leads to various endings in The Outer Worlds 2. You'll be able to sacrifice companions or the Commander--or everyone in the colony--to seal people's fates.Ending 1: Sacrifice everyone / sacrifice all of humanityPerhaps the worst ending that you can get involves sacrificing the entire Arcadia colony. After killing the Consul and interacting with the ship's controls, an NPC--i.e. Auntie Cleo if you sided with her faction or you mediated peace--will tell you that you can give humanity a chance. Reply with:\"You're not going anywhere. If I have to die, I'm taking you all with me.\"\"Humanity has proven that we're too stupid to live. We need to be put out of our misery.\"There's only one ending slide here, telling you that the rift destabilizations continued to spread. Naturally, this meant the eradication of all life in the galaxy.Ending 2: Sacrifice de VriesIf you spared Augustine de Vries during \"Fiends in High Places,\" she'll reappear during the finale:Investigate her ship near the initial area in Horizon Point Station.Then, at the halfway point where several automechs show up, you'll see a facility to your left. Inside, you'll meet de Vries, along with a rift-displaced Helen Pascal.When you confront the Consul, de Vries will be there to help you.Upon interacting with the ship's controls, de Vries will tell you her intention to sacrifice herself. It's mentioned that she didn't want to live with her guilt any longer.Ending 3: Sacrifice yourselfThe process to get this ending in The Outer Worlds 2 is similar to the above, assuming you killed the Consul during the finale. Choose this option: \"I won't ask anyone to die in my stead. I'll fly the ship.\"Alone, the Commander sacrifices themselves to stabilize the rift.If you spared de Vries, then she'll join the Commander, too.Ending 4: Sacrifice a companionAlternatively, you can have a companion finish the job at the cost of their own life:There are Speech checks--i.e. level 18 to 20--that you can select. A companion will then accept their duty voluntarily.If you're unable to pass these Speech checks, you can opt to force a companion to sacrifice themselves against their will.Ending 5: Sacrifice the ConsulYou can also make the Consul sacrifice himself via dialogue choices, allowing you to skip the final boss fight in its entirety. This is generally considered as the best ending in The Outer Worlds 2.Neither your character nor any companion needs to die. However, if you spared de Vries, she'll still voluntarily join the Consul for this last journey.To get this ending, you need to meet the following conditions:Speech 20 is absolutely required as it's the last dialogue choice that appears.You must have discovered various contextual clues and key information throughout the campaign, enough to shatter the Consul's confidence.Here are some examples of important information:Knowing that the Matriarch didn't invent the Skip Drives.Finding the Sovereign in a vegetative state in Placid Waters Wellnitarium.Completing Tristan's personal quests and bringing him for the finale, so he can tell the Consul what the Arbiters truly think of him.Bringing Marisol and/or Aza along to gain additional reply options.Getting the Rift Modulator Schematics in the Providence's Science Deck.Having the Brilliant trait or Observation 13 for one dialogue response.Reading the terminal logs and journal entries in Horizon Point Station and the Providence.At the very last segment, there's the aforementioned Speech 20 check: \"What about faith, Consul? If your people wish to preserve the Protectorate, they will find a way.\" This leads to the Consul deciding to sacrifice himself.Outcomes: Locations and questsAs long as you didn't pick the ending to sacrifice all of humanity/all life in the galaxy, you should see more ending slides. The first batch details what happened to various places that you've visited in Arcadia. Here are some examples:The fate of Fairfield and/or Wesport based on where you crashed the Vox Relay.Being able to complete the tasks in Westport, which is somewhat related to the quests from the Milverstreet vs. Kaur segment.If you spared certain bosses, such as Victor Clemens in the N-Ray Range.Outcomes: Companion fatesNaturally, The Outer Worlds 2 endings also show the fates of the recruitable companions. These are related to (a) the personal quests that unlocked their mod kits, and (b) their disposition based on how you've interacted with them during those quests.A good example is how Inez views the grafting program based on the biomechanical implants she received and the manner in which you concluded her arc.Tristan's sense of justice and whether he'd become more lenient at interpreting the law.Marisol rejecting violent means of eliminating her targets based on how you spoke with her.Aza becoming the leader of the Glorious Dawn and disbanding it outright.Outcomes: FactionsAnd, of course, we'd be remiss if we didn't mention how your actions shaped the fates of factions in Arcadia, too. Perhaps the most notable outcomes pertain to Auntie's Choice and the Order of the Ascendant:If you were able to negotiate a peace, then you'd learn how the two organizations continued their partnership.If you found a mechanical body for Auntie Cleo, you'll know that she began to appear more frequently in public.There's also another outcome concerning Ruth Basar, the leader of the Order, and how she perished in the Archive when she tried to access it. Unfortunately, we're unable to confirm if there's a way for her to survive.In any case, that does it for our guide on all endings in The Outer Worlds 2. All your choices have consequences and, if you didn't like these conclusions, then perhaps it's time to start another run.Black market smugglers? Autocratic regimes? Rampaging Raptidons? Invisible cultists that can only be seen if you wear special goggles? These shenanigans need not cause any alarm because we've got you covered in our The Outer Worlds 2 guides hub.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                If you've received an Arc Raiders quest called Power Out and aren't quite sure where you need to go to get it done, you've come to the right place. This may be one of the game's most basic quests, but as with many of its outings, the act of getting there and getting back out can be more challenging than anything. So, we'll share the exact location of the quest below so that you can take some of the guesswork out, allowing you to focus on making the magic happen.You won't need to extract to complete Power Out, but you may potentially be making quite a trek to reach the quest location. It's not a bad idea to toss on a combat-focused augment with a good gun and shield, as well as plenty of ammo and healing items to ensure you're prepared to take on anyone standing in your way.When you're ready to tackle Power Out, follow the steps below.How to complete the Power Out quest on SpaceportThe first step to completing Power Out is to head all the way south on Spaceport to find the Electrical Substation. Depending on where you spawn on the map, this could be quite a trek, so while the area itself is pretty tame, don't be shocked to run into trouble on the way there.Electrical Substation locationOnce you arrive, you'll be prompted to find signs of an engineer who has gone missing, which is very easy to find. Identify the electrical box below.Electrical boxWhile looking at the electrical box, turn left and spot the engineer's bag a few steps away. Interact with it, take the item within, then return to the electrical box. Interact with the electrical box to place the item inside. Turn on the power to complete the quest.With the quest complete, your next goal is to extract. Unfortunately, due to being so far south on the map, you're going to have to walk quite a way to get to an elevator. Your choices are the South Elevator to the northwest or the East Elevator to the northeast, so make sure you're reloaded and healed up, then set off. We'll be rooting for your survival.For more on Arc Raiders, check out our full quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The time of Halo: Infinite is coming to a close. Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.In a message posted to the official Halo site, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on \"multiple Halo titles in development.\" This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been saying for over a year now that there are multiple new Halo games in development.\"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us,\" reads the statement. \"While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.\"The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of the original Halo that will bring the franchise to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about a live-service Halo game, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed some light on the Halo MMO from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the Halo remake \"warms my heart,\" while another former Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The launch of Hytale in early access yesterday saw over 400,000 people watching the game on Twitch. There is also speculation that the Minecraft-inspired sandbox game has reached almost 3 million sales, though there's confusion around that number currently.PC Gamer reported on the Hytale's popularity on Twitch, citing 420,000 viewers on January 13. At the time of publication, Hytale has around 112,000 viewers on Twitch, putting it only behind games like League of Legends and Grand Theft Auto V. In addition, a massive rumored concurrent-players for Hytale has been making the rounds, though the figure--2.8 million--seems too good to be true. It all stems from a stream posted by Hytale News on YouTube. GameSpot has reached out to developer Hypixel Studios about the statistic.Keep in mind PUBG holds the Steam record for most concurrent players with over 3.2 million people in January 2018. So, it's seemingly hard to believe Hytale is close to that achievement within 24 hours of release, especially considering you need to download the game from the Hytale website.A Hytale blog post has stated \"demand has exceeded our expectations,\" reinforcing the strong start for the game. That would imply sales have topped 1 million copies because Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme previously posted on X that \"we expect over 1 million players on the early-access release day.\"Hytale was canceled by Riot Games in June 2025, before being resurrected in November by Hypixel Studios. The game actually started development over a decade ago.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Cygames, the developer and publisher behind the popular series of Granblue Fantasy video games, just opened an AI-focused studio. In response to the backlash toward this announcement, Cygames put out a message trying to assuage players' fears about generative AI's use in its games. The message isn't very reassuring, though.This kerfuffle started on January 9, when a post on Cygames' Japanese website revealed that Cygames AI Studio had been established. The announcement explains that this new studio will research and develop its own models and provide services to others while drawing on Cygames' game development history and expertise.The use of artificial intelligence, specifically generative AI, has become a very hot-button issue in the video game industry as of late. Games like Arc Raiders and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 have faced backlash over their use of the technology, and each new AI-related gaming announcement online usually draws the ire of fans.This announcement in particular made the fans of Granblue and Umamusume: Pretty Derby nervous, as many don't want to see generative AI in their favorite games. In response, Cygames released the following message on X, hoping to quell player fears:The biggest takeaways from the statement are that generative AI art isn't currently being used in Cygames' titles, and that the company \"won't implement generative AI into our products without prior notice.\"While Cygames goes on to say it wants to respect the \"dignity, passion, and heart of the creators and artists who act as the architects of gaming culture,\" that message wasn't exactly reassuring. Many don't just want a warning over the use of generative AI, but for it to not be used at all.The establishment of Cygames AI Studio and this message definitely mean players should keep a close eye on Cygames' releases going forward to see whether or not they'll use generative AI.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Arcade Edition will be added to the Apple Arcade game catalog on February 5 alongside a smattering of other new games. This new version of the game will be playable on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and there does not appear to be plans for an Android port at this time.Released last February for PC and consoles, Civilization 7 is a 4X strategy game where players guide a civilization through several different ages of history. Like the mobile port of Civilization 6, Civilization 7 Arcade Edition's content is comparable to the PC and console versions of the game, so this isn't some sort of radically inferior spin-off.The most novel thing about Civilization 7 Arcade Edition is that its UI has been specifically tailored to support touch controls on iPhone and iPad. Currently, the closest you can get to that is using the touchscreen for your cursor on a PC handheld or Nintendo Switch 2.Sid Meier's Civilization VII Arcade EditionThis port was developed by Behaviour Interactive, the studio behind Dead by Daylight. It's not the company's first mobile game, as Behaviour Interactive previously developed games like Worms Across Worlds and Fallout Shelter.Although it's certainly the most notable game coming to Apple Arcade in the coming weeks, Civilization 7 Arcade Edition isn't the only title coming to Apple's gaming subscription service. The blog post announcing the port highlights several other games and events coming to Apple Arcade soon.On February 5, Apple Arcade will also add the retro game collection Retrocade, the rhythm game Felicity's Door, and a microtransaction-and-ad-free version of I Love Hue Too. A Paddington-themed event is also coming to Apple Arcade's Crayola Create and Play+ on January 22, if that's something that tickles your fancy.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

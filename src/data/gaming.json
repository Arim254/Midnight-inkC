    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Baldur's Gate 3's cast has been widely acclaimed since the game's release, from Neil Newbon's award-winning role as Astarion to Tim Downie (of Paddington fame) as Gale. But how would the characters--no, not the actors--do if they were auditioning for a different role in the game? We thought that sounded like a great idea, so we got some of the fan-favorite cast together and, potentially under duress, had them audition for new roles.\"I'm Gale of Waterdeep, and I am going to be reading for the role of Lae … of Lae'zel,\" Downie said. \"I smell their blood on you, still! I smell your sweat!\"Given that Gale is quite polite and a cat dad, it's tough to imagine him ever having Lae'zel's bloodlust, not to mention her sexual forwardness. That being said, we would very much like an entire game where that is exactly what we get.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Astarion as Shadowheart? BG3 Cast Tries New Roles!\n      \nNeil Newbon's Astarion, meanwhile, read for the role of Shadowheart, with Jennifer English standing by his side and physically forcing him to kneel: Kneel Newbon. Astarion seemed less than thrilled with the situation.\"I am auditioning for the role of Shadowheart, under no duress … of my own free … free will,\" he said, while looking up at English to make sure he hadn't done something wrong.One of the best was Wyll actor Theo Solomon's turn as Minsc--a ranger who, if he were a cat, would definitely be orange.\"No, Boo! The druid did not beat Minsc at arm wrestling! It is not fair match!\" Solomon said. \"And he turned into an Owlbear midway through, and there was grease on the tree stump!\"Boo is, of course, Minsc's \"miniature giant space hamster\" who is definitely not just a regular hamster that gets swapped out every few years when the last one dies.Jennifer English's turn as Astarion and his meme-worthy \"full concentrated power of the sun\" line--which may have been a Megamind Easter egg--just might be our favorite line-reading. Shadowheart, who is not a vampire, also has much less to fear about the sun itself, so her recasting as Astarion might make the game a little easier!Baldur's Gate 3 was GameSpot's GOTY for 2023. Larian Studios has revealed it will not be making a sequel, but IP-owner Hasbro has big plans for future Dungeons & Dragons games.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The games rarely touch on it, but hidden within short bursts of text within the Pokédex live haunting tales of death, reincarnation, kidnapping, and worse.Pokédex entries differ from game to game for many of the same Pokémon. Something in the Scarlet Pokédex may be completely different than the ones in the classic games. Either way, there is some horrific stuff packed in there.We’ve combed through hundreds of entries across the series, from classic Red and Blue to the latest releases, to uncover the pocket monsters you might want to avoid--unless you’re looking for a reason to never sleep again.HypnoHypno is a mainstay of the Pokémon franchise, and yet it is still one of the weirdest creatures of the hundreds that have come after. The design is just a man with a beard. Worse, a naked man with a beard. One that, according to this specific entry from multiple games including FireRed, kidnapped a child..JellicentLike other jellyfish, Jellicent looks harmless and colorful on the outside. The reality is that this Pokémon has been the reason for hundreds of deaths at sea.Mega MetagrossThe entries for a number of mega Pokémon are particularly brutal. The transformations they go through cause them enormous amounts of pain. Metagross is particularly gruesome as it would rather commit suicide than lose a fight.Meostic If Meostic has enough power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust, what will happen to a trainer--more often than not a child–tries to creep up on it to catch it? The result would be horrifying.HattereneTall tales from a variety of cultures--whether it be Bulgaria or Mexico--warn of a forest witch that stalks the trees of the woods outside the village. Hatterene is that witch living in a forest where living things go to die.AraquanidNature is beautiful and horrifying, as evidenced by the sight of an Araquanid headbutting its prey and then drowning it in front of your terrified tour group.BanetteWhat would a Pokemon version of Toy Story look like? According to the Pokedex, it'd be horrifying and abduction by demonic haunted doll would be a very common cause of death in that world. As The Simpsons reminded us, always make certain that your doll is set to good instead of evil.BasculegionAs if a river full of Magikarp wasn't bad enough, the Sinnoh region also has legions of fish powered by the vengeful spirits of their fallen comrades.BewearThere's nothing better than a firm hug, and the world of Pokemon, nothing deadlier than an embrace from the freakishly powerful Bewear. Adorable and unstoppable, the tragic Bewear can easily be spotted by the trail of crushed spines left behind in its affectionate wake. CuboneThe original \"that's messed up man\" of Pokemon, Cubone's tale is so hauntingly sad that it's likely the source inspiration of emo-rock from the mid-2000s. DarkraiSure it's a defense mechanism, but the Nightmare on Elm Street Pokemon is an absolute scourge to anyone encountering it and the leading cause of insomnia in the Sinnoh region. DrifloonMore recent Pokedex entries have tried to amend Drifloon's reputation for being a child-abducting monster, but real Pokemon fans know just how dangerous this inflatable ghost really is. Just remember, if you pop a Drifloon, the escaping sound you hear will be its screaming spirit. DuskullOn the plus side, at least you can use Duskull to see who's on Santa's naughty list. DusknoirA few evolutions later, and the appearance of a Dusknoir is a sign that you're about to kick the bucket. Unless you're armed with a Psychic-type that is, which will give you a fighting chance against death's emissary.FroslassGrand Designs given a Pokemon spin. Froslass may be responsible for the chilliest of missing persons reports, but at least it has style.GengarLike most Ghost-type Pokemon, Gengar is always ready to cause some mischief. Judging by the Pokedex excerpt that has accepted the finality of being attacked by one, Gengar is perhaps too good at being the apex predator of stalking in Pokemon.GliscorA Pokemon that looks like it was designed by Tim Burton, Gliscor is out for blood and wants you to know that it's going to have fun feeding on whatever it finds out in the tall grass.GolbatWhat's disturbing here is that there are Pokemon out there who have a taste for blood after taking on Golbats that have gorged themselves on some of the ol' crimson claret. Either scenario is horrifying to think of.GorebyssGorebyss are graceful, beautiful, and elegant creatures who'll gladly grab a snack in the most terrifying way possible. Another reminder that nature can be creatively cruel. GourgeistThere's nothing more disturbing than a sentient ghost-pumpkin wanting to cause you misery and taking delight in it with some off-key singing. Just look at American Idol auditions to get an idea of this audio torture.GyaradosThis is just a reminder that the oceans are filled with millions Magikarp who are just one bad day away from leveling the entire planet with their unrelenting rage.HonchkrowConsidering that Pokemon has defined Honchkrow as a crafty scavenger, it's only a matter of time until they band together to form an unstoppable Murkrow gang. HoundoomThey may look like the ultimate mascots for death metal bands, but running afoul of a Houndoom might just sentence you to a lifetime of infinite pain. MimikyuAccording to gruesome corpses, the only thing that Mimikyu is hiding under its shroud is pain and misery. PalossandEver wondered what would happen if Mortal Kombat's Shang Tsung was reincarnated as a sandcastle? Well know you know, and you can't un-know it.ParasectIf there was any doubt as to how evil mushrooms really are, look no further than the Parasects who are slowly being used to create a Last of Us fungal apocalypse.PhantumpPhantump's are also spookier than the average Ghost-type, but at least your picnic baskets are safe.TentacruelJellyfish, which are scientifically categorized as gross ocean monsters, are thankfully few and far between. As the Pokemon games like to remind us though, not only are Tentacruel plentiful in the oceans surrounding the various regions of the franchise, but an army if them is roaming the ocean at any given time. Waiting. Watching. Ready to pounce when the signal is finally given. VespiquenIf Nicolas Cage is terrified of them, then you have every right to fear Pokemon's giant bees which apparently build hives out of honey and murdered Zigzagoon. YamaskThat's right, Yamask will haunt you with a replica of its own face and won't stop screaming about it. Probably best to not let your kids catch one in the wild.     \n  \n                      "

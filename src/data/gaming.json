    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Amazon Games has announced that the MMO New World: Aeternum will go offline at the end of January 2027. The announcement isn't a total surprise, though, as some theorized this would be the case after the developer announced that the MMO would get no more new content after the Nighthaven seasonal update last year. In October 2025, Amazon cut more jobs at its gaming division that specifically impacted the MMO teams.Aeternum's final day on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S is January 31, 2027. As of today, January 15, the game is being delisted. Everyone who has the game can keep playing, and Amazon announced that the Nighthaven event is being extended until the eventual shutdown.\"We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community,\" the developer wrote in the announcement.New World launched in September 2021 for PC and came to consoles in October 2024. The game had a strong start, reaching a peak of more than 900,000 concurrent users. The game's playerbase on Steam ticked up with new updates, but has fallen down to about 1,100 concurrent players on Steam.Amazon also clarified that it will keep selling microtransactions for New World until July 19, 2026, after which the Marks of Fortune currency will be removed from sale, along with all other items. Refunds will not be provided to people who have a balance of Marks of Fortune.While New World will not get any more new content, Amazon said it will monitor the game for \"bugs and performance to ensure the game runs smoothly as things wind down.\"Amazon has struggled with games in recent years. Amazon's free-to-play shooter Crucible stalled and was eventually canceled, while the company was making a Lord of the Rings MMO until a supposed contract dispute ended things. Amazon also had a game in the works called Breakaway that was canceled.A report from Bloomberg documented an apparent pattern of mismanagement at Amazon's video game division. In 2021, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pledged a commitment to gaming, but that was years ago. The company isn't abandoning games altogether, of course, as it's publishing Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis and Tomb Raider: Catalyst.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

With the company having launched its own mobile store, it has also started a second free games program on iOS and Android devices, kicking things off with a curated library of titles and weekly freebies. The app also features mobile versions of Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe.To access these games you will need to create a free Epic account and install the free Epic Games Store mobile app and log in with your account, but once you do, you can start claiming your free games every Thursday through it. One other thing to note is that Android users can access the app via Android-based emulation devices like Retroid Pocket, as they aren't limited to just smartphone and tablets.For now, only iOS users in the European Union can install the app, but the app is available worldwide to Android device users and they have a wider selection of games to choose from in comparison. Like its PC counterpart, you'll have one week to grab each game that's offered. Here's a closer look at what you can grab this week, and what the current mobile games library has to offer.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The boss of digital PC storefront GOG has weighed in on the conversation around Anthem's demise, saying that there may be a future in which fewer games could be developed and published if regulators demand that creators keep them alive forever.Speaking to Eurogamer on January 15 after Anthem was laid to rest, GOG's managing director, Maciej Gołębiewski, said it's good that the discussion around game preservation is happening once again, but that the conversation gets a little tricky when talking about games that were designed as online-only experiences.\"There is a broader discussion to be had within the industry of what does an end-of-life cycle look like in games--what is a fair end-of-life cycle for a game?\" he said. \"Should it just be buried and killed and no one can access it any more, and people who spent five or seven years working on it cannot really look at their creation any more because the service turned off? There is a very interesting and very complicated discussion that Stop Killing Games probably kick-started out of frustration.\"Referencing the lobbying group Stop Killing Games, which was formed in April 2024 in response to The Crew's delisting, Gołębiewski said regulation sounds like a good idea in the short term, but any statutes around game preservation--particularly regarding live-service games, which are becoming the norm these days--could potentially have adverse effects in the long term.\"We want to make games live forever,\" he said. \"At the same time, if we put too many barriers on game creators and what the end-of-life cycle looks like, we might get fewer games, because people will be scared of, 'Okay, now I need to put up the funds to create it, promote it, and then upkeep it for 10 years, 20 years, because the regulator said so.' That might in turn cause there to be fewer cool games for gamers. I don't have the perfect answer yet, but it's good that the discussion is taking place.\"As of January 12, developer BioWare's pretty-cool-but-ill-fated Iron Man-esque action-RPG is no longer playable. With Anthem being an online-only multiplayer game, you can't boot up and fly around in the world of Coda now that publisher EA has pulled the server's plug. It's a bummer of a situation, and a blatant reminder that no game lasts forever, something GameSpot examined in a July 2025 feature when Ubisoft took the online racer The Crew permanently off the track in March 2024.Gołębiewski's comments come as Amazon announced its 2021 MMORPG New World: Aeternum will get Thanos snapped from all platforms on January 31, 2027. And if I can get personal for a second, this further heightens my fears that Full Circle's 2025 skating sim Skate could get pulled offline forever in some future as well. Skate is still doing relatively well--with a consistent player count of approximately 3,500, according to player tracker SteamDB--but you can't help but wonder just how long until Electronic Arts decides to hang the skateboard up.In the end, as Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said in a July 2025 shareholders meeting about The Crew: \"You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. Support for all games cannot last forever.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

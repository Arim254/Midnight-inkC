    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                It's been a very good year for indie titles on Steam, even in the aftermath of Hollow Knight: Silksong's blockbuster success. Last week, Escape From Duckov somehow briefly outgunned Battlefield 6. Now, another indie game, RV There Yet, has raced past 1.3 million sales in a single week.          RV There Yet is the debut game of Nuggets Entertainment, and up to four players can join this co-op experience as they get behind the wheel of an RV home while attempting a very perilous side route through Mabutts Valley. The goal of the game is to get the RV past obstacles that it would ordinarily be unable to traverse. To pull that off, players will have to leave the RV and creatively use a winch and other tools to get by. As seen in the trailer above, some of those attempts can end very badly. This band of bros also has to deal with wildlife and snakes, which is why an EpiPen is one of their primary tools.According to SteamDB, RV There Yet had over 100,000 concurrent players in its first week. Nuggets Entertainment community manager Jace Varlet subsequently posted the following video, in which he thanks players on behalf of the team. He also explains why the game wasn't marked as \"early access.\"          In short, Nuggets Entertainment didn't expect this game to take off the way it did, and the studio just wanted to finish the title by its internally agreed-upon release date. There weren't originally any plans to add more content to RV There Yet, but that may soon change. Meanwhile, Varlet acknowledged that there are some bugs in the game and he pledged that they will be fixed.There aren't any current plans for RV There Yet to make the leap to consoles, but it's currently on sale on Steam for $7.19 before reverting to its regular price of $8 on October 28. Nuggets has also been concurrently developing another title called Among the Wild, but it just isn't ready for release yet.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

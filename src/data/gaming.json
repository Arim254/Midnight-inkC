Doster\n   on December 17, 2025 at 11:00AM PST\n              \n          \n                Season 1 of Black Ops 7 and Warzone is currently underway, and now Activision has announced Call of Duty's crossover with Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show for the midseason update.Activision released a very brief teaser clip for Black Ops 7 and Warzone to reveal the operator skins for this upcoming crossover. While you can't see the full details of the operator skins, the silhouettes clearly hint at operators for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus in his power armor. Call of Duty's big IP collaborations also usually come packed with events for players to participate in. It's uncertain if the skins will be included in an event pass or as shop bundles for purchase.Call of Duty's paid event passes are usually 1,100 CoD Points ($10) and operator packs usually feature a price of 2,800 CoD Points ($25) for each bundle.This collaboration is well-timed with the debut of the Fallout TV show's second season, which began on December 16. This will be the first major collaboration to appear in Black Ops 7, as Activision cancelled plans for Call of Duty's Carry Forward program, preventing Black Ops 6 skins like Beavis and Butt-Head from joining the operator lineup for the game.Activision's initial statement said it understood that people want Call of Duty to be and feel \"immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded.\" However, the statement didn't confirm the future plans for operator skins, and the authenticity of the game seems to only apply for the launch window of Black Ops 7.Season 1's midseason update arrives sometime after the holidays. In addition to the Fallout operator skins, Call of Duty's Season 1 Reloaded update will also add more maps, modes, and challenges.Black Ops 7 currently features a free trial across all platforms. From now until December 22, players can access 20+ maps and experience the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. For Fallout fans, Fallout 76 is also free-to-play for a limited time on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.\n                                  \n        Where to buy\n      There are currently no available deals\n    GameSpot may get a commission from retail offers.  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Gaming continued to take most of the top spots, as fans spent more time in interactive worlds that are constantly updated, like Minecraft and Terraria. In film and TV, long-running franchises like Star Wars and Marvel stayed near the top thanks to new releases like Andor and Thunderbolts.The rankings were determined using Fandom's franchise factor score, which combines five things: worldbuilding, strong reviews, loyal fans, cultural impact, and consistency. It uses Fandom's large fan data to give a full picture of how popular and important a franchise is in entertainment and gaming.Anime also had a big year in large part because of high-profile films and celebrations. Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle brought huge attention as it moved the series toward its finale, while Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc kept momentum high between seasons. There was also the relative newcomer Dan Da Dan, which saw its second theatrical adaptation with Evil Eye.The rankings also show a shift away from single launch moments toward steady output. According to Fandom's study, Roblox's top placement reflects how fans now prefer platforms with constant updates and community-created content. Smaller Roblox games, such as Dandy’s World and Grow a Garden, ranked higher than well-established worlds like Minecraft and Disney by focusing on frequent events and active, niche communities.The same pattern appeared elsewhere with franchises such as Dungeons and Dragons and Cookie Run Kingdom performed well by releasing content regularly, showing that consistency mattered more than occasional peaks in attention.1.

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                For three decades, the Tekken series has brought players together as they control of some of the best fighters in the world. Now, a 92-year-old Japanese woman named Hisako Sakai has carved out her own legend in the King of the Iron Ring battles by winning a Tekken 8 tournament.As reported by Automaton, the tournament of senior citizen Tekken 8 players was put on by the Japanese eSports association Care. The mission statement of that organization is to \"create an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in eSports.\" Care has been running tournaments since 2019 while treating them like a major event with livestreaming and official commentators. A video from the event can be seen below.          Sakai made it all the way to the finals while playing as Claudio, when she went up against 74-year-old player Goro Sugiyama, who used Lili as his character. The match between Sakai and Sugiyama can be found two hours and 25 minutes into the video above. Despite the advantage of Sugiyama's relative youth, Sakai appears to have a superior button-mashing technique and enough mastery of the game to execute an effective path to victory.Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada recently announced his departure from Bandai Namco after three decades with the company. Harada is not retiring from the video game industry, and his farewell message indicated that he has taken into consideration the \"time I have left as a creator.\"Earlier this year, Harada expressed his desire to bring the Waffle House chain of restaurants into Tekken. There have been several viral videos of fights in Waffle House restaurants that have given the chain a reputation that it probably wants to shy away from. That may be why Waffle House turned down Harada's request.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

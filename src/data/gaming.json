This update introduces a new melee weapon and the icy winter variant of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State.In this guide, we'll show you how to unlock all the free and paid items in Battlefield 6's Winter Offensive event pass, including the new Nomad CX-12 ice climbing axe.Battlefield 6's Winter Offensive event pass is a bonus reward path separate from the game's Season 1 battle pass, but you'll still find it under the battle pass tab in the menus. This event pass includes 11 tiers of free and premium items to unlock, meaning you'll need to purchase the $10 Season 1 premium battle pass to earn them all.Just like the recent California Resistance event pass, you level up in the event by earning battle pass points, and this will level up alongside your active path in the Season 1 battle pass. Points are earned by completing weekly challenges and earning XP, and you reach a new reward tier for every 10 battle pass points you earn.The Winter Offensive event pass is available to complete between now and December 22. The full list of event rewards can be found below, including an operator skin, vehicle skin, and other winter-themed cosmetics. The skins are part of the premium rewards, but the Nomad CX-12 ice climbing axe is one of the free items you unlock.The full patch notes for the Winter Offensive update can be found here, which detail audio improvements and several quality-of-life updates."

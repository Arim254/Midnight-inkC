    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had a very strong showing in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii \"problem.\"Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.\"One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model,\" Lee told The Game Business. \"Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem.\"Lee was very complementary toward Nintendo in his follow-up remarks, but he added that the Wii's model of selling only a few games to certain members of its install base was \"not sustainable.\"\"It's very important that we set ourselves up to serve our customer continuously with new innovations,\" added Lee. \"That is how the whole system can sustain. But it started with Wii. We are standing on a giant’s shoulder.\"Nex Playground reportedly accounted for 14% of all console sales on Black Friday, finishing ahead of the Xbox family of systems.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The South Korean band Stray Kids is coming to Roblox today, and they'll be unleashing the SKZOO from now and through the weekend while promoting their new album, Do It. As seen in the clips below, Stray Kids' anthropomorphic avatars will be performing their songs in-game as virtual concerts.Stray Kids-related items are also hidden in four different Roblox experiences, with two items per game. Players can collect all eight items and bring them to the Block to watch Stray Kids perform and receive additional free items from the band. However, this event will only run until 10 AM PT/1 PM ET on Monday, December 22.In other Roblox-related news, the platform has been banned in Russia and accused of negatively impacting children, and apparently considers the dissemination of LGBTQIA+ content to be a crime. But Russia isn't alone with its accusations that Roblox hasn't done enough to protect kids from child exploitation and grooming. A June 2024 Bloomberg investigation reported that the platform is rampant with predators. More recently, Florida and Texas have sued Roblox over that issue.Last month, Roblox revealed new initiatives to keep children from talking to strangers, and limit their interactions to kids roughly their own age. Roblox CEO David Baszucki has \"categorically rejected\" the lawsuits' depiction of the platform's safety measures. He also said that Roblox has done \"an incredible job at innovating\" and added that it's \"constantly getting better\" at protecting children's ability to chat with each other in-game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Microsoft has embraced the ex-boxer meme for its latest Xbox advert, as the company continues with its \"this is an Xbox\" marketing campaign. Featuring a self-proclaimed ex-boxer, the bizarre advert also spotlighted the new dedicated hardware that recently joined the Xbox family, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X.          This year has seen Microsoft focus more on the idea of an Xbox ecosystem--rather than on the idea of dedicated Xbox hardware--as it continues work on its next-gen plans for the brand. Recently, Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald spoke about how Microsoft is looking to evolve the Xbox ecosystem across multiple devices in the future, hinting at multiple devices and options.\"So what we're really focused on is how do we evolve the Xbox ecosystem to allow players to play the games wherever you want to play them, while at the same time, we're continuing to build dedicated devices that are optimized for gaming, like the Xbox Ally or next-generation console,\" Ronald said in August.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has also suggested that the next Xbox could be more like a PC, and the company is once again partnering with AMD to help build its gaming hardware. While Microsoft has rolled out some flashy marketing for its gaming division, the year has also been rocky for it due to layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures.A recent report says that Microsoft has also set astronomically high profit goals for its studios, and recent months have seen it once again raise the price of its Xbox consoles and Game Pass subscriptions.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's November 14 release date is unchanged, a spokesperson for Activision has confirmed amid rumors that the date is shifting forward.A spokesperson confirmed this to CharlieIntel. As a reminder, there is no early access for Black Ops 7, so the November 14 date is when the game becomes available to everyone on all platforms.          Rumors suggested Activision was going to move up Black Ops 7's release date amid a competitive landscape for FPS games. EA's Battlefield 6 launched on October 10 to big sales, and its new battle royale game, Redsec, came out on October 28. The PvPvE game Arc Raiders, meanwhile, debuted on October 30 to big numbers as well.Experts said prior to Battlefield 6's launch that Black Ops 7 should have no trouble beating Battlefield 6 when it comes to sales. People buy Call of Duty every year, even if they complain about it, and that tradition should continue with Black Ops 7, analysts have said.Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2024's Black Ops 6, and this is the first time ever that Activision is delivering Black Ops games in consecutive years. A developer working on Black Ops 7 has admitted that there is some level of concern about \"fatigue\" with two consecutive Black Ops games.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The Battle Bus dropped off Peely, Jonesy, Meowscles, and a couple of other Fortnite characters on to The Simpsons for the long-running show's opening couch gag. The crossover starts harmless enough. But then, things go awry for the Fortnite clan--especially the cute-looking banana.Peely slips trying to run away from the Simpsons, who pull out weapons to get the Fortnite characters to leave their couch. That misstep leads to a terrible fate for poor Peely. The Simpsons turn the character into a banana split, bringing a horrifying new meaning to Fortnite skin. The official Simpsons account on X shared a clip of the opening sequence from last night, November 2.The crossover is a reciprocation of Fortnite's recently launched Simpsons season. This is a huge collaboration that has replaced the game's normal island with a Springfield-inspired map that's cel-shadded and features locations like Moe's Tavern as well as the Qwik-E-Mart. There's even a Simpsons-specific Battle Pass. Players can earn skins based on Homer, Marge, and even Flounders.The start of The Simpsons season in Fortnite has seen a spike in player counts, as spotlighted by Shiina on X. The battle-royale game almost hit 2.7 million concurrent players, per Fortnite.gg. To put that number in perspective, that would put Fortnite at No. 2 all time for Steam concurrents--though the big caveat here is Fortnite is available across PC, consoles, and mobile devices. The player count also comes nowhere close to Fortnite's all-time recorded high, which was over 14 million concurrent players roughly a year ago.Looking ahead, Fortnite dataminers believe they've found evidence pointing to future collaborations with SpongeBob SquarePants and Harry Potter.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

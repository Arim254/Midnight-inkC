    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 21, 2025 at 3:10PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Fortnite's collaboration with the Netflix series Stranger Things gets its biggest drop yet this weekend with five new skins in the item shop and a branded takeover of the Blitz Royale mode.Blitz Royale, which has quick, five-minute rounds of battle royale on a tiny island, got an entirely new map on November 21. The new island features four named locations based on the town of Hawkins, Indiana, as well as a border right down the middle separating the normal world from locations that have been corrupted by the Upside Down--essentially giving the map a pair of distinct biomes, something that Blitz hasn't done before since its map is already so little.The map and the new item shop skins based on Vecna and the original four boys are the entirety of this takeover--there aren't any new Stranger Things weapons added to the loot pool or anything like that. That's fine, because between the ongoing Simpsons season and the imminent launch of Chapter 7, we've already got plenty of new mechanics to worry about.Scroll on for looks at the full new map and each of the named locations.As you can see, the island is split in half between the regular part in the west and the Upside Down part in the east, with each half getting two of the major locations. While the Upside Down half is always dark and spooky, the normal half of the island has the usual day/night cycle.Gnarly FarmsStranger SuburbsLibrary LandingHawkins HeightsHawkins Heights includes this movie theater sign and marquee teasing the Chapter 6 finale event that's taking place on Saturday, November 29. Fun fact: Despite the sign indicating otherwise, there's no movie theater on this map.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                During an investor presentation earlier today, Ubisoft showed off Teammates, a new R&D game experience that utilizes generative AI. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot also described the advent of generative AI in games as \"a revolution.\"\"Generative AI is as big a revolution for games as the shift to 3D,\" said Guillemot (via Game File). \"We are making great strides in applying Gen AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams... It's as big [of] a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D. And we have everything to lead on this front.\"Teammates was developed by the team behind Neo NPC. The company also said that the demo is meant to prove that \"generative AI-driven gameplay can shape a new generation of more interactive and engaging games.\"A screencap from Teammates.The game's prototype is currently being tested by a small number of players. Teammates is a first-person shooter, but its AI tools will supposedly let it adapt to voice commands from the player, allowing NPCs to dynamically respond in real-time.\"It's really about experimenting with entirely new ways of creating interactive stories,\" said the game's narrative director, Virginie Mosser. \"Our role is to give AI meaning, to narrativize it, ensuring logic doesn’t replace soul. We designed Teammates to leave space for player creativity, finding that balance between emotion and unpredictability.\"Teammates includes a companion character called Jaspar who is said to be able to help the player overcome obstacles and provide hints or strategies. In concept, that's not very different from other NPCs in numerous games. What supposedly makes Jaspar stand out is his ability to interact and respond directly to the player.The Teammates devs note that it has a specially made Application Programming Interface (API) that can utilize guardrails that shield players from AI-powered hallucinations and \"helps control its power to put it at the service of human creativity and play.\" The company also characterized Teammates as an experiment that \"serves both as a playable prototype and a testbed for the underlying technology.\"Ubisoft has stated that its new \"Creative Houses\" operating model will be unveiled in January 2026. Earlier this week, Ubisoft apologized to players for including AI artwork in Anno 117: Pax Romana. The replacement image looks like the AI version, minus a few people with extra fingers or distorted faces.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this year, Hytale was canceled after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and purchased all of the rights for Hytale from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale will retail for $20. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.\"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible,\" wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. \"I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast.\"Collins-Laflamme added that he wants to attract as many players as possible, even during rough economic times. Hypixel has also released a post detailing how far along the modding feature is. The short answer is there's still a lot of work to be done. For now, Hytale doesn't have a release date, but Collins-Laflamme has implied that the game's early-access period will begin relatively soon.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

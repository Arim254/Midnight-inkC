    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Following its decision to sue Tencent for creating a \"slavish clone\" of its Horizon games, Light of Motiram, Sony has concluded its legal battle with the company. The game is no longer listed on Steam or the Epic Games Store, and the court case has been dismissed.That's according to new court documents filed earlier this week, and Tencent added that it has reached a \"confidential settlement\" with Sony Interactive Entertainment. \"SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter,\" head of communications for Tencent Americas, Sean Durkin, said to The Verge.Announced last year, Light of Motiram was quickly compared to Sony's Horizon series as it featured a very similar art direction and tone to the post-apocalyptic sci-fi series developed by Guerrilla Games. Both games featured vibrant environments and animal-like robots, and Sony was quick to file a lawsuit. Sony and Tencent eventually began discussions to resolve the dispute, with Sony demanding that Tencent pause all public promotion or testing for Light of Motiram.Tencent allegedly pitched Sony a Horizon game set in Asia, which was turned down, and the company later argued that Sony's lawsuit was an attempt to establish a monopoly on Horizon-like games. Sony, in turn, accused Tencent of playing a legal shell game to avoid facing the repercussions of allegedly infringing on its intellectual property.While it looks like Light of Motiram may be no more, a Horizon mobile game is currently in development. Recently, Sony and NCSoft announced a new MMORPG called Horizon Steel Frontiers for both mobile devices and PC.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Developer Santa Ragione is reporting that its controversial indie horror game Horses sold 18,000 copies in two weeks. That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game.According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game.\"This result is not enough to begin production on a new game,\" reads the statement. \"The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love.\"          It's been an uphill battle for Santa Ragione and Horses. The studio recently revealed that its title had been banned by Steam in 2023 without explanation. Subsequently, Horses was also banned by Epic Games Store and Humble Bundle just before its release. The cancellation of Horses by three of the major PC game distributors comes after a recent effort to target adult-oriented games on storefronts like Steam and Itch. There is definitely material meant for mature audiences in Horses, but the development team is calling for more transparency in the industry after it says it wasn't given a chance to make any changes to Horses in order for it to be released on Steam.\"We also want to emphasize that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce,\" wrote Santa Ragione's spokesperson. \"For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly. We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases.\"Horses is now available for $5 on GOG, and Itch.io.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The point is to take that ore to the titular forge and use it to craft various items. You are able to get weapons and armor by crafting with the ore at these forge locations in Stonewake’s Cross and the Forgotten Kingdom.Of course, the rarer the ore, the better chances you’ll get a high-quality or even exclusive item. You can then take the items you have crafted using your ore and sell them or even equip them to have better stats to do better against the various enemies in the world. This is why it is vital that you know where to find specific ore, so you are always improving your gear and gaining even more money.There is so much to see and do in Roblox The Forge beyond the overwhelming number of available ores. You should find out the current codes available in The Forge, so you don’t miss out on any free goodies and the tier list for what items are most worth using.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

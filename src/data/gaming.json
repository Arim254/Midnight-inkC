    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Microsoft has announced a new partnership to Hisense to bring the Xbox app to TVs that run on the company's TV operating system, V (formerly known as VIDAA).In essence, the big takeaway here is that people will soon be able to play Xbox games in yet another place, without needing to own an actual physical Xbox. This is possible through Xbox Cloud Gaming, which is included with Game Pass Essential, Premium, and Ultimate.Your Hisense TV will soon be an Xbox.\"Our vision is to make sure your games, your community, and your achievements are always within reach. Bringing the Xbox app to select Hisense and V homeOS-powered TVs is another step toward making gaming available across a broad range of devices, to meeting you wherever you want to play,\" Microsoft said.Playing Xbox on a Hisense TV won't be here tomorrow, or next week. Microsoft said it will share more details on how this all works \"in the coming months,\" so keep checking back for more.Hisense TVs are just the latest to welcome the Xbox app, as Samsung welcomed the Xbox app all the way back in 2022 to allow people to stream games to their TVs.All of this is part of Microsoft's push to expand the Xbox audience beyond consoles. The company is messaging this with the tagline \"This is an Xbox.\"In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox, but \"playing on Xbox\" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. \"It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it,\" he said.Game consoles usually do not make much money, and if they do, it's not a lot compared to the much more lucrative games and services. This is why Microsoft is pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard. Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 developer Warhorse has revealed one feature that it cut from the RPG because it was too weird and not very fun.Speaking to PC Gamer, executive producer Martin Klima said this feature was a GTA: San Andreas-like eating system where main character Henry could gain and lose weight depending on food consumption. This would also affect what Henry would be able to wear.The version of Kingdom Come 2 that launched in February 2025 allows players to put on any piece of clothing they find. But it wasn't always this way. In earlier stages of development, Klima said, \"Some NPCs would be fat and some would be thin, and then the clothing they wear would be either too large or too small for you.\"If players found a piece of clothing or armor that was too big for them, they would be able to eat a bunch of food to grow in size. Alternatively, players could cut back on chowing down to shrink into smaller clothes. \"When you eat, basically, you would get fatter, and then this clothing you have in your inventory suddenly will fit you, while the clothing you had previously wouldn't fit you, because now you're too fat for it. Or you could go on a diet and do the same process in reverse,\" Klima said.In the end, the feature didn't make it into the game for a few different reasons. \"It was just really too bizarre and too much work and not really that much fun,\" Klima said. \"We felt that the clothing system is quite complex as it is, and it really doesn't need another layer of complexity.\"Kingdom Come 2 is on sale for just $30 right now on Amazon.GameSpot's Kingdom Come 2 review scored the game a 9/10. Reviewer Richard Wakeling said it is a \"triumphant sequel, improving upon its predecessor with an open-world RPG that delights in its complexity and emphasis on player choice.\"Kingdom Come 2 was also among GameSpot's favorite PC games of 2025.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders is a popular gaming, and it could become a movie or TV show next.Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderlund told GamesBeat (via VideoGamer) that the team has received numerous offers from Hollywood, but nothing has materialized as of yet. \"It needs to be done in the right way,\" he said.\"I can't tell you how many companies have reached out wanting to make a TV series [and] movie out of this IP,\" he said. Soderlund added that it would be \"fun\" to see Arc Raiders get adapted for a film or TV show, but nothing is officially in the works as of yet.\"The IP fits quite well,\" he said of Arc Raiders.Arc Raiders launched in October 2025, sandwiched between Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. It has enjoyed great success, reportedly selling 12 million copies and driving more than $350 million in revenue. Months after release, Arc Raiders recently had its biggest day ever. The game also won the Most Innovative Gameplay award for the Steam Awards.If Arc Raiders gets a movie or TV show deal, that doesn't mean anything would ever actually be produced. After all, there are 50+ video game adaptations in some form of development at the moment, and it's not expected that they will all be seen through to release.In terms of video games movies that are definitely coming, 2026 will see the release of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, a new Street Fighter film, the next Mortal Kombat movie, and a Resident Evil movie from Weapons director Zach Cregger. In 2027, there will be the live-action Zelda movie and the next Minecraft movie. On the TV side, one of the biggest upcoming shows is The Last of Us Season 3, which is expected to be released in 2027.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

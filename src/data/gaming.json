Aside from showing off the game's gorgeous '80s anime-inspired visuals, Orbitals' debut trailer also highlights how Maki and Omura will traverse space and work together to solve puzzles.          In one example of how the game's co-op will work, the trailer shows one character piloting a spaceship while another operates the ship's turret. Another portion of the trailer highlights one of the duo using a levitating beam to help transport some important piece of a puzzle, while the other navigates a series of dangerous platforms.Not much else is known about the game, only that it's being published by Kepler Interactive and developed by the Tokyo-based developer Shapefarm. Orbitals will be released exclusively for the Switch 2 and is slated to arrive in 2026.There was no shortage of new game announcements at The Game Awards this year, including a new co-op shooter from the creator of Left 4 Dead and the next game in Remedy's Control series. Other surprise announcements included a new Dungeons & Dragons game, a Star Wars racing game, and a new shooter from some of the creators of Apex Legends.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Each year he seems to get more dedicated airtime during the orchestral section, playing bigger and more unusual flutes.Pedro Eustache playing a strange new flute during the Clair Obscur tribute2025, of course, is no different, with Eustache even getting his own announcement video on The Game Awards' social media pages in the lead up to the show. His appearance in the orchestral section didn't disappoint, with his flute part highlighted through the Death Stranding 2 arrangement, and his part in the Clair Obscur section played on a strange new flute that appears to be made out of PVC pipe.Flute Guy, and the whole orchestral mix, added some needed drama to one of the most obvious Game of the Year announcements The Game Awards has seen. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became the most award-winning game in the awards show's history when it picked up nine awards, including Game of the Year. It had previously secured the record for most nominated game, receiving 13 total nominations. Clair Obscur has also been revealed as GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2025.For all the rest of the winners, losers, and surprises from The Game Awards 2025, check out our list of all the biggest announcements from the show, as well as our roundup of all the 2025 winners.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n          \n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n    \n              \n          \n                It was almost a foregone conclusion, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 absolutely crushed it at The Game Awards this year, taking home little polygonal statues for a record-setting number of categories it was nominated for. When the game's director, Guillaume Broche took the stage, he thanked a number of individuals, but he ended his speech by giving a very special thank you to us, the players, not with a speech, but with a rather sizable update for the game that dropped the second he walked on stage to accept the award.          Dubbed \"The Thank You Update\", this is no mere costume/weapon set, though there's over a dozen each of those to go find too. This is an all-encompassing update that brings everything from quality-of-life updates--a Picto/Lumina filter, a long-overdue photo mode, and an option to escape from battles, to a completely new area called \"Verso's Drafts,\" with a bunch of new story content, mostly about Verso's childhood, and the final music tracks written by Lorien Testard for the game.You can watch the trailer for it here, but, really, we're very sorry, this is a Jack from Lost situation now; you're gonna have to go back and play. The Thank You Update/patch 1.5.0 is available right now on all platforms. The full patch notes are below:New ContentVerso's Drafts, a new playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover :)  Located on the World Map, next to Lumière - Accessible from Act IIIEsquie’s Underwater ability is required!New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19, with more to come!New costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving even more customization options for players throughout their adventureNew boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower - They are variations of iconic bosses from the main game, designed to be even more challengingAdded new Luminas and WeaponsAdded the \"Old Key\" quest item to the final area of the game - Previously obtainable only during the Prologue, this addition gives players a second chance to collect all journals within a single playthroughNew FeaturesAdded Photo Mode with plenty of settings and options for players to get creative with while capturing your favourite moments from the game, accessible at any time from the pause menu!Added Lumina Sets feature, allowing players to save up to 50 different lumina loadouts for adapting to plenty of different fighting tactics at any momentAdded Abandon Battle option in the pause menu which can now be opened in battleAdded HUD Scale setting, allowing players to adjust the size of in-game HUD elements from 80% to 120%Added FSR 4 support, including AMD temporal upscaling for sharper visuals and Frame Generation for smoother gameplay on compatible GPUsAdded new filters for Pictos and Luminas and improved the UIAdded input remapping for controllerHandheld PC improvementsThe game is now certified on Steam Deck and ROG Xbox Ally!Global improvement of text legibilityFixed multiple fog and lighting issues:  Overly intense effects during the Flying Manor boss fight (which also impacted some cinematics)Overexposed areas in the VisagesOverly dark areas in the Endless TowerFixed FPS being capped at 30 on Steam DeckVSync can now be properly disabled in the settings when playing on Steam DeckGraphic settings are now adjusted for Steam Deck usersImproved first-time setup flow:  Controller input is now supported in installation wizards (no longer touchscreen-only)External controllers now switch seamlessly with the Steam Deck controlsBug FixesFixed an issue where using Battle Retry after a cinematic or automatic trigger could spawn the player out of the world if the last save was created in a different locationThe playtime displayed on save files now accurately reflects total playtime, including time spent on Game Overs(Note: this fix does not retroactively update existing save files.)Fixed inventory behaviour so that sort order now persists after closing the game menuFixed issue preventing Intel XeSS Frame Generation setting from being accessible on PC Game PassFixed an issue where the usage of particular diacritic marks (e.g. ^, ~, ´, `) in Windows is blocked after launching the titleFixed Breaking Death always breaking all enemies when the character dies, it should only break the enemy that killed the character - As a result, it shouldn’t work when the character kills themself anymoreCharacters' turn order during a First Strike, triggered by attacking an enemy on the map, now correctly respects characters' SpeedFixed Boucharo giving +150% Critical chance instead of +50% Critical chanceFixed some Luminas giving unintended hidden +10% damage:  Sweet KillTeamworkDead Energy IIFirst Strike and others\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

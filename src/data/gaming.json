Their real-world tangents are nothing compared to some recently uncovered voice lines for MLB Slugfest 2003.\"Enjoying some smoked whale meat up in the booth today,\" one of the fictional casters says mid-game. \"I don't really care for it, but I can't stop eating it.\"Other lines talk about players getting drunk, the commentators walking into traffic, audio engineers getting electrocuted, and even families being murdered. It's some truly unhinged stuff.The lines were uncovered by the Video Game History Foundation, which found a CD that included a number of lines that never made it to the ears of players.\"Still need more baseball?\" a post from their Bluesky account read. \"We found a CD in our archives containing dozens of unused voice lines from MLB Slugfest 2003 rejected by the MLB. Here are some of our favorites.\"It's obvious that the MLB would never want to be associated with such inappropriate conduct, even in the form of a video game.\"A lot of families at the ballpark,\" said another caster. \"You know Tim, that's good because my family was murdered.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In 2015, Obsidian Entertainment launched Pillars of Eternity, a party-based real-time tactical RPG. Now Obsidian is making one of the most significant changes to the game in the last 10 years by introducing a turn-based mode. And Pillars of Eternity players will be able to get their hands on it this week.On the game's official site, Obsidian announced that the public beta for Pillars of Eternity's turn-based mode will go live on November 5. The real-time combat was inspired by the system used by the game's sequel, Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. The studio also released an announcement trailer for the new mode to demonstrate it in action.          According to Obsidian, the following real-time improvements were made after taking fan feedback from Deadfire.Unbound Turns: All turns are now influenced by a character’s overall speed, improving the value of Real-Time with Pause attributes and mechanics.Smarter Free Actions: Actions like swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions. Each free action is limited to one per turn per type for balance.Faster Pacing: Combat lethality has been significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful.Mode Flexibility: You can choose Turn-Based Mode alongside difficulty when starting a new game — or swap freely between Real-Time with Pause and Turn-Based Mode in the game options. We’re also investigating a direct HUD toggle for even more convenience.As noted above, players can choose whether or not to embrace turn-based combat, or switch between real-time and turn-based at their desire. The beta test doesn't currently have an end date, but Obsidian notes that it will release future updates in support of this before adding turn-based mode to the game as a permanent feature.Josh Sawyer--who directed both Pillars of Eternity games--has suggested that if Pillars of Eternity 3 ever goes forward, it will embrace the influence of Baldur's Gate 3 and switch from an isometric perspective to a 3D-style game.Earlier this year, Obsidian released Avowed, an action-RPG that takes place in the same universe as the Pillars of Eternity games.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                One of the recurring themes from a vocal segment of Battlefield 6 fans before and after launch was a desire to see the game free of Call of Duty-style ridiculous skins. The dev team responded by telling fans that Battlefield 6 would be \"a gritty, realistic shooter.\" But after releasing the recent \"Wicked Grin\" skin, Battlefield Studios has quietly removed the light blue outfit from the lineup.Much like an apparent orange skin and an earlier leaked skin, the response to the \"Wicked Grin\" outfit was largely swift and negative.\"[What do you mean?] That is classic naval camouflage, because of all that water. Just find a fountain and you are golden,\" wrote one Reddit user. \"LMAO this is not grounded and horrible looking,\" added another fan. \"Doesn't even look cool. What a mess.\"After the response from players, Battlefield Studios re-released this outfit in more conventional military uniform colors and left the light blue shades behind. Battlefield 6 recently received a number of new cosmetics in the Season 1 battle pass.EA recently announced a new mode, Casual Breakthrough, which will let Battlefield 6 players earn Career XP, Weapon XP and Battle Pass XP, while also accruing points towards challenges. This mode will only feature 16 real players in each lobby, with 32 bots to fill out the matches. A new DLC map, Blackwell Fields, has drawn scorn from players for being a \"sniper fest.\"One aspect that seems to be well-received so far is the game's free-to-play battle royale mode, Battlefield Redsec. For new and veteran players, GameSpot has put together seven Redsec tips that you need to know before diving into the game.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

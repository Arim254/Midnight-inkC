    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on November 11, 2025 at 1:47AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Some structures in Minecraft are built purely for show, while others need to be built of necessity for your survival. However, certain structures accomplish both of those goals, and a bridge definitely falls within that category. Bridges usually aren’t an essential construction, depending on your seed and base design, but if you want to cross water without needing a boat or quickly get from one mountainside to the other, you'll need to start designing a bridge.While you can always just get some basic wood planks or stone blocks and place them in a line to form a bridge, where's the fun in that? If you're truly looking to test your skills as a builder or add some extra spice to your world, you'll want to check below for five of the best bridge designs in Minecraft.Nether BridgeReference: RedditThe Nether is one of the most iconic biomes in all of Minecraft, but getting around to different areas within the twisted dimension can be difficult. After all, you have to contend with lava streams, dangerous mobs, and treacherous terrain at every turn. To help make your life simpler while roaming the Nether, you can build a bridge that either goes across a large gap or a stream of lava. The bridge we've referenced is a simple but sturdy design that utilizes some of the Nether's natural resources to complete it.Skellige BridgeReference: YouTubeIf you're a fan of The Witcher video game series, TV show, or even the books, then you likely know of the island town \"Skellige.\" Skellige is famously portrayed during the middle part of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, as you get to fully explore the island and all of its glory. One of the most recognizable landmarks in Skellige is a towering bridge that connects the mountainside to the town's main castle. This bridge is made of stone, stands hundreds of feet above the ground, and makes you feel queasy just walking over it.In Minecraft, you can recreate the Skellige bridge with a simple stone design that goes over a large gap between two mountains. The YouTube video we referenced doesn't include a castle on one end of the bridge, but the bridge itself looks very similar to one featured in Skellige.Hogwarts BridgeReference: RedditHogwarts Castle is one of the most well-known locations in all of entertainment. Throughout the movies, books, and even the game Hogwarts Legacy, one particularly beautiful spot on the castle grounds is the covered bridge. This bridge runs from the castle to the outer grounds, and it's a central location for several events in Hogwarts' history.While the bridge we see in Hogwarts Legacy and Harry Potter is somewhat tattered and rickety, you can correct those mistakes with a gorgeous bridge design from a user on Reddit. This player's bridge features the same covered middle and lower beam design as the Hogwarts bridge, but it adds some extra flair with the two towers on either end. It's a fantastic reimagining of the Hogwarts bridge that you can continue to tweak to your liking.Mossy BridgeReference: YouTubeWhen it comes to a bridge in Minecraft, it doesn't need to be an overly extravagant structure that's meant to get you across a massive mountain range. Sometimes, a bridge can be small and quaint with the sole goal of allowing you to cross some peaceful water or a small gap between some rocks. This mossy bridge design isn't anything spectacular from a design standpoint, but it doesn't need to be. This kind of bridge fits in perfectly with a cozy base or as a simple way to get across a pond, river, or lake. You can also add more flair with different grassy blocks, more lighting, or a raised platform if you'd like.Fantasy BridgeReference: YouTubeSometimes, you need to go all out with your design in Minecraft. If you're looking to make one of the flashiest and most jaw-dropping bridges for your world, look no further than the \"Bridge of Lords.\" This bridge features a medieval design with several layers of different blocks, plenty of lighting, and even has the potential to be a pitstop kind of base with how much room there is in the foundation. The goal of this bridge is to dwarf any mountainside that you build it on, and you'll ideally want to build it high in the air to get the full intended effect.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Joey Carr\n   on November 11, 2025 at 1:48AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Farming is a task that every Minecraft player eventually has to undertake, and over the years, designs for various farms have sprouted up all over the community. Whether it's traditional farming for crops or using clever methods to farm specific resources, you'll want to take advantage of this process in Minecraft at some point or another.The entire world of Minecraft can be harvested for resources, all of which allow you to upgrade and customize your character, gear, base, and everything in between. However, slowly collecting all the resources you need to build everything you've brainstormed can be painstaking work, especially if you're not optimizing the way you loot items.To help you with that, we have five farm designs that are intended to provide you with fast and efficient ways of farming various resources in Minecraft. You can also expand upon these design ideas to make your farms unique to your world.Automatic Multi-Level FarmReference: YouTubeFirst up on our list is a multi-level crop farm that also features an automatic harvesting method so you don't have to go around and loot every single crop one piece at a time. Not only does this farm look fantastic, featuring clear windows so you can see your crops from the outside, but it serves an impactful purpose.You can use this farm design for a single crop that you need a lot of, or space out different crops on each level. If you wanted even more crops, you're able to keep expanding the height of the farm as well. Overall, this is a fantastic way to move away from the basic farm design that usually looks out of place off to the side of your base.Mob FarmReference: YouTubeMobs are the lifeblood of Minecraft, and you need the resources from the dozens of mobs in order to craft a wide variety of different items. The specific mob farm we're showcasing is designed to trap the dangerous mobs in Minecraft, such as zombies. However, you can also apply the idea to docile mobs, like cows and horses.This mob farm is built in the middle of the water and intends to trap the mobs inside a dark enclosure inside the structure. Since mobs tend to spawn in dark and damp locations, you'll get dozens of them spawning within minutes. The farm is then set up to eliminate the mobs and deposit their loot into chests, essentially doing all the work for you.Iron FarmReference: YouTubeIron is one of the most valuable resources in Minecraft, and, like any ore, it's extremely tedious to find in the world. You have to go out with your pickaxe and hope you find a vein of iron ore to mine, and even then, it's usually never enough. Fortunately, you never have to worry about iron again with this clever farm.While an iron farm does utilize a slew of resources, it's worth it to never mine an iron ore block again. The way the farm works is by using Iron Golems, which are then killed to drop the iron. You need to position villagers and beds in very specific ways to spawn the golems, but once that's down, it's smooth sailing.Greenhouse FarmReference: YouTubeA greenhouse has been an extremely common way to design a farm in Minecraft since the game's inception. However, you can expand the basic idea of a greenhouse into several different farming avenues. You can design a greenhouse to store basic crops, and you can also use it as an extension of your base. Perhaps the most clever way to utilize a greenhouse, though, is by storing honeybees inside.The bees are protected in the greenhouse, and they'll also pollinate your crops for you. This is also an easy way to start a honeybee farm, as you can build a small house for the bees that they can use to spawn even more of their species. Whichever way you decide to go with your greenhouse, it's a tried and true way to farm that also looks amazing when built correctly.Wool FarmReference: YouTubeWhile wool is most famously used in the creation of beds in Minecraft, it's also an extremely common resource when crafting banners and other decorations. Heading out to find the amount of sheep you need for wool is never fun, so why not build an elegant farm for the furry creatures?The wool farm we're showcasing houses a dozen or more sheep inside a small stone and glass enclosure. The farm then shears the sheep after their wool grows back, effectively giving you an infinite supply of wool. The main issue with this farm is that you have to wait for all the sheep's wool to grow back, but that's going to be a problem no matter how you set up a farm like this. In the end, you're getting around a dozen wool at the same time. And a sheep's wool grows back in around two minutes, so you're really not waiting that long if you need more of the resource.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Cody Perez\n   on November 11, 2025 at 1:46AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Anime is influencing every aspect of pop culture and media right now, including even some of the best Roblox games of all time. The best Roblox anime games embody manga and anime in a couple of different ways. Some of the anime Roblox games might make a literal take on a particular series like Demon Slayer. Other times, they may focus on a particular anime or cel-shaded style that is a celebration of anime in general. Regardless of how it works, the best Roblox anime games are well worth checking out for fans of high-octane action experiences. Typically, anime games in Roblox have some of the fastest combat and deepest progression systems possible on the platform. As such, be sure to give some of the best Roblox anime games below a try. After all, they are all free.Blox FruitsBlox Fruits is one of the oldest still-running anime Roblox games and it rightfully adapts one of the most famous and longest manga and anime series of all time: One Piece. Players take on the role of a pirate or marine as they learn various skills, consume some Devil Fruits (Blox Fruits in this case) and explore a vast world.You can truly spend thousands of hours in Blox Fruits for free without ever having to spend a penny on the experience. It offers some of the best value out of any anime game due to the years of updates and additions. It helps, too, that the melee-focused combat still feels great to use with the various customizable skills and styles.Attack on Titan RevolutionDeveloper AoTR somehow made the intricate movement of the Attack on Titan series work in a Roblox game, and it surprisingly feels great to use. Attack on Titan Revolution lets you don the classic ODM gear and swing around the fantasy world to take down the horrifyingly weird titans.The movement and gameplay has no right working this well, giving even the official Attack on Titan 2 video game a run for its money. Of course, Revolution wouldn’t be complete without the ability to shift into a titan yourself, and that is a limited option that plays just as well, if not better, than swinging around as a Survey Corps member.Shindo LifeNaruto fans will be happy to know that Shindo Life is still going strong many years later and remains one of the best Roblox anime games. Taking cues from the popular manga and anime shinobi series, players use the various ninjutsu abilities to explore a vast ninja world that is absolutely stunning.The buildings, biomes, and various clan nations have a gorgeous cel-shaded style that has stood the test of time visually. While the characters look just as blocky as ever, the world is a joy to be in. It helps, too, that there is so much depth to unlocking and upgrading your ninjutsu abilities on your rise through the ninja ranks.Type://SoulType://Soul is for the Bleach fans out there. At the start of the game, you create a character using one of four signature Bleach options: Shinigami, Hollow, Quincy, and Fullbringer. Each of the four character options feel vastly different from one another, so this is one of the few anime games where it is recommended to make multiple characters to see everything it has to offer. Some of the characters are able to wield wild weapons to slice down the supernatural foes in the world of Type://Soul, while others are even able to transform into terrifying monsters themselves. The customization is great, letting you feel like you are a one-of-a-kind part of the Bleach universe, so it is highly recommended for fans of the series.Demon Slayer RPG 2There are a lot of Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer-focused games in Roblox, but Demon Slayer RPG 2 has the most immersive world to explore. You create your own character and use the different breathing techniques from the beloved franchise to slay the demons that roam around the retro Japanese world. The sword gameplay is precise but quick, helping the combat to always feel fluid and engaging. Since it is an RPG, exploration is a huge part of the experience and it feels like a genuine adventure. So much of the Demon Slayer world, including its towns and villages, are fully realized in ways that feel authentic to the time period. The developer behind Demon Slayer RPG 2, Shounen Studio, captured the nostalgic Japanese aesthetic of the world so well, and that alone makes it worth experiencing.Anime Battle ArenaIf you play traditional console anime games, you’ll find most of them are fighting games like Dragon Ball FighterZ or My Hero Academia: One’s Justice. Fortunately, if you are looking for that type of gameplay, Anime Battle Arena is the one for you. With its celebratory roster of characters from across anime, it genuinely feels like Jump Force but somehow done right.Anime Battle Arena takes cues from so many anime series for its wonderfully crafted maps, including memorable locales from the likes of One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Dragon Ball, and many more. The same is true for the characters you can play as where their movesets are built entirely around the original characters from franchises like My Hero Academia and Fate/stay Night. There are only a few abilities for each character, so it is easy enough to learn but difficult enough to master in the short-burst matches.Blue Lock RivalsFor the sports manga and anime fans out there, you even have a Roblox game to check out in Blue Lock Rivals. It adapts the hyper dramatic anime sports series into a competitive soccer/football experience. You have the usual soccer mechanics of sliding, tackling, dribbling, passing, and shooting to score points to win the match. Where Blue Lock Rivals sets itself apart, though, is in the unique powers you are able to wield. These abilities let you zip across the map in a short period of time, decimate enemy players to take the ball from them, or score some of the flashiest goals imaginable. Each match only lasts a few minutes, so this is one of the best Roblox anime games for bite-sized fun that just keeps going.Jujutsu InfiniteJujutsu Infinite is the best overall anime RPG you’ll find in Roblox. As the name implies, this game is based entirely around Jujutsu Kaisen. After some surprisingly well done cinematics to introduce the story, you are thrust into the Jujutsu world for you to explore, take on bosses, complete story quests, and do daily missions. The gameplay in Jujutsu Infinite plays out sort of like a 3D arena brawler but with rich progression. You can spin (often for free) to learn new curse abilities and every single one can be upgraded the more you use them to make them more powerful. The gameplay loop between the missions, story, and bosses ensure you are constantly able to do something enjoyable with little to no downtime.All Star Tower Defense XTower Defense games are becoming more popular in Roblox, and arguably the best of all of them is an anime-centric experience known as All Star Tower Defense X. You collect various units from across anime from Mob of Mob Psycho 100 to Sasuke from Naruto to Sung Jiwoo from Solo Leveling to place around a battlefield to defend against an armada of foes. All Star Tower Defense X is quite the complex experience, but it eases you well into the gameplay with a tutorial-like story mode featuring Future Trunks from Dragon Ball Z. You can also play alone or with friends, which can help to ease some of the difficulty. All Star Tower Defense X is, admittedly, one of the most gacha-centric anime Roblox games when it comes to unlocking new characters, but it is also quite generous with its free rewards, so you don’t feel like you have to use Robux all the time.Sword Blox Online: RebirthSword Blox Online wears its Sword Art Online inspirations on its sleeve from the moment you boot up the game, which plays out as a near one-to-one recreation of the VR boot up screen from the anime series. You create your character and then embark on the same journey Kirito, Asuna, and the others did in SAO to clear the various floors of Aincrad. The sword gameplay is a bit slower than some of the other Roblox anime games out there, but this allows every fight to feel meaningful and challenging. There are different weapon types to choose from, including dual wielding and rapiers, and the more methodical gameplay ensures they all feel radically unique to use. Sword Blox Online: Rebirth is a Roblox anime game that takes a bit of a grind to get into, but it is by far one of the most rewarding in the long run.    \n  \n                      "

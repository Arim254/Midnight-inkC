    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Miri Teixeira\n   on January 19, 2026 at 1:49AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The best co-op cooking games task you and your friends with whipping up some delightful delicacies through a variety of gameplay styles, from frenzied fast-food kitchens to full restaurant management games. Few things test communication, adaptability, and friendship like trying to serve meals under pressure, while hot-headed customers or food inspectors breathe down your neck.The games on this list turn simple mechanics into high-stakes teamwork, and push the limits of even the most laid-back friendships. Many of the games are perfect for players of all ages, those who are new to gaming, and people looking for a casual experience with friends. As long as you don't cry over split milk, you'll get a lot out of these culinary co-op classics.If you like a co-op experience but can't stand to use the kitchen when someone else is in there (valid), check out our best couch co-op games list for similar vibes without the foodie flavour.Overcooked! All You Can EatDeveloper: Team 17/ Ghost Town GamesPlatform: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo SwitchNumber of players: 1-4Overcooked! All You Can Eat is often the first name that comes up when people talk about co-op cooking games, and for good reason. This collection brings together multiple Overcooked experiences into one package, focusing entirely on the cooperative chaos offered by the franchise. Players work together to prepare, cook, and serve dishes across a series of increasingly absurd kitchens, many of which actively interfere with your ability to function as a team, so pretty standard for the catering industry.Ideal for players who enjoy fast-paced action and don’t mind getting a little heated in the kitchen, Overcooked! All You Can Eat is especially well-suited for local co-op sessions, where you can embrace your inner Gordon Ramsay and get your point across in an instant. This edition also features an assist mode, where several accessibility options mean everyone can join in, whatever their chef-ing ability. Overcooked also made it onto our best Xbox co-op games list, and works flawlessly either locally or online.GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by FandomOne Armed CookDeveloper: DuhndalPlatform: PCNumber of players: 1-4You can probably guess the premise of One Armed Cook without much prompting: you're a cook and you have one arm. But the simple concept gives way to hours of physics-based fun when you consider that between you and a friend, you'll have all the required arms. The game very quickly goes from \"I'm not doing too badly, considering,\" to \"oh my god the floor is covered in onions,\" so if you want the video game equivalent of a three-legged race, you don't have to look much further.Carrying ingredients, chopping food, and assembling dishes often requires both of you working in sync, especially when dealing with awkward customers or a full house. One Armed Cook is best enjoyed by pals who appreciate goofy, unpredictable gameplay and don’t mind failing spectacularly on the way to success.PlateUp!Developer: It's HappeningPlatform: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo SwitchNumber of players: 1-4PlateUp! blends the more traditional elements of co-op cooking with light restaurant management, meaning it's as much about planning ahead as it is about the actual execution of each dish. It's another of the more popular entries on the list, but continues to prove itself in the multiplayer arena, even against more recent games. Players work together to run a restaurant over 15 in-game days, choosing layouts, upgrading equipment, and deciding how to handle increasingly demanding customers. Every three days, you then have to choose a card that will permanently impact the game from there on--sometimes for the worse.Unlike more linear level-based cooking games, PlateUp! leans toward rogue-lite mechanics, changing things up with every full game. Decisions made early--such as kitchen layout or menu/card choices--directly affect later runs. Cooking, serving, cleaning, and managing customer flow all happen simultaneously, making teamwork essential and genuinely challenging.Diner Bros 2Developer: JAYFLGAMESPlatform: PCNumber of players: 1-4Diner Bros 2 asks a lot of you, so if you want a co-op cooking game with a bit of bite, this is the one for you. Alongside serving up delicious dishes, you'll have to keep enhancing your restaurant, optimizing its layout, impressing food critics, learning new recipes, hiring staff, and even dealing with sneaky customers who try to dine-n-dash. There are no gimmicks or environmental hazards, just good honest work and the potential of a thriving business driving you forward.The game emphasizes clear task-division, meaning it's best with four friends, but can also be played alone (by hiring staff) or with two players. One player might focus on blasting through all the cooking while another handles serving and cleanup, but the most effective teams adjust roles dynamically depending on customer flow. Progression unlocks new content, encouraging players to improve efficiency and coordination over time, so you'll find plenty of replayability here, too.Galaxy BurgerDeveloper: Galactic WorkshopPlatform: PCNumber of players: 1-8Galaxy Burger is a little different from many of the games on this list, as there's no frantic energy and no chaotic time limits. It's a laid-back game with no stress, where you and up to seven friends can create cosmic burgers for aliens, space creatures, and mecha cats. Different burgers require different ingredients and combinations, meaning you'll be prepping all manner of accompaniments, toppings, and side dishes to complete challenges.If you're sick of cooking co-op games making you frustrated, stressed, or even downright angry, Galaxy Burger offers an alternative in chilled, casual cooking in which gentle creativity is rewarded. Galaxy Burger doesn’t reinvent the genre, but it adds enough thematic flair to keep teamwork feeling fresh. Plus, some of the cats are really cute.WitchtasticDeveloper: Red Fur GamesPlatform: PC, Nintendo SwitchNumber of players: 1-4Witchtastic handles like a co-op cooking game, but throws in a witchy twist by having you and your pals brew potions instead of preparing food. Speed is the key, as you want those potions flying out of there ASAP. While there is a single-player campaign, it's a lot more fun to team up and scurry around increasingly elaborate cooking setups.If you're a big fan of cozy games, Witchtastic might appeal with its cottagecore cauldron-in-a-forest vibes--just watch out for ghouls, wolves, and other halloween-y horrors that might distract you from your noble pursuit. Between foraging, scooting about on a broomstick, and customising your witch, there's always something to do between brewing sessions.Cook Serve Delicious 3Developer: Vertigo GamingPlatform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo SwitchNumber of players: 1-2Cook Serve Delicious 3 is a lot to explain. It's a co-op cooking game set in dystopian future America where cyborgs mingle with humans--and instead of freaking out about this, you're taking your food truck on a road trip. If there is such a thing, this is basically the Dark Souls of cooking games, so if you want something that'll pose a genuine challenge to you and your friends (perhaps to knock a smug pal down a peg or two), you'll want to check the series out. It's one of those great two-player co-op games that'll reward you handsomely if you reach its incredibly high bar for challenge.Single-player is supported in the campaign, but local co-op is where Cook Serve Delicious 3 really shines. Between rounds, you'll upgrade and customize your food truck, expand your menu, and travel across the war-torn future USA, before launching into another round of trying to cater to the hungry masses. When on-shift, you and your friends will have to coordinate almost seamlessly in an unforgiving onslaught of demanding customers. The game packs a ridiculous 387 levels, so you've got plenty of time to hone those chopping, flipping, and frying skills.Let’s Cook Together 2Developer: Yellow DotPlatform: PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PCNumber of players: 2Let’s Cook Together 2 is a wholesome co-op game that can be played with just about anyone, but works best with younger kids. The game rewards cooperative puzzle-solving and well-timed cooking collaboration, with kitchens designed as challenges that require players to coordinate movements, timing, and task execution to complete recipes efficiently. It's a great introduction to co-op gaming for your less-experienced kids or siblings, and offers more than 250 levels to try.Fast reflexes aren't much of a consideration in Let's Cook Together 2's lower difficulty levels; you just need to be able to communicate, plan ahead, and support each other. Everything you need to serve up your dishes is scattered across a wide room, so sometimes you're going to have to throw stuff with perfect timing.Shakes on a PlaneDeveloper: Huu GamesPlatform: PC, Nintendo SwitchNumber of players: 1-4Shakes on a Plane centers on cooperative milkshake-making in unusual environments, but we'll loosely group milkshakes into cooking for now. Players work together to fulfill orders while dealing with airplane kitchens that move, tilt, or change unexpectedly, as they gain altitude and deal with turbulence, demanding passengers, and even aliens.The game thrives on shared chaos, and although it does offer single-player, we personally think it's not the best way to play it. Having multiple players support you in co-op makes it easier and more engaging, allowing you to progress at a comfortable pace. At its heart it's a fairly cluttered Overcooked clone, but the unique concept and fun setting make it a good alternative party game if you're not afraid of heights.Bone’s CafeDeveloper: Acute Owl StudioPlatform: PC, Nintendo SwitchNumber of players: 1-4Bone’s Cafe combines cooperative cooking with a creepy-cute aesthetic, tasking players with running a cafe filled with undead workers and patrons. Players work together to preparing dishes, serving customers, and managing shared responsibilities--as well as literally raising the dead.Coordination and timing are hugely important, with progression introducing new recipes and challenges that require better teamwork. Decorate and upgrade your cafe, and increase your Skull Ranking for better rewards, all while trying to automate and streamline your work. The cute pixel art belies the fact that your job is to strategically attract, kill, and harvest customers for fresh ingredients and use their souls to raise an undead army. Adorable.    \n  \n                      "

This weekend, the hit Roblox game Steal a Brainrot is going to host a pop up performance by Bruno Mars that's a one-time only appearance.The official announcement went out on Roblox's social media channels. Mars' performance will be held on Saturday, January 17 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.Although musical acts like Stray Kids have performed in Roblox before, Mars will be the first to do so for Steal a Brainrot, which launched in May 2025. He's expected to sing his new single, I Just Might, as well as an older song, Locked Out of Heaven.To mark the occasion, players will have the chance to get a Bruno Mars Brainrot, as well as other related in-game items and traits.Steal a Brainrot, Grow a Garden, and the larger Roblox sandbox were among the top-trending topics on YouTube in 2025. There's even a Grow a Garden movie in development despite the game's lack of any identifiable story elements.However, Roblox has been dogged by accusations that it hasn't done enough to protect kids from child exploitation and grooming. According to a June 2024 Bloomberg investigation, the platform has had major issues with child predators. Florida and Texas even sued Roblox over that issue.Roblox has since introduced initiatives to keep children from talking to strangers, and to limit their interactions to kids roughly their own age. Earlier this month, Roblox continued its global rollout of a facial age-check system, but the results have been mixed at best.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Once you make it past the early game in Satisfactory, your production lines will skyrocket in complexity. As the number of items you're producing goes from a dozen to dozens, so will the number of conveyor belts carting all of that around. Mastering Smart Splitters will be a crucial part of advancing in Satisfactory, keeping your production lines navigable and easy to understand.What is a Smart Splitter?The function of a regular splitter is fairly obvious--it splits a single conveyor belt into as many as three belts. That's great for a smelter cranking out more ingots than any single production line needs, such as having one smelter sending ingots to make plates, rods, and screws. There's no configuration needed here, either. It's just plug-and-play.So what makes a Smart Splitter smart? Smart Splitters are programmable, allowing you to determine which items on a belt go where. There are programmable splitters, too, that do the same thing but at a higher level, allowing you to sort more than three different outputs.How to unlock Smart SplittersImage Credit: Satisfactory WikiTo build a Smart Splitter, you'll need Reinforced Iron Plates, Rotors, and AI Limiters. The first two will unlock as part of the normal progression of building the space elevator, but AI Limiters can be unlocked most easily through the MAM Research machine, in the Caterium research tree. You just need to fashion 200 Quickwire and 50 Copper Sheets. Once you've unlocked the AI Limiter, build 10 of those and another 50 Reinforced Plates to unlock the Smart Splitter.How to use Smart SplittersAt their most straightforward, Smart Splitters allow you to send up to three items down the same conveyor belt and have them split up equally across the three outputs. After dropping a Smart Splitter, you can click on it to set the outputs:For example, you could send all the components for a given end product down the same belt and have them split off into the correct machines. This works best in earlier components, but as you progress, ratios can get more complex and you might have to do a bit of math to figure out the best way to split things.Another great way to use a smart splitter is to make sure you're getting the most out of a given production line. For a simple example, let's say you have a concrete production line set up. Once you reach Mk3 miners and belts, you'll be making way more concrete than you can reasonably use and store.In this case, you might use a smart splitter to send the concrete to two different destinations--storage and manufacturing--and still find the lines gummed up. Having full belts isn't the worst thing in the world, but it's hardly the most efficient. Your line might be working at only 20% capacity or something like that.What you can do instead is pipe that third output to an Awesome Sink. Alongside the many specific ingredients you can program into the Smart Splitter, there's a generalized option called Overflow. Essentially, this will ensure that those two main lines are completely full, and then start sending any extra down the overflow path. And so instead of having a machine that's working at low capacity, you can be dumping waste concrete into the Awesome Sink constantly. Concrete doesn't generate many points in the Sink on its own, but when you're sending concrete there every waking moment, it builds up. Put a smart splitter and an Awesome Sink overflow on every production line you can think of, and suddenly your machines are operating at much higher efficiency and you're racking up Awesome Sink points.Smart Splitters are a crucial component in making the most of your production lines, both for streamlining and overall production efficiency. Don't sleep on this useful part.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

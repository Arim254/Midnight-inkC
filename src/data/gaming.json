    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders presents you with plenty of quests that require you to find materials or unique items, but only a few require you to use your materials to complete them. Eyes on the Prize, however, is one such quest that expects you to bring along a little something to help you get the job done. Let's jump in and see what's what.You'll need 3 Wires to repair the solar panel and complete Eyes on the Prize. Wires are a common resource found in Electrical-based POIs, and within a few hours of gameplay, you should've already amassed quite a collection--unless you've been selling them. Whether you're tossing them into your inventory before you head out or finding them while in the raid, just make sure you have 3 of them before you head to the secluded roof terrace for Eyes on the Prize. And make sure you toss them in a safe pocket if possible, as you never know when things could go wrong, and you don't want to lose them.When you're ready to repair a solar panel, here's how to complete Eyes on the Prize.Where to find the secluded roof terrace west of the Southern StationThe first objective in Eyes on the Prize is to find a secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station extraction point. The quest mentions to keep an eye out for a blue tarp, but it can still be hard to spot if you're not at the right angle. With that in mind, refer to the photo below for the exact location on the map.Gallery                                       You'll need to be on the roof to reach the secluded roof terrace (as per the name). You'll eventually spot a blue tarp with some chairs, boxes, and an electric box. That's your destination.How to rewire the solar panelAs mentioned earlier, you'll need to have brought or scavenged 3 Wires to repair the solar panel at the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace. If you didn't bring any in with you, you'll either have to recycle an electrical item like a Battery or visit an Electrical-based POI on the map to round a few up.As long as you have the 3 Wires in your inventory, you can approach the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace and interact with it to finish your repairs like a proper electrician. With that out of the way, the Eyes on the Prize quest will conclude.Repair the solar panel using 3 Wires.Since you don't need to extract to complete the quest, you're now free to finish looting or shooting until you're ready to leave. The nearby Southern Station should prove to be a solid spot to extract when you're finished up, though. Just keep in mind that it tends to be an active region of the map, so don't let your guard down.If you need to tackle more quests, check out our full Arc Raiders quest list.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this week, Square Enix disclosed its ambition to drastically cut its Quality Assurance employees and use generative AI to handle 70% of its game QA and debugging. The company went on to note that it wants to \"establish a competitive advantage in game development.\" However, Michael Douse--the publishing director of Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian--has called out Square Enix and described its plan as \"stupid.\"\"So QA are some of the most video games engaged people in any company,\" Douse wrote on X. \"They are integral to your community teams. To publishing. They give you the real feedback. They know what is good and what is bad before the audience does, and they are the most resilient department.\"\"[The] idea that QA people can be replaced at a large scale is stupid because it supposes that the conversations with them can be replaced and they can't,\" added Douse. \"They are a massively advantageous vibe check.\"Douse also noted that QA jobs have often been gateway positions for people looking to get into the video game industry. He cautions that losing QA workers risks missing out on future designers and other positions.QA is not an inherently entry-level job but I will also add that without gateways to the industry you won't find your lead designers. This is a stupid path. You want to be able to offer people beneficial positions that allow them to grow and help to grow you!  — Very AFK (@Cromwelp) November 6, 2025              In a subsequent post, Douse noted that Square Enix aims to save $19.6 million by outsourcing its QA to AI. He also questioned why executives weren't laid off if the company needs the savings so badly.The desired annual savings of $19.6 million - while a substantial amount of money in real life terms - is not hugely substantial for a AAA company. If things are this bad where are the executive \"layoffs?\" I'm pretty sure these games aren't failing because of QA, publishing, etc. https://t.co/MCJw16kBHz  — Very AFK (@Cromwelp) November 7, 2025              Reports have emerged that Square Enix is already conducting a massive employee layoff. Square Enix isn't the only video game company to embrace AI. Electronic Arts has reportedly instructed its employees to treat AI as \"thought partners.\" A recent survey also found that over 50% of Japanese game publishers utilize AI in some way. Prominent game developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield have both stated that AI tools should be embraced in game creation.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The time of Halo: Infinite is coming to a close. Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.In a message posted to the official Halo site, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on \"multiple Halo titles in development.\" This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been saying for over a year now that there are multiple new Halo games in development.\"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us,\" reads the statement. \"While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.\"The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of the original Halo that will bring the franchise to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about a live-service Halo game, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed some light on the Halo MMO from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the Halo remake \"warms my heart,\" while another former Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Amid Netflix's proposed buyout of Warner Bros. Discovery, the streaming platform has made another big business move, acquiring a gaming startup amid the company's push further into games.Netflix has paid an unspecified sum for Estonia-based Ready Player Me, a company that builds the technology used to create gaming assets that are available across different titles.\"Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds. We've been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time. I'm now very excited for the Ready Player Me team to join Netflix to scale our tech and expertise to a global audience and contribute to the exciting vision Netflix has for gaming,\" CEO Timmu Tõke said.Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch that Ready Player Me's team of 20 people will join Netflix, but only one of the executives, CTO Rainer Selvet, is shifting to Netflix. There continue to be many unknowns about the deal, too, like when gaming avatars will come to Netflix or which titles will be supported.As a result of the buyout, Ready Player Me also announced that it will close its own services on January 31, 2026, and this includes the company's avatar-maker tool, PlayerZero.Ready Player Me sells products and services to developers for avatars that work across multiple different titles. The company points out in its business plan that every game is different, including game engines, devices, and art styles, and it sells the tools that developers can use to handle compatibility in these environments. Ready Player Me counts companies like Ubisoft, Lenovo, and Nvidia among its clients.Netflix has always said its investments in gaming were experimental in nature, as the company looked to find what worked best. This has led to a rocky road, as Netflix cut back on its AAA game plans and is now focusing more on mobile and party-focused games. In July, Netflix announced it would \"ramp up\" its gaming efforts.Netflix recently announced a blockbuster deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery and take ownership of many of the company's entertainment assets, including its games portfolio, but not the entire company. Rival Paramount is going straight to shareholders with its own offer, which includes more money and a proposal to buy the entirety of the company.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Microsoft has reacted to a report that said the company is pushing Xbox to make more profit. In a statement to CNBC, the company said it has ambitious profit goals, but the specific 30% profit-margin figure was not correct. The statement was paraphrased and not attributed to any specific person at Microsoft, and GameSpot has followed up with Microsoft in an attempt to get more information.Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft pushed the Xbox team to increase profit margins starting in 2023, with the goal of rising to 30% (up from 12% in 2022). The industry average for profit margins is likely between 17% and 22%, analysts said in the Bloomberg piece.According to the report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new goals, and her team has \"taken a larger role\" in the company's gaming business recently.The Xbox team undertook efforts to make more money in 2025, including raising Xbox console prices, hiking Game Pass membership costs, and releasing more of its games on rival platforms. Microsoft also laid off lots of people, canceled games, and closed studios. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said these cuts had to happen because of capitalism. Microsoft was also planning to charge $80 for new games this year, but canceled those plans. Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty said the Xbox team needs to run a \"healthy business,\" but this doesn't necessarily mean increases beyond $70 for new games.\"From our point of view, monetization just happens in so many different ways right now. So we're going to continue to listen to the feedback from fans. We're going to continue, to balance that with needing to run the healthy business. But right now, on the content side, we don't have any pricing updates,\" he said.Next year is poised to be a big one for Microsoft, as 2026 marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox and Halo. It's also the 40th anniversary of Bethesda, the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and the 30th anniversary of the original Diablo. Some are expecting Microsoft to also divulge new information about the company's new console in 2026, but that remains to be seen.Microsoft will host an Xbox Developer Direct event in January 2026 where it will show off some of what's coming to Xbox in 2026, but not everything.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In the span of a week, Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was named Game of the Year by both The Game Awards and The Indie Game Awards. But just two days after its latest win, The Indie Game Awards stripped Expedition 33 of its two wins over the developer's use of AI.\"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself,\" reads a statement on The Indie Game Awards' official site (via Insider Gaming). \"When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.\"Following that decision, The Indie Game Awards named Blue Prince as its new Game of the Year. Sorry We're Closed was given the award for Debut Game, which Expedition 33 previously claimed.During a feature run on El Pais in July 2025, Expedition 33 producer François Meurisse said, \"We use some AI, but not much. The key is that we were very clear about what we wanted to do.\" Following the release of that article, Sandfall Interactive released the following statement:\"The studio states that it was in contact with El Pais on April 25--three months prior to this publication. During these exchanges, Sandfall Interactive indicated that it had used a limited number of pre-existing assets, notably 3D assets sourced from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. None of these assets were created using artificial intelligence.\"Additionally, Sandfall states that the only AI-created assets in the game were placed as \"temporary placeholder textures\" that were missed during Expedition 33's QA process. Once the assets were identified, they were \"removed within five days\" and replaced by the intended textures.So far, the controversy doesn't seem to have dimmed Expedition 33's popularity. The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, congratulated Sandfall for its success at The Game Awards. Those awards gave Expedition 33 a massive boost on Steam and consoles. That increase may have also been fueled in part by a new DLC for Expedition 33 that dropped immediately after The Game Awards.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

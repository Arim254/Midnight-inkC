This information was disclosed on the game's Steam page, but also applies to the console editions.Once the servers go dark, \"all game functions requiring online servers will no longer function.\"2K Sports actually first confirmed the server shutdown on December 8, but it wasn't widely reported on until more recently. The game's offline modes like Play Now and Showcase will remain available after the servers go dark.All virtual currency, along with DLC and add-ons, will be removed from sale on January 31, 2026, along with the game itself, as mentioned.WWE 2K24 was released in March 2024, so the servers will have been online for about two years. The impending closure is a bummer for people who want to keep playing online, but this kind of thing is not uncommon in the world of sports games and beyond, for 2K and other publishers.In September this year, 2K shut off the online servers for The Golf Club 2019 and PGA Tour 2K21. The newest WWE 2K game, WWE 2K25, was released in March 2025.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

In its place, indie-darling Blue Prince was declared the new Game of the Year winner. Now, publisher Raw Fury wants to make sure everyone knows that Blue Prince wasn't made with AI of any kind.In a statement released on X, Raw Fury credited Tonda Ros and his team for a game that \"was built and crafted with full human instinct ... It is the result of eight years of development [fueled] by imagination and creativity, and we are extremely proud of what Tonda has achieved.\"For people that need confirmation: There is no AI used in Blue Prince.

Jones, a man who is set to inherit a mysterious mansion called the Mt. Holly Estate following the death of his great uncle Herbert S. Sinclair. There are 45 rooms known to be in the mansion, and Simon has to find the hidden 46th room in order to claim his inheritance. However, the layout of the mansion changes each night, and Simon largely has to start from scratch if he can't find it in time.The game also allows Simon to investigate mysteries that are more closely linked to his own past than he initially suspects. Not every mystery in the game is solved, but that only adds to the emotional impact of the entire narrative. Blue Prince was also one of 2025's best-reviewed games.In May, Ros was very clear that Blue Prince will not receive any DLC or expansions in the future.\"It had always been my dream to release a definitive version of the game at launch,\" wrote Ros. \"I'm a big fan of complete standalone experiences and it was never my plan to continually tinker with the game with regular content updates, room rebalancing, or DLC and the like.\"Blue Prince is out now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Fortnite's latest Winterfest celebration kicked off with the usual array of map and gameplay changes in Battle Royale and piles of free stuff in the Winterfest cabin. But that's not all there is to care about in Fortnite's latest update--we've also got a pair of new sets of quests that reward XP, and an additional free cosmetic that must be earned by completing a specific one of those new quests. Let's take a look at what we've got here.Not all of the Winterfest quests are currently available. As of December 20, only the first two sets of quests are available. Table of Contents [hide]Winterfest 2025 questsDrop 1 - Gift to the StarsCollect a Perfect Gift from a chestBring a Perfect Gift to any characterDamage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)Drop 2 - Passion for PresentsBring a Prefect Gift to The Bride, Carter Wu, or KingstonTravel 60 distance with Icy FeetSearch 5 chests at Clawsy Lodge or Tiptop TerraceSquad Up! questsWinterfest 2025 questsThe first of these new quests sets, listed under Winterfest in your quest log, are for Battle Royale. There are four time-gated groups of this set of quests--the first group is available now, and the rest will be added periodically. Completing a quest awards 12K XP each, and there may be a reward at the end of the questline--but we don't know for sure yet. These quests expire when Winterfest ends on January 5.Drop 1 - Gift to the StarsCollect a Perfect Gift from a chestEvery chest you open during Winterfest has a change to drop an item called Perfect Gift, which triggers a quest to deliver it to any non-hostile NPC on the map within five minutes. But for this quest, you just have to collect the item. Fortunately, the Perfect Gift does not require one of your inventory slots.Bring a Perfect Gift to any characterThis quest requires you deliver one of these Perfect Gifts to an NPC. They all work, so pick whichever is most convenient. To see which NPC is closest to you, pull up your map menu, and switch to the Characters tab, which will show you where every NPC lives.Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)You will need to cause 500 points of damage to any boss NPC for this one--and we mean the NPCs specifically. Players who have used a boss token to disguise themselves as bosses don't count for this.Drop 2 - Passion for PresentsBring a Prefect Gift to The Bride, Carter Wu, or KingstonIt's the same process from the previous batch of quests, but you'll need to deliver to one of these specific NPCs. The BRide lives at Sandy Strip, Carter Wu is a hireable NPC at Latte Landing, and Kingston is chilling near the beach at Bumpy Bay.Travel 60 distance with Icy FeetIcy Feet are a movement item that let slip and slide where you need to go very quickly, and they're a lot handier than you might think since you can activate and deactivate them at will. The distance required isn't very much, so this shouldn't take long.Search 5 chests at Clawsy Lodge or Tiptop TerraceThese locations are on either side of Wonkeeland, and you'll need to open chests specifically--ammo boxes and veggie boxes won't do it.Squad Up! questsIn addition to the main Winterfest quests, there's an additional set of very simple quests that simply require you to find Shiny Llamas in the Squads version of Battle Royale, Reload, OG, or Blitz. These Shiny Llamas have a random chance to drop any time you open a rare chest or supply drop, or when you defeat an enemy player or NPC. You'll receive 12K XP for every 100 of them that you collect, until you've collected 1,000 of them. You won't have to compete with your teammates for them, though, because any Shiny Llamas collected by any squad member counts for all four of you.Which is good, because there's also a cosmetic reward for these quests. Collecting 400 of these Shiny Llamas will earn you the Starbrite Slasher pickaxe, which has been sitting in the Fortnite game files collecting dust for nearly two years. You'll want to pay particular attention to this quest if you purchased the Lego starter pack that includes the Brite Agent skin, since this is the first time it's been possible to get the pickaxe that belongs to her set.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

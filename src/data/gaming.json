    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 29, 2025 at 4:35PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Do you plan on completing The Pursuit of the Partite Pentaptych in The Outer Worlds 2? This side quest takes place in Golden Ridge on the planet of Dorado, which is pretty much the second major/open-world area in the campaign. You do need to look for specific items, and the game doesn't even tell you where they can be found.All five mural locations in The Outer Worlds 2 - Golden RidgeYour goal in The Pursuit of the Partite Pentaptych, as the term sort of implies, is to find the five murals scattered all over the region. At best, you're told that these can be acquired from tram stations. The only problem is that the Golden Ridge is a blasted wasteland, and most of the railways are already destroyed.Golden Ridge mural locations mapIn any case, if you want to complete the Pursuit of Partite Pentaptych in The Outer Worlds 2, then you can check the map above. It shows the locations of all five murals in the region. We've numbered them accordingly starting from Alexandra Station Entrance, which is where your ship lands upon arriving in this zone.Mural location #1: Alexandra Station EntranceThe first mural essentially starts the quest itself. Simply exit your ship and go around to the interior of the station that's adjacent to the landing. You should see the mural on the wall. In front of it is a lore entry that tells you about the events that are being depicted. Anyway, just interact with the mural fragment with a darker hue to pick up the item.Mural location #2: Guardian EstatesSave for the fifth and final item, you can pick up the next Golden Ridge murals in The Outer Worlds 2 in any order. For now, though, we recommend doing the following:Go to Matriarch's Mercy to continue the main quest. Don't forget to pick up the bounties at the terminal outside the main building.Head to the southwestern part of the map. It's where you'll be able to tag the Guardian Estates fast travel point. If you picked up the bounties, you should have a mission called \"Battle with the Beastly Brigands.\" It requires you to kill the Dunsany Brothers in the same area.Keep going up the hill until you see a tram station just before the large building. You'll find another mural inside. Don't forget to take out the Dunsany Brothers for the bounty reward, too.Mural location #3: Decommissioned Autonomous ExtractoriumFrom the previous location, head north until you arrive at the Decommissioned Autonomous Extractorium. You can actually recruit a companion named Aza inside the facility. As for the mural, it's inside a small building that's adjacent to the Extractorium.Mural location #4: N-Ray RangeIf you keep going north from the Extractorium, you'll come across the N-Ray Range. Venturing deeper into this facility is actually part of the main quest in this region, which is why we encouraged you to visit Matriarch's Mercy earlier. Here's a quick summary:You can find the N-Ray Scanner gadget in this facility. It allows you to see enemies, objects, and wiring through walls.The aforementioned companion, Aza, actually has a personal quest that you can undertake in this area.Dealing with the head honcho, Victor Clemens, is a key objective. Finishing this task eventually grants you access to the location of the fifth mural. (More on this shortly.)Now, for the item in this location, you need to continue exploring until you reach sub-level 2. Next, ride the elevator back to the top. The mural is in the chamber with the tramway. There's also a High Security Lockbox in the same room.Mural location #5: Alexandra MonasteryOnce you've finished the main objectives in Zyranium Manufactory VII and N-Ray Range, you should be ready for the next step in the main story:Return to Matriarch's Mercy and access the lift. This will take you to an instanced location/mini-dungeon called Alexandra Monastery.Proceed through the facility as normal, taking out enemies along the way. Eventually, you'll stumble upon a large garden area.The mural is inside the station at the right-hand side. Pick it up, and you should have all the Golden Ridge murals in The Outer Worlds 2.The Pursuit of Partite Pentaptych rewardsWhile you're tackling this quest and collecting murals, you've probably noticed a certain perk that pops up. This is the Art Enthusiast perk, which grants bonus XP to your character whenever companions defeat an enemy.At the conclusion of this quest, you'll have Art Enthusiast V--i.e. +10% XP from companion kills. It's a pretty decent way to gain levels quickly, especially if you also picked the Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome flaw. Oh, and all five mural pieces will also appear as decorations in the Incognito.That does it for our guide on how to complete The Outer Worlds 2 Pursuit of the Partitie Pentaptych quest. While you're at it, you might want to check these related topics:Alexandra Monastery puzzle - If you're still in Alexandra Monastery, you can solve a riddle to obtain a nifty reward.Character perks - Art Enthusiast is an additional perk, which means you don't need to spend a point to unlock it. Still, you might be curious about all the others that you can obtain in the game.Science Weekly Volumes - This is another collectible-type quest that you might've missed while exploring Eden/Paradise Island.Black market smugglers? Autocratic regimes? Rampaging Raptidons? Invisible cultists that can only be seen if you wear special goggles? These shenanigans need not cause any alarm because we've got you covered in our The Outer Worlds 2 guides hub.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jason Rodriguez\n   on October 29, 2025 at 12:47PM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Are you thinking twice about whether you should side with Milverstreet or Kaur in The Outer Worlds 2? These two characters both lead their contingents in the town of Fairfield, but they just can't get along. That said, the person that you support will also assist you as you make your way to the Vox Relay. Our guide has all the details, but be forewarned that there are minor spoilers ahead.The Saboteur of Paradise quest guideBefore we get to the meat and potatoes, here's a quick summary on what you can expect when dealing with Milverstreet and Kaur:An early-game main quest called \"The Saboteur of Paradise\" tasks you with entering the Vox Relay. You can approach this objective through various means, including general exploration. However, it's also possible to gain help from the aforementioned NPCs.Minister Milverstreet and Acquisitions Officer Kaur are both inside the large building in Fairfield. They're members of the Auntie's Choice faction, but they have different preferences when it comes to solving their dilemmas. Milverstreet prefers subterfuge and a more conniving approach. Kaur, meanwhile, wants direct, in-your-face combat.You can talk to Milverstreet first and say that you'll think about his offer. Then, you can talk to Kaur to hear her out. Once you've made up your mind, talk to the NPC that you want to support to begin their quest chain. This locks you out of the other NPC's side missions and rewards.You need to make a major decision upon reaching the end of the Vox Relay. This can lead to a drastic outcome that affects both Milverstreet and Kaur, as well as other inhabitants of Fairfield.Minister Milverstreet's quests and rewardsIf you choose to side with Milverstreet instead of Kaur in The Outer Worlds 2, then you have to complete the following tasks:Quest 1: \"A Refreshing Bit of News\" - This takes place in the Ministry of Accuracy to the west of Fairfield. You need to find information about a certain \"Mental Refreshment.\" Take note that a recruitable companion, Inez Silang, can also be found in the Ministry of Accuracy.Quest 2: \"The Brain Benders of Auntie's Choice\"- Milverstreet wants you to convince the townsfolk of Westport to relocate to Fairfield. Note that there's another side quest called \"The Saga of Malfunctioning Mechanicals\" that you might want to tackle.Once you've completed the second quest, Milverstreet finally relents with his part of the deal. He'll then whisk you away to the Vox Relay to continue with the main quest. As far as rewards go:The first quest nets you the Topmost Coat. It looks snazzy but it's just a regular item.The second quest nets you the Limited Edition Gentleperson's Oxonian. This is one of several unique helmets in the game. Its mod, Marketing Manager, causes companion abilities to charge +10% faster. The effect scales up to 30% based on your Speech skill.Officer Kaur's quests and rewardsConversely, siding with Kaur instead of Milverstreet in The Outer Worlds 2 leads you to other locations:Quest 1: \"Above and Beyond Repair\" - The goal is to head to the Euphoria Coast Automech Repair Center.  If you're unable to gain access to the facility even via skill checks, then you still need to visit the Ministry of Accuracy to obtain a gate pass.The Automech Repair Center is also where you can acquire the Gas Energy Deflection Apparatus. Just like other gadgets in the game, it consumes energy when activated. But it does have a nifty effect, since it allows you to pass through Zyronium gas clouds and poison fields.As for the quest itself, you can either sabotage the facility or help the soldiers. We recommend choosing a peaceful route just to obtain additional items.Quest 2: \"Ascent in the Howling Tower\" - Next up, Kaur will send you to Skycutter A102, which is north of the Ministry of Accuracy. Initially, you'll climb on ladders since the lift isn't working. Then, upon reaching deck 6, you'll be able to call on the lift, though it also causes numerous Raptidons to spawn. Upon reaching the outer walkway, you can fire a pulse that destroys most of the mechs in the Vox Relay.In terms of rewards, here's what you'll get if you buddied up with Kaur:You'll receive Kaur's Kuirass after finishing the first quest. This is a unique armor that has the Adrenaline Shot mod--i.e. Reduce toxicity levels by -1 whenever you take damage. This effect scales based on your Medical skill.Continuing that trend, you'll obtain the Kaur's Korroder after completing the second quest. This is a unique weapon that has the Infection mod--i.e. Goo projectiles bounce off surfaces and apply a Corrosion effect. The spread is improved based on your Science skill.But wait, what about Inez Silang?As mentioned earlier, Inez does show up in the Ministry of Accuracy. You're bound to meet her if you're doing Milverstreet's first quest. Alternatively, if you sided with Kaur and you need an access card to enter the Automech Repair Center, then you'll be heading to the Ministry of Accuracy anyway.What's important is this: After you talk to talk to Inez, she'll say that she's going back to Fairfield. Complete the main objective in the ministry, then fast travel back to Fairfield. You'll see Inez accosting Milverstreet for short-changing her. Choose non-antagonistic dialogue responses when talking to Inez. She'll then move near the entrance, where you can recruit her as a companion.The point-of-no-return in FairfieldWhether you sided with Milverstreet or Kaur in The Outer Worlds 2, you'll still end up in the Vox Relay sooner or later. The pivotal moment that we cited takes place after you defeat a boss named Brigadier Montelli. In the next room, you suddenly learn that the Vox Relay is about to launch. You have to redirect its flight so that it crashes elsewhere.This is important: If the Vox Relay crashes into Fairfield, then all the inhabitants, including Milverstreet and Kaur, will die. If you weren't able to recruit Inez earlier, then she'll perish as well. Your only recourse is to either send the facility crashing into Westport or have it explode in space. If you want to learn about all the options and ramifications, then you can head over to our Vox Relay guide.Black market smugglers? Autocratic regimes? Rampaging Raptidons? Invisible cultists that can only be seen if you wear special goggles? These shenanigans need not cause any alarm because we've got you covered in our The Outer Worlds 2 guides hub.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The age of AI has barely begun, but there are some in the industry who see it as an absolute necessity for the future. Electronic Arts, for example, has reportedly instructed its employees to treat AI as \"thought partners\" in every aspect of game creation. However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick isn't buying into the hype, and he doesn't believe AI will ever be able to compete with Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto games.\"Let's say there were no constraints [on AI],\" said Zelnick during an appearance on CNBC. \"Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the Grand Theft Auto marketing plan? The answer is no. A, you can't do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn't end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative.\"Zelnick went on to explain that AI can't innovate, because it's \"backward-looking\" by design and its predictive models are built on things that have already been created, rather than anything new.This isn't the first time Zelnick has shared his feelings about AI, and he's been fairly consistent over the years. Earlier this month, Zelnick made a point of saying that people overstate what AI can do.Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently disclosed that his company primarily uses AI for security purposes, but he didn't rule out its role in game creation. Meanwhile, Microsoft is attempting to fully integrate AI and voice commands into Windows 11 machines. Video game developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield have both stated that AI tools should be embraced in game creation. A recent survey also found that over 50% of Japanese game publishers utilize AI in some way.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

The new island features four named locations based on the town of Hawkins, Indiana, as well as a border right down the middle separating the normal world from locations that have been corrupted by the Upside Down--essentially giving the map a pair of distinct biomes, something that Blitz hasn't done before since its map is already so little.The map and the new item shop skins based on Vecna and the original four boys are the entirety of this takeover--there aren't any new Stranger Things weapons added to the loot pool or anything like that. That's fine, because between the ongoing Simpsons season and the imminent launch of Chapter 7, we've already got plenty of new mechanics to worry about.Scroll on for looks at the full new map and each of the named locations.As you can see, the island is split in half between the regular part in the west and the Upside Down part in the east, with each half getting two of the major locations. While the Upside Down half is always dark and spooky, the normal half of the island has the usual day/night cycle.Gnarly FarmsStranger SuburbsLibrary LandingHawkins HeightsHawkins Heights includes this movie theater sign and marquee teasing the Chapter 6 finale event that's taking place on Saturday, November 29. Fun fact: Despite the sign indicating otherwise, there's no movie theater on this map.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                We are fast approaching the end to another Fortnite chapter, and that means it's nearly time for a huge live event that will introduce a new era for Epic Games' metaverse. It's Fortnite's biggest party, typically drawing its biggest concurrent player numbers by a wide margin each year. In 2023 it drew more than 11 million players, and 2024's event pulled more than 14 million.And with this year's chapter finale, titled Zero Hour, looking like it's going to rope in every collab Fortnite had over the past 365 days while also picking up old storylines that Fortnite abandoned years ago, this one's looking like quite a doozie.The Fortnite Chapter 6 finale event looks like it'll be quite a spectacle.When is Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale event going down?The live finale event, which will only take place one time, will begin at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET on Saturday, November 29.You'll be able to join the mode 40 minutes prior to start time, which likely means there will be some sort of pre-show entertainment. Prior to the event at the end of Star Wars season back in June, there was an X-Wing vs TIE Fighter PvP space flight sim for players to enjoy before the main event, so these things can get pretty elaborate.Will Fortnite go offline afterward?Yes. You can expect that Fortnite's servers will go offline for the Chapter 7 update once the event ends. But if all goes well, Fortnite should only be down for about 4-7 hours. Expect Chapter 7 to start in the evening on November 29.Fortnite Chapter 6: Zero Hour live event teaserEpic has offered a cinematic teaser for the event, and it looks like a lot. Check it out.          What can we expect to happen during the Zero Hour event?Based on the teaser, we're going to get some kind of Avengers: Endgame-level confrontation with Chapter 6's ultimate big bad, whose tentacles have made sporadic appearances throughout the chapter. All the past year's Fortnite collabs will team up like it's the end of Ready Player One, and then whatever happens will usher in the Chapter 7 island.We're expecting characters from tons of different IPs that collabed with Fortnite in the past year to show up, with Godzilla x Kong, Star Wars, Halo, K-Pop Demon Hunters, Hatsune Miku, Power Rangers, TMNT, and Superman already being teased. Likewise, at least two upcoming Chapter 7 collabs--Kill Bill and Back to the Future--will also have parts to play.But Zero Hour won't just be about the collabs. The Fortnite original superhero group known as the Seven are almost guaranteed to make their return during this event. None of the members of the Seven have been seen since the end of Chapter 3, so it's been a while.The big question is whether they'll be the same versions of the characters as before. We've already had two different versions of The Paradigm, who were entirely different characters from alternate realities, so we might get to meet a new version of The Foundation not played by Dwayne Johnson. But there have been no rumors either way on that front just yet, so we'll have to wait and see.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Earlier this year, Hytale was canceled after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and purchased all of the rights for Hytale from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale will retail for $20. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.\"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible,\" wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. \"I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast.\"Collins-Laflamme added that he wants to attract as many players as possible, even during rough economic times. Hypixel has also released a post detailing how far along the modding feature is. The short answer is there's still a lot of work to be done. For now, Hytale doesn't have a release date, but Collins-Laflamme has implied that the game's early-access period will begin relatively soon.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

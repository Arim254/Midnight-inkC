    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                With Borderlands 4 being a Borderlands game, you'll inevitably come across a piece a gear that just won't shut up. Borderlands 2 had The Bane, a unique submachine gun that screamed incessantly; meanwhile, Borderlands 3 had The Unkempt Harold, a legendary pistol that made illogically funny statements. Borderlands 4 is no different, with the legendary shield Cindershelly treating you like a sub to its dom. But, apparently, this armament wasn't supposed to bark smutty lines as often as Gearbox Software coded it to.Borderlands 4's October 23 update made an assortment of changes while also adding a Halloween event to the looter-shooter. Buried within the lengthy patch notes, and spotted by PC Gamer, was one curiously sly adjustment: Cindershelly's voice lines won't trigger as frequently, so that the shield will be less distracting. That doesn't sound like anything special, but when you consider how horny the shield was and how often it catcalled, you'd think that maybe you were getting hit on the entire time you ventured around the world of Kairos.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Borderlands 4 Video Review\n      \nAs PC Gamer noted, some of the voice lines were especially raunchy. Cindershelly would say things like \"Touch that barrel and scream for me\" and \"Don't stop till I allow it.\" The legendary shield would then keep going, telling you to \"Show me how close you can get, worm,\" and \"Worship me.\" Apparently, it got worse in combat, as these lines would trigger when doing or taking damage, which happens all the time in a Borderlands game.Cindershelly was built by the Order, a weapons manufacturer for The Timekeeper's army. The shield is a random loot drop, like most gear in Borderlands 4, but you have a greater chance of finding it from The Backhive in The Fadefields' Auger Mine in the Dissected Plateau. It's a solid piece of loot that grants you damage reduction and emits an AOE blast that deals damage once it breaks, based on your Resolve stacks. And now, it's gotten that much better because you'll likely get less turned on since it won't sexily insult you as much--if getting turned on by pixels is a thing you're into.Cindershelly isn't the only horny piece of gear in the franchise. Borderlands 2 had the effervescent sniper Hot Mama that, like Borderlands 4's super-horny shield, spoke suggestive innuendos at you while gunning goons down. Welcome to the Goonerlands, everyone, I guess.Borderlands 4 is out now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. A Nintendo Switch 2 port is in the works, but has been pushed out of its October 3 release to ensure it meets the quality Gearbox Software expects of it.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                According to Shawn Layden, a live-service game \"isn't really a game.\" The former PlayStation executive said in an interview that a live-service game is better described as a \"repetitive action engagement device.\"Then what is a game? Speaking to The Ringer, Layden said a game needs three elements. \"I need a story, I need a character, and I need a world,\" he said. \"And Horizon, God of War, and Uncharted have all three of those things,\" he said. \"If you're doing a live-service game, you just need a repetitive action that most people can get their head around, an ability to communicate in that world with other like-minded people, and [the player's] desire to do it again and again and again.\"Layden left Sony in 2019. He hasn't said exactly why he left, but explained in the interview that live-service was \"not my skillset.\" At the time, Sony was investing heavily in live-service and was planning to release a dozen live-service games by 2026. Sony later cut that projection in half, and some of the titles it has released, like Concord, failed spectacularly. Others, like Helldivers 2, have been enormously successful.Researcher Joost van Dreunen told The Ringer that Sony's misses in the live-service department \"sting, but they're not fatal.\" He said, \"Even if live-service fizzles, the PS5 business is strong. The real risk isn't collapse--it's wasted time and money that could've gone into what Sony already does best.\"Sony has invested more than $1.45 billion into Fortnite developer Epic Games, so the company likely stands to benefit as Fortnite continues to grow and grow. Sony is also continuing to invest in its own live-service projects, and the next big release is Bungie's Marathon. The game has already had a rocky road to release, though, as it was delayed indefinitely and is caught up in an art theft scandal.For his part, Layden said companies should not look to live-service to help turn their businesses around. \"If you're trying to go into that space because you have this illusion in your mind of big sacks of money coming every day for the rest of your life, for most it doesn't happen,\" he said.In 2023, one of PlayStation's most important people, Connie Booth, left the company after 30+ years. She has never explained her departure, but former PlayStation developer David Scott Jaffe, the creator of Twisted Metal and co-creator of God of War, said Booth was fired.\"She was fired. She was not let go. She didn't retire. She didn't quit. She was fired,\" Jaffe said.Jaffe went on to say that former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan gave a mandate for PlayStation's teams to make more games-as-a-service titles, which in turn reportedly upset a number of PlayStation developers. \"All of this was somehow blamed on Connie,\" Jaffe said. \"The blame has fallen on Connie.\"One Sony live-service game that is not going forward is Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Online, which Neil Druckmann said was the company's most ambitious game ever. A live-service God of War game was reportedly planned at one point as well before apparently getting canceled.Another upcoming live-service game from Sony is Fairgame$, but Sony has been quiet on the project of late, even as multiple senior staff have left, including the founder of its development studio. Despite all of this, Sony has said time and time again that it remains committed to live-service and has learned from the mistakes of Concord.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Warner Bros. has launched a \"For Your Consideration\" website for Minecraft, listing off all the categories that the film studio believes Minecraft should be considered for.This includes numerous categories, including Best Picture, Best Director for Jared Hess, and Best Actor for Jack Black. WB also put forward Jason Momoa and Sebastian Hansen for Best Supporting Actor and Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, and Jennifer Coolidge for Best Supporting Actress.WB also is campaigning voters to pick Minecraft for things like Best Casting, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Production Designer, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Original Score, Best Original Songs, and Best Adapted Screenplay.Beyond Minecraft, WB is urging voters to consider films like Weapons, Superman, Sinners, and Mickey 17 for the next Academy Awards, which take place in March 2025. The nominees will be announced in January 2026.Film studios like WB are known to spend money on Academy Award campaigns under the For Your Consideration heading. A Minecraft Movie may not immediately come to mind as an Oscar contender, but WB may think otherwise. Spending money on For Your Consideration ads also helps A Minecraft Movie find repeat viewers or a new audience now that it's available on streaming and home video.A Minecraft Movie more than $950 million worldwide. It's the No. 2 highest-grossing video game movie of all time, and the No. 69 highest-grossing movie of all time for all films ever released.A sequel is now in the works for 2027, with director Jared Hess coming back. The sequel could focus on the character Alex, who was teased at the end of the film. Alex would be joined by Jack Black's character, Steve, in a potential sequel, Hess said.For more, check out GameSpot's A Minecraft Movie review.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

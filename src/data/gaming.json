    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 1, 2025 at 8:16AM PDT    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Fortnite's Simpsons season is finally here after many months of rumors, and in some ways, it's a lot more involved than previous mini-seasons. That's because it's the first of them to take place on a completely new and original island. While the other November mini-seasons took place on updated versions of old maps, and Star Wars season just added Star Wars places to the Battle Royale map, Simpsons season is introducing a totally new, cel-shaded island based on Springfield and various iconic locations from the series for us to fight over in November.At least one sacrifice was made to make this map happen. This island is a little bit smaller than the current Battle Royale map, and as a result, it uses a smaller player cap than usual at 80 players instead of 100. But that's not necessarily the worst thing, as the smaller island should mean faster and more exciting rounds, and also they might be able to keep it around as a Reload map after the season ends, which would make all this effort a little more worthwhile.The new island includes nine major, named locations, like the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and it's filled with gimmicks, like how each round will have one randomly activated event that players can race to complete for great loot. These are the new map spots:Springfield Nuclear Power PlantCletus' Corn HoleKamp KrustyBurns ManorSpringfield Town SquareMayor's MunchiesDonut DistrictEvergreen TerraceSpringfield SlurpworksAs you can see, Epic essentially broke Springfield up into several smaller pieces and spread them around. I shudder to think of how many Easter Eggs this map must be filled with. Scroll on for closer looks at some of the major locations and landmarks you'll find around the map. And before you ask--yes, these are all actual Fortnite screenshots.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on November 1, 2025 at 8:45AM PDT\n              \n          \n                The day has finally arrived--after months and months of leaks and rumors, Fortnite's Simpsons season launches today. Just not quite yet, because Fortnite is offline for maintenance following the \"Welcome, Our Alien Overlords\" event, during which players were treated to a Simpsons short film that explained how they ended up being a part of the Fortnite omniverse.As is standard operating procedure for Epic, Fortnite goes offline when it's time for a major update. While this usually happens during the middle of the night on a weekday, this season launch is a special event, and as such, it'll kick off on a Saturday evening. That's why it's offline for maintenance now--Epic wants the launch of Fortnite x Simpsons to arrive during primetime on a Saturday night.          When is Fortnite Simpsons season expected to launch?Epic is planning to bring Fortnite back online for The Simpsons season at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET, though that time is an estimate and not set in stone. In reality, Fortnite maintenance rarely ends on schedule, as it's simply done when it's done--which actually often means sooner than expected. Fortnite maintenance usually lasts between four and seven hours, and the planned start time here splits the difference exactly at 5.5 hours of downtime. So don't be surprised if the season starts a little before or a little after that time.When the season does start, everything will be different. This Fortnite x Simpsons event is introducing an entirely new cel-shaded map based on Springfield from the series, and it'll have a Simpsons-themed battle pass and revamped loot pool. This may just be Fortnite's most thorough collaboration ever.

Finally, though, the time has come, and The Simpsons season is starting on the evening of Saturday, November 1. And it's one of the biggest Fortnite takeovers we've ever seen, with a Simpsons-themed battle pass, and entirely new cel-shaded map for Battle Royale, and a totally revamped loot pool--all for a season that lasts just a month.So, yeah, there's a lot going on here. Let's run through everything we know about so far--which is a lot, because Epic let a bunch of influencers play the new season and they've been sharing their content. Just keep in mind there's likely to be plenty of surprises in store as the season goes on.Fortnite x Simpsons battle passThis Simpsons-themed battle pass, which lasts for just a month, includes five skins. Three of them are Simpsons characters--Homer, Marge, and Ned Flanders--with the other two being Simpsons-fied versions of Fortnite characters Peely and Fishstick. Each of the skins has alternate styles, like Evil Homer and Witch Marge. The new Peely is the time-gated bonus skin--all the Simpsons characters are in the linear part of the pass.While it's smaller than a normal battle pass, the Simpsons pass still costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and you can also unlock it by subscribing to Fortnite Crew.Fortnite x Simpsons new mapThe Chapter 6 island is gone, and it's been replaced with a slightly smaller map based on Springfield, the hometown of the Simpsons, which has a capacity of 80 players--down from the usual 100. The whole map is cel-shaded and full of well-known locations from the show, like Moe's Tavern, the Qwik-E-Mart, and the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.New Fortnite x Simpsons loot poolWith a couple of notable exceptions, the weapons making up this season's arsenal are existing Fortnite guns, while you take care of your health and shield needs with a pile of new Simpsons-themed items.The new Simpsons weapon is Mr. Blasty, a revolver with an exotic variant that attaches balloons to anyone you shoot with it. There's also the mythic Jebediah's Protective Helm, which protects you from a single headshot from any weapon.And there are a variety of healing items, some of which come with fun bonus effects--like how the Super Squishee makes you faster and gives you unlimited sprint, and eating a Blinky fish gives you temporary teleportation powers. There are more mundane healing items too, like Duff splashes and Krusty Burgers.Returning Fortnite weapons:Suppressed assault rifleStriker ARTactical ShotgunThunder ShotgunRanger ShotgunCompact SMGInfantry RifleSuppressed PistolShockwave GrenadesSidekicksStarting during the Simpsons season, you'll be able to buy little companions who will follow you around and emote sometimes. The first of these is Peels, a banana dog included in the Simpsons pass, and several others are slated to hit the item shop on November 7. No collab sidekicks have been announced yet, but some are surely on the way.But sidekicks have already inspired a lot of consternation amongst players, because you'll only be allowed to customize your sidekick's appearance once before locking it permanently. If you'd like to change, for example, your Raptor's scale color later, you'll have to buy it again. And judging by the rumored prices, doing so won't be cheap.Random in-match eventsEach match will include some sort of special event, like a meltdown at the Nuclear Power Plant, which will be revealed on the battle bus blimp at the start of each map. These events seem to be a bit more complicated than these sorts of Fortnite mechanics usually are, which is fun.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault asks you to choose from four weapon options at the start of a new game. These are just the base versions of the four weapon types, but you'll be using whichever weapon you pick for several runs before you can unlock another one, making this choice one you'll want to think about. In this guide, we'll break down which weapon is best in Moonlighter 2, so you aren't stuck with the wrong one for a good while.Merchant's SwordThe sword is considered a balanced weapon, offering a four-hit attack-pattern for its primary attack, with the final hit functioning as a finisher. The special move is a spinning attack, dealing damage in a circle around Will. If you use your special after three attacks, it transforms into a more powerful finisher.Merchant's Large SwordThe Large Sword has a slow attack pattern, but it also has the strongest attacks. The primary attack has a three-hit pattern and uses sharpness on every attack. Your special is a quick jab attack that is much weaker but restores sharpness. The Sharpness meter is broken up by chunks, and for each missing chunk, you deal less damage.There are four weapon types, and you can choose one of the base weapons at the start of Moonlighter 2.Merchant's SpearThe Spear offers a long-range attack but doesn't offer any width to its strikes. Using the primary attack spawns Spearheads, with the fourth attack dropping three Spearheads. Using the Spear's special ability, you can recall the Spearheads to you, dealing damage to enemies in their path.Merchant's GauntletsThe Gauntlets offer the fastest attack speed of the four weapon types. The primary attacks don't deal a ton of damage, but they build special meter. The special attack is slower and deals a ton of damage, and when your meter is full, it activates Berserk, which increases your attack speed and knockback.Which weapon should you choose?While most of the decision comes down to personal taste, I found the Large Sword to be the best of the bunch of the early runs in Moonlighter 2. The reduced attack speed isn't that much of a hindrance, and the much stronger attacks are worth the trade. Plus, you still have access to your gun, which can be used in the moments where a sword swing would take too long. You can unlock the rest of the base weapons by earning materials from monsters in Kalina, the first area you have access to.For more on Moonlighter 2, use our guides on finding the Kalina Treasure, getting more potions, and expanding your Moonlighter 2 inventory.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                How many relics you can carry back to town is incredibly important in Moonlighter 2, the roguelike shop management game. The more relics you can bring back with you, the more items you have to sell in the shop, which means more money in your pockets. Before you can upgrade your inventory, you'll need to meet an NPC during a run.How to expand your inventory space in Moonlighter 2To expand your inventory space, you will need to purchase additional slots from Sliver, an NPC who will come to town in the western section. You can meet Sliver fairly early into Moonlighter 2, but there is one requirement to get him to come to town. You need to first encounter Sliver during a run in Kalina. This isn't too difficult, as Kalina is the first area you have access to. All you need to do is find Sliver at a \"?\" room during a run. It's not guaranteed to be him, but there are only a handful of possible characters who can appear.You can unlock additional inventory slots, allowing you to carry even more relics.Once you've encountered him during a run, he will be present in town, where you can purchase inventory slots. The first slot costs 4,000 gold, with the second costing 8,000, increasing from there. There is also another row that becomes available after the first, but that requires crafting materials not currently present in the early access version at the time of writing. While you're at it, you'll also want to be sure to get more potions in Moonlighter 2.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

One of the best ways to extend your runs is to get more potion uses, which can be unlocked by speaking with an NPC in town. You can have up to five total potions, along with other potions-related upgrades, like improved healing. Here's how to unlock more potions in Moonlighter 2.How to get more potions in Moonlighter 2You can unlock up to five total potion uses for a single dungeon run.Potion upgrades can be purchased from Eris the witch, who is found next door to your shop, just to the south. Eris' upgrades are divided into four sections, unlocked through various means. The first one is available immediately, with the second awarded for reaching the 50,000 coin milestone with the Endless Vault.Once you have a panel unlocked, you need to spend both coins and various crafting materials, dropped by enemies in dungeons. The materials vary depending on the upgrades, although you typically unlock the area with the enemies you need to defeat before unlocking the new panel. Eris also offers other important potion upgrades, like increased healing and pedestals that restore potions during a dungeon.While there are a seemingly endless number of upgrades to purchase in Moonlighter 2, once you have access to the next potions upgrade, you should prioritize it, as having an additional potion will drastically improve your dungeon runs.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

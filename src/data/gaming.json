    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The increasing demand for AI among tech companies is one of the reasons why the global shortage of memory chips remains an ongoing issue. And while it's expected to adversely affect the production of smartphones, Samsung Electronics co-CEO T M Roh has warned that TVs and home appliances may also be hit by shortages and increased prices.\"As this situation is unprecedented, no company is immune to its impact,\" said Roh via Reuters. According to the report, Roh noted that TVs and home appliances will also feel the pinch from the shortages and he didn't rule out price hikes to compensate for them. Samsung is the biggest manufacturer of TVs in the world, and Roh said it the impact of the RAM shortages will be \"inevitable.\"The rise in consumer-electronic prices would also throw a large wrench in Microsoft's ongoing \"This Is an Xbox\" strategy, as smart TVs, including those made by Samsung, are among the growing list of platforms capable of playing Game Pass titles.The lone bright spot from Roh's comments is that he mentioned that Samsung is working with its production partners on strategies to minimize the impact of the memory shortages.A recent report suggests that Nvidia may take a different approach to the increasingly high GPU prices by resurrecting its previously discontinued GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs. That has yet to be confirmed by Nvidia, which phased out the GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs in favor of the 40 and 50 series GPUs, both of which were more expensive and more advanced.As for Samsung, the company touted its plans to use Google's Gemini AI in 800 million units this year, which will continue the need for RAM across its family of products.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Arc Raiders is all about looting and shooting your way through a map and hoping to make it back home safely to Speranza. Every moment counts, and every container in the game could end up having that item that makes all the stress of the run worth it. So, it makes sense you may be disappointed to come across a Security Breach locker you can't open. Anything at all could be in there just waiting for you to take it home, right? Well, you might need to put in some time to make it happen, but here's how you can get to opening Security Breach lockers in Arc Raiders.How to open Security Breach lockers in Arc RaidersBefore you'll be able to open any Security Breach lockers you stumble across, you'll first need to buy the aptly-named Security Breach skill from the skill tree. You can access the skill tree by selecting Raider > Skill Tree while in Speranza.The Security Breach skill is in the Survival path of the skill tree.The Security Breach skill is the final node in the Survival (red) path on the right of the skill tree. To unlock this skill, you'll need to place at least 36 points into the Survival path, which is a hefty investment. We'll get into whether it's worth it or not a bit further down.With the Security Breach skill unlocked, you can breach and search any Security Breach locker.Once you've purchased the Security Breach skill--presumably with your 37th skill point in the Survival path--you'll be able to breach any Security Breach locker in the game to have a look inside. You'll also now be able to search any of these lockers that have already been opened by other players--though it's not likely they've left much behind for you.Is the Security Breach skill worth it?Security Breach was once an invaluable skill, as Security Breach lockers very often contained purple weapons like Bobcats, Tempests, and Vulcanos. However, developer Embark nerfed this skill soon after launch to bring down the frequency at which these items dropped from the container. As such, it's worth asking whether it's still worth investing 37 total points into the Survival path of the skill tree.Security Breach lockers still often contain worthwhile loot despite the nerf.We'd argue it's still quite worth the investment to buy the Security Breach skill. While you won't find purple rarity weapons with nearly the same frequency, it's still a fantastic way to gain some fast and high-quality resources as you're looting throughout a map. These lockers will usually offer a green or blue gun, a few stacks of ammo, and a solid chance at gun parts or Mod Components. And, of course, there's still always a chance at one of those purple guns, so there's never harm in checking.Additionally, there are a lot of excellent skills in the Survival path that speed up looting, improve your weight limitations, and even allow for in-game crafting. With that in mind, you're not really wasting many skill points along the way to Security Breach.

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Phil Owen\n   on January 9, 2026 at 11:02AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                Well, this is different. Season 7 of Fortnite OG kicked off in December with a new OG pass--but unlike previous OG passes, half of this one was time-gated until January 9. The back half of the OG finally out now, and it turns out that Epic was just holding back additional styles for the skins in the first half of the pass. Sorry, everybody who got their hopes up (like we did) that a secret Ice King remix was coming.The Season 7 OG pass includes three remixes of skins from the Chapter 1 Season 7 battle pass--Voidwalker Lynx is unlocked instantly with a purchase of the pass, and you can earn Lt. Winter and Wonder Onesie by leveling up. Wonder Onesie has the most customization options of any OG pass skin thus far, as you can decorate her with any of the sprays or emoticons you have in your locker.Notably missing are the Ice King, who was Season 7's hero, and the Prisoner, who served as the season baddie. Midway through the original Season 7, the Ice King projected a gigantic magical phantom of himself standing over the island, and then unleashed a blizzard that coated the island in snow for several weeks. Presuming Fortnite OG will do that event again the way it has all the other Chapter 1 live events, it would make a lot of sense for a new Ice King skin to be on one of those hidden pages.Each of the three skins available in the Season 7 OG pass comes with a back bling, a pickaxe, a weapon wrap, a glider, and an emote. The pass costs 1,000 V-Bucks, and access to the pass is included while players are subscribed to Fortnite Crew, which costs $12 per month.

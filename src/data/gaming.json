    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Valve has unveiled its first look at its new gaming machines, including Steam Frame, a virtual reality headset that can handle VR and non-VR games. Apparently, Steam Frame is also being used as a way to bring Android games directly to Steam users.According to The Verge, Valve will support and encourage developers to bring Android apps to Steam. As part of this initiative, Valve will release a Steam Frame developer kit for developers who already use Android APKs for apps and VR headsets on Android phones.\"From the user's perspective, our preference is that they don't even have to think about it,\" explains Valve engineer Jeremy Selan. \"They just have their titles on Steam, they download them and hit play ... They're really VR developers who want to publish their VR content, and they're porting a mobile VR title where they're already familiar with how to make those APKs. They are now free to bring those to Steam, and they'll just work on this device.\"This seamless transition from Android to Steam is possible because Steam Frame uses an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, which can run the apps directly. That will allow the Android games and VR apps to be easily accessed on Steam Frame.In addition to Steam Frame, Valve announced a Steam Machine that can bring PC games to living rooms like a console, as well as a new Steam Controller. Valve hasn't disclosed pricing for any of its new Steam hardware yet, but hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told IGN that Steam Machine will likely be competitively priced to be an affordable alternative to consoles.\"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it,\" said Aldehayyat.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Chris Compendio\n   on November 12, 2025 at 1:11PM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                The first Super Mario Bros. animated movie pulled references from across Mario lore, and while The Super Mario Galaxy Movie wears its main inspiration in its title, the sequel will be no different. Even in the initial trailer for the upcoming movie, there were already several hints and nods to different Super Mario titles from the franchise's 40 years of history.This trailer gave us our first looks at Brie Larson's Princess Rosalina and Benny Safdie's Bowser Jr. But let's look at some of the smaller details in this first look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, which hits in theaters on April 3, 2026.Bowser paints Mario's Skeleton SuitThe first half of the trailer focuses on Bowser's surprising artistic ability, as he paints several pieces while confined to a tiny version of himself in a miniature of his castle. His latest work is an unflattering depiction of Mario as a skeleton, which bears a striking resemblance to Mario's Skeleton Suit in Super Mario Odyssey.That suit was one of the hardest outfits to obtain in Odyssey, costing 9999 coins.Bowser's other paintingsThat isn't all when it comes to Bowser's paintings--as he runs up the stairs of his mini castle, you can also spot some additional pieces, with one depicting smiling flowers from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and another with Bowser on his famous Koopa Klown Car. It looks like there's a painting of a Boo on the bottom left as well.With all of this artistic talent, we can't rule out the possibility that Bowser made all of the paintings in his castle himself for Super Mario 64. Although, all credit for the \"hot Bowser\" painting seen in the trailer should go to Illumination artist Renan Porto.The Star FestivalWhile we don't know yet what the inciting incident for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is, the trailer shows an event that resembles the Star Festival that kicks off the stories of Super Mario Galaxy and its direct sequel. The Star Festival occurs once a century, with a comet passing through the night sky and dropping Star Bits.The trailer shows several falling lights released by the comet, but it's unclear as of now if these are Star Bits.Launch StarsThe most common method of traversal in the Super Mario Galaxy games was through Launch Stars, and they make a notable appearance in the movie's trailer. While they have an ethereal glow in the movie that isn't present in the games, they appear to have the same function, launching Peach and Toad through the stars.Drip Drop GalaxyLevels in Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel were full of planetoids, and the first planetoid we see in the movie trailer is an aquatic one that resembles Drip Drop Galaxy from the first Galaxy game.The movie version features more foliage than what we saw in the game, and it appears to be populated by Bloopers instead of Cheep Cheeps, so this location might be more inspired by Drip Drop Galaxy than a direct reference.The Inverted Pyramid from Super Mario OdysseyMario and Luigi appear to be riding dirtbikes (as seen in the Mario Kart games) through a desert, and one shot of the trailer shows them driving towards a giant inverted pyramid. This greatly resembles the Inverted Pyramid in the Sand Kingdom of Super Mario Odyssey, though this one is slightly askew.Other pyramids are seen floating in the sky, so it's possible that the pyramid that Mario and Luigi are going toward had crashed down--sounds like a fun location for the characters to explore.Ninjis in a casinoPeach, in action movie fashion, fights an army of Ninjis in one scene in the trailer. Ninjis first showed up in Super Mario Bros. 2 (or Doki Doki Panic, technically), and they recently reappeared in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, most prominently in the Ninji Jump Party level.The battle appears to take place on top of a giant roulette, so this locale might have inspirations from a number of places in the Super Mario series, including Casino Delfino in Super Mario Sunshine or perhaps even Luigi's casino in the Super Mario 64 DS minigames.Bowser Jr., his magic paintbrush, and Wonder effectsBowser Jr. is making his big screen debut, and he's making use of the magic paintbrush he wreaked havoc with in the GameCube classic. One notable detail is that the paintbrush lacks Professor E. Gadd's logo, meaning that the paintbrush might have a different origin in the movie universe.And instead of taking the form of Shadow Mario like he did in Sunshine, Bowser Jr. instead resembles how he did in Super Mario Bros. Wonder when under the effects of a Wonder Flower, sporting a darker color scheme.MegalegThe Megaleg boss from the first Mario Galaxy game shows up at the end of the trailer, attempting to capture Princess Rosalina before she goes all Super Smash Bros. on it, demolishing the giant mech with ease. Megaleg was one of the first major bosses in the first Galaxy game, and he's relatively easy to dispatch.The main difference in the movie is that Megaleg is a voiced character, or perhaps another character is piloting Megaleg, though it's unknown exactly who the voice performer behind this imposing enemy is.Gusty Garden Galaxy musicAfter Rosalina destroys Megaleg using her magical powers, the trailer ends with part of the Gusty Garden Galaxy theme, one of the most iconic music tracks in the first Galaxy game.Composer Brian Tyler is returning to score The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, so we should expect the soundtrack to contain several leitmotifs and musical references to the two Super Mario Galaxy games, and likely from the larger Mario franchise.    \n  \n                      "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Even former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime was surprised by the somewhat sparse launch lineup of the Nintendo Switch 2.\"I wouldn't be completely honest if [I didn't say] from a business perspective, when I first saw that lineup, I scratched my head a little bit,\" said Fils-Aime--who served as Nintendo of America's president and chief operating officer from 2006 until he retired in 2019--during an interview with The Game Business. \"But I think certainly what I underestimated was the enhanced performance, the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, I think has been compelling. The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly Bananza was a key driver for them.\"When the original Switch launched in 2017, it was accompanied by The Legend of Zelda: Breathe of the Wild and joined later in the year by Super Mario Odyssey. Switch 2's big launch title was Mario Kart World in June 2025, followed by Donkey Kong Bananza a month later. But while many didn't consider those games to be system sellers, they were both hits with players and critics alike.Fils-Aime attributed the success of the Switch 2 launch to Nintendo's global team and noted that \"being able to successfully launch a new system after you've had historical success with the prior system is quite a challenge.\" He pointed to several examples of that, including Nintendo following the Wii with the less successful Wii U.Earlier this year, Fils-Aime appeared to disagree with Nintendo's decision to charge $10 for the Switch 2 Welcome Pack. As a contrast, he compared it to his decision to release Wii Sports as an included title for Wii consoles in North America. In 2022, Fils-Aime predicted that the large number of studio acquisitions by Sony and Microsoft would lead to senior designers breaking away and launching their own innovative games. There have been some high-profile directors and designers that left larger companies, but Fils-Aime noted a lack of innovation during his new interview.\"I do hope that this industry doesn't stagnate,\" said Fils-Aime. \"There are, at times, signs that the innovation isn't there. The breakthrough new type of content seems to be a little bit further and far between. That concerns me, and I hope that doesn't stop.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com\n      \n      \n    "

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the Vedal987 Twitch channel within a limited time.Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a Minecraft Hardcore run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can \"see\" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model.Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record.          When Neuro beat the world record for the first time, she was rewarded with a global emote from Twitch--one which can be used anywhere on the platform, by anyone, whether they're following her channel or not. She's the first streamer to consecutively hold two Twitch Hype Train world records, so it remains to be seen whether a similar protocol will follow this achievement.After beating her world record again, Vedal prompted Neuro to comment on the achievement. \"I'm speechless,\" she said. \"I'm blown away by the amount of support. Thank you so much everyone.\" Vedal had some further comments, adding, \"This has changed my life completely. I'm very grateful that I have the opportunity to do something cool like this and that you guys are here to support it, but I do not deserve it.\" Neuro was quick to dispel her creator's self-doubt though, saying, \"It doesn't matter whether you think you deserve it. What matters is that you've created something unique, and people are willing to support that.\" The wholesome exchange stopped short of Vedal telling Neuro he loves her too, though. Shame.As it stands, Neuro-Sama's subathon is now set to end in around 345 hours. You can watch the rest of her antics on Vedal987's Twitch channel.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

It is also a great time to meet up and reconnect with those faces you may not have seen in a while, or just time to unwind and relax. Either way, games are a great way to spend newfound time off, and luckily, 2025 saw the release of some wonderful titles that can appeal to whatever sort of gaming relaxation you are looking for.Whether you're looking for a game to boot up at a party or something to put on and escape into as a blizzard rages outside, here are 10 games that are great to check out this holiday.Super Mario Party JamboreeNothing screams holidays quite like getting together again with your friends or family and screaming at them for stealing your stars in a Mario Party game. The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.Read our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree hereCall of Duty: Black Ops 72) Call of Duty Black Ops 7When work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.Read our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hereDragon Quest I & II HD-2D RemakeWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.Read our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake hereClair Obscur: Expedition 33Few games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.Read our review of Expedition 33 here.Sonic Racing: CrossworldsI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.Read our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds hereSplit FictionIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.Read our review of Split Fiction here.Ball X PitThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.Read our review of Ball X Pit hereBlue PrinceIf you are more in the mood to keep your mind sharp over vacation, then step inside the ever-shifting rooms of Blue Prince. In this mind-bending game that mixes puzzles with a clever mystery you need to solve, you will need to count your steps and solve puzzles in the various rooms of the mysterious manor in an effort to discover Room 46. Every time you step inside, your route will be different, with each door leading to a new place with new challenges to solve. Blue Prince is one of 2025's best brain-busting titles and a great way to spend your downtime this holiday.Read our review of Blue Prince herePeakWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.Check out a bit of the history behind Peak hereSuper Smash Bros. UltimateWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!Read our review of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate here    \n  \n                      "

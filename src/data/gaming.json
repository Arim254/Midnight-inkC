    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \nAvowed doesn't allow slain enemies to respawn and is all the better for it.By \n    Kenneth Seward Jr.\n   on January 1, 2026 at 6:00AM PST\n              \n                Obsidian's Avowed is one of the better action-RPGs released in 2025. While it doesn't reinvent any particular wheel, it benefits from an engaging campaign, fun combat systems, and charming characters. Aside from the occasional bug--a common element of Obsidian's open-world games--and an overabundance of homicidal bears, I liked nearly everything about the game. That includes Avowed's most controversial game mechanic: enemy respawns, or the lack thereof.When it comes to RPGs, players often think of a few key elements. Some sort of leveling system, quest-granting NPCs, obtainable loot that bolsters certain \"builds\" or playstyles--you know, the basics. One feature that's common but maybe not as notable, considering its use in other genres, is respawning enemies. Players often expect areas to repopulate with baddies whenever they return to a given location. Avowed isn't about that life though--at least, not entirely.Avowed is designed to respond to your actions in meaningful ways, and not just during key moments, where certain decisions can change the direction of the game's story. This also applies to Avowed's enemies. Essentially, most of the outlaws, walking mushrooms, and crazed bears you'll run into during your journey, won't return after being killed. Laid waste to a group of Xaurips while wandering through the forest? Don't worry. They'll still be dead on return trips. Slain a few dozen Spiderlings in an underground lair? They won't be resurrected anytime soon, either. Rinse and repeat--or rather, don't repeat.Of course, this aspect of Avowed's gameplay didn't sit well with everyone. Some didn't like how empty areas felt after a while. Others hated that they couldn't farm enemies for experience points or random loot--a shortcoming that exacerbated the irritating grind of upgrading gear before Avowed's day-one patch. In most cases, the complaints about this feature are reasonable. That said, I liked the idea of never having to face the same enemy twice. Not having to worry about battling the same group of skeletons on return trips to their camp was great, especially during those times when I needed to collect something I missed; returning for a chest that could only be opened with a specific key (or several lock picks) was a breeze.AvowedI also liked how my actions had consequences. If I made a place relatively safe for travelers to explore, it stayed that way. And conversations with NPCs would reflect how I was able to put down a group of bandits that threatened their town. Again, this sort of thing is common when dealing with story-based missions or important side quests. It's easier to role-play when everything you do matters, though. Even on a small scale, it's nice to feel like you're a meaningful part of Avowed's world.The most notable reason this novel feature is a good thing has to do with farmable enemies. There aren't any, which in turn means that grinding for XP isn't a thing. Obsidian has created multiple combat systems that, when combined, offset the need to constantly hit certain levels. Yeah, there are places that are initially off-limits to new players. And seeing multiple enemies with skulls over their heads (indicating their threat level) could mean trouble. But thanks to the ability to upgrade weapons/gear, flexible build-crafting, competent AI companions, and a generous helping of XP whenever a quest is completed, I never felt under-leveled when trying to complete a story-based mission.I've played enough video games over the years to know that grinding, while being a respected method of controlling the pace of certain activities, isn't always needed. I've also gotten to a point where I can better appreciate a developer's efforts to respect my time as a player; this is less \"old person yelling at the clouds\" and more \"I no longer have all of the time in the world to play games.\" That's not to say that I didn't partake in side quests, bounties, and more--just that I was never made to feel like I had to do those things to progress.Avowed offered me a balanced experience throughout my entire playthrough. And part of that appeal came from Obsidian's deliberate efforts to allow players to play at their own pace. You could go through the game clearing all the camps, caves, and abandoned mines in hopes of min/maxing your character. You can also, for the most part, just stick to the main questline and still have a good time. Creating a game that doesn't allow for enemy respawns--which requires changes to the normal RPG grind-fest formula--works in Avowed's favor.\n                                                              \n              \n  Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

After selling out in the lead-up to Christmas, the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Minifigure 6-Pack is back in stock for $30 at Amazon. Resellers have been selling Spider-Verse mystery boxes for around $50, so Amazon will probably sell out again soon.If you're interested in collecting this Lego minifigure series, now's the time to grab a box or two. Spider-Verse minifigures are sold out at all other major retailers and the Lego Store. Most retailers sold out shortly after the collection launched in September and never restocked the mystery boxes or singles. And with the Lego Minifigure Animal Series 28 Collection launching this week, it's unlikely the Spider-Verse minifigures stick around for much longer.The Spider-Verse Lego minifigure collection includes 12 characters from the animated film series. Each minifigure comes with a stand and most also have an accessory.Lego Minifigures: Spider-Verse 6-PackAmazon - $30Target - Sold outWalmart - Sold outLego Store - Sold outLego Minifigures: Spider-Verse -- $5 eachLego Store - Sold outBest Buy - Sold outWalmart - Sold outTarget - Sold outArticle updated December 31.

For instance, Spider-Punk has an electric guitar; Web-slinger, otherwise known as Patrick O'Hara, actually comes with a horse figure; and Pavitr Prabhakar's minifigure is accompanied by a cat figure that is reminiscent of Bodega Cat from Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Perhaps most notably, Peter B. Parker has a baby carrier that holds a mini-minifigure of his daughter Mayday.Here's the full list of minifigures in the Spider-Verse collection:Miles Morales (Spider-Man)Prowler (Miles G. Morales)Peter B. Parker (Old Spider-Man)Gwen Stacy (Ghost Spider)Spider-Punk (Hobart Brown)Sun-Spider (Charlotte Webber)Werewolf Spider-Man (Peter Parker)Spider-Byte (Margo Kess)Web-Slinger (Miguel O'Hara)Patrick O'Hara (Web-slinger)Cyborg Spider-Woman (Petra Parker)Pavitr Prabhakar (Spider-Man)It's not impossible to receive a duplicate in these minifigure mystery boxes, but it is unlikely. What is likely, however, is that you'll need to purchase more than two boxes to get all 12 characters in the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse collection. Unless you're quite lucky.                      Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Lego MinifiguresAmazon and other major retailers have deals on some pretty awesome Spider-Man Lego playsets and display models. One of the most notable deals is the 379-piece Iron Spider-Man Bust for $48 (was $60). You can also save on multiple buildable action figures and minifigure mechs. The 303-piece Iron Spider-Man Construction Figure is only $27 (was $30). If you want Iron Spider-Man to have a villain to fight, check out the 471-piece Green Goblin Construction Figure for $26 (was $35). Both of the Construction Figures are retiring soon, so snag these deals while you can.More Lego Marvel Spider-Man SetsIron Spider-Man Bust (379 pieces) -- $48 ($60)Iron Spider-Man Construction Figure (303 pieces) -- $27 ($30) | Retiring soonGreen Goblin Construction Figure (471 pieces) -- $26 ($35) | Retiring soonSpider-Man Mech vs. Anti-Venom (107 pieces) -- $13 ($15)Spider-Man Minifigures: Across the Spider-Verse 6-Pack -- $30Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock Subway Train Scene (393 pieces) -- $55Spider-Man vs. Venom Muscle Car (254 pieces) -- $30Spider-Verse Miles Morales vs. The Spot (375 pieces) -- $50Spidey: Spin & Electro Dinosaur Vehicle Chase (124 pieces) -- $20Venom Mech vs. Miles Morales (134 pieces) -- Sold out | Retiring soon                                                                                                                                               Iron Spider-Man and Green Goblin Construction Figures                                New Lego Star Wars BB-8 Droid Building Set Is Available Now                         Double Nintendo Switch 2 Console Storage For Only $33 With Samsung MicroSD Express Deal                         New Tom And Jerry Blu-Ray Anthology Drops To Lowest Price Yet                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (3)                 Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Mortal Kombat Cabinet Gets First Discount                         Lego Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Minifigure Mystery Box Restocked At Amazon                         Arcade1Up Ms. Pac-Man And Galaga Countercade Is Back On Sale At Amazon    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

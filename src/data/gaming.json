    "body": "\n                            \nBy \n    Jon Bitner\n   on November 15, 2025 at 12:00AM PST    \n          \n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                While Black Friday technically falls on November 28, plenty of retailers are kicking off their deals well in advance. That's especially true for the Hotel Collection, as right now you can save 50% on select Star Wars scents, candles, and diffusers. This includes everything from premium candles with a burn time of up to 300 hours and tiny diffusers built to keep your car smelling fresh.Many of these scents have names like Rebel Spirit and The Dark Side, but rest assured, they won't smell like the inside of Darth Vader's helmet or the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. Each fragrance was crafted from a blend of ingredients, including Valencia Orange and Bergamot. Many of the scents are shared across product categories, so if you already know how you want your home (or car) to smell, here's a quick rundown of each fragrance in the Star Wars roster.Hotel Collection: Star Wars FragrancesThe Empire: Toasted vanilla, shadow clove, black amberJedi: Bergamot, damask rose, Chinese black teaThe Dark Side: Sinister sage, patchouli, saffronRebel Spirit: Bergamot, amber, Valencia orangeGalactic Hope: Smooth resin, seductive amber, vintage woodThe Force: Bright neroli, oud wood, cardamomSith: Cashmere amber, shadowy violet, bitter orangeThe Duel: Santal, dim amber, muskHere's a look at all the Star Wars fragrances and diffusers that are on sale snow. Many are up to 50% off. If you know you'll be using the scents for a long time, consider picking up a diffuser--it could save you money in the long run. Otherwise, a premium candle is a nice, affordable alternative. Please note that many discounts are only applicable when signing up for monthly subscriptions (not one-time purchases).Once you've browsed all the deals, be sure to check out GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for even more early discounts--and don't forget to check back throughout the month to see the latest price cuts on video games, figures, and beyond.Studio Pro Scent Diffuser (Home Diffuser)Before you can use any of the fragrance oils, you'll need to pick up a diffuser. These come in three different designs, though each one covers up to 600 square feet. They don't use heat or water, making them safe for kids and pets, and you won't find any residue left behind as the scents waft through your room. Their original price of $100 is a bit steep, but since you can snag a cool Star Wars one for just $50 right now, they're definitely worth a closer look.Darth Vader -- $50 ($100)Storm Trooper -- $50 ($100)C-3PO -- $50 ($100)Home Diffuser Fragrance OilA whole lot of fragrance oil for the Home Diffuser lineup is on sale at the Hotel Collection. These come in two styles--Pro and Regular. The Pro Pods are compatible with the Studio Pro Scent Diffusers (including the Star Wars models above). The Regular Pods are compatible with the older Studio Scent Diffuser. We've listed the Pro Pods below, but you'll find Regular variants on each store page if you're working with the older diffuser.The Empire -- $27.48 ($55)Jedi -- $38.46 ($55)The Dark Side -- $27.48 ($55)Rebel Spirit -- $27.48 ($55)Galactic Hope -- $38.46 ($55)Chauffeur Car Diffuser + Fragrance OilRoom SprayJust need a periodic scent refresh? These room sprays work a bit like cologne or perfume. Just give your space a few sprays, and the fragrance should linger around for a while. They're also pretty cheap right now, making them a good alternative to diffusers and oils.Rebel Spirit -- $25 ($50)The Dark Side -- $25 ($50)The Force -- $25 ($50)Galactic Hope -- $25 ($50)Deluxe CandlesBuilt to burn for up to 300 hours, these are much more impressive than the candles you'll find at your supermarket. They're quite large at 55 ounces, and each one comes with minimalist Star Wars iconography.Jedi -- $75 ($150)Sith -- $75 ($150)The Duel -- $21.48 ($43)Classic CandleBuilt to burn for 90 hours, these smaller 14-ounce candles are cheaper and might be a better fit for small spaces.Rebel Spirit -- $27.48 ($55)The Dark Side -- $27.48 ($55)The Force -- $27.48 ($55)    \n  \n                      "

Amazon is offering $250 discounts on the MacBook Air M4, which brings all configurations of Apple's best-selling laptop down to all-time low prices. The MacBook Air M4 13.6-inch model is on sale for as low as $750 (was $999). Meanwhile, the 15.6-inch MacBook Air M4 is discounted to only $950 (was $1,199).The MacBook Air M4 launched in March and has earned excellent reviews from critics and customers. If you're looking for a powerful, reliable, and travel-friendly laptop, it's hard to beat the MacBook Air M4. All four color options for both sizes are included in the promotions: Midnight, Silver, Starlight, and Sky Blue.                                                                                                      MacBook Air M4 13.6\" Laptop (2025)                                                                $750 (was $999)                                                                                                                                                                                    The MacBook Air M4 256GB offers great value at full price, but with a $250 discount? Well, it's arguably the best laptop deal of the year (so far). The base model M4 chip is equipped with 10 CPU cores, 8 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The CPU and GPU cores share 16G of Unified Memory, which offers enough processing power and speed for creatives and developers. It's also an ideal laptop for new college students, as it should be a trusty device through graduation and beyond. Plus, the ultra-slim profile makes it one of the best laptops for travel, and it's extremely efficient in terms of power consumption. The M4 can run for up to 18 hours on a full charge.The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display makes all your videos, pictures, and games look fantastic, while a 12MP camera lets you dive into video chats or virtual lectures. Rounding out the entry-level M4 are two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a MagSafe charging port, a headphone jack, support for Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth, and suppor for up to two external displays.Apple computers still aren't the best choice for gaming, but not because they aren't powerful enough; it's simply due to the comparitively limited library. That said, Apple has made a concerted effort with gaming over the past few years by working with big publishers to bring hit games to the App Store, including Death Stranding, Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and more. The MacBook Air M4 has ray tracing and other advanced rendering tools. The base model runs a wide assortment of visually demanding games wonderfully, and games look incredibl on Apple's Liquid Retina Display.The base model's main downside, especially when it comes to gaming, is the 256GB SSD. It's a high-performing storage drive, but 256GB can disappear quickly if you download a bunch of games or work on big design projects.If you want more storage space and a boost in performance in the video department, the two 512GB configurations are also on sale for $250 off. Both models have two additional GPU cores, and the pricier one offers 24GB Unified Memory.10-core CPU / 8-core GPU / 16GB Memory / 256GB SSD -- $750 ($999)10-core CPU / 10-core GPU / 16GB Memory / 512GB SSD -- $950 ($1,199)10-core CPU / 10-core GPU / 24GB Memory / 512GB SSD -- $1,150 ($1,399)                                                                                                                            MacBook Air M4 15.3\" Laptop (2025)                                                                $950 (was $1,199)                                                                                                                                                                                    As mentioned, if you want more screen real estate, the 15.3-inch model is also on sale for $250 off. It's available in the same four colors, and all three configurations have a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The base model is $950 (was $1,199) and offers 16GB Unified Memory and a 256GB SSD. You can double the storage to 512GB by picking up the $1,149 deal. Once again, the memory can be increased to 24GB by opting for the $1,350 model.16GB Memory + 256GB SSD -- $950 ($1,199)16GB Memory + 512GB SSD -- $1,149 ($1,399)24GB Memory + 512GB SSD -- $1,350 ($1,599)                                                         Meta Quest 3S Batman Bundle Is $70 Off, Comes With $50 Amazon Gift Card                         Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 & PC For Only $40                         Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut                                   + Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Links (5)                 Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon                         Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon                         Lego DC Batman Figure & Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else                         Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount                         Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller    \n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Both the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch versions of the game are currently down to $25, saving you $15 off the original price of $40. Then there's the Nintendo Switch-exclusive Hello Kitty Island Adventure Gift Box, now available for $50 (was $16), a welcome deal considering it was just released earlier this month. This version includes the Deluxe Edition of the game and a selection of other collectibles, which are detailed below.                                                                                                      Hello Kitty Island Adventure                                                                $25 (was $40)                                                                                                                                                                                    The Hello Kitty Island Adventure standard edition comes with the base game. The PS5 and Nintendo Switch versions of the game are the same price, so you can't really go wrong with which edition you pick. However, there are pros and cons to both; the PS5 version will undoubtedly run more smoothly than the Switch Version, but the Switch version has the advantage of being able to play in handheld mode.

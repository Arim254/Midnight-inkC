    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Battlefield 6 has largely been well-received by players, but it's not as if it can't be improved. In particular, Battlefield 6 fans have been requesting bigger maps in Conquest, and they didn't wait around for Battlefield Studios to do it. Instead, a handful of fans have created their own big maps with Battlefield Portal and REDSEC.Reddit users andy_6170 and kurtinthegrind have joined forces to create Club House, a Conquest play area that has plenty of space for large scale battles to break out. There are options for bots or botless versions of Club House, as well as servers that can support 64 real players. The Conquest and Tech Center options open up most of the map, while Operation Tech Center offers a smaller-scale experience in and around a single building. As described by the creators, Conquest mode features \"vehicles, semi-urban areas ideal for infantry fights, and hills perfect for snipers. It's also a great map for helicopter combat!\"Separately, Battlefield lead producer David Sirland wrote on X that the game needs \"more of the large sandbox types for sure though!\" Sirland indicated that maps and weapons will be added continuously over time. He also noted that the dev team will be \"looking at fixing issues on the existing maps, and changing things up when necessary to make it better too, of course.\"Maps and weapons is of course the biggest area we'll just keep adding to over time, so this will move in that direction for sure.We are also looking at fixing issues on the existing maps, and changing things up when necessary to make it better too of course.  — David Sirland (@tiggr_) November 5, 2025              Earlier this week, Battlefield Studios made adjustments to Battlefield 6 to make some of the achievements easier to complete. Sirland also explained why the bots are necessary to fill up the servers in order to get matches started more quickly.So far, Battlefield 6 has sold over 10 million copies. However, its momentum may suffer when Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Take-Two's story of the day may be Grand Theft Auto 6's delay to late 2026, but the company's investor call also revealed some info about its other titles. Borderlands 4 fell short of the publisher's sales expectations despite the biggest launch in franchise history and its debut as the third-highest selling game of 2025.While speaking with The Game Business, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick laid the blame for Borderlands 4's performance on the optimization problems plaguing the PC port.\"The critical acclaim [for Borderlands 4] was superb, and we're really happy with the release,\" said Zelnick. \"Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. [Developer] Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. So, in terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were a little softer than we would have liked. In the fullness of time, we think it's going to do great.\"It's true that some PC players review bombed Borderlands 4 on Steam about its performance and optimization issues. In response, Gearbox Studios CEO Randy Pitchford openly challenged players' negative reviews and remained defiant about it days later. Pitchford also shared a number of tips for better performance on PC and consoles.However, the PC sales figures may not tell the whole story. The American/Canadian console sales for October 2025 haven't been released yet, but PlayStation's list of the top downloads for North America reveal that Borderlands 4 dropped to 14th place after debuting at number three a month earlier. This suggests a broader dissatisfaction with the game beyond PC users, and the PS5 version did have some optimization issues as well.Later this month, Gearbox will drop Borderlands 4's first paid DLC pack, and the developer debuted a bee-shooting legendary weapon this week. The Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 remains indefinitely delayed for now.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Amy Hennig, of Uncharted fame, is the studio's president and is leading development on the title as well, which puts players in the shoes of four playable characters, including Black Panther and Captain America, as well as a Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, and Nanali, a Wakandan spy leader.As suggested by the game's title, Rise of Hydra is set during World War II in Nazi-occupied Paris, but--in true action-adventure form--the game will span the globe and take players to Wakanda and beyond.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

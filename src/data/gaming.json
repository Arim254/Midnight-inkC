    "body": "WELCOME TO SEASON 01The biggest Season 01 ever arrives December 4th, bringing a massive variety of maps, modes, Loadout content, and more, including four Multiplayer maps and the new Astra Malorum Zombies map on day one.Click or Tap to ZoomThe Season 01 Roadmap. With content so stacked, this image is designed to be zoomed in on to view everything available.The Story So FarAs The Guild claws its way back from the ashes of defeat at the hands of David Mason, Alden Dorne, once the trusted right hand of CEO Emma Kagan, seizes his moment. His vision is merciless: capture David Mason at all costs and unlock the secrets buried within the C-Link, the cutting-edge neural tech possessed only by JSOC’s elite.Weekly ChallengesComplete challenges every week of the season to unlock new Loadout items, Camo rewards, and XP. Beginning with Season 01, the Weekly Challenges Menu, accessible via the Lobby or the Challenge Hub in the Career Menu, gives you the chance to earn new Attachments, Scorestreaks, Weapons, and more by completing Challenges in all modes.At the start of Season 01, immediately check the Weekly Challenge menu to see the available rewards and the challenges required to access them. Complete any six challenges across any (or all) of the four supported modes — Co-op Campaign/Endgame, Multiplayer, Zombies, or Call of Duty: Warzone (Warzone Patch Notes) — to unlock the weekly Loadout reward. Check the menu again the following week for the next gameplay reward.Completing challenges also rewards XP, and this is a great way to rise through the Levels. Don’t worry if you miss a week; as long as you’re playing Black Ops 7 during any part of Season 01, all the previous Weekly Challenge Challenges and rewards are still accessible, up to the point the season concludes.Week 1 Reward: Ballistic Knife: For the first week of Season 01, a brand-new Melee Weapon is your reward: Make sure you’re rapidly completing Weekly Challenges to unlock the Ballistic Knife!New WeaponsThe following weapons are available at launch with even more coming in-season.Kogot-7 - SMG (Battle Pass)Full-auto submachine gun. Excellent mobility and fast fire rate, but shorter-range capabilities and moderate recoil.What the Kogot-7 lacks in punch, it makes up for with speed and mobility. This fast-firing, quick-handling SMG is perfect for Operators looking to get into the thick of things.Prestige Attachment: MFS Kogot-7 Akimbo  A Dual Wield toggle that lets you swap between holding one or two SMGs. Damage range and hipfire spread suffer a slight penalty, overcome by the deluge of firepower at your fingertips. Blocks Underbarrel Attachments.Maddox RFB - Assault Rifle (Battle Pass)Full-auto assault rifle. Fast fire rate with a large ammo pool.A favorite from Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, the Maddox RFB returns to action in Black Ops 7. The weapon’s manageable recoil, fast fire rate, and large ammo pool make it ideal for sustained fights.Prestige Attachment: 13” MFS Echo-Fire Barrel  A firing blowback system that increases the fire rate for every second bullet, granting a boost in firepower at the expense of some slight accuracy loss.Ballistic Knife - Melee (Weekly Challenge Reward: Week 1)Spring-action knife launcher. High melee damage and can fire retrievable blades as projectiles.The Ballistic Knife returns, a staple Black Ops weapon that lets you pull off deadly ranged attacks with surprising speed and accuracy as the blade is fired from the handle, eliminating unarmored targets on contact.NX Ravager - Special Weapon (Event Reward: Week 2)Launches high damage bolt projectiles. Can be configured to fire explosive bolts that detonate a short time after impact.Take aim with the NX Ravager compound bow, featuring quick loading bolts in a device that shoots accurately to great distancesNew AttachmentsAkita Scorchlink Akimbo (Weekly Challenge Reward: Week 2)Why wield only one full-auto Shotgun when you can have two? With this Attachment equipped, you’re granted dual capabilities coupled with Belt Fed Ammo Capacity and an Overheat mechanic, with a slight dip in damage range and hipfire spread to compensate for the barrage of rounds. Blocks other Magazines.New Multiplayer ScorestreakDeadeye Drone (Weekly Challenge Reward: Week 3)Take to the skies remotely with the Deadeye Drone to harass and eliminate enemies with its onboard rifle. Soar over the environment and look for target indicators marking the position of enemy Operators.Overclock AbilitiesExtended Mag: Larger magazine allows for more shots.Grenadier: Attached grenade for aerial bombing.New Multiplayer MapsThe following maps are available at launch, with more coming in-season.Utopia (6v6)Once a cutting-edge Guild research facility, this site now serves as the nerve center of Project Synapse under Alden Dorne’s command. Towering structures pierce the skyline, remnants of a forgotten future now repurposed for ruthless ambition.Fate (6v6)David is dragged back into the nightmare he’s tried to forget: a fractured memory where fear and regret over Raul Menendez take physical form. Step into a warped vision of Menendez’s Nicaraguan compound, now twisted beyond recognition: colossal machetes carve through the sky, and shattered pieces of reality hang suspended as if time itself has splintered.Odysseus (6v6 / 2v2)The team steps into a distorted hallucination aboard the scarred deck of a familiar carrier etched deep into David’s past. Close-quarters combat dominates as you fight across the deck overlooking a runway frozen in chaos: aircraft locked mid-explosion, debris suspended in time, and a crimson mist bleeding across the sky.Standoff (6v6)Remastered for Black Ops 7, Standoff returns with greater visual fidelity than ever before. Revisit your favorite spots on this classic mid-sized map from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 that played a huge role in casual and competitive play.Party Games ReturnProp HuntDisguise yourself as a prop and evade notice from searching Operators in this fan-favorite Party Mode challenging players to notice what’s not quite right in the environment. Props whistle every 30 seconds, so be ready to move and even change shape or drop a decoy if the enemy is on to you. Teams switch roles between rounds, from hiding as props to seeking them out before the round timer is up.One in the ChamberEach Operator spawns with a pistol, one bullet, a Combat Knife, and three lives. The only way to earn another bullet is to eliminate another Operator. In this free for all, every shot that lands counts as an elimination, so keep your aim steady and start dancing when encountering enemy fire. When only two players remain, a UAV begins to scan the area, forcing the remaining targets into a fight.SharpshooterPut your skills to the test in this free-for-all match where every Operator is given the same randomly selected weapon. Every 45 seconds, the weapon changes to a new random weapon for all players, and this cycle continues throughout the match.Sticks & Stones (Week 2)Armed with a Crossbow, Ballistic Knife, and Combat Axe, players battle in a free-for-all earning points for each elimination. Keep slaying to outscore the enemy but beware — those who fall victim to the Combat Axe lose all their points. Watch your back and aim your own axe to take down players with the highest scores.Gun Game (Week 2)Eliminate enemies and be the first to cycle through every weapon tier in this party mode where every Operator starts out with the same weapon. With each elimination, your weapon is advanced to the next tier. Eliminating enemies with a melee attack will demote them to the previous tear and vice versa, so don’t let anyone get up close!New Zombies Map: Astra MalorumThe heroes continue their perilous journey in search of another Shadowsmith, with their path leading them to a mysterious observatory, a relic ripped from the early 20th century now drifting silently within the shimmering rings of Saturn.Once a beacon of human curiosity and discovery, the observatory has become a ghostly monument suspended in time, its rusted domes and fractured telescopes watching endlessly over the planet’s swirling bands. Within its hollow corridors, secrets of the past, and the next step in their quest awaits.New Enemy: O.S.C.A.R. (Astra Malorum)This sentinel robot — a remnant of mid-20th Century cinematic imagination — has somehow become an animated, stalking menace that roams the dark halls of the Observatory. Known as the Observation System and Carnifex Adjudicator Robot (or O.S.C.A.R. for short), this Elite entity seems to be persistent in assessing and neutralizing threats, slowly hover-patrolling areas where a disturbance has occurred.New Wonder Weapon: LGM-1 (Astra Malorum)The Little Green Menace launches saucer squadrons that exterminate enemies like the lower life forms they are. Shoot for the stars!A retro-sleek artifact with unique target acquisition and annihilation qualities, the LGM-1 shoots out partly autonomous saucer-like projectiles that swarm nearby targets with miniature (but potent) laser fire.This small squadron of independent spacecraft prioritizes the closest targets and depends on weapon aiming. These flying discs then track and circle enemies, before returning to the LGM-1 for replenishment.New Survival Map: Exit 115Welcome to Reba’s Diner! Survive as many rounds as possible in this isolated location from Ashes of the Damned with everything you need to put up a fight. The more rounds you survive, the more rewards you can earn:“Chef’s Special” Animated Emblem and 1,000 XP (reach Round 10)“Ravaged” Charm and 2,500 XP (reach Round 25)“Perkaholic” Ultra GobbleGum and 5,000 XP (reach Round 50)Returning Perk-A-Cola: Mule KickDrink to carry an extra weapon.

The goal of these changes is to increase penetration overall, while keeping damage reasonable. Additionally, we would like to maintain a level of consistency and predictability when it comes to bullet penetration.Up until now, a weapon’s penetration was driven entirely by the maximum distance it could pass through a given surface type. Penetration damage would decrease based on the thickness of the surface until the maximum distance. This limited our ability to tune distances without also affecting damage. It could also lead to some extreme edge cases, such as a weapon’s falling off to just a few points of damage.Starting with Season 01, penetration damage and distance have been decoupled. Weapons will still have a maximum distance they can shoot through for each surface type, but now the damage falloff they experience will be a flat percentage regardless of how thick the surface was. This lets us push the penetration distance further while still ensuring that cover feels advantageous.We’ll be carefully monitoring feedback and adjusting specific surface types as necessary to make sure that penetration feels fair on both sides of combat engagements.Slightly increased distances at which bullets can penetrate through many surface types.Bullets that successfully penetrate through a surface now experience a flat percentage of damage falloff regardless of the distance that was penetrated.FMJ will now increase distance penetrated as well as reduce the penetration damage falloff.Addressed an issue preventing FMJ from improving penetration damage as intended.Weapon TuningWe're planning to release a larger weapon balance patch once we're a couple of weeks into Season 01 and have collected plenty of feedback and data on the first batch of new weapons and attachments. This timing will help us ensure the S01 weapon meta is in the best state possible heading into the holidays.The attachment adjustments below are very focused and not intended as a comprehensive balancing pass. We often revisit and tweak attachment tunings as we add new weapons to the game and the relative balance of weapons within a class evolves, which is the case here.Assault RiflesM15 MOD 0Attachment

Based on all the new content coming to Multiplayer in Season 01, we’re making some updates to our playlist structure and UI.The first playlist tab will now be Featured playlists, where we’ll highlight various styles of experiences, such as the Season 01 Moshpit featuring our S01 maps Utopia, Fate, Odysseus, and Standoff. This is also where you can find Standard Moshpit, where skill is an important consideration.We’ve continued to see increased engagement with Standard Moshpit, so we’ll be featuring it in the Featured tab for players who prefer an experience with more similarly skilled opponents. With the main tab changing to Featured, the other tab will now become Party Games, which will include Prop Hunt, Sharpshooter, One in the Chamber, and Gunfight at the launch of Season 01, as well as the debut of Sticks & Stones and Gun Game in Week 2.In addition to Standard Moshpit, all Multiplayer playlists feature Open Matchmaking where skill is minimally considered, for a more varied experience.Season 01 Moshpit (NEW) & Hardcore Season 01 Moshpit (NEW)MapsUtopiaFateStandoffOdysseusModesTeam DeathmatchKill ConfirmedDominationHardpointOverloadFace Off Team Deathmatch (Odysseus)Face Off Kill Confirmed (Odysseus)Prop Hunt (NEW)Nuketown 2025 24/7Face Off Moshpit (+ Odysseus)Skirmish 20v20Standard Moshpit (+ Utopia, Fate, and Standoff)Party Games (NEW)Prop Hunt (NEW)Sharpshooter (NEW)One in the Chamber (NEW)Gunfight (+ Odysseus)MODE UPDATESOverloadOvertime has been added to Overload.

While not official canon, the map includes redesigned spaces inspired by Zombies locations and features a collection of hidden Easter eggs for a fun layer of discovery throughout each match.Primary Points of InterestCoal DepotA high-traffic junction where interiors make for strong ambushes and the rooftop offers risky but rewarding positions.LumbermillAn industrial complex with the map’s largest rooftop, layered interiors, and sneaky parkour paths for advantageous positioning.Main StreetA dense collection of building interiors and loot spots, featuring the Motel, comic book store, and a high-stakes Bank drop reminiscent of Rebirth Island’s Prison rooftop.MansionA reimagined Shattered Veil layout with new interior routes, attic choke points, and rooftop ascenders offering layered vertical play.PondA natural lowland marked by long sightlines, strategic foliage for cover, plenty of ziplines for quick mobility, and a central Hunting Lodge overlooking ankle-deep waters.Research CenterA spiraling, multi-floor facility around a central courtyard, topped with tiered rooftops and a dangerous yet important buy station below.RiverboatUnique, multi-level space with ascenders, ziplines, and tight interior fights balanced by open upper decks overlooking the river.Train StationThe welcome mat of Haven's Hollow - ideal for quick regains with fast access to supplies and tight engagements.Barn AdjustedPreviously announced as Homestead, we’ve made several structural and layout changes to this POI:Replaced the small shed with a new two-story interior structure, adding a lower town-side entrance and improved cover when engaging toward the barn.Reworked the destroyed barn into a larger, more open structure with multiple interior and exterior routes to the upper level, creating more varied engagements and reducing single-point choke fights.Reinforced the outer perimeter with a more solid fence to provide increased protection from long-range pressure coming from the Mansion rooftops.Improved entrance callouts to more clearly communicate when players are transitioning into this space.Repositioned the cabin cluster into a tighter cul-de-sac layout to reduce long sightlines toward the Research Center and better concentrate encounters.Added an exterior fireplace and tall landscaping elements to further break up sightlines across the POI.Relocated the grain shed and rotated the ladder to face the Church, enabling smoother rooftop access and new parachute rotation opportunities toward the barn.» Verdansk «Signal Station New Point of InterestLocated near the Military Base, Signal Station introduces a new high-visibility landmark centered around its towering radar arrays.Players can complete a short side quest to activate the main radar and earn a portable Tactical Heat Map. This item reveals nearby threat levels for your squad in real time and is lost upon death.This POI brings much-needed gameplay depth to what was previously a forest with only an average drop rate. Positioned near the center of Verdansk, it stays relevant deeper into matches while logically fitting as a high-altitude radar installation. Its unique multi-building layout provides clear visual and gameplay identities without adding excessive conflict to already busy surrounding areas, with most lines of sight intentionally oriented toward Military Base.FactoryRemastered Point of InterestLocated near Superstore, the Factory returns as a remastered version of the fan-favorite Verdansk ’84 location.The layout stays intentionally close to the original design while introducing new environmental dangers, including active missile production.Reintroducing Factory helps support the naturally high-action ecosystem around Superstore, adding more options for players to engage or safely disengage from the area. The POI enhances rotational freedom while keeping combat intensity balanced across this hotspot region. The missiles inside Factory serve as a nostalgic nod to the classic Stadium update.MODESNewWeekend-Only Limited-Time ModesEach weekend, a different Limited Time Mode will be featured, giving players new ways to experience Warzone. The currently planned modes are as follows:Week 1 | Buyback Battle Royale ReturningA fan favorite mode that allows players to redeploy as long as they have enough cash when eliminated.Squad Size: QuadsWeek 2 | Amped Battle RoyaleNewAn experimental mode that increases base health to support longer, higher intensity engagements.Squad Size: QuadsWeek 3 & 4No Limited-Time Mode will be available due to the holiday break.Week 5 | Ultra Fast ResurgenceNewDetails to be announced at a later date.Squad Size: QuadsPLAYLISTNewOpen MatchmakingWith the launch of Black Ops 7 Season 01, Open Matchmaking where skill is minimally considered will be introduced to Call of Duty: Warzone.This change will apply to all non-Casual modes available on the Warzone playlist.At the launch of Season 01, all squad sizes (Solos, Duos, Trios, and Quads) will be available across both core Battle Royale and Resurgence in Europe and North America. Other regions will be launching with Quads for both core modes.During the first few weeks of the season, we will be closely monitoring matchmaking data across individual regions. Given the introduction of open matchmaking, this data will help us determine necessary adjustments per region to ensure the healthiest matchmaking experience possible. While any potential changes are still to be determined, we wanted to share this early for transparency.For information about upcoming Playlists, please check out the dedicated Call of Duty: Warzone Trello Board.GENERALAim AssistTuned strength at short and long ranges and refined full-activation requirements to better balance engagements between Controller and KBM players.For the launch of Black Ops 7, Treyarch shared that in engagements between similarly skilled Controller and Keyboard & Mouse (KBM) players, data showed a slight controller advantage at close range and a KBM advantage at long range.As such, Black Ops 7 launched with a new right-stick aiming requirement for achieving maximum Rotational Aim Assist strength. When the right-stick isn’t used, or isn’t tracking a target effectively, players now experience a minimum Rotational Aim Assist strength. The goal for this new mechanic and other Aim Assist range changes is to provide the most competitive experience for all players and inputs.Warzone will be inheriting these same changes with the launch of Season 01.MOVEMENTFor movement, our goal this chapter is to make traversal feel smoother, more responsive, and more natural as you flow through the map.SprintingRemoved Tactical Sprint as a core ability.Tactical Sprint is now available via the Sprinter Perk.Increased base sprint speeds.By shifting Tactical Sprint into a perk unlock and boosting base sprint speed, players still get a smooth, fast traversal experience but your movement choices now carry more intention and build identity. This lets Sprinter lean into high-mobility playstyles while keeping core movement fluid and fair for everyone.Combat RollIntroduced Combat Roll as a new movement tool, available through the Mountaineer Perk.This new, optional mechanic lets players absorb fall impacts and maintain momentum, opening up new ways to reposition, descend from height, and chain movement options together creatively.Experimental MechanicsWe’ve enabled both Wall Jump and the Grapple Hook in all Limited-Time Modes throughout Season 01.Movement remains a core pillar of the Warzone experience, and we will be closely monitoring player feedback in our LTMs to identify opportunities for new mechanics, tuning, and future improvements.LOADOUTSTo further streamline the create-a-class experience and reinforce weapon identity, we’ve made several foundational changes to loadouts and weapon customization.WildcardsWildcards have been removed entirely.Overkill is now available to all players by default.Since Overkill was already the dominant choice for most players, this change streamlines the loadout process and simplifies how players select the weapons and attachments that define their playstyle.Attachment CapWeapons are now limited to 5 attachment slots.With this change, builds are more deliberate and each weapon’s identity is clearer. This helps ensure that Assault Rifles feel like Assault Rifles, SMGs feel like SMGs, and each weapon class maintains its intended role without excessive overlap.Equipment OptionsA number of lethal and tactical equipment options have been moved out of the loadout selection and will only be available via in-match loot.With this change, our goal is to simplify loadout selection while making loot-only items more desirable and impactful. Each loot-exclusive item has been buffed to support this shift. This approach also gives us greater flexibility to rotate and vault items throughout the chapter to keep the sandbox fresh.EQUIPMENTLethal and Tactical equipment have received a meaningful refresh this season, featuring a mix of powerful new additions and targeted adjustments to fan-favorite tools.Equipment InteractionsStarting in Season 01, we’re introducing the first wave of our equipment counterplay interactions - also referred to as our rock-paper-scissors system. This system expands the core utility of equipment, adding additional depth to combat and encouraging players to think more strategically about what they carry throughout a match.Stim ShotThe Stim Shot can now be activated immediately after being hit by a Flash or Concussion Grenade to fully clear their disorienting effects.This change gives players a fast option to counter disorienting crowd-control effects, especially with the buff to Flash Grenades, enabling quicker recovery in high-pressure combat situations.Smoke GrenadeThe Smoke Grenade can now extinguish lingering flames created by Molotov Cocktails or Napalm Killstreaks.These are only the first of several interactions we have planned for the Black Ops 7 year. We expect that these changes will lend to more dynamic and interesting outcomes during engagements, especially if squads properly coordinate their shared arsenal. As always, we’ll be keeping a close eye on how these systems perform and player feedback.Available Equipment» Lethals «Needle Drone NewSmall flying drone that explodes on impact.

Not consumed if no opponents are nearby.Tagged opponents emit sound for 10 seconds.Tagged opponents appear on the compass.Only available in loot.The Phantom Signal is a new Tactical device used to track nearby opponents or sow chaos between squads. Ghosted players can be revealed by this device, while players using Cold-Blooded remain immune to its targeting. Most importantly, this equipment item is only consumed if there are opponents within range when you attempt to use it.Pinpoint GrenadeNewShoots tracking devices at opponents.  8.5m targeting radius.15-second active duration.Tracked opponents are visible through walls in real-time.Tracker can be removed.Only available in loot.The new Pinpoint Grenade replaces the Snapshot Grenade, allowing you to mark targets with removable trackers.

Increases the height before taking critical fall damage by 5 meters.Combat Roll further reduces fall damage by 10% and removes the movement penalty from high falls.Increases ladder climb speed by 15%.We’ve heard the feedback that Mountaineer wasn’t delivering enough impact compared to previous versions, and we agree that maintaining its identity is critical. In this update, Mountaineer now allows players to Combat Roll to further increase fall damage reduction. This also negates the negative effects typically applied when falling from significant heights, giving the Perk a more consistent and meaningful defensive role.Cold-Blooded ReturningGrants immunity to tracking equipment, targeting systems, and electronic interference.  Immune to thermal optics, weapon targeting systems, heartbeat sensors, phantom signals, scrambling, EMP effects, Tracker, and Alertness.Grenadier ReturningImproves explosive equipment and equipment handling.  Explosive equipment adds a 5-second health regen delay.Explosive equipment inflicts a 20% movement slow for 3 seconds.Throw equipment 15% farther.See equipment trajectories.ScavengerReturningImproves ammo and resource acquisition.  Dead opponents drop a pack containing additional ammo, equipment, plates, and cash.Veteran ReturningImproves equipment resistance and long-range weapon handling.  Resistant to flash, concussion, gas, and shock equipment effects.Immune to Grenadier.Increases hold-breath duration by 5 seconds.Increases flinch resistance by 30%.» Red (Slot 2) « Bomb Squad AdjustedProvides explosive resistance and equipment negation.  Reduces explosive and fire damage by 45%.Spot and hack equipment through walls.Highlight equipment for your squad while ADS.Bomb Squad now reduces damage from explosive and fire-based Killstreaks. This update expands the perk’s defensive utility and opens up new opportunities for more aggressive, frontline play.Reactive Armor AdjustedImproves armor recovery and defense.  Armor regenerates up to 100% of its maximum if you avoid damage for 2 seconds.Total approximated time to regenerate to maximum is 20 seconds.Breaking armor triggers an EMP effect (won’t re-trigger until armor is fully restored).We were initially cautious about the overall effectiveness of this perk, as maintaining a healthy plate economy is a key balance consideration. However, it also needed to feel more impactful in moment-to-moment gameplay. In addition to its new EMP trigger effect, we’ve reduced the delay before regeneration begins and increased its regeneration speed to improve its combat value without disrupting balance.SprinterAdjustedImproves sprinting and movement.  Grants Tactical Sprint.Reload while Tactical Sprinting.Reduces movement penalties while reloading or using equipment.With Tactical Sprint removed from base movement, it is now available through a perk-based choice instead. We’ve also merged Gung-Ho into Sprinter, allowing the perk to fully focus on improving sprinting performance across the board.Alertness ReturningImproves situational awareness.  Sense opponents within 30 meters.Sense when you are being aimed at.Quick-Fix ReturningImproves armor handling and health regeneration.  Insert plates one-handed.Immediately begin health regeneration when eliminating opponents or inserting armor plates.» Yellow (Slot 3) « Adaptive NewImproves explosive defense, movement, and handling.  With plates not full: gain a 10% movement speed boost.With plates full: gain improved ADS speed and sprint-to-fire speed.Gain an audible warning when near trap equipment.Traps triggered by the player are delayed.Gain the ability to reset fuses when throwing back grenades.Adaptive is a new perk designed to dynamically respond to combat situations. When your armor plates are full, it supports aggressive pushes; when plates are depleted, it grants a constant movement advantage to aid in repositioning. The perk also reintroduces elements of Reflexes through built-in equipment counterplay.Ghost AdjustedImproves stealth.  Undetectable by enemy radar pings while moving.Effects are disabled if stationary for 1.5 seconds or more.Ghost remains a strong pick but has become less clear in recent iterations. Starting with BO7, several interactions have been refined to better define its role. It now protects you from standard radar pings and no longer appears on Advanced UAV. However, it will no longer protect you from Heartbeat Sensors. To balance these changes, the time you can remain stationary before the stealth benefits has been reduced.Survivor AdjustedImproves health regeneration, revive speed, and survivability.  With full armor plates, gain one-hit protection against ballistic weapons.Health begins regenerating after 4 seconds.Allies revive you faster.Survivor was a strong pick in Slot 1 but began to underperform in Slot 3. To reinforce its intended role, it now grants one-hit protection while at full armor. This behavior matches the version previously used in Warzone Ranked.TrackerAdjustedImproves tracking and target acquisition.  Shooting an enemy briefly outlines them based on range.Automatically ping the enemy who downs you.Track enemy footprints; when you shoot an enemy, all others can see their footprints for 10 seconds.Tracker remains a strong perk, but we wanted to introduce new opportunities for teamwork.

    "body": "\n                  GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n                If the success of Switch 2 is any indication, 2025 was defined by the launch of Nintendo's latest console. Yet Nintendo is surprisingly absent from the top trending games of 2025, with only a single title making the cut: Pokemon Legends: Z-A.Google has shared its annual report about the top trending search topics, including which subjects changed in the year since the previous disclosure. Note that these are not the most-played or most popular games of the year--the data shows which of these games saw a significant spike in search via Google throughout 2025.Only a single game from Google's top trending games of 2024 returned for 2025's list. The game in question was Strands, a free-to-play word game from The New York Times.Many of this year's breakout titles made the 2025 list, including Split Fiction, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Arc Raiders, and Battlefield 6. Perennial hits Roblox and Minecraft staked out the final two spots for this year.Grand Theft Auto 6 is the only unreleased game to make this year's list, and it will likely show up again next year even if the game is once again pushed out of its release window.You can find the complete lineup of Google's top 10 trending game searches for 2025 below."

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                The dream of Skyblivion goes back over a decade as a team of fans came together to use The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's engine to fully recreate and re-imagine Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion as a modern RPG. At the beginning of 2023, the team set a 2025 premiere for Skyblivion. However, that's no longer the plan and Skyblivion has been pushed to next year. The good news is that the latest dev video shows off how much has been finished and what remains to be done.          Skyblivion lead Rebelzize narrates the video as he offers a guide to where things stand. According to Rebelzize, most of the work has already been done and over 70 volunteer contributors are still hard at work trying to get the ambitious mod across the finish line.When this project was started, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was far out of date. Earlier this year, Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered, which could have taken the wind out of this team's project. Instead, Rebelzize and others praised the remaster as a \"win-win\" for the community. In recognition for their work, Bethesda gave copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion mod team.However, it hasn't been entirely harmonious for team Skyblivion. Earlier this year, a former member of the team spoke out against efforts to rush the mod out before it's ready. As impressive as Skyblivion is, no one is getting paid for it, and the ex-team member is against the crunch-time mindset that was making things more difficult.For now, it looks like Skyblivion is worth the wait. Although Bethesda does offer some support for mods on consoles, it will only be available on PC. Skyblivion will also require players to own both Elder Scrolls 5 and Elder Scrolls 4 in order to work.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

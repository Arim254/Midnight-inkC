Players, however, can still earn career XP in bot lobbies, as well as receive a 150% XP match completion bonus. Portal lobbies without bots can still be used to earn Mastery and complete challenges.\n  \n              Click To Unmute\n        \n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n      Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos.\n    \n      This video has an invalid file format.\n    00:00:00Sorry, but you can't access this content!\n          Now Playing: Battlefield 6 Essential Starter Guide\n      \nA statement from Battlefield Studios last week said that its internal data indicated that a \"large number of these [bot-enabled Portal servers] were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.\" While the developers understand why players would make these lobbies, it was making it \"noticeably harder\" for players to find non-XP-farming experiences in Battlefield Portal.\"Our goal moving forward here is to reinforce the player-driven experiences that bring people together, while still keeping room for custom setups, creativity, and new ideas,\" Battlefield Studios said.Though the bot farms are now dead, Battlefield Studios is still working on solving the underlying progression frustrations that led to players resorting to XP farms in the first place. In an update last week, Battlefield Studios increased the amount of XP earned from match completion and daily challenges, as well as reduced the amount of Mastery XP needed to unlock a weapon's first 20 Mastery ranks. Assignments that required players to reach career ranks 20, 23, and 26 in order to unlock were also adjusted to instead unlock at ranks 10, 15, and 20.More progression changes could be coming in the future as well, with Battlefield Studios stating that it's \"aware of the frustrations regarding the challenges themselves\" and will be reviewing them, but that it will take time to \"develop, test, and implement these changes.\"Battlefield 6 sold more than 7 million copies in its first week, making it the biggest launch of any game in the long-running franchise, and saw a concurrent player peak of 747,000 players on Steam shortly after launch. Battlefield 6 Season 1 will launch October 28 and add new maps, weapons, and more.In other Battlefield 6 news, the game apparently fails to credit the work done by some of the developers at Ridgeline Games, who worked on Battlefield 6's campaign before the studio was shuttered last year. In a post on LinkedIn, former Ridgeline studio head Marcus Lehto said the studio helped build Battlefield 6's foundation, and that \"every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment.\"\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

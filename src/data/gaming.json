    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Microsoft's Forza Horizon 5 continues to be a huge hit on PlayStation, it seems. Research from Alinea Analytics claims that the game just recently passed 5 million copies sold on PS5.This works out to more than $300 million in revenue on PS5 alone for the 2021 game. Alinea's Rhys Elliott said this data proves why Microsoft is keen to release more of its own games on a rival platform like Sony's PS5. \"Xbox's move to third-party is no mystery, especially given Microsoft's lofty profitability mandates,\" Elliott said.As Microsoft does not keep 100% of the revenue, as Sony gets a cut for its platform fee. The industry standard revenue share is 70/30.Forza Horizon 5 has been putting up strong sales numbers on PlayStation for a while already, so to hear it's crossed 5 million sales on PS5 is not a big surprise. The next entry in the series, Forza Horizon 6, will be released on Xbox and PC first, before coming to PS5 later on.Forza Horizon 5.Forza Horizon 6, which is set in Japan, will be among the titles shown at the Xbox Developer Direct on January 22. The showcase will also include more updates on the new Fable game. Both Forza Horizon 6 and the new Fable are in development at Playground Games.The \"lofty profitability mandates\" Elliott is referring to are likely the 30% profit-margin mandates that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood reportedly put upon the Xbox division. Microsoft later denied this specific figure, but acknowledged that the company does have ambitious profit goals for the Xbox team.Whatever the case, the Xbox team undertook efforts to make more money in 2025, including raising Xbox console prices, hiking Game Pass membership costs, and releasing more of its games on rival platforms. Microsoft also laid off lots of people, canceled games, and closed studios. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said these cuts had to happen because of capitalism.Additionally, Microsoft was planning to charge $80 for new games starting in 2025, but canceled those plans. Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty said the Xbox team needs to run a \"healthy business,\" but this doesn't necessarily mean increases beyond $70 for new games.Microsoft will release its next quarterly financial report on January 28, at which time we may learn more about how the Xbox business is performing.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Ubisoft's The Division is getting a definitive edition, it appears. This would be in addition to ongoing updates to The Division 2 and a brand-new game in the series, The Division 3, along with a mobile title called The Division Resurgence.Advertising for an unannounced The Division Definitive Edition recently appeared in Japan, though there is no telling if the images are authentic or not. Images also surfaced of new The Division merchandise, but IGN theorized they could be prizes for an upcoming The Division esports event.The Division was originally released in 2016, meaning 2026 will mark the game's 10th anniversary. It is one of many anniversaries on tap for 2026, including Donkey Kong (45th anniversary), The Legend of Zelda (40th anniversary), Sonic (35th anniversary), Pokemon (30th anniversary), Resident Evil (30th anniversary), Halo (25th anniversary), and The United States of America (250th anniversary).GameSpot has contacted Ubisoft for comment on the supposed The Division Definitive Edition.If such a game is real, it could follow the path of other definitive editions and receive visual and performance upgrades, along with the bundling of previously released DLC, among other things. The game was originally released on console for PS4 and Xbox One, so a possible definitive edition could come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. These are just guesses, however. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.As for The Division 3, director Julian Gerighty recently gave an update on the project, saying it's going to be a \"monster.\" The game was announced back in 2023 but we still haven't learned much about it, though.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                In October 2025, rumors suggested that Larian Studios' hit RPG Baldur's Gate 3 could be getting a port for Nintendo's Switch 2. Unfortunately, that report has turned out to be inaccurate as Larian has confirmed that its wildly popular D&D will not be coming to Nintendo's console.During a recent AMA session on Reddit, Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke acknowledged that the company wanted to work on a Switch 2 port, but it was denied.\"We would have loved to [bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Switch 2], but [it] wasn't our decision to make,\" wrote Vincke. That likely means the port was either shot down by Nintendo or by Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast, which controls the rights for all things Dungeons & Dragons-related.In another post from the Reddit session, Vincke indicated that the \"smaller\" game that the company had in mind post-Baldur's Gate 3 was \"another DnD game, but that ship has sailed.\"Last month, Larian released an upgraded version of Divinity: Original Sin II on Switch 2 and other modern consoles. As revealed during The Game Awards, Larian has turned its attention to a new Divinity game. Vinke recently noted that the team feels pressure from the success of Baldur's Gate 3 to exceed it with their next project.\"It's more pressure,\" said Vincke. \"The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing.\"Divinity doesn't currently have a release date.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

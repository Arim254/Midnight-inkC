    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Amazon's popular TV series The Boys is going to become its own video game, series creator Eric Kripke has revealed. He said in an interview that \"there are plans\" for The Boys to spin into its own video game, but not on console. Kripke would like to see a console game someday, though.\"There is currently a desire, but no hard plans for, a console game. I don't want to give anything away, because I'm not sure what Iâ€™m allowed to say or not, but there are plans for some other kinds of video games that aren't necessarily Xbox or PlayStation,\" he said in an interview with Variety.Characters from The Boys have appeared in games like Call of Duty and Mortal Kombat, but there hasn't been a dedicated game for the series as of yet.Based on the comics, The Boys is a TV series for Prime Video that spawned a spin-off series, Gen V, and a spin-off called The Boys: Mexico is also in the works. There is also the upcoming prequel series, Vought Rising, which takes place in the 1950s.The series seems ripe for a video game, as the world is full of powerful characters with unique abilities, and the off-beat and comedic tone might be appealing to many.Amazon--which hosts The Boys TV show--is also a big player in the world of video games, but it remains to be seen what company may back any future games based on the show. The show is produced in part by Sony.Gen V recently wrapped up its second season, which leads into the fifth and final season of The Boys. A release date has not been announced, but it's expected in 2026.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Elden Ring's Switch 2 port is not going to release on time. From Software and Bandai Namco have confirmed that the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition for Nintendo's console has been pushed to 2026.Development \"continues wholeheartedly,\" the developer said in a statement. But a delay was necessary to give the team time for \"performance adjustments.\"Earlier this year, people who played Elden Ring on Switch 2 said it was in rough shape, with the frame rate in particular getting called out for being poor. Bandai Namco forbade media from showing footage of the game, so we haven't actually seen it in action as of yet, however.\"We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support,\" the developer said about the delay.The Tarnished Edition includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Author George R.R. Martin worked on Elden Ring's backstory and lore.Elden Ring was the No. 2 best-selling game of 2022 in the US and sold nearly 30 million copies as of the end of 2024 across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. No sequel has been announced, but the standalone multiplayer spin-off, Elden Ring Nightreign, came out this past May. It's not confirmed for Switch 2, however.Assuming it releases in 2026, Elden Ring will join From Software's The Duskbloods in launching for Switch 2 next year. That is a new action-RPG exclusive to Switch 2 developed by From Software and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "\n    GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n  \n              \n          \n                Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total pay package for fiscal 2025 has been confirmed, and the executive earned a total of $96.5 million for the year. That is up 22% from the previous year and represents his highest-ever annual pay. It's a massive multiple over what the median Microsoft worker makes, with the median worker taking home around $200,000.The executive's pay details are coming to light as the company faces scrutiny over its recent Xbox decisions, including layoffs, game cancellations, studio closures, price hikes, and increasing profit-margin mandates. The company as a whole has faced ongoing criticism as well due to its slate of mass layoffs, partnership with Israel, and investments in AI, among other things.Nadella is paid a $2.5 million salary, a figure that's been the same since 2019. The majority of his pay for fiscal 2025 came from stock awards, making up $84.2 million (87%) of his total pay. Microsoft revealed all of this as part of a regulatory filing disclosed this week, as reported by The Seattle Times.Nadella also makes money from an annual cash bonus--for this latest fiscal year, Nadella got paid a bonus of $9.56 million. The bonus he got last year--$5.2 million--was millions less than this year. That's because he requested a lower cash bonus for 2024 due in part to cyberattacks against Microsoft.The median pay for a Microsoft employee, excluding Nadella's pay, rose in fiscal 2025 to $200,972, up from $193,744. At the same time, the delta between Nadella's pay and the median Microsoft salary is growing, reaching 480-to-1 for fiscal 2025--that's up from 250-to-1 in 2023.The regulatory filing revealing Nadella's latest pay included a memo from Microsoft's board of directors saying the CEO's efforts to push on artificial intelligence helped Microsoft's fortunes overall in the latest fiscal year. \"His leadership team have positioned Microsoft as a clear artificial intelligence leader for this generational technology shift,\" the board said.Microsoft reached a $4 trillion market cap this year and the company's stock also reached an all-time high of more than $535 earlier this year. Microsoft is the No. 2 most valuable company in the world right now, only trailing Nvidia.Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, taking over for Steve Ballmer. He is just the third CEO of Microsoft, following Bill Gates and Ballmer. Since Nadella took over as CEO, Microsoft's stock price has risen from about $36 in 2014 to more than $520 today, an increase of more than 1,300%.Recently, Microsoft made headlines again over a report that said CFO Amy Hood has implemented a new profit-margin mandate for Xbox of 30%, which is well above industry standards. Many have theorized that this reported mandate has contributed to some of the decisions Microsoft has made in recent times, including bringing its first-party games to rival platforms, raising prices on consoles and Game Pass, investing in automation technologies with AI, canceling games, closing studios, and laying off workers.Sources told Bloomberg that Microsoft will look to focus on producing titles that are \"cheap to make\" or more likely to generate revenue as opposed to \"riskier bets.\"Microsoft will publish its next earnings report on October 29, at which time the company's financial fortunes for the latest quarter will be revealed.\n                                  \n  \n    Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

After losing the first two picks of the weekend with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UVA/virginia-cavaliers/\">Virginia</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARIZST/arizona-state-sun-devils/\">Arizona State</a> upsets, my wagers settled down for a winning mark at 6-4 overall. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> hammering <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> keeping it within the number in College Station and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon's</a> outright victory at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a> helped.</p><p><strong>Season totals</strong>: Crawford (36-14 straight, 30-20 ATS); Hummer (36-14; 20-30).</p><p><em>For clarity, these lines were taken from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\">FanDuel Sportsbook</a> on Sept. 28.

North Carolina just isn't living up to the Bill Belichick hype at 2-2 and having been outscored 82-23 against Power Four competition. Clemson, for its part, went from preseason national title contender to a disastrous 1-3. Still, Clemson isn't a bad team. North Carolina might be. The Tigers win the lines of scrimmage and finally look more like themselves coming out of a bye week. -- <em>Clemson 38, North Carolina 20.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Clemson -13.5)</strong>: Is Clemson capable of covering any spread the remainder of the season as a favorite? I have questions. Which one of these teams will be be better prepared coming off a bye week? And for the Tigers, how much do they still care with end-of-season goals essentially over? These are all factors to consider when making this play. There's the obvious talent discrepancy as well, but that hasn't helped Dabo Swinney's much through four games. -- <em>Clemson 27, North Carolina 10.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BOISE/boise-state-broncos/\">Boise State</a> at No. 21 Notre Dame</h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Notre Dame -17.5)</strong>: This line is climbing the wrong direction for Boise State midway through this week. But it should be noted that Brad and I pick the lines as of Sunday. Thus, the value is with Notre Dame. Boise State is good. The Broncos are strong defensively, particularly in the secondary, and they're going to be a tough test. But Notre Dame's scored on everyone this year, and I'm hesitant to bet on a Boise State offense that's a middling 61st in offensive success rate. If there's an area of vulnerability for Notre Dame it's in the secondary, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28921239/maddux-madsen/\">Maddux Madsen</a> has just been OK (69th in QBR) and I haven't seen enough from the Broncos to think they'll light it up through the air. Give me the Irish to cover. -- <em>Notre Dame 35, Boise State 17.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Boise State +17.5)</strong>: The Irish might be overvalued a bit here after just hanging 50-plus at Arkansas, but they're certainly a team that looks to be hitting their stride since opening with losses to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a>. And while improved, there are still areas of weakness to sort out defensively at Notre Dame before mentioning \"playoff\" and \"Irish\" in the same sentence moving forward. I'll take the underdogs to cover here. -- <em>Notre Dame 38, Boise State 23.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICHST/michigan-state-spartans/\">Michigan State</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Michigan State +11.5)</strong>: This could be a big day for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29392540/dylan-raiola/\">Dylan Raiola</a> and the Huskers passing attack, because the Spartans have been horrendous this year defending the pass at 116th in success rate and 117th nationally in passing yards allowed per game. The question becomes can Michigan State's offense score enough against what is an excellent Nebraska secondary to keep up? I think Michigan State does enough coming out of a bye to keep this close. -- <em>Nebraska 34, Michigan State 24.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Michigan State +11.5)</strong>: Any believers in Nebraska yet? The home loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a> was a missed opportunity for Matt Rhule, who still hasn't beaten a nationally-ranked opponent with Huskers. The Spartans aren't ranked, but they did cover at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a> this month and have an offense capable of keeping it within the number. If Nebraska leaves the back door open, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28897339/aidan-chiles/\">Aidan Chiles</a> will deliver with a touchdown pass to cash. -- <em>Nebraska 31, Michigan State 24.</em></p>\n<h2>No. 14 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWAST/iowa-state-cyclones/\">Iowa State</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CINCY/cincinnati-bearcats/\">Cincinnati</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Cincinnati -1.5)</strong>: The Bearcats are much better this year, but I'm still a little surprised to see them favored over a ranked Iowa State team. But Vegas doesn't care about records or rankings, and the Bearcats have been playing great. To me this game comes down to one area: How does Cincinnati's pass defense holds up? I have full confidence the Bearcats can score. That unit's been awesome at third nationally in yards per play. But the Cincinnati secondary has been a disaster at 132nd nationally in defensive success rate against the pass. Can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877490/rocco-becht/\">Rocco Becht</a> take advantage? I'm not sure. High-scoring, high-volume games aren't how Iowa State usually wins. Give me the Bearcats. -- <em>Cincinnati 27, Iowa State 24.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Cincinnati -1.5)</strong>: If you're keeping tabs on games featuring an unranked team being favored at home against a ranked opponent, it hits more often than not. We saw it happen last week when then-unbeaten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a> was an underdog at Arizona State. Another scenario could be unfolding here in the unpredictable Big 12. Iowa State's unbeaten, but this will be its first road game against a conference opponent this fall. -- <em>Cincinnati 23, Iowa State 20.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a> at No. 6 Texas A&M</h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Mississippi State +13.5)</strong>: Unlike Auburn over the weekend, Mississippi State is capable enough on offense to stress a Texas A&M defense that's had some shaky moments early this year. It also helps that quietly the Bulldogs' defense has been excellent at 32nd nationally in yards allowed per play. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3168291/blake-shapen/\">Blake Shapen</a> needs to recapture some of his early-season form, but I think this sets up well for a Mississippi State cover. I wouldn't even rule out an upset if the Bulldogs can force a few turnovers. -- <em>Texas A&M 34, Mississippi State 21.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Mississippi State +13.5)</strong>: Mississippi State is 5-0 ATS this season and could've beaten <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> outright last week as a 7.5-point underdog at home before the Vols forced overtime. Texas A&M failed to cover at home against Auburn and needed its top defensive performance of the season to down the Tigers. The Aggies should stay unbeaten, but take the points here. And if you can get 14 points or more by kickoff, even better. -- <em>Texas A&M 34, Mississippi State 24.</em></p><h2>No. 9 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a> </h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Texas -7.5)</strong>: This is a tough game for Florida. Unless we see a very different offensive product from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28904801/dj-lagway/\">DJ Lagway</a> and the Gators passing attack, Florida will really struggle against one of the elite defenses in college football. And while the Gators defense has held up admirably for much of the year, the injuries are starting to pile up for that unit, especially along the defensive line. Maybe Florida comes out of the bye week and looks totally different. It's possible. But based on what we've seen so far, I'll take Texas to cover. -- <em>Texas 27, Florida 17.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Texas -7.5)</strong>: Statement coming from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29122638/arch-manning/\">Arch Manning</a>? His first SEC start of the season is the most important on this Texas schedule. It's difficult to imagine the Longhorns being a factor in the league title race or playoff conversation if they fall to a team amid a significant decline. Billy Napier's offense has no rhythm and going up against a defense littered with stars, that's a bad omen. -- <em>Texas 24, Florida 10.</em></p>\n<h2>No. 11 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Texas Tech -10.5)</strong>: I enter this game wondering if Houston can score enough to keep up with Texas Tech. The Cougars are better on that side of the ball but still rank just 86th nationally in yards per play and 116th in offensive success rate. That could be a problem against what's been an elite Texas Tech defense and an offensive unit capable of putting up points in bunches. Houston's defense keeps this game close for a while, but Texas Tech is going to be tough to beat coming out of a bye week. -- <em>Texas Tech 28, Houston 17.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Houston +10.5)</strong>: We're keeping the Red Raiders as the projected Big 12 champion this week, but Joey McGuire's team is marked and is no more upset proof than many other remaining unbeatens. Unlike most Texas Tech wins, this one could take more of the methodical approach against an opponent whose front seven defensively may struggle getting push. But if you're giving me 10.5 points with an unranked team at home coached by Willie Fritz, I'm taking it. -- <em>Texas Tech 31, Houston 23.</em></p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a> at No. 20 Michigan</h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Wisconsin +16.5)</strong>: Does Wisconsin look any better coming out of the bye week? That's the big question entering this one. It helps the Badgers' case that Billy Edwards is back under center as QB1. But the Badgers still must figure out a way to consistently run the football. Michigan, outside of big runs by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123679/justice-haynes/\">Justice Haynes</a>, isn't usually particularly explosive offensively, so that works in Wisconsin's favor in terms of keeping this close. Michigan is better, but the Badgers manage to cover in an important game for Luke Fickell. -- <em>Michigan 31, Wisconsin 20. </em></p>\n<p><strong>Crawford (Michigan -16.5)</strong>: It's show me time for Fickell and the Badgers. Too often Wisconsin has come out flat under this current regime in big games, so here's a chance at reversing those fortunes in Ann Arbor. The best play here would be taking the under, but if you must pick a side, Michigan with a late cover in a potentially ugly game feels like the right spot to put your money. -- <em>Michigan 30, Wisconsin 13.</em></p><h2>No. 16 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">Vanderbilt</a> at No. 10 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Vanderbilt +13.5)</strong>: Vanderbilt is a product with which I know exactly what to expect. The Commodores are going to control the clock, efficiently move the football and avoid defensive mistakes that lead to explosive plays. Alabama? The Crimson Tide are more talented, but we've seen some very uneven performances from them this year. This game comes down to two areas to me: 1. How does a just OK Vanderbilt offensive line hold up? 2. Can Alabama establish any sort of run game and avoid making <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a> carry the offense? I do think Alabama gets revenge at home. But Vanderbilt is going to make it difficult. -- <em>Alabama 34, Vanderbilt 27.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Vanderbilt +13.5)</strong>: Vanderbilt's not going to beat Alabama for a second straight year, but this line feels disrespectful to the Commodores. Knowing what <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28873851/diego-pavia/\">Diego Pavia</a> was able to do against this defense last season should worry Alabama fans, especially since he's red-hot again through five games. Vanderbilt's been beating the opposition by more than four touchdowns per game this fall, but that changes this weekend. -- <em>Alabama 38, Vanderbilt 27.</em></p>\n<h2>No. 3 Miami at No. 18 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Hummer (Miami -5.5)</strong>: This is going to be a fun test for Miami's revamped defense. It takes so much discipline to play Florida State's offense led by Gus Malzahn and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875815/tommy-castellanos/\">Tommy Castellanos</a>, and the Hurricanes have historically (and at times this year) had issues with busts and tackling. At the same time, I'm not particularly optimistic about Florida State's defense generating much pressure against what is the best O-line in college football. Both these teams are good. But Miami has the better roster and has the advantage of coming off a bye. Give me the Hurricanes. -- <em>Miami 35, Florida State 28.</em></p><p><strong>Crawford (Miami -5.5)</strong>: I was admittedly surprised Virginia had as much success offensively as it did against the Seminoles, which resulted in an inexcusable road loss for Mike Norvell despite a sizable talent advantage. Here, it is Miami's turn to flex its roster after an open date. Can Florida State block this Hurricanes' front? That's where the game will be won. Pressuring Castellanos is key for the unbeaten Hurricanes. -- <em>Miami 27, Florida State 20.</em></p>\n            </div>"

Just heard there was this high-level D-II coach, but I started studying his stuff this past year. They played a coach I worked with … I watched one game, locked in, and it's just incredible what he does. I studied him more and more as the season went along. Then they beat <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MIZZOU/missouri-tigers/\">Missouri</a> in the NCAA Tournament. There's more than just success in Year 1 (at Iowa). Longevity at that place. That feels like a really good fit for him and he's bringing a couple of his good players.

Great coach. He'll win consistently as long as his administration supports him.\"</li><li>\"McCollum I don't know anything about, but seems like he's a controlling tempo and defensive guy, so that will translate no matter what personnel they have.

He has the experience and the skill to be a perfect fit at Texas.\" </li><li>\"It's not really close. He has proven he can win at an elite school (Arizona) and he is at Texas. It's a place you are going to win at. And: Sean wins.\"</li><li>\"Perfect fit and has won big [at that level] already. Very smart hire. Ensures they will continue to be good after the worst four-year period in history. Went from multiple Elite Eights at a hoops-only school to not making tourney for four years. Major slide. [Texas] will be back.\"</li></ul><h3>    About Odom   </h3><ul><li> \"Some coaches get hired, it makes sense and is the perfect the place. For me, Odom is an easy choice because the program he went to is the most synergistic fit of all the guys. I've gotten to know Ryan and know UVa well based on having worked in that area. I know what UVa is about academically and non-athletically. When Ryan Odom was at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UMBC/umbc-retrievers/\">UMBC</a>, he invited me to his practice and I got to know him there. How he is as a coach, who he is, what he values and the university, it's a perfect fit.\"  \t\t</li><li><p>\"He has a personal connection to the university and he's won everywhere he's been: UMBC, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UTAHST/utah-state-aggies/\">Utah State</a>, VCU.\"  \t\t</p></li></ul><h3>   About others</h3><ul><li>Medved: \"How can anyone discount what Niko Medved has done at each stop in his career? He inherited a disaster at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/FURMAN/furman-paladins/\">Furman</a> and in three years he won. Drake, he won. And what he did at CSU is beyond impressive.\"</li><li>Jensen: \"I had a chance to spend a year with Alex when I was [younger]. He has a way about him. Humble, exceptionally smart, obviously very knowledgeable about the game but doesn't try to outsmart himself. He has a feel for people.\"</li></ul><h2>        The takeaway<br />                </h2><p>With our \"who's the best player?\" and \"who's the best team?\" survey questions this year, I've been pulling out data from the archives to show who won those Qs in years past. Let's do the same for today's study, as it's a question we've asked dating back to 2014.</p><p>Recent winners of this question — with links to go back and see how the coaches voted each year — are ... </p>\n<p><strong>2024</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-was-college-basketballs-best-high-major-coaching-hire-of-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">John Calipari to Arkansas</a></span>. Way too soon to tell, but he was <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/new-face-new-place-big-wins-here-were-the-best-year-1-coaches-in-college-basketball-for-the-2024-25-season/\" target=\"_blank\">objectively not the best hire in Year 1</a></span>. <br /><strong>2023</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-was-the-best-high-major-coaching-hire-of-the-2023-offseason/\" target=\"_blank\">Rick Pitino to St. John's</a></span>. An easy choice not so long ago and it's certainly looking like the right pick as of today.<br /><strong>2022</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-was-the-best-hire-of-the-college-basketball-coaching-carousel-in-2022/\" target=\"_blank\">Shaheen Holloway to Seton Hall</a></span>. A tight vote that year, but a miss, as Holloway was hired in the same year as Jon Scheyer, Todd Golden, Dennis Gates and Chris Jans.<br /><strong>2021</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-was-the-best-coaching-hire-in-college-basketball-in-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Beard to Texas</a></span>. It ended disastrously. Shaka Smart finished second, and that tracks. Tommy Lloyd to Arizona wasn't even top-five!<br /><strong>2019</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-was-the-best-head-coaching-hire-in-college-basketball-this-year/\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Hoiberg to Nebraska</a></span>. He finished well ahead of guys who proved to be better their schools: Nate Oats, Mick Cronin, TJ Otzelberger and Eric Musselman.<br /><strong>2018</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-was-the-best-coaching-hire-of-2018-in-college-basketball/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Mack to Louisville</a></span>. Mack beat out the Correct Answer by one percentage point that year: Dan Hurley to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UCONN/connecticut-huskies/\">UConn</a>.<br /><strong>2017</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-power-conference-school-made-the-best-coaching-hire/\" target=\"_blank\">Archie Miller to Indiana</a></span>. An obvious miss. Brad Underwood to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> is the clear best hire from 2017; he took second to Miller that year.<br /><strong>2016</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-was-the-best-new-coaching-hire-this-offseason/\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Underwood to Oklahoma State</a></span>. Yes, Underwood had two power-conference jobs in two years. Beard to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a> or Greg Gard at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/WISC/wisconsin-badgers/\">Wisconsin</a> wound up as the most fruitful hires, though.<br /><strong>2015</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-the-best-coaching-hire-of-the-2015-offseason/\" target=\"_blank\">Shaka Smart to Texas</a></span>. He comfortably won, with Ben Howland to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MISSST/mississippi-state-bulldogs/\">Mississippi State</a> being second. The Correct Answer came in third that year with 12% of the vote: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a> hiring Rick Barnes.<br /><strong>2014</strong>: <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-school-made-the-best-coaching-hire/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz Williams to Virginia Tech</a></span>. Identical to 2018, the top vote-getter that year beat out the leading vote-getter by 1%: Bruce Pearl to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a> came in second. </p><p>I love asking this question every year to get a read of coaches' opinions on their contemporaries. That said bear in mind the winner is far from guaranteed to be the best in their hiring class. In the 10 previous iterations of this question, it's fair to say coaches got it right with the No. 1 pick <em>maybe </em>two times.</p><p>That doesn't mean McCollum won't prove to be excellent. After winning 395 games (and four national titles) in 15 seasons at Division II Northwest Missouri State, the Iowa native walked into D-I at Drake and went 31-4. The fit with the Hawkeyes seems like it could change the dynamic in the Big Ten in the next decade if McCollum's philosophies are adaptable at the high-major level. </p>\n<p>I expected Wade to finish top-three when we presented this question, and in fact he took the 2-slot. His confidence and personality profile matched with NC State's position in the Triangle pecking order has a lot of coaches eager to see if the Wolfpack can be a national factor in the next two years. That is going to be a fun one to watch.</p><p>And with Miller, he's been up for voting in this question before, just a few years ago when he went to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/XAVIER/xavier-musketeers/\">Xavier</a>. He has more wins than any coach in this year's cycle. He goes to Texas, with the idea that he can do more than he did at Xavier. With the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-commitments-plummet-amid-big-changes-in-recruiting-nobody-knows-what-to-do-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\">new revenue sharing rules in place</a></span>, we'll see if that winds up being the case. Miller has long been referred to as one of the best coaches without a Final Four to his name. He'd love to shed that label as quickly as possible in what should be his final stop in college coaching. </p><p>Big picture, I look at McCollum to Iowa, Wade to State, Medved to Minnesota, Odom to Virginia, Alex Jensen to Utah, Luke Loucks to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a>, etc. ... and I don't think there's been a carousel cycle in the past decade where there have been more \"fits\" that align with coaching style, school, background, geographical ties than what we have in 2025. It's why, even though coaches had to settle on one answer, a number of guys I spoke with gave their second-choice votes to the likes of Medved and Odom. </p>\n<p>Even Jai Lucas and Bucky McMillan — neither of whom has been a high-major coach until this year — each received a vote. This is a promising, relatively young class of coaches stepping into new gigs. It's not just about who they were when they won the job, it's about how they can adapt in the next few years. College sports is in either Stage 3 or 4 of probably a five-stage mega-shift, and only the coaches who understand the terrain and how to map-read, pivot and adjust will still be holding on to these jobs, or better ones, five years from now. </p><h2>Previous 2025 Candid Coaches questions</h2><ul><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-mens-college-basketball-team-this-season/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the best men's college basketball team this season?</a></span></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-what-percentage-of-your-schools-revenue-sharing-should-go-to-mens-basketball/\" target=\"_blank\">What percentage of your school's revenue sharing should go to men's basketball?</a></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the best college basketball player this season?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-is-the-best-xs-and-os-coach-in-college-basketball-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\">Who is the best Xs-and-Os coach?</a></span>  </li></ul>\n            </div>"

On Tuesday, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Colts</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/Colts/status/1973511939096780878\" target=\"_blank\">placed Howard on reserve/retired list</a>. The sudden retirement comes after just four games with the Colts, who are off to a surprising 3-1 start. </p><p>Howard, 32, signed with Indianapolis back in August after sitting out the entire 2024 season. He played his first previous eight seasons with the Dolphins, where he was a four-time Pro Bowler and earned first-team All-Pro honors in 2020. </p><p>\"When I was away from the game in 2024, I fell in love with taking my kids to school, doing activities with them and watching them grow up,\" <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPSN07hjeTU/\" target=\"_blank\">Howard wrote</a> in his retirement post. \"Up to that point I had always put my family after football. I'm no longer willing to do so. So today I am retiring from the National Football League.\" </p><figure>\n</figure>\n<p>Howard started in each of the Colts' first four games this season and recovered a fumble during the team's Week 1 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a>. </p>\n<p>While he continued to remain in the starting lineup, Howard had been struggling in recent weeks. During the Colts' Week 4 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a>, he allowed seven completions on 10 targets for 112 yards and a touchdown, according to Next Gen Stats (<a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2025/09/30/xavien-howard-lou-anarumos-colts-cornerback/86412474007/?gnt-cfr=1&gca-cat=p&gca-uir=true&gca-epti=z117062p119950c119950e009100v117062b0052xxd005265&gca-ft=117&gca-ds=sophi\" target=\"_blank\">per the IndyStar)</a>. He was routinely matched up against Rams wideout <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121687/puka-nacua/\">Puka Nacua</a>, who caught 13 passes for 170 yards. </p><p>\"Not to my ability,\" Howard said afterward when asked if his play has been up to snuff. </p><p>A 2016 second-round pick, Howard was an immediate starter for the Dolphins and was able to establish himself as one of the league's best cornerbacks. During that span, he led the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in interceptions twice, including career-high 10 picks during the 2020 season. </p>\n<p>Howard retires with 29 interceptions and 95 passes defensed in 104 career games.

The winner will advance to the ALDS to face the Seattle Mariners.</p><p>Here's the Wild Card Series schedule for the Tigers vs. Guardians:</p><table><tbody><tr><th><br />  </th><th>Date</th><th>Start time/score</th><th>TV</th><th>Live stream</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 1</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Tues., Sept. 30</p></td><td><p>DET 2, CLE 1</p></td><td><p>ESPN</p></td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 2</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Weds., Oct. 1</p></td><td><p>CLE 6, DET 1</p></td><td><p>ESPN</p></td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 3</strong> \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Thurs., Oct. 2</p></td><td><p>3:08 p.m. ET</p></td><td><p>ABC</p></td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2> Where to watch Game 3<br />  </h2><p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, Oct. 2 | <strong>Time:</strong> 3:08 p.m. ET<br /> <strong>Location:</strong> Progressive Field (Cleveland)<br /><strong>TV channel: </strong>ABC | <strong>Live stream</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a> (Try for free)<br /> <strong>Probable pitchers:</strong> RHP Jack Flaherty (DET) vs. RHP Slade Cecconi (CLE)<br /><strong>Odds:</strong> DET -107 | CLE -113 (via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings</a>)</p>\n<h2>Game 3 prediction</h2><p>I have no idea what to expect really, given this pitching matchup and these very unpredictable offenses.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>We're four weeks into the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> season, which means we're about a quarter of the way through. It's hard to believe, given that it feels like the season just started, but that's where we are right now.</p><p>And after four weeks, we've seen enough to -- mostly -- start declaring which teams are good and bad. There's obviously plenty of football left to play, but all 32 teams have also put quite a bit on tape already. And we know with some degree of conviction which teams are definitely good and bad. There's a squishy middle of the league that is more complicated to sort out, but we can at least make some educated guesses on which teams are probably good or bad.</p><p>That's what we're here to do today: We're sorting all 32 of the league's teams into five distinct tiers based on where they are right now and will likely go in the future. These include factors like their schedules, conditions of rosters and more.</p><h2>Tier 5: See you at the draft<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CAR/carolina-panthers/\">Carolina Panthers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NO/new-orleans-saints/\">New Orleans Saints</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>These teams are going nowhere fast.</p><p>The Panthers have looked fairly embarrassing in three of their four games, and they somehow blew out the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> 30-0 in the other. We're betting that the three losses are more representative than the one win. The same goes for the Browns, who somehow had their defense steal a game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> in Week 3 but have otherwise not looked good and are making a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-to-start-dillon-gabriel-at-qb-bench-joe-flacco/\" target=\"_blank\">quarterback change</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Saints, Jets and Titans are all 0-4, and they look varying degrees of terrible. The Jets have probably looked the \"best\" of the three teams, and they don't look good at all. They could have won that Week 1 game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> and almost stole Week 3 at the Bucs, but they've gone down big in three of their four games so far. The Saints have generally hung around and seemed run-of-the-mill bad rather than atrocious in their games, but they're just not a talented team. Tennessee is probably on the verge of firing its coach, and quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> put it best <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cam-ward-sums-up-titans-play-through-four-games-we-ass/\" target=\"_blank\">when he said</a></span> of the Titans, \"We ass.\"</p><p>It might be aggressive to put the Bengals here, but they've lost two straight in pathetic fashion without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a> and their next three games are against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, Packers and Steelers. They'll likely be 2-5 before we have a chance to blink.</p><h2>Tier 4: Probably bad<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Miami Dolphins</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYG/new-york-giants/\">New York Giants</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>The Raiders have lost three in a row, including one game to a backup quarterback, and their offense just has not been able to get much going to date because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a> can't stop throwing interceptions and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693971/brock-bowers/\">Brock Bowers</a> doesn't look like himself. The defense also is not nearly good enough to carry the team, as it's probably still the weaker unit.</p>\n<p>Miami has looked vaguely competent in two of its four games but been able to defeat only the decrepit Jets, and the Dolphins just lost <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131163/tyreek-hill/\">Tyreek Hill</a> for the season. Undermanned on both offense and defense now, they're likely to slide even further back from the pack over the rest of the season. (They do have the good fortune of playing games against the Panthers, Browns, Saints and Jets again, though.)</p><p>The Giants pulled off Sunday's shocking upset of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26694019/jaxson-dart/\">Jaxson Dart</a> acquitted himself fairly well in his first start, but this team that could do nothing offensively with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a> under center just lost top playmaker <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26697761/malik-nabers/\" target=\"_blank\">Malik Nabers</a> for the year to a torn ACL. Unless the defensive line totally dominates like it did in Week 4, it's probably still going to be a long season.</p><h2>Tier 3: Possibly frisky<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a>, Atlanta Falcons, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Baltimore Ravens</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CHI/chicago-bears/\">Chicago Bears</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Denver Broncos</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/HOU/houston-texans/\">Houston Texans</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIN/minnesota-vikings/\">Minnesota Vikings</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NE/new-england-patriots/\">New England Patriots</a>, Pittsburgh Steelers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Washington Commanders</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>This is the largest group of teams, and that makes sense because we're still pretty early in the season and don't really know enough about anybody to draw that many definitive conclusions just yet. So we're lumping the entire middle class of the NFL into one tier, deemed possibly frisky, until we know more.</p>\n<p>Arizona beat two bad teams and lost to two good ones. The Falcons have shown a low floor without yet showing the type of ceiling that we want to see from a good team. The Ravens have a lot of talent, but their defense is decimated and now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2239671/lamar-jackson/\">Lamar Jackson</a> might miss time. The Bears seem to have rebounded from their rough start but did so against two weak defenses.</p><p>The Cowboys have shown that they can move the ball and put up points, but their defense is atrocious. The Broncos just stomped the Bengals, but their offense hasn't fully gotten untracked just yet. The Texans are here mostly because the AFC South isn't great and we know that they have a really good defense.</p><p>The Colts are off to a surprising start to the season but required a massive comeback for one of their wins and just lost to the first elite team they played. The Jags are 3-1 but lost to the Bengals, and there's no way that they can keep forcing turnovers at the rate they have to date. The Vikings have a ferocious defense, but we have yet to see the offense get fully untracked.</p>\n<p>The Patriots have had their only two wins against the dregs of the league, and have looked ordinary in their two losses, one of which saw them turn it over five times. Pittsburgh could easily be 1-3 instead of 3-1 if the ball had bounced differently in games against the Jets and Pats. And we don't yet know what Washington will look like when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123337/jayden-daniels/\">Jayden Daniels</a> comes back.</p><p>All of these teams have their strengths, obviously. But again, we probably don't know enough about them to make a determination on whether they are probably bad or good. So we're sticking them here and punting on that determination a while longer.</p><h2>Tier 2: Probably good<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/KC/kansas-city-chiefs/\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, Los Angeles Chargers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SF/san-francisco-49ers/\">San Francisco 49ers</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/SEA/seattle-seahawks/\">Seattle Seahawks</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-buccaneers/\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>These are teams that we know are talented and have gotten off to varying degrees of good starts (they're all 3-1 except for the Chiefs) but also know have real flaws on one side of the ball or another, for one reason or another.</p>\n<p>The Chiefs finally looked like themselves offensively against the Ravens, but that defense has been torn to shreds by every opponent. We need to see that type of performance more consistently, and the same goes for the defense. The Chargers just lost to the Giants and now must play without both of their starting tackles for a while, but the defense is still terrific (two of New York's scoring drives started deep in L.A. territory) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2221960/justin-herbert/\">Justin Herbert</a> was playing at an extremely high level.</p><p>The 49ers are dealing with injuries pretty much everywhere on both offense and defense. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961306/brock-purdy/\">Brock Purdy</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3122949/ricky-pearsall/\">Ricky Pearsall</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180514/jauan-jennings/\">Jauan Jennings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2260972/nick-bosa/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Bosa</a> -- basically everyone<em> except</em> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2136743/christian-mccaffrey/\">Christian McCaffrey</a> is ailing at the moment. The Seahawks have one of the NFL's best defenses, if not the single best, and that will keep them competitive in just about every game. We have to see what the offense looks like when it gets into trailing mode to have more confidence that the 49ers can contend.</p><p>The Bucs are also 3-1 and dealing with a ton of injuries. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824909/mike-evans/\">Mike Evans</a> and the entire right side of the offensive line are out. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162347/jalen-mcmillan/\">Jalen McMillan</a> won't be back until after the bye. The run game has not looked the same as it did last year and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26693770/bucky-irving/\">Bucky Irving</a> is now dealing with an injury. We almost have to be in wait-and-see mode here.</p>\n<h2>Tier 1: Inner circle (for now)<br /></h2><ul><li><strong><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BUF/buffalo-bills/\">Buffalo Bills</a>, Detroit Lions, <strong><em>Green Bay Packers, </em></strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Los Angeles Rams</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>The Eagles and Bills are 4-0. They were inner-circle contenders last year and just keep winning. There have been some fits and starts for Philadelphia's offense, but we know how talented a team that is, and we've seen that the Eagles can win games despite not playing at their best. Buffalo has given us no reason to doubt that it is one of the league's best teams, with a rollicking comeback over the Ravens in Week 1 and double-digit wins over dregs in the other three games.</p><p>Separating the Lions, Packers and Rams from the rest of the teams near the top is a bit more difficult, but mostly comes down to ceiling. The Lions have shown that their offense is still a machine, even if that machine got taken offline for a while in Week 1 against Green Bay. The Packers have shown that their defense, which did just get torched by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescott/\">Dak Prescott</a>, has the ability to be such a monster that it is almost impossible to move the ball. And the Rams have shown that they can compete with anyone on both sides of the ball. Their only loss came on a blocked kick in Philadelphia, in a game they mostly controlled.</p>\n            </div>"

It was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29086560/ben-rice/\">Ben Rice</a> early and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507358/jazz-chisholm-jr/\">Jazz Chisholm Jr.</a> late Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, extending New York's season with a Game 2 win (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/boxscore/MLB_20251001_BOS@NYY/\" target=\"_blank\">NYY 4, BOS 3</a>). Thursday's Game 3 will send one team to the ALDS to face the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> and the other home.  </p><p>Rice did not start Game 1 against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2836763/garrett-crochet/\">Garrett Crochet</a> because he's a lefty hitter who can have trouble with lefties, and also because <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765052/paul-goldschmidt/\">Paul Goldschmidt</a> crushed lefties in 2025. Rice and Goldschmidt make for a natural platoon. It has been tough sledding the last few weeks for Goldschmidt though. Rice, meanwhile, went 10 for 23 with three homers in his final six regular-season games.  </p><p>\"Being aggressive to where and what I am looking for in the zone,\" Rice said after the game about his recent hot streak. \"Always  coming up with a plan, being convicted in that, and just being ready to  go.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-bracket-schedule-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores as Dodgers advance, Yankees-Red Sox, more series go to Game 3</p>\n                <p>\n                    Kate Feldman                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores as Dodgers advance, Yankees-Red Sox, more series go to Game 3\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/bca9b677-47e3-4b9a-87fe-7eb2c859f141/thumbnail/270x152/c9a4d2adfcc2e4df9fdfcce80727a2e4/mlb-bracket-dodgers-advance.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>In the first inning of Game 2, Rice hit the very first pitch he saw in the series into the right field seats for a quick 2-0 Yankees lead. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615413/brayan-bello/\">Brayan Bello</a> left a cement mixer out over the plate and Rice did what he's been doing all season: hit the ball hard in the air. His underlying batted ball data and contact rates are exceptional. Among the best in baseball, in fact. Swings like this are a perfect example:  </p>\n<p>Rice is the first Yankee to hit a home run in his first career postseason at-bat since Shane Spencer the Home Run Dispenser back in 1998. He's only the sixth player this century to hit a home run on his first career postseason pitch. </p><p>\"I know my role,\" Rice said when asked if it was difficult to be out of the lineup in Game 1. \"And yesterday my role was to be ready for a big at-bat off the bench, and today I was starting. The approach doesn't change. I mean, I am just going to be prepared for every at-bat I get and every chance I get.\"</p><p>Like Rice, Chisholm did not start against Crochet because he's a lefty who's had trouble against lefties. Also, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2117042/amed-rosario/\">Amed Rosario</a> entered the game 6 for 9 with a home run against Crochet, so he drew the start at second. Chisholm did enter Game 1 in the late innings and flew out in New York's failed ninth-inning rally. After the game, he made it pretty clear wasn't happy being out of the lineup.</p>\n<p>\"I guess, yeah,\" Chisholm said Tuesday with his back turned to reporters when asked if he was surprised to be out of the lineup after Game 1. \"... It's always tough watching when your team's down.\"  </p><p>How did Chisholm handle the disappointment?</p><p>\"I played MLB The Show and mercy ruled someone,\" he explained, adding he has Ken Griffey Jr. on his custom New York Aliens team. \"That's how I get my stress off.\"</p><p>In Game 2, Chisholm's contributions came on both sides of the ball. He saved at least one run in the seventh inning with a diving stop on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29041593/masataka-yoshidas/\">Masataka Yoshida's</a> ground ball back up in the middle, more or less the same ball Yoshida hit that drove in two runs in Game 1. Chisholm did not get an out on the play, but keeping the ball on the infield forced the runner to hold up at third.  </p>\n<p>The next batter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1945488/trevor-story/\">Trevor Story</a>, flew out to deep center field to strand the bases loaded and keep the game tied 3-3.  </p><p>\"You see a ground ball, you got to stop it.  You have to keep it in the infield.  You have to stop that run from scoring,\" Chisholm said about his diving play in the seventh. \"I felt at that point it would have been a really crucial run.  I  was doing what I could to keep the ball in the infield.  Not trying to  make the play at first base but keep it in the infield.  I caught the  ball, I was like maybe I could make it at first base.  At the end of the  day, it is stopping that run from scoring.\"</p><p>Chisholm's eyes and legs built New York's game-winning run in the eighth. He worked a seven-pitch, two-out walk against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2837680/garrett-whitlock/\">Garrett Whitlock</a> to give the Yankees a little life. The next batter, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615315/austin-wells/\">Austin Wells</a>, roped a single to right field, and, because it hit the side wall at a weird angle, it caromed away from right fielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3158300/nate-eaton/\">Nate Eaton</a>. That allowed Chisholm to score all the way from first base.  </p>\n<p>\"Going through my head, I am already running, so any ball that an  outfielder moves to his left or right, I have to score, in my head,\" Chisholm said. \"That's all I was thinking.\"</p><p>The Red Sox will start lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29658250/connelly-early/\">Connelly Early</a> in Game 3 and Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Chisholm will be in the lineup. The Yankees will get together and think about the first base situation, though it would be awfully tough to have Rice on the bench again. He's blistered everything the last few weeks, including his first-inning homer in Game 2. The best lineup includes him.  </p><p>Whatever the lineup is going to be in Game 3 is whatever the lineup is going to be in Game 3. We'll find out Thursday. In Game 2 though, two players who were not trusted enough to be in the Game 1 lineup made impact plays. Rice opened the scoring with his homer and Chisholm saved a run with his glove and created a run with his legs. They gave the Yankees the shot in the arm they lacked Tuesday.  </p>\n<p>\"I feel like every game is a must-win.  For us, we want to win every  day. Any other professional athlete thinking about a game they  want to play, it is a must-win,\" Chisholm said about Game 3. \"We always put everything out there on the line, especially the  playoffs.  We want to give every game.  There's no space.  You don't  want to give any team an edge.  Obviously a must-win.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>CHICAGO –</span> We've become a bit habituated to all the triple-digit fastballs and sharp, unhittable late movement populating Major League Baseball these days. Relievers especially have been bred and fed to max out velocity, and so many of them regularly clock readings that would've been unthinkable less than a generation ago. And there's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26911802/mason-miller/\">Mason Miller</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a>' fire-breathing high-leverage reliever and the club's flagship trade-deadline addition. </p><p>However routine \"pitch nastiness\" has become for the regular observer of this sport, a pitcher like Miller still redefines what we think a ball leaving a human hand should be able to do. Miller loudly reminded us of this during the later innings of the San Diego Padres' 3-0 win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Chicago Cubs</a> (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/recap/MLB_20251001_SD@CHC/\" target=\"_blank\">box score</a>) in Wednesday's Game 2 of the National League Wild Card Series. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-bracket-schedule-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores as Dodgers advance, Yankees-Red Sox, more series go to Game 3</p>\n                <p>\n                    Kate Feldman                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"2025 MLB playoff bracket: Schedule, scores as Dodgers advance, Yankees-Red Sox, more series go to Game 3\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/02/bca9b677-47e3-4b9a-87fe-7eb2c859f141/thumbnail/270x152/c9a4d2adfcc2e4df9fdfcce80727a2e4/mlb-bracket-dodgers-advance.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>With the Padres down 0-1 in the best-of-three set and thus facing elimination, Miller got the call from manager Mike Shildt after starter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211754/dylan-cease/\">Dylan Cease</a> and All-Star lefty setup man Adrián Morejón combined for six scoreless. Staked to a 3-0 lead that he would maintain, Miller struck out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/27023012/seiya-suzuki/\">Seiya Suzuki</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044542/carson-kelly/\">Carson Kelly</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26615365/pete-crow-armstrong/\">Pete Crow-Armstrong</a> in the seventh. Then in the eighth, Miller struck out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184343/dansby-swanson/\">Dansby Swanson</a> and Moisés Ballesteros before just nicking the pant leg of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117931/michael-busch/\">Michael Busch</a> with a 1-0 backfoot slider that back-footed just a bit too much. At that point, Shildt went to closer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26861461/robert-suarez/\">Robert Suarez</a> for what would be a four-out save. The relevant moving pictures: </p><p>Through the magic of color television sports programming, let's revisit strike three to Kelly because in some ways it's \"The Mason Miller Experience\" distilled down to a single pitch with which the batter can do nothing but genuflect before it: </p>\n<p>Yes, as claimed, that's that 104.5 mph four-seamer is the fastest postseason pitch on record. Given that probably no one was throwing 104.5 mph before we had reliable means to measure such things, yes, it's probably the fastest pitch anyone has ever thrown in the playoffs. </p><p>\"104, we like that,\" Shildt said after Game 2 while complimenting Miller's \"pretty impressive\" outing. </p><p>Miller in Game 2 threw 11 fastballs, and those were the 11 fastest pitches thrown by anyone in Game 2. He averaged 103 mph with it. Miller on Wednesday got six whiffs on 10 swings and, looping in his Game 1 performance on Tuesday, he's now struck out eight of the nine batters he's faced in this series. That's against a Cubs offense that during the regular season was one of the toughest in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> to strike out. </p>\n<p>All of this raises the necessary matter of whether Miller will be available for Thursday's game, which will decide whether the Padres or Cubs advance to face the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIL/milwaukee-brewers/\">Milwaukee Brewers</a> in the Division Series. Shildt after Game 2 addressed that pressing matter: </p><blockquote><p>\"Yeah, I mean, listen. I mean, Morejon and Miller have gone back-to-back days. Both got extended today. Morejon is still efficient, but 33 pitches. Miller in the 30s for two games combined. I would have an expectation that all hands are on deck tomorrow, but we're also going to take their temperature and be smart. We've got to value their careers as well. But we've also been -- we've only had two guys go three days in a row all year, and we've done it and saved it for these circumstances. Obviously in an elimination game, there's special circumstances.\"</p></blockquote><p>Miller threw 13 pitches in Game 1 on Tuesday and then 27 in Game 2. Only once this season has Miller worked three straight days, and that was back in May, before the Padres acquired him from the A's. Here's how he fared while pitching in every game of that three-game set against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PHI/philadelphia-phillies/\">Phillies</a>: </p><ul><li>May 23: ⅔ IP, 3 R, 1 SO, 27 pitches</li><li>May 24: 1 IP, 1 R, 3 SO, 21 pitches</li><li>May 25: 1 IP, 0 R, 1 SO, 12 pitches</li></ul><p>At the time, he was coming off a combined 48 pitches before being called upon for the third leg of a back-to-back-to-back. In the here and now, he's coming off 40 pitches. Obviously, we shouldn't read too much into a one-off more than four months ago and compare it to the effort level and intensity of playoff baseball, but Shildt will be operating from precedent if he leans on Miller in Game 3. As for the \"value their careers\" part, Shildt is no doubt invoking ethical principles, and adding to it is the fact that the 27-year-old Miller is under team control through the 2029 season and thus a valuable part of the Padres' future. </p><p>For now, though, the focus is on the Padres' present and their designs on the first World Series title in franchise history, and that's why you may indeed see Miller make another crucial appearance on Thursday. If what he did in Game 2 is any guide, he'll miss bats and drop jaws once again.</p>\n            </div>"

But if Los Angeles were to lose at home on Thursday—the Rams are 7-point favorites—that probability crashes to 41.3%.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The UFC bantamweight championship has produced flashes of brilliance but never the enduring grandeur of other divisions. Anderson Silva nor Georges St-Pierre anchor its history. Reigning champion Merab Dvalishvili is on the verge of changing that.</p><p>Dvalishvili defends the UFC bantamweight title against Cory Sandhagen <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-magomed-ankalaev-vs-alex-pereira-2-fight-card-date-odds-rumors-location-complete-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">at UFC 320</a></span>. He enters as a heavy four-to-one favorite against the challenger. He also eyes a rematch against Petr Yan before the year's end, which would mark an astonishing fourth title defense in a calendar year. If Dvalishvili beats Sandhagen and Yan again, as he did in a lopsided decision two years ago, it would cement what many already call the best bantamweight run ever.  </p><p>\"I want to be busy. I'm healthy, and I want to set a record with four UFC title fights in one year,\" Dvalishvili told CBS Sports. \"That would be great on my resume.\"</p><p>Dvalishvili's push for four title fights in 12 months underscores his drive. The native of Georgia opened 2025 with a win over Umar Nurmagomedov where he entered the fight as a betting underdog to the cousin of legendary lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov. He passed that test with flying colors before being booked for a rematch with Sean O'Malley in June, where he scored a brutal submission of the former titleholder.</p>\n<p>Instead of giving himself an extra month or so to heal from Saturday's fight to may be get booked on the upcoming December PPV to close out 2025, Merab wants to fight at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 15 for UFC 322 -- just six weeks later.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-alex-pereira-gets-his-chance-at-redemption-after-rare-humbling-loss-against-magomed-ankalaev/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>UFC 320: Alex Pereira gets his chance at redemption after rare humbling loss against Magomed Ankalaev</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brian Campbell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"UFC 320: Alex Pereira gets his chance at redemption after rare humbling loss against Magomed Ankalaev\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/708592ee-b8e1-443c-ae13-300a57f2abc9/thumbnail/270x152/54e07dd73f63a36081fb6cd613ed5c3c/pereira-yell-ufc-313.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>It sounds reckless, but Dvalishvili isn't one for empty promises.</p><p>Dvalishvili already owns the longest win streak in bantamweight history (12). He's two victories shy of tying Aljamain Sterling's divisional wins record and Dillashaw's five title defenses. Looking at the current contenders, it's believable he'll get there. He's beaten everyone in the UFC's bantamweight top five except Sandhagen.</p><p>Zoom out, and the records keep piling up. He recently passed St-Pierre for most UFC takedowns (97) and is poised to be the first to hit triple digits. His 13-fight winning streak -- including a catchweight bout -- ties him with GSP, Jon Jones, Demetrious Johnson, Khabib Nurmagomedov and Max Holloway. Three more wins would match Silva's 16-fight streak, untouched for 13 years. </p>\n<p>\"Hard work got me here. I don't think I'm special...\" Dvalishvili previously told CBS Sports. \"I still have the same motivation as before. I'm still trying to be a   better version of myself. Yes, I'm a champion. I have this status and   respect. But I'm a regular guy. </p><p>\"I tell people, 'You have to work hard.'   Sometimes hard work beats talent. I think that's who I am. I'm still   trying to improve. I'm still trying to work harder and get better. I  want to keep this belt, make new records and inspire more people.\" </p><p><strong><em>Check out the full interview with Merab Dvalishvili below.</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Still, to say bantamweight never had a great champion would overlook those who laid the groundwork for what Dvalishvili is chasing.</p>\n<p>Dominick Cruz set the standard from the beginning. As reigning WEC champion, he was awarded the inaugural UFC bantamweight title at the promotion's final event before its merger. Cruz beat \"Mighty Mouse\" in his first defense before vacating due to injuries. Four years later, he made a thunderous return, dethroning TJ Dillashaw to become a two-time champ. But a one-sided loss to Cody Garbrandt and recurring health issues stalled his UFC legacy, even if his WEC reign is untouchable.  </p><p>Dillashaw has the next best claim. A two-time champion, he revolutionized the division with elusive movement and finishing instincts. His bitter feud with ex-teammate Garbrandt remains the best rivalry in the division's history. But losses to Cruz and Henry Cejudo, and a career-ending shoulder injury, kept him from closing the case as the bantamweight G.O.A.T.</p><p>Dvalishvili is primed to be the storied champion bantamweight lacks -- one who can enter pound-for-pound, all-time conversations without being immediately laughed out of the room. Some, <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-316-sean-omalley-calls-merab-dvalishvili-the-greatest-bantamweight-of-all-time-after-second-loss/\" target=\"_blank\">including rival Sean O'Malley</a></span>, already call him the best. Fittingly, it's not a label the Georgian-born, American immigrant -- whose self-belief stems from humility and hard work -- is willing to claim. </p>\n<p>\"I will never call myself the best bantamweight,\" Dvalishvili said. \"I am still an active fighter... Maybe when I finish my career, I'll call myself what I was. But right now, I'm active and my goal is to continue step-by-step moving forward.\"</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>LONDON --</span> At their best on Wednesday night, <span>Arsenal</span> played in the sort of fashion that their critics (and a few of their supporters) have been craving. This was the Gunners at their zippiest, the ball flying up the field so that Viktor Gyokeres and <span>Gabriel Martinelli</span> could drive at the Olympiacos backline before it was settled. Better decisions when the chances really presented themselves, and this would have been a more comfortable night for Mikel Arteta's side, who had the odd shaky moment and plenty of clumsy finishes in the 78 minutes between Gabriel Martinelli's opener and <span>Bukayo Saka's</span> nerve-settler at the death.</p><p>It ought to be no surprise that these moments of prime Arsenal arrived on the night that Martin Odegaard returned to the XI, completing a full half of football for the first time since the opening weekend. What was supposed to be the year where the club captain had his \"yeah, I'm thinking I'm back\" season has been one of frustrating false starts. Determined to shake off a season spoiled by an ankle injury, Odegaard has looked much more like his old self when he has made it on the pitch. He just would have wanted more than eight minutes at St. <span>James</span>' Park or a quarter hour against <span>Nottingham Forest</span> to show what he can do.</p><p>Odegaard used that time effectively, his through ball inviting Gyokeres to wreak havoc on the Olympiacos backline, ramming a gap between the center backs, Venom pumping through his system. Kostas Tzolakis did well to parry a poked effort onto the post but Martinelli was on hand to turn in. After plenty more openings had been frittered away -- including by Odegaard, who twice managed to pick out an Olympiacos player with the goal at his mercy late on -- the captain got out his slide rule one last time, Saka's low drive finding the space between the goalkeeper's legs.</p><p>This will feel like a game where Arsenal diced with danger. On another day, it would have been a procession for a team with 16 shots and 2.73 expected goals.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, an unnecessarily tight game was decided, at least in part, by moments of Odegaard's invention. So far, so familiar. What stood out, however, was how frequently the skipper went for these sorts of game-changing passes. The captain sets the tone for his teammates, and for the last two seasons, that has meant applying the slow chokehold to opponents. Arsenal would park themselves in your final third and get Odegaard in his two-man game with Bukayo Saka. Slowly, precisely, they would carve themselves an opening, teasing out the deficiencies in the other team.</p><p>That works pretty well for Saka, but it may not be quite as effective at unlocking Gyokeres, who was a wrecking ball through Portugal and Europe when Sporting got him a quick ball. If quick ball is what Gyokeres wants, then Odegaard would give it to him. When space emerged between the Olympiacos lines, he attacked it, demanding the ball from David Raya and springing it into dangerous areas with his first touch. A drop of the shoulder and a flick of the ball was enough for Gyokeres' legs to catch up with Odegaard's brain, a curling pass taking four Olympiacos defenders out of the game. If only the Swede had squared it to Martinelli, the second would have been secured much earlier. To be fair, Martinelli had gone alone a few moments earlier.</p><p>In pursuit of the killer ball, Odegaard was more prepared to gamble with possession than he often is. Over his Arsenal career, the Norwegian is an 87% passer, a number 10 who cherishes the ball. In the first half, when he was at his most scything in possession, only 77% of his passes found a red shirt. And that was great. It unlocked Gyokeres and Martinelli in a way they might not be if Arsenal tried to grind down a low block.</p>\n<p>\"I think we have to play to our qualities, and when we have a front three with that pace, with those timings in the runs, players can activate him, we have to do that 100 per cent,\" said Arteta. \"He did it in Newcastle a few times in 15 minutes, and that's the game that I want from him.</p><p>\"He has total freedom from my side to do and to explore and to take risks and to feel the movement away. He needs to generate those spaces and I think he's certainly done that in the last two games.\"</p><p>That this is the game Arteta wants from Odegaard seems significant. Like several other top sides, Arsenal seem determined this season to attack with more speed than in years gone by, to bypass the press and (more frequently) to get the ball in dangerous areas before their opponent has time to set their defense. As in the win at <span>Manchester United</span> on the opening day, the cannons were firing with remarkable regularity. </p>\n<p>Arsenal's direct speed, the number of metres they advance the ball towards goal per second, was 1.71. The average for the last two Premier League seasons has been 1.12, significantly below the league average. A bit more basketball-y, perhaps, leaving the defense occasionally vulnerable, but when your defenders are that good and your attackers so threatening in opening space, it is easy to see why it is an approach Arteta wants to explore.</p><p>After all, on the basis of this game, it is one in which Odegaard can thrive. And any approach that encourages him to start pinging it promises to be very successful indeed.</p>\n            </div>"

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>A must-see light heavyweight title rematch tops the marquee on Saturday in a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-magomed-ankalaev-vs-alex-pereira-2-fight-card-date-odds-rumors-location-complete-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">UFC 320 pay-per-view event</a></span> from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.</p><p>Magomed Ankalaev makes the first defense of his 205-pound title in the main event as he welcomes Alex Pereira in an immediate rematch just six months after Ankalaev scored a <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-313-results-highlights-magomed-ankalaev-upsets-alex-pereira-to-claim-light-heavyweight-title/live/\" target=\"_blank\">unanimous decision to take the belt</a>. </p><p>UFC 320's co-main event is a fight fans have wanted for a long time. UFC bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili is on a dominant run after beating Sean O'Malley (twice) and Umar Nurmagomedov. Dvalishvili can extend his record for the longest bantamweight win streak by fending off his next challenger. Cory Sandhagen has long been tabbed as a future champion. After repeatedly falling just short of a breakout, \"The Sandman\" finally gets his shot at undisputed gold.</p><p>As we draw closer to the fights this weekend, let's take a closer look at the biggest storylines. </p>\n<h2>1. A refocused and healthy Alex Pereira is a very, very dangerous man</h2><p>Despite the shock of seeing him stuff all 12 takedown attempts by Ankalaev in their UFC 313 title bout, Pereira's decision loss was a decidedly underwhelming performance. Gone was the constant threat of the knockout from the stalking Brazilian slugger as the more technical Ankalaev kept him on the back foot throughout thanks to steady pressure. After the fight, UFC analyst Joe Rogan publicly shared that Pereira had battled both a broken hand and a bout with norovirus, to which the proud Pereira never confirmed nor made excuses about. Fighting hurt and taking big risks with his matchmaking has become Pereira's calling card, including an insane 175-day stretch in 2024 in which he made three title defenses despite battling a number of physical ailments. But when Pereira told CBS Sports last week that <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/alex-pereira-reveals-he-was-at-just-40-in-title-loss-to-magomed-anakalev-surprised-i-was-able-to-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">he was just 40% of himself in the Ankalaev fight</a></span> and was shocked he even made it to the Octagon given everything he endured during training camp, it might be worth taking his word on it. </p><p>Pereira's trainer, former UFC champion Glover Teixeira, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G77b3GmlMCI\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned on \"UFC Countdown\"</a> that the training camp for UFC 320 was much different than prior bouts, when Pereira often traveled throughout the build to his title fights to make public appearances. This time, they focused exclusively on rebuilding Pereira's gas tank at age 38 and the always stoic \"Poatan\" has appeared uncharacteristically agitated this time whenever Ankalaev is mentioned, including during a run-in the two had at the UFC Performance Institute last week where Pereira accused his opponent of hiding from him out of fear. An injured and ill Pereira might have been neutralized in their first meeting but the fight was still close on the scorecards as Pereira rallied in Round 5 to narrowly lose by a score of 48-47 on two of three judges' scorecards. Expect a hungry Pereira to be much more aggressive in their rematch, which is a scary thought to consider. </p>\n<h2>2. Pereira isn't the only one who can improve upon his performance in March</h2><p>Despite winning the title in a smart performance that saw the 20-1-1 Ankalaev extend his unbeaten streak to 14 fights since he lost his UFC debut in 2018, the native of Dagestan, Russia, wasn't overly exciting or commanding in doing so. It's probably the biggest reason why UFC matchmakers chose to go the way of an immediate rematch. The good news for Ankalaev is that he acknowledged his shortcomings during a sitdown on \"UFC Countdown,\" where the 33-year-old admitted he should've followed through with more offense when he had Pereira visibly hurt and/or backing up. Passivity against elite competition has sometimes been an issue for Ankalaev, who has predicted he will finish Pereira in the rematch. Given the intensity in Pereira's eyes this week, he may have to in order to win. </p>\n<h2>3. Merab Dvalishvili enters the most difficult style challenge of his title reign</h2><p>Ranked in the top five pound-for-pound and riding an insane 13-fight winning streak since losing both of his first two fights in the UFC, the 34-year-old Dvalishvili continues to be a nearly unstoppable force at 135 pounds. A victory on Saturday would make the native of Georgia just the eighth UFC champion in any division to make three title defenses in the same calendar year (and he's already stated his hope of adding a record fourth in December). Yet, even with his recent dominance and incredible displays of relentless cardio, Dvalishvili is expected to have his hands full with the lengthy and awkward Sandhagen. There isn't an MMA skill that the well-rounded Sandhagen doesn't possess and both his constant movement and creative striking attacks have the potential to be problematic for the champion. Sandhagen also has a strong gas tank of his own and has weathered the storm of disappointment in recent years after losing multiple close fights against top contenders that would've lifted him into a title shot. At 33, this could be Sandhagen's final shot at glory and the experience he brings will be key as he looks to slow Dvalishvili down and turn the fight into a chess match.  </p>\n<h2>4. A slugfest is expected as top five light heavyweights look for title return</h2><p>Buckle your seatbelts! Nothing short of fireworks are expected when former 205-pound champion Jiri Prochazka welcomes former title challenger Khalil Rountree Jr. in a battle of exciting sluggers with legit title implications at play. Yes, it's true that the winner might ultimately take a backseat to Carlos Ulberg, the New Zealand contender who <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-fight-night-results-highlights-carlos-ulberg-blasts-dominick-reyes-for-first-round-ko-wants-title-shot/\" target=\"_blank\">improved his win streak to nine last Saturday</a></span> when he knocked former two-time title challenger Dominick Reyes out in Round 1. Ulberg is even more likely to get the call should Pereira regain the title, mostly because he knocked out both Prochazka and Rountree in his last two victories in 2024. But with the combination of a shallow contender pool and rampant parity at light heavyweight, the winner of Prochazka-Rountree will be in the driver's seat for a huge fight, especially considering both have momentum after each scored stoppage wins over former champion Jamahal Hill earlier this year. At 35, Rountree's resurgence into a legit title threat has been fun to watch. But no one brings the fun quite like Prochazka, who, outside of two knockout title losses to Pereira, has finished all five of his UFC wins and hasn't gone the distance in a pro fight since 2016. </p><h2>5. Patchy Mix quietly returns on the early prelims after demoralizing debut</h2><p>It was only three months ago when Mix, a 32-year-old free agent and former Bellator MMA champion brought his 20-1 record into the UFC for a debut fight against Mario Bautista that possibly would've lifted him to an immediate title shot had he won. Unfortunately for Mix, he was brutally battered in a one-sided decision loss that saw his stock take an insane hit. Despite having entered UFC fresh off of consecutive wins over James Gallagher, Kyoji Horiguchi, Magomed Magomedov (twice), Raufeon Stots and Sergio Pettis, Mix suddenly finds himself buried on the early prelims on Saturday against a debuting Jakub Wiklacz, who is fresh off of a run as KSW bantamweight champion. Oddly enough, the same thing recently happened to Mix's significant other, Tatiana Suarez, who went from a brutal strawweight title loss to Zhang Weili in the co-main event of UFC 312 in February to returning far off the radar on the prelims of Noche UFC in September. While it's likely premature to say Mix's job is on the line, he undoubtedly is in need of a huge bounce-back performance more in line with the capabilities he has shown in his pre-UFC run.  </p>\n            </div>"

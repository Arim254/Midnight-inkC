    "body": "\n        Since starting the season 0-2 with last-second losses to major playoff contenders, Notre Dame has settled in as one of the most reliable teams in college football. The Irish sit at No. 9 in the College Football Playoff Rankings with only games against bottom feeders Syracuse and Stanford remaining. But as top contenders fall off the board, an unexpected complication is entering the playoff picture for the Irish… Miami. The Hurricanes were dead in the water after a 2-2 midseason stretch with losses to unranked opponents, which seemed to keep them out of playoff contention. However, after wins by a combined score of 79-17 over the past two weeks, Miami suddenly rose up to No. 13 in the CFP Rankings.And now, Miami's 27-24 victory over Notre Dame in the season opener is suddenly the proverbial elephant in the room in Grapevine, Texas. \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: What 12-team field looks like after third CFP Rankings release\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMiami stunned Notre Dame with a last-second field goal to win the opener, a season-defining moment for Mario Cristobal's program. However, fortunes flipped midseason. Miami lost to unranked Louisville and SMU by a combined nine points. Notre Dame went on a dominant eight-game winning streak, headlined by double-digit wins over No. 15 USC and Pittsburgh. The run penciled Notre Dame into the playoff field with Miami on the outside. But with the gap closing, the separation is getting harder to defend. \nIn the formal CFP protocols, the committee lists head-to-head competition as one of its top criteria, along with strength of schedule, comparative outcomes of common opponents and other relevant factors. The key phrase, though, is that the committee will use this to distinguish \"otherwise comparable teams.\" At this point, for whatever reason, the committee has not found them comparable. \"I think when you look at Notre Dame and Miami, we really compare the losses of those two teams,\" new CFP chair Hunter Yurachek said. \"Miami has lost to two unranked teams and Notre Dame has lost to two teams that are ranked in our top 13. We really haven't compared those two teams. They haven't really been in similar comparative pools to date.\"\nAs someone who has participated in the CFP Mock Selection Committee a few times, let me translate for a moment. The committee votes for spots in threes for spots 1-9, and considers up to six teams at a time. That allows them to best utilize the data and tools that they have available to them. \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff: Lessons learned evaluating teams as a member of the mock selection committee\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSo based on the rankings that members bring to the table, Notre Dame has always been considered with the top 12 teams. Miami is stuck in the 13th spot, notably behind No. 11 BYU and No. 12 Utah. Would that change if the Hurricanes were treated as a team caught between 6 and 12? It's hard to say. Let's go back to the formal CFP protocols. Miami takes the edge in head-to-head. Both programs beat mutual opponent NC State, though the Hurricanes' performance was more impressive. Miami previously destroyed future Notre Dame opponents Syracuse and Stanford, while the Hurricanes have yet to play Pitt, which the Irish beat. As for strength of schedule, the SportsLine rankings have Miami (32) with a slightly better schedule than Notre Dame (34). \nNow of course, the gap between the losses is significant. Notre Dame has some of the best losses in the country. At the same time, a College Football Playoff case built on impressive losses probably won't make anyone feel settled. The analytic systems love how consistent Notre Dame has been, and rightfully so. Since the 0-2 start, they've won every game by multiple scores. They've clearly improved in the defensive secondary, the unit that doomed them to their 0-2 start. If these two teams played today, sure, Notre Dame would probably be favored. I'd even pick them to win. But, that's not really the point. The Fighting Irish are getting a lot of credit for what they've almost done. And that's not really in the spirit of sports. \nFor a second, put Miami to the side. Notre Dame ranks ahead of Alabama because of loss quality, even though the Tide have four wins against top 25 teams (including No. 4 Georgia on the road). They're ahead of 9-1 BYU, even though the Cougars' only loss is against No. 5 Texas Tech on the road, and they have a better win than the Irish. Notre Dame has recovered from 0-2 to put together a playoff-worthy season. But even if the Irish earn their way into the field -- as Miami stays home with the same record -- the double standard is hard to ignore. Miami's outlook from CBS Sports bowls expert Brad Crawford:Two outcomes in Week 12 hindered Miami -- Navy's win over South Florida and Oklahoma's win at Alabama. Already ahead of Miami in the at-large discussion last week, Oklahoma leaped into the top 10 with the victory, while USF's title hopes in the American as the perceived Group of Six favorite took a major hit.\nIt weakened the impact of Miami's 49-12 win over the Bulls back on Sept. 13, as well. That was shaping up to be a quality victory that would've been earned had USF won out, took the American title and earned the No. 12 seed in the final bracket.So, what are Miami's biggest needs going forward?In an ideal situation for the Hurricanes, any of theses scenarios -- accompanied by winning out against Virginia Tech and Pitt -- would unfold to guarantee a spot in the bracket.Win the ACC Championship Game: To get that opportunity, Miami needs six dominoes to fall in conference play over the final two weeks of the regular season -- Virginia beats Virginia Tech, Pittsburgh beats Georgia Tech, Duke beats North Carolina, SMU beats Louisville, Cal beats SMU and Wake Forest beats Duke. That would put Virginia (7-1 in ACC) and Miami (6-2) in Charlotte with the Hurricanes holding four-way tiebreakers advantages over Georgia Tech, Pittsburgh and SMU.Notre Dame loses to Syracuse or Stanford: A 9-3 finish for the Fighting Irish will eliminate them from the playoff conversation as it currently stands given the number of at-large teams that will have a better record (Miami included).Texas Tech winning the Big 12 along with BYU losing before the league title game or getting blown out by the Red Raiders in the final.USC loses to Oregon this weekend: If the Trojans upset the Ducks and create a logjam of possible 10-2 teams in the Big Ten, that's troubling for the Hurricanes in the at-large discussion.Alabama loses at Auburn or Oklahoma suffers a loss against Missouri or LSU: The SEC is going to be a five-bid league unless the Crimson Tide or Sooners lose once more.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After rising three spots in last week's College Football Playoff Rankings, Miami has surged again with a two-spot move to No. 13 on Tuesday night, pushing closer to the \"last team in\" designation as an at-large selection. The playoff picture within the ACC is messy with two weeks left in the regular season, and for the Hurricanes to be in the hunt for an auto-bid, they're going to have to win out -- and get help -- the rest of the way.The Hurricanes (7-2) are the selection committee's favorite in the ACC for the second straight week, but probabilities suggest it'll be Georgia Tech and Virginia playing in Charlotte for a conference title -- not Miami -- the first weekend of December. Under playoff protocol, five highest-ranked conference champions receive auto-bids in the 12-team bracket, so Miami is vying for one of seven at-large spots. Still four spots behind Notre Dame this week, the Hurricanes could use some assistance from teams ahead of them, including Oklahoma and Alabama, with preferred losses over their final games.Miami's College Football Playoff pathCollege Football Playoff ranking: No. 13Playoff seed: No. 11 (committee's projected ACC champion)Best wins: No. 9 Notre DameLosses: Louisville, SMURemaining pathat Virginia Tech (Nov. 22)at No. 22 Pitt (Nov. 29)No playoff berth starts without convincing wins over the Hokies and Panthers over the next two weeks.

Oklahoma beating Alabama and USF losing to Navy did not help last week, but Texas falling at Georgia appears beneficial.\n\n    \n                                        \n    InsideTheU is your source for intel and analysis on the Miami Hurricanes.

    "body": "\n        Three-time Pro Bowl receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was officially reinstated by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Tuesday and is free to sign with any team, per NFL Media. Beckham just finished serving a six-game suspension for violating the NFL's policies on performance-enhancing drugs. A while his suspension did not prohibit him from signing with a team, he is now allowed to take the field at any time. Beckham, who turned 33 earlier this month, last played for the Miami Dolphins in 2024. In nine games, he caught just nine passes for 55 yards. While he is no longer the dynamic perimeter threat that can stretch the field and carry an offense, Beckham could still contribute for a contender and was adamant in August about his desire to continue playing. Beckham took the league by storm as a rookie with the New York Giants in 2014, catching 91 passes for 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns. He crossed 1,300 yards receiving in each of his first three seasons, and caught double-digit touchdowns as well. After 59 games played for the Giants, he was traded to the Cleveland Browns. In 29 games with Cleveland, Beckham caught 114 passes for 1,586 yards and seven touchdowns before being released in 2021. Beckham then signed with the Los Angeles Rams in the middle of the season and helped the team win Super Bowl LVI. Beckham caught 21 of 26 targets for 288 yards and two touchdowns for the Rams during that playoff run, including a touchdown in the Super Bowl before tearing his ACL. Beckham sat out the 2022 season, and then spent 2023 with Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. \nAs the playoff race heats up in the NFL, which teams could show interest in Beckham? Let's take a look at five potential landing spots, in no particular order.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThe reigning AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs are still all-in for a Super Bowl despite their 5-5 start. Kansas City has a tough matchup this week with the Indianapolis Colts coming off their bye. With a loss, the Chiefs' chances to make the playoffs would drop to 36.3%, according to SportsLine. Patrick Mahomes' arsenal includes Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy, JuJu Smith-Schuster, Marquise Brown and Tyquan Thornton, but could Andy Reid be interested in adding a veteran wideout to help for this playoff push?\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Denver BroncosSpeaking of the AFC West, the Denver Broncos could use some help at receiver. Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant had great games against the Chiefs this past Sunday, combining for 166 yards, but Denver's inconsistencies on offense this season are well documented. Beckham isn't an addition that automatically makes the Broncos a top 10 passing offense, but he could be a reliable target for Bo Nix. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers' front office has likely been keeping tabs on the receiver market all season, as DK Metcalf is the only wideout on the team that has surpassed 250 yards receiving this year. With Baltimore, one of OBJ's former teams, closing in on Pittsburgh in the division, the Steelers could look to add some help offensively. It would certainly be interesting to see Beckham play for his third different AFC North team.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersBrandon Aiyuk has yet to return after tearing his ACL last year, plus Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings have missed time this season due to injuries. Still, the 7-4 San Francisco 49ers have their eyes set on competing for a Super Bowl. The 49ers reside in the toughest division in the NFL, so why not take a flier on a player that helped your rival win a Super Bowl a few years ago?\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles RamsThis is my favorite potential landing spot. Beckham helped Matthew Stafford and Co. win Super Bowl LVI with his contributions late in the regular season and in the playoffs that year, and he could do the same in 2025. The Rams' passing game is headlined by the talented duo of Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, but with Tutu Atwell on injured reserve and Xavier Smith currently in the concussion protocol, the door could be open for OBJ to return for another Super Bowl run. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        TAMPA, Fla. – To borrow a line from Bill Hader's fictional Saturday Night Live character Stefon, the U.S. men's national team's year has had everything – routine wins, uninspiring defeats, fresh faces and a new tactical vision. Even if USMNT onlookers have been trained to expect the unexpected, their final match of 2025 threw something completely new at the masses – a 5-1 obliteration of Uruguay, delivered by a completely rotated side full of cuspy players eager to make their case for a World Cup roster spot.The match started in routine fashion and then the goals felt like they came all at once. Sebastian Berhalter put the USMNT up by the 17th minute with an impressive strike but by the time Alex Freeman completed a brace in the 31st minute, habits had set in. The U.S. were essentially scoring whenever they felt like it, Uruguay's defense crumbling time and time again. Freeman's second goal is perhaps the trademark example – the Orlando City defender torched Barcelona center back Ronald Araujo, perfectly encapsulating the vibe of the night.\nDiego Luna had a goal of his own before the half and even on a tough evening for Uruguay, delivered a moment of brilliance with Giorgian de Arrascaeta's bicycle kick. A calmer start to the second half did not mean the eventful portion of the evening was complete – Rodrigo Bentancur's second yellow card in the 65th minute and Tanner Tessman's strike four minutes later kept the party going, another banger on a night full of them. Raymond James Stadium was far from full but for all those in attendance, it was time well spent. That was especially true for an unfamiliar version of the USMNT, who notched the first statement win since head coach Mauricio Pochettino took over as the head coach little more than a year ago.\nPochettino said on Monday that he would rotate through his team, in part to account for the quick turnaround from Saturday's 2-1 win over Paraguay, but rare are the occasions where the head coach wholeheartedly embraces a spirit of experimentation quite like he did on Tuesday. He made nine changes to his starting lineup, the group almost exclusively made up of players who needed to make their World Cup cases. Those players wasted little time doing so – Freeman has been on the inside track for a World Cup roster spot for months now but bolstered his argument, as did Luna.\nIt was a declarative night for Berhalter, who had a goal and an assist by the 20th minute. The Vancouver Whitecaps player thrust himself into a crowded midfield conversation in the process, pestering Uruguay to the point that Bentancur was sent off for going for his ankle. He deputized in midfield alongside Aidan Morris, the pair holding down the fort while veterans like Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie missed out on this month's camp for varied reasons.Those two, though, merely scratch the surface on how well Pochettino's insistence on experimentation has gone, nor is it the first time. Results have been inconsistent in the year-plus since Pochettino took charge but the one constant has been an unwavering commitment to ripping it all up and starting from scratch. The team may have looked aimless at times along the way, forcing questions about whether or not Pochettino has cast his net far too wide and sacrificed chemistry during a truncated run-up to the World Cup. Next summer's tournament may still be seven months away but Pochettino may be in as good a position as any to take a victory lap – his team is unquestionably unfamiliar to the one that lost 1-0 to Uruguay in the final game of Gregg Bheralter's time in charge of the team, better for just about all the changes that he has made.Now on a three game winning streak, the USMNT keep finding different ways to collect victories. Saturday's gritty performance against Paraguay gave way for a remarkable success on set pieces on Tuesday. Pochettino's side scored four of their five goals on set pieces, several players' special skillsets coming to the forefront. Berhalter was a bright spot on those dead ball opportunities during the Concacaf Gold Cup and was impactful again against Uruguay, while left back John Tolkin called back upon his New York Red Bulls heritage and whipped in the corner that led to Freeman's first goal.\nThe performance, both collectively and individually, provides Pochettino with a good set of problems with just one international break left to go until his World Cup roster is set. It may have created an unpredictable race to the finish in the process – which is exactly what Pochettino has hoped for all along.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The third edition of the College Football Playoff Rankings was released Tuesday night with undefeated Ohio State remaining No. 1 ahead of Indiana and the top 10 experiencing some key alterations. Just three weeks remain until the final College Football Playoff bracket is selected, and there is no telling what upsets may be in store for the top teams in the nation with two weeks left in the regular season.A pair of top-tier SEC matchups created a new No. 4 team in the nation. Alabama vacated that spot amid a 23-21 home loss to Oklahoma with Georgia sliding into first-round bye position after dominating Texas, 35-10. The Sooners now sit No. 8, two spots ahead of the Crimson Tide.No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 5 Texas Tech round out the top five.The reigning national champion Buckeyes are seeking their seventh playoff appearance in 12 years of the postseason bracket's existence (2014, 2016, 2019-20, 2022, 2024). Ohio State's final game against a ranked opponent comes in its regular-season finale against Michigan.Eight of the 11 teams ranked No. 1 in a season's initial CFP Rankings ultimately reached the playoff, an effort now made easier with the expanded 12-team field, which is being contested for a second season.\n\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Miami's rise complicates Notre Dame's picture-perfect CFP case\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCurrently projected to meet OSU in the Big Ten Championship Game is Indiana after both teams won by double digits on Saturday. IU enjoys a late off week before playing Big Ten basement dweller Purdue in Week 14.Miami (FL), despite being ranked No. 13, takes the 11th projected bid as the highest-rated team from the ACC. However, with the Hurricanes unlikely to play in the ACC Championship Game -- projected as Georgia Tech vs. Virginia -- they will almost assuredly need to earn a spot as an at-large team.Tulane claims the last of the 12 playoff spots as the highest-ranked Group of Five team in Tuesday's release at No. 24. With the 12-team playoff model granting automatic bids to the five highest-ranked conference champions, the Green Wave are presently projected to win the American and grab the final spot in the field. Should a Group of Five team not make the final rankings, the CFP Selection Committee would choose which champion deserved the last bid.\n    College Football Playoff Rankings, Nov. 18* First-round bye | ~ First-round host | ^ Highest-ranked Group of Five teamOhio State (10-0) *Indiana (11-0) *Texas A&M (10-0) *Georgia (9-1) *Texas Tech (10-1) ~Ole Miss (10-1) ~Oregon (9-1) ~Oklahoma (8-2) ~Notre Dame (8-2)Alabama (8-2)BYU (9-1)Utah (8-2)Miami (FL) (8-2) | No. 11 seedVanderbilt (8-2)USC (8-2)Georgia Tech (9-1)Texas (7-3)Michigan (8-2)Virginia (9-2)Tennessee (7-3)Illinois (7-3)Missouri (7-3)Houston (8-2)Tulane (8-2) ^ | No. 12 seedArizona State (7-3)Miami's curious caseWhile losses to Louisville and SMU squandered Miami's chance to control its own destiny in the eyes of the committee, the good news for the Hurricanes is there's a greater chance now of reaching the bracket compared to two weeks ago. Playoff hopes dwindled after their overtime loss in Dallas to open November, and the committee's response was a No. 18 grade in their first top 25 as the ACC's fourth team behind Virginia, Louisville and Georgia Tech. All of those teams have lost at least once since, pushing the Hurricanes back out front of others in the ACC at No. 13 in Tuesday's third edition of the rankings.Let's address the leprechaun in the room as it relates to Miami. After moving up three spots last week to No. 15, the Hurricanes pushed ahead again after their blowout win over NC State. Notre Dame handled the Wolfpack, too, but that matchup was 10-7 at halftime in South Bend. Miami held a 24-point advantage at intermission a week after NC State had given Georgia Tech its first ACC loss of the season. So, there's the common opponent perspective when comparing the two teams who each appear to be heading toward 10-2 finishes. If the Hurricanes blow out Virginia Tech and Pittsburgh -- who might not be ranked any longer depending on Saturday's result against the Yellow Jackets -- they'll still be behind the Fighting Irish in the strength of record, game control and strength of schedule metrics. Those are significant factors for the committee. The Hurricanes need help from an at-large standpoint unless one of two convoluted scenarios involving various other ACC outcomes results in a league championship game opportunity. The more realistic scenario is one of the three at-large, two-loss teams ahead of the Hurricanes lose another regular-season game -- looking at you, Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Alabama. \nDanger zone for AlabamaFrom being slotted -- at worst -- on the No. 4 line with a loss in the SEC Championship Game prior to last week's defeat to Oklahoma, the 10th-ranked Crimson Tide are another turnover-filled setback at Auburn away from being outside of the playoff. That wouldn't sit well with the natives in Tuscaloosa, not after this team won eight straight games following the season-opening loss at Florida State with four of those victories coming against ranked teams in SEC play. There's no need to panic for Alabama, by the way. As long as mistakes are corrected, the Crimson Tide should handle their rival in the Iron Bowl. The alternative is another cataclysmic November slide that would keep Kalen DeBoer away from the national championship picture for the second straight season, which could make 2026 a contract year of sorts given the elite expectation level at Alabama.Oregon's Big Ten predicamentTake out the Sharpie and show unbeaten Ohio State and Indiana some love. They're in. The Big Ten's third playoff entry hasn't yet materialized, however. No. 7 Oregon's in prime position with one loss and wraps up a first-round guarantee with a victory over 15th-ranked USC this weekend. If the Trojans clip the Ducks at Autzen Stadium, the chaos begins. That could set up a situation that includes three 10-2 teams inside the conference at the end of the month behind the Buckeyes and Hoosiers if Michigan takes out Ohio State on Nov. 29. If the committee did vote a fourth Big Ten squad into the bracket, Oregon would be on the outside looking in. \nThe only metric in which the Ducks currently have a sizable advantage over the Trojans and Wolverines is game control. Their best win is Iowa, while USC has that same victory and would hold head-to-head edges over Oregon and Michigan and beat Nebraska away from home. Michigan's resume would sparkle with the Ohio State shocker, and one of its losses came to potential SEC invitee Oklahoma. How would the committee justify putting Oregon in over the Trojans and Wolverines if all end with the same record? They couldn't. Beating USC this weekend should bring Dan Lanning reassurance, regardless of what happens in the finale at Washington.Four teams battling for two first-round spotsAs long as Ohio State and Indiana get to Indianapolis without a loss, there's five teams battling for the other two coveted opening-round byes -- the SEC champion along with the SEC's runner-up, Texas Tech or Georgia competing for the other two coveted opening-round byes. I don't foresee 11th-ranked BYU jumping enough spots to get there -- even by winning out and taking the rematch with the Red Raiders in the Big 12. The most likely scenario is third-ranked Texas A&M winning the SEC at 13-0 over Alabama with an 11-win Georgia team pushing to the 4 seed during final deliberations. You're not supposed to be docked by what happens in a conference championship, but a three-loss Crimson Tide would have to slide behind the Bulldogs. In that scenario, Georgia's final-month wins would include Florida, Mississippi State, Texas, Charlotte and Georgia Tech, while Alabama would hold wins over LSU, Eastern Illinois and Auburn. That's not recency bias. It's one team entering the playoff red hot and the other leaking oil.Another scenario is Alabama beating Texas A&M in the conference title game and earning the No. 2 or No. 3 seed, depending on the committee's preference alongside the Big Ten's runner-up. That would leave the No. 4 spot open for the Aggies, Big 12 champion Texas Tech or 11-win Georgia. Best-case for the currently fifth-ranked Red Raiders getting a first-round bye would be all of these games going chalk the rest of the season along with a convincing win over BYU in the Big 12 final. A 12th victory and conference title should be enough to push them ahead of the Bulldogs for that final position.\n            ",

Only 19 wide receivers are projected to score more than 13 Fantasy points. It's even worse in three wide receiver leagues as only 31 receivers are projected to score double digits in full PPR this week. A big part of the reason is that 15 of the top 36 wide receivers based on preseason ADP are either hurt, suspended, or on bye this week. It also doesn't help that the Commanders are on bye, they have given up the second-most points to the position.One reason to bring this up is to put your mind at ease when you are setting your lineups this week. The vast majority of managers in 12 teams leagues are going to be starting someone at wide receiver that they would rather not start. The second reason to bring it up is to set you free. If there is no one available with a good projection, feel free to aim high and go for the upside. Guys like Xavier Worthy, who hasn't done anything start worthy in a month, should be started in three receiver leagues. Even someone like Luther Burden, who has shown us the ability to make a Fantasy day with one play, or Ricky Pearsall, who gave us a goose egg in Week 11.At the bottom of the wide receiver rankings projection just doesn't matter as much when it's this bad. Be willing to leave eight points on your bench for the chance to score 20.Here is the rest of the Week 12 WR Preview:\n\n        Week 12 WR Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            74.5% -- Ricky Pearsall played nearly three-quarters of the snaps in his first game back. He was open more than once as well.31% -- Wan'Dale Robinson led the Giants with a 31% target share in Week 11. I am going tight back to him in Week 12, no matter who starts at quarterback.37.5 -- The Raiders are giving up 37.5 PPR Fantasy points per game to receivers, the second most in the league. Maybe it's Jerry Jeudy week?40.7% -- A.J. Brown led the league with a 40.7% target share in Week 11. It seems the Eagles are at least attempting to appease him.38.8 -- Since he became a full time player in Week 6, Tez Johnson is averaging 38.8 receiving yards per game. He is a touchdown or bust flex.33 -- Luther Burden has played 33 offensive snaps, a season high, in each of the Bears last two games. The breakout could be right around the corner.185 -- Michael Wilson's 185 receiving yards was the most by a player in the NFL this week. He's a start if Marvin Harrison misses another week.20% -- Jakobi Meyers and Parker Washington both have a 20% target share since Meyers joined the Jaguars. They could both be WR3s this week unless Brian Thomas Jr. comes back.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n

week in that the best waiver wire add is dependent on someone missing time. Marvin Harrison Jr. hasn't been ruled out for Week 12, but as of Tuesday we are not projecting him to play. That means are projecting Wilson as a top 20 wide receiver this week. As bad as wide receiver is in Week 12, Wilson may be a top 40 guy even if Harrison is back.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        GB\n                    \n                         \n                        Green Bay\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        MIN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -6.5\n                                    O/U 41\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                4th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                28th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                65%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    234\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    11.9\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Watson's 20 point outburst in Week 11 could be a sign of things to come.

    "body": "\n        Survivor Series: WarGames has a blockbuster main event. The WarGames stipulation returns for the fourth consecutive year with CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Brock Lesnar and Logan Paul in the mix.Since 2022, WWE has replaced the traditional four vs. four or five vs. five Survivor Series matches with WarGames, a legendary stipulation invented by \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes. This year, world heavyweight champion Punk teams with Rhodes, Reigns and others to take on The Vision and their loose allies. Survivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion will grant Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker & Bronson Reed), Logan Paul, Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, TBA and TBA vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kari Sane) and TBA: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the latest DraftKings promo code, new users can take advantage of $200 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass, and Tuesday night MACtion and a six-game NBA slate provide multiple ways to capitalize on this promotion. The San Antonio Spurs will take the court without the phenom Victor Wembanyama, who is expected to miss multiple weeks with a calf injury, and he's been integral to San Antonio's winning start to the season. The Spurs are favored by 5.5 in the latest Tuesday NBA odds at DraftKings against the Grizzlies, but without Wemby on the floor, the SportsLine Projection Model views this as too many points to lay. Instead, the model is including the Grizzlies to cover as 5.5-point underdogs as one of its Tuesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The Grizzlies are 8-2 in their last 10 meetings against San Antonio, and Memphis' over/under for total points scored on Tuesday is 114.5.The model also sees value in MACtion, backing UMass to cover as massive 33.5-point underdogs against Ohio in a 7 p.m. ET college football matchup as one of its Tuesday best bets. Also, one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick on Akron vs. Bowling Green. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight seasons. The model enters Week 5 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 28-13 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Tuesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookBowling Green (-162) to defeat AkronUMass (+33.5) vs. Ohio (-112) Grizzlies (+5.5) vs. Spurs (-105)Combining the model's three picks into a Tuesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +497 (risk $100 to win $497). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nBowling Green (-162) to defeat Akron\"Akron is not the pushover it used to be, but it's the home finale for the Falcons -- basically their bowl game as they won't make one,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"I'll be playing a lot of teams simply because of that reason here in the next couple of weeks. The reason this is kinda low, I'm guessing, is that BGSU is the only FBS program to start four different QBs this season (due to injuries, etc.). I don't care. It's Akron. On the road.\" Back Bowling Green at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:UMass (+33.5) vs. Ohio (-112)You could make the argument that UMass is the worst team in the FBS, but 33.5 points is a huge number to give against a fellow MAC opponent. This is the most points the Minutemen have been underdogs by since playing Missouri, of the SEC, and UMass covered that 44.5-point spread in a 42-6 loss. Ohio is the defending MAC champions and has a 4-2 record in the conference this season, but the Bobcats aren't anywhere near the level of an SEC program such as Missouri. The model views 33.5 points as simply too many points in a conference matchup, despite UMass being 0-10 this season. Ohio hasn't won a game by more than 27 points this season, and it is 0-3 against the spread when favored by 11 points or greater this year. The model projects the Minutemen to cover the spread in 56% of simulations for this matchup airing on CBS Sports Network. Back UMass at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Grizzlies (+5.5) vs. Spurs (-105)Both teams are without their superstar, with Victor Wembanyama out for the Spurs and Ja Morant out for the Grizzlies as both players deal with calf injuries. Wemby was off to an MVP-caliber start, averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 3.6 blocks per game, so although both players' absences significantly affect their teams' outlooks, the Spurs playing without their superstar could be the harder of the two to overcome. The Grizzlies will rely more on their size with players like Jaren Jackson Jr., Cedric Coward and Zach Edey, and without Wemby in the paint, that could be a significant Memphis advantage on Tuesday. The Spurs are 3-6-2 ATS as the favorite this year, and the model projects the Grizzlies to cover the spread in 61% of simulations. Back the Grizzlies at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Tuesday college football and NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        For the many who have laid the foundation for the rise of women's soccer, validation comes thick and fast these days. The NWSL and its clubs are not only willing, but able, to share key performance indicators that quantify the growth that was destined to come with adequate investment. The days of worrying about the league's general ability to survive are a thing of the past. There's a degree of normalcy that comes with that stability, but as concerns about durability subside, they pave the way for a new round of existential questions every league faces about supporting the flywheel of growth and maintaining relevance.The NWSL's batch of existential questions, naturally, make up an eclectic mix, especially in a year marked by instability. The foundation of the league may be set but in a year of transition, the road has been unusually bumpy, the prospect of losing the league's top star, which Berman has already addressed, essentially light fodder compared to the other events of 2025. The NWSL has had to contend with two on-field medical emergencies, a heat delay that reportedly inspired tension over a lost broadcast slot, discriminatory attacks on players – one time by another player – plus an investigation into a head coach for fostering a toxic workplace.Commissioner Jessica Berman has been busy, not only keeping up with a year's worth of unexpected events but also forcing her to explain herself time and time again. Perhaps a sign that she has made it as the commissioner of a major U.S. sports league, she has received the ire of fans, who have brought signs to matches asking for her removal and even booed her during a trophy presentation. The outrage may be something she survives -- she has reportedly already received a three-year contract extension, her current deal up this season -- but 2025 has forced Berman to apologize and defend herself more than once.\"I have said that it wasn't good enough and other than taking accountability for it and assuring people that we understand where we could have been better and that we're committed to being better, there's not much more I could say to make sure that they have confidence in in how we're going to show up,\" Berman said in an exclusive sit down with CBS Sports.\nThe trials and tribulations of 2025 leave the NWSL in a curious predicament and at an inflection point. Are these merely growing pains for a young league, or was this year a signal that the NWSL needs some recalibration to capitalize on the undeniable momentum of women's sports?'A league that is growing as quickly as we are'Berman and the league's decision-makers have admittedly not gotten every call right in a testing year but they have shown signs of progress, even if it was belated. Between the medical events experienced by Angel City's Savy King in May and Racing Louisville's Savannah DeMelo in September, the league has improved its procedures and finally implemented a process to suspend matches. The commissioner has also preached for a \"collective kindness\" for the league's players, a comment inspired by transphobic remarks directed towards some players, while admitting the process is ongoing to establish policy on the topic. Statements like these may have been hard to predict before the season started but the NWSL has had to learn to roll with punches.\"I think you have to expect the unexpected,\" Berman said. \"Certainly, in my role and for the league, it's our responsibility to be ready to meet those moments and to navigate through them. We won't always get every single thing right but hopefully we get the most important things right and in those situations, thankfully – I'm thinking about the medical ones in particular – the things that had to go right went right and so I'm very thankful for that and that's not an accident. Those are the systems and the medical protocols and the medical staff that our teams have hired that were able to show up in the way that they needed to be and in the face of crisis.\n\"With every season that we grow and become bigger and have more attention on us and more pressure, it requires that we also continue to invest in the foundation that supports the ecosystem. Some of that is governance. Some of that is reform and health and safety. Some of that is operations, policies and protocols and we're continuing to hire and make sure that we have the appropriate expertise and resources to confidently be able to navigate the things that we can't anticipate.\"Berman also said the improvement process is ongoing, some of it baked into the natural upgrades a young league would make during a period of rapid growth.\"We, of course, have analyzed a minute-by-minute of every situation that was challenging this year,\" she said, \"and made changes to communication protocol and how those decisions get surfaced and made in real time when there isn't a second to to regroup and and that's the best we could do for for a league that is growing as quickly as we are.\"\nSome of the unexpected events of 2025, though, feel somewhat unresolved. Take, for example, Albertin Montoya, the now ex-Bay FC head coach who was cleared of wrongdoing after a player alleged \"emotional distress,\" or a sexual assault case involving an employee of the San Diego Wave in which an NWSL investigation reportedly revealed that the club \"could have done more.\" The Montoya investigation may inspire issues around encouraging players to report their accounts through the NWSL's processes, while the Wave investigation may leave the alleged victims feeling unresolved and underserved.\"Without specifically commenting on those particular situations, I think I've said this before,\" Berman said. \"We're always looking at our policies to make sure that both drafted and being implemented in the best way possible and specifically consistent with the intent and we do that both internally and we do that with our Players Association in some instances and we'll always continue to do that. I think as an evolving organization, it's our responsibility to always have a mentality of in the aftermath of any situation, to have a practice of reviewing where we can improve and that is our culture at the league office. We come at the growth of this league with both confidence and humility, knowing that we have a strong responsibility to make sure that professional women's soccer is positioned to thrive in this country for the long term and that's going to require a lot of iteration and evolution and self-reflection about how we can show up in the best possible way.\"NWSL's mix-and-match business approachEven outside of the heightened attention of Women's World Cup and Olympics years, the NWSL's growth has trended upwards in a handful of categories – viewership on linear television, for example, is up 20% year over year and digital viewership increased 30% during that time frame. There's a sense of traditionalism to the NWSL's business approach, especially in broadcast – the $240 million deal it agreed with CBS Sports, ESPN, Amazon Prime Video and Ion is a mix and match of exposure of linear television and streaming, a varied package that mirrors most U.S. sports leagues.\nThe league seems to be casting as wide a net as possible in its pursuit of attracting new fans. While streaming broadcast slots are obviously flexible, the NWSL's linear television slots are almost always during the afternoon hours. Berman attributed that to the availability from the networks as well as individual clubs' attempts to bring fans to stadiums.\"There's a bunch of factors that go into making our schedule,\" Berman said. \"One of them is broadcast availability and the windows, but it's also our clubs and when they want to play their games and we try to have a strategic mix shift of game times and days for our teams. You can imagine that for young families, [the clubs] in some markets really prefer and enjoy having day games and in other markets, maybe less so but most often, those are the games that are more family-friendly. Those are the games that a lot of young kids come to and those are important community relationships for us to invest in and build and cultivate and then at night, you'll probably get a slightly different crowd and we are in this hyper-growth stage where we really want to give as many people an opportunity to discover and sample the NWSL, both on TV and in person, and that means we have to be nimble and flexible and provide a lot of optionality in terms of when and where and how they can attend and watch.\"The traditional approach extends to the expansion strategy in some ways. The NWSL granted Atlanta an expansion team last week, continuing a habit of slowly building a presence in the U.S.' top 10 media markets. Existing in those metropolitan areas specifically is a top priority for Berman, even if the situations are somewhat unideal -- 2026 entrant Boston Legacy will not move into their new stadium in time for their inaugural season, resigned to play their opening matches at the suburban Gillette Stadium. The Atlanta team, meanwhile, will also play at an NFL venue with artificial turf in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which may have a cavernous vibe with the capacity reduced to approximately 28,000 when the team kicks off in 2028.\n\"It's definitely one of the considerations, and I would say it is a primary consideration, but it's not the only consideration,\" Berman said. \"We are keenly aware of the fact that we're going to be in media negotiations as this four year cycle concludes and the base of our geographic footprint being driven by where our teams are located is going to be a key factor in that, so being able to land Atlanta right now in 2025, knowing they're going to be playing in 2028 when our new media cycle becomes effective, is strategic. It's very important, but it isn't the only factor, and thankfully with Atlanta and Arthur Blank, there's lots of boxes that they check and we're really excited that we were able to get that done when we got it done.\"The foundation may be imperfect, but it is not unimpressive, though it may all hinge on the NWSL's primary value proposition -- its players. No matter the league's popularity, it has always been right to claim that it is the home of the best athletes in its sport, but Trinity Rodman's potential departure as a free agent magnifies the new realities of the women's game. Rodman will be a free agent at the end of the season, and the Washington Spirit may reportedly be hamstrung by the NWSL's salary cap in their attempts to retain her, prompting arguments that the league is resting on its laurels rather than meeting the moment.\n        \n            \n                NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman addresses Trinity Rodman's contract talks and defends salary cap structure\n                \n                    Pardeep Cattry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe NWSL's teams are more deep-pocketed than they used to be, which seems opportune as transfer fees grow exponentially, American and European clubs smashing the record on the regular. Berman, who has been at the helm as the league inked its greatest-ever broadcast deal and has watched expansion fees and team valuations skyrocket, was surprisingly conservative in her view of the salary cap.\n\"We want to make sure that this league is thriving and is the best league in the world, not just in 2026 but in five, 10, 50, 100 years,\" she said. \"There needs to be a long-term lens on how you think about those things and if you look back in history over the last few years, we've quadrupled our salary cap so we're investing. Our owners are investing hundreds of millions of dollars and we want to do that in a way that's smart and supported by revenue growth and is done strategically.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 FIFA men's World Cup is approaching next year, and qualifying is well underway with more than half of the spots now accounted for. There are now 48 teams after FIFA decided to expand from the old 32-team format that had been in place since the 1998 World Cup. The 2026 edition will take place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, kicking off on June 11, 2026, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, and will end on July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New York City.With the tournament's expansion, the European confederation (UEFA) is guaranteed 16 slots of the 48 teams, while the African confederation (CAF) has nine, and the Asian confederation (AFC) has eight. There will also be a minimum of six each from South America (CONMEBOL) and the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf). On top of this, for the first time in history, the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) has one guaranteed slot, while the remaining two spots will be decided through intercontinental playoffs.Three teams have already secured qualification to the first men's World Cup in their history. Uzbekistan, Jordan, and Cabo Verde will all be at the World Cup for the first time, and more first-timers could join them as the dust settles. With a population of 524,877, Cabo Verde became the second-smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup, behind only Iceland, which had a population of 350,000 when they qualified for the 2018 World Cup.Let's take a look at who has already booked their tickets to the World Cup:Already qualified for the 2026 World CupWorld Cup hostsSince the 2026 World Cup is co-hosted by three nations, they all receive an automatic qualifying spot in the tournament. United StatesMexicoCanadaAFC QualifiersIranUzbekistanSouth KoreaJordanAustraliaJapanQatarSaudi ArabiaConcacaf QualifiersHaitiCuracaoPanamaOFC Qualifier\nNew ZealandCONMEBOL QualifiersArgentinaBrazilEcuadorParaguayUruguayCAF QualifiersMoroccoEgyptTunisiaGhanaCabo VerdeAlgeriaSouth AfricaSenegalIvory CoastUEFA qualifiersEnglandFranceCroatiaPortugal Norway Germany Netherlands SwitzerlandScotlandSpainAustriaBelgium Chaos in UEFATeams such as England, Portugal, France and Croatia booked their place in the World Cup, as the winners of each qualifying group will head directly to the tournament.

Those 12 second-placed teams will be joined by the four best UEFA Nations League group winners.That second round will see 16 teams drawn into four paths with two rounds of single-match playoffs that will lead to a final with the four overall path winners heading to the World Cup. Due to that process, no UEFA teams will take part in the inter-confederation playoffs. These also won't conclude until March of 2026.Who makes the inter-confederation playoffs?The final World Cup participants won't be determined until March of 2026, following the draw for the World Cup groups. A playoff will take place in North America in March, including one team each from the following regions: AFC, CAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, alongside two from Concacaf to determine the final two places in the World Cup. The bottom four teams in the FIFA World Rankings will be drawn into two single-elimination matches, where the winner will advance to face the top two teams in the rankings, with the winners of those two matches qualifying for the World Cup. Currently in the inter-confederation playoffs\nCAF: DR CongoOFC: New CaledoniaCONMEBOL: BoliviaWhen is the World Cup draw?Paths to the World Cup final will be revealed on Dec. 5 in a ceremony taking place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C..

    "body": "\n        LeBron James, who will make his season debut Tuesday night vs. the Jazz, has spent the better part of two decades playing Atlas for franchises that would collapse without him to keep them aloft. He's also spent a good chunk of that time making it clear he was ready for that to change. Heck, that was what motivated him to ditch the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in the first place. As far back as 2017, he talked about handing the Cavaliers over to Kyrie Irving. That was eight All-NBA selections ago. The Lakers made a point of supporting him with ball-handling from the moment he arrived in Los Angeles and, when that wasn't enough, he pushed for the disastrous Russell Westbrook trade. The moves kept failing. James kept playing Superman.In fairness, it's all he's ever really done in the NBA, save perhaps the brief moments of overlap with a healthy, peak Dwyane Wade in Miami and the best of Irving in Cleveland. James has talked a big game about sharing the workload, but when the games actually start, 20 years of habits kick in and he tends to control everything. And hey, he's LeBron James. Who's gonna stop him? Even after the Lakers acquired Luka Dončić last February, there was a push and pull between the two. Dončić led the team in shots and usage, but at lower clips than he'd posted since his rookie season. James deferred for most of the game, but cranked his usage and shot attempts back up above Luka's by a meaningful margin in fourth quarters in both the regular season and their first-round loss to Minnesota. Dončić joined James' team on the fly in the middle of a season. The torch never fully passed.If there is a silver lining to James' absence thus far this season, it's that it has allowed the Lakers to find themselves without that question hanging over their heads. Dončić is settled and playing like an MVP, but just about everyone else is thriving as well. Austin Reaves is trending towards his first All-Star appearance. Rui Hachimura is having a career year and Deandre Ayton is having the bounce-back season the Lakers needed. For so long, James played on teams that needed him to do everything. Now, he's on a team that, at least thus far, really hasn't needed much of anything. He's getting what he's wanted for so long. He's also entering a situation he's never really played in before.His injury may prove helpful in that respect. He'll be reintegrated somewhat slowly. He said himself after his first practice with the Lakers this season that his lungs feel like a newborn baby's and that he'll need to get his wind back with real minutes over time. A couple of games with somewhat limited minutes will go a long way towards figuring out where exactly he fits onto this new team. It certainly helps that the Lakers have reached the cupcake portion of their schedule. Between now and the stretch in mid-December in which their games are currently unscheduled due to the NBA Cup, they'll play the Jazz twice, the Clippers, the Mavericks, the Pelicans, the Suns, the Raptors and the Celtics. They'll be favored in all of those games as long as they're reasonably healthy. They can afford to get a bit experimental.James will never be a role player. He's too good for that, team needs aside. But there's a balance here the Lakers should strive for. They don't need him to average 25 points per game. Something like 18-20 will more than suffice, with the hope that most of them come within the flow of the offense so as not to disturb the rhythm Dončić and Reaves especially have developed.\nGetting there should be relatively simple. More and more of James' points have come in transition in recent years, not because he's getting out and running more often, but because he's been more aggressive about finding his own, easier shots there while setting up teammates in the half-court, where creating his own looks is more taxing. He's become a far more eager catch-and-shoot gunner over the past few years as well. In Cleveland, he peaked at 1.6 catch-and-shoot 3s per game. With the Lakers, he's gotten as high as 3.5, a figure the current team would love for him to match or exceed, as they're taking the fewest catch-and-shoot 3s in the NBA by a wide margin so far this season. James, to his credit, recognized this as a key area coming into the season.\"I spent a lot of time on my catch-and-shoot 3-pointers,\" James said at media day in October. \" ... Understanding how can I make the most of when I don't have the ball, either moving into space. Obviously, Luka and AR [Austin Reaves] going to do a lot of time handling the ball. …We have a lot of guys that can handle the ball, so how can I still be effective on a team where I don't have to handle the ball as much?\"\nThat quote notably came before the extent of his injury was known. Dončić didn't have to assert his place as team alpha on the court. James was seemingly prepared to willingly cede it and his return to action will be our first glimpse into what his newfound role as a supporting player really means for him. It's probably going to be bumpy. There will be hiccups as the Lakers figure out how to reintegrate one of the most ball-dominant players of all time. But he's also among history's most versatile stars. By skill set, he's equipped to do whatever the Lakers need. Mindset and circumstance were always going to be the barometers here. His return will be our first glimpse into how he's going to handle this. It's something he's said he's wanted for quite some time and now the Lakers need him to embrace it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dallas Mavericks All-Star guard Kyrie Irving has been sidelined to start the season as he rehabs from the torn ACL he suffered in March. The Mavericks haven't given a definitive timeline on his return, though January has been floated before as a possibility. Irving has been seen during recent Dallas practices helping rookie Cooper Flagg work on his game, and he's reportedly \"ahead of schedule\" in his recovery, according to ESPN's Marc Spears.Irving is rehabbing with the intention of returning some time this season, according to Spears, who said someone close to Irving told him the veteran guard could return right now if it were the playoffs. Spears listed late January or the All-Star break in mid-February as potential return windows for Irving, whose presence would provide a boost for with a 4-11 record through the first month of the season. Irving would especially make things easier for a Mavericks roster that is severely lacking in backcourt depth. But given where this team is right now, would Irving's return actually be detrimental to Dallas' big picture outlook for the rest of the season?Why the Mavericks should prioritize the 2026 NBA DraftThis isn't about taking minutes away from anyone. Let's be honest, the fewer minutes the Mavericks get from someone like D'Angelo Russell at this point, the better. The Mavericks aren't struggling to find enough minutes for everyone on this roster, instead they're starting Brandon Williams -- who,  as impressive as he's been, was just on a two-way contract a season ago. To this point, Williams has been the most reliable point guard on the team, and when Irving returns, Williams should become his backup.\nThe Mavericks need Irving out there, if for no other reason than to have someone who can organize the offense, not turn the ball over and draw attention from the defense to make life easier for the likes of Anthony Davis and Flagg. Beyond that, pairing Flagg with an elite guard will only make him better and ease some of the pressure that's persisted for the No. 1 pick in the first month of the season.\n        \n            \n                Tearing down the Mavericks: Finding a trade for every player who can legally move (except Cooper Flagg)\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut Irving's return also means the Mavericks could contend for a play-in spot at the very least, something they really shouldn't be doing. Now that Nico Harrison has been given the boot just nine months after trading Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, there's no need to play out this foolish plan to compete for a playoff spot -- especially when the 2026 draft class is expected to have some of the best prospects in recent memory. It's a draft class that should make several teams want to bottom out with the hopes of improving their chances at landing a top pick. And the Mavericks should be one of those teams that has a one-way ticket on the tank express. But Irving's return may result in winning too many games to give them a legitimate shot at landing a top three pick. Given that the Mavericks don't control any of their own first-round picks between 2027 and 2030, prioritizing the 2026 draft should be the goal.\nIt's time for Mavericks to build around Cooper FlaggIt will be a difficult line for the Mavericks to tow when Irving returns. Assuming Davis also returns in the near future from a calf strain, Dallas will have a healthy roster that is capable of being far more competitive than it has been to open the season. That would have been good news a month ago when Harrison was still in charge, but he's not, and Dallas doesn't have to force this fake championship window Harrison deluded himself into. Now it's about building around Flagg for the long-term future, and the first step in doing so is ensuring they're able to land as high of a draft pick as possible in 2026.There's already been talk of the Mavericks exploring the trade market for Davis, but they should also be doing the same for Irving after he returns. If he returns in mid-to-late January, and is operating at the levels he was prior to the ACL tear, it'll build up enough of a trade market to generate some interest from rival front offices before the Feb. 6 trade deadline. \nThe Mavericks have to untangle the mess Harrison got them in, which means recouping assets that they've lost. The only way to do that is through trades. Between now and the trade deadline, the only player who should be off limits is Flagg. And if it means getting closer to a top draft pick next summer, the Mavericks have to consider trading Irving.\n            ",

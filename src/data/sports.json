    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl brings the most betting opportunities of any sporting event each year, and Super Bowl 60 between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots is no different. One of the popular Super Bowl props is the MVP award, which is handed out after the game. Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is the +120 favorite (risk $100 to win $120) in the Super Bowl 60 odds at DraftKings, while Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is +240. Darnold and the Seahawks are favored by 4.5 points on Sunday, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. While quarterbacks are the most likely winners, three of the last 10 winners have come from non-quarterback positions. Jaxon Smith-Njigba (+500) and Kenneth Walker III (+850) are next on the NFL odds board.  There are plenty of longshot betting opportunities for other players in Patriots vs. Seahawks. CBS Sports gambling and Fantasy sports managing editor R.J. White went 718-623-37 on NFL against-the-spread picks from 2017-24, returning more than $3,200 to $100 players as SportsLine's No. 1 NFL expert in ATS picks. He's also gone 22-15-1 (+545) in his last 38 over/under picks, and now he's sharing his Super Bowl 60 MVP picks.Here are the latest odds for Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings:\nSuper Bowl MVP picksBest bet: Seahawks QB Sam Darnold (+120)Best longshot value: Patriots WR Mack Hollins (+18000)Defensive longshot: Seahawks LB DeMarcus Lawrence (+9000)Sam Darnold, Seahawks (+120)\"When it comes to taking a player to win Super Bowl MVP, the safest play is to back a quarterback,\" White said. \"Fourteen of the last 19 Super Bowl MVPs have been quarterbacks, with the position winning the award 34 times overall versus eight times for receivers, seven times for running backs and 10 times for any defensive player. With the Seahawks being huge favorites on the money line, taking Darnold to win Super Bowl MVP presents the best value on the board by getting plus odds for them winning and the award going to the most likely candidate.\"Mack Hollins, Patriots (+18000)\"The Patriots have been criticized for playing an easy schedule this year, but when the tougher opponents have shown up, Hollins has tended to be more involved in the offense,\" White said. \"After a quiet first seven weeks, he caught all seven of his targets for 89 yards in Week 8 against a Browns defense that held Stefon Diggs to 14 yards. He delivered a season-best 106 yards on 10 targets in Week 10 in a close game against the Buccaneers, again outperforming Diggs by a wide margin. He had just 41 yards in Week 15 against the Bills but saw a team-high eight targets in the game while Diggs had four, and then the next week Hollins racked up 69 yards on nine targets in a comeback win over the Ravens, with Diggs leading the team in all receiving categories in that one. Hollins went to IR after that game and returned for the AFC Championship, where he recorded catches of 31 and 20 yards in a game where Maye threw for just 86 yards total.\"Hollins definitely doesn't deserve to be among the favorites for the award, but he should be much closer to Stefon Diggs (+5500) considering how much Maye leans on the secondary receiver in big games. And when compared to the other players ahead of Hollins in odds, including guys like Jake Bobo and George Holani who may not make any impact on the box score for Seattle as well as both backup QBs and a number of defensive players, Hollins stands out as the best value pick on the board.\"DeMarcus Lawrence, Seahawks (+9000)\"There hasn't been a defensive player to win Super Bowl MVP since Von Miller 10 years ago, but it happens more than you think and doesn't necessarily have to be the best defender on the team, with Malcolm Smith and Dexter Jackson taking home the award this century as well,\" White said. \"While that brings super longshots like Jaylinn Hawkins (+25000) and Drake Thomas (+25000) into play, my favorite defensive pick is Lawrence. He'll be up against a Patriots offensive line that has struggled to protect Maye during the playoffs, and the quarterback has had a massive issue hanging onto the ball.\"Lawrence has a sack and forced fumble in three of his last four games, and he's recorded at least one QB hit in 13 of the last 14 games. With the veteran playing in his first Super Bowl after more than a decade with the Cowboys, he could continue his recent fine form, and if he can score a touchdown after recovering a fumble, which he did twice against the Cardinals earlier this year, he could be in contention for this award in a lower-scoring game. I'd put Lawrence at least as the co-favorite among Seahawks defenders, but he's slotted behind Ernest Jones and Nick Emmanwori, so he's my favorite value among the defenders.\"Want more Super Bowl 60 picks?Head to SportsLine for more Super Bowl picks, both from proven experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times and enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

    "body": "\n        All eyes will be on Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game. It's an unlikely matchup after the Patriots came into the season off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and hadn't been to the NFL playoffs since the 2021 season. Seattle hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2022 season, but made huge strides in the second season under head coach Mike Macdonald and quarterback Sam Darnold, a free-agent acquisition.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Seattle as the 4.5-point favorite, with the over/under at 45.5 points. The Seahawks are -238 money line favorites (risk $238 to win $100), while the Patriots are +195 underdogs. SportsLine's NFL experts teamed up to give exact score projections for the Big Game, and while they're unanimously backing the Seahawks to win, their score predictions lead to some different spread and total picks. \nThe team of NFL betting experts includes R.J. White, who is SportsLine's all-time No. 1 NFL spread expert and Larry Hartstein, who enters the game on a 43-33 run on NFL ATS picks (+596). Other NFL betting experts featured include Alex 'PropStarz' Selesnick, who is on a 62-44 (+916) roll on NFL player props and Jeff Hochman, who is 83-66-3 (plus +1217) over the past four NFL seasons.Now, SportsLine's NFL experts have analyzed the NFL odds and locked in their final score predictions for Seahawks vs. Patriots. Patriots vs. Seahawks score predictionsR.J. White Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 19, Patriots 16\"The last four Big Games have seen both teams get to 20 points, but I think there's a chance touchdowns will be hard to come by in this game. The Seahawks defense is elite, allowing just two touchdowns in the six games since Week 12 where they haven't faced the Rams. The Patriots defense has risen to that level in the postseason thanks to getting key players back in the front seven as well as playcaller Zak Kuhr putting on a masterclass each week. There's no denying the talent on these offenses, but I see two defensive units that will be tough to crack in the red zone and a lot of kicking points in this game.\" New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and target the Patriots +4.5: \nLarry Hartstein Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\"It's been four months since a team not named the Rams excelled offensively versus Seattle's No. 1 defense. Unless Drake Maye runs wild, I have a hard time seeing the Patriots getting to 20 points. New England's defense is stout too, with a front that shuts down the run and Christian Gonzalez patrolling the back end. But Seattle has better weapons, led by the unstoppable Jaxon-Smith Njigba. He, Rashid Shaheed and Cooper Kupp will make enough plays to complete the Sam Darnold redemption story.\" You can bet Seahawks (-4.5) at DraftKings:\nJeff HochmanBig Game score prediction: Seahawks 27, Patriots 20\"Seattle's edge in Net Yards Per Play (+1.4 vs. +1.0) is even more impressive considering they played the fourth-toughest schedule, while New England had the league's easiest. Since 2000, just four teams have captured the title with a negative sack differential, while teams with a +20 or higher sack differential -- such as Seattle -- have won six times. The Patriots' sack differential of -13 is the lowest ever for a championship team in this span. After monitoring both teams all season, Seattle appears superior in every phase: offense, defense and special teams.\" You can go Over on the total (45.5) at DraftKings:\nAlex 'PropStarz' Selesnick Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 19\"This looks like a game where both offenses could find it difficult to score touchdowns. New Englands defense has been dominant through the playoffs and features the type of scheme and personnel that could potentially give Sam Darnold fits coupled with limiting Seattle's run game. I also expect Mike McDonald's defense to make life really difficult on Drake Maye who has not been same player that was a bonafide MVP candidate through the entirety of the regular season. I think this is ultimately a low scoring game decided by 4 points or less. The Seahawks have been very fortunate in high leverage situations and I do expect some major regression in the turnover department, however that may not come to fruition until next season. Seattle feels like a team of destiny.\" You can pick Under (45.5) the total at DraftKings:\nHow to get more Patriots vs. Seahawks picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Patriots 10,000 times and revealed its picks. See who wins and covers the spread here, all from the model that's on a 53-37 roll on top-rated NFL picks. \n            ",

Seattle lost its opener to San Francisco and fell to 3-2 after a Week 5 loss to Tampa Bay, but ripped off wins in 13 of the next 14 games to earn its way into the Big Game. Meanwhile, New England lost two of its first three but has won 16 of its last 17.Sam Darnold and Drake Maye both looked like NFL MVP candidates at points throughout the season, though they'll likely fall short to Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford. Darnold has rejuvenated his career by throwing 60 touchdown passes in the last two seasons and Maye became the youngest player in NFL history to lead the league in completion percentage (72.0%). Darnold is the +120 favorite to win the Big Game MVP, while Maye is +240. Both teams were top five in the NFL in scoring offense and scoring defense, and the SportsLine Projection Model is predicting thin margins against the spread and with the over/under. It's slightly leaning towards Seattle to cover against the spread based on the percentages and also projects that the Under hits in 59% of its 10,000 simulations of the Big Game, higher than the implied odds of 52.2%.Exact score prediction: Seattle Seahawks 24, New England Patriots 20 (best odds +15000 at BetMGM):Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 NFL season concludes on Sunday with the Seattle Seahawks meeting the New England Patriots for the Lombardi Trophy. Sports fans looking to wager on Seahawks vs. Patriots can do so with the latest BetMGM bonus code CBSSPORTS, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if their first bet wins or up to $1,500 in bonus bets if their qualifying wager loses. The offer you are eligible for depends on the state you reside in. Sign up for BetMGM here:For a full list of terms and conditions of both offers, visit the BetMGM bonus code review page.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Here's a look at some of its best picks for Seahawks vs. Patriots on Sunday, with odds from BetMGM.Seahawks vs. Patriots best bets at BetMGM SportsbookUnder 45.5Jaxon Smith-Njigba Over 91.5 receiving yardsRhamondre Stevenson Under 47.5 rushing yardsCombining these three picks in a same-game parlay at BetMGM would result in +500 odds (wager $100 to win $500). Bet it at BetMGM here (odds subject to change).\nSeahawks-Patriots Under 45.5The SportsLine Projection Model has the Under hitting in 59% of simulations, good for a \"B\" grade play. These were the two of the best scoring defenses in the regular season, with Seattle allowing 17.2 points per game and New England ceding 18.8 points per game. Both offenses have struggled at times in these NFL playoffs despite success during the regular season but the defenses have stepped up in a big way. In the final game of the season, teams often try to avoid a major mistake and keep the game close. That lends towards a more conservative gameplan from both sides and the Under.Jaxon Smith-Njigba Over 91.5 receiving yardsSmith-Njigba was the NFL's top receiver during the regular season, going Over this particular line in 13 regular season games. He was bottled up in the Divisional Round but part of that was the blowout nature of the game which led to the Seahawks running the ball more and eventually pulling their starters. The star shined in the NFC Championship Game against the Rams with 153 yards and a score, and he should have a prominent role on Sunday. Even if the Patriots show him double coverages and bracket, Smith-Njigba should find ways to get open and become Sam Darnold's favorite target once again. The SportsLine model projects him to hit 109.8 yards.Rhamondre Stevenson Under 47.5 rushing yardsStevenson was hot to close the regular season and did damage in every playoff game to take pressure off Drake Maye. Carries are unlikely to be an issue but Seattle's defense is a different problem. The Seahawks pride themselves on stopping the run, allowing just 91.9 rushing yards per game during the regular season. Even though Stevenson has been solid in the playoffs, his efficiency is a cause for concern. The Seahawks likely want to shut him down and put more of the onus in this game on Maye, who has been hot and cold in the playoffs.\nWant more NFL picks for Seahawks vs. Patriots?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Seahawks vs. Patriots.

However, the Patriots also deserve a lot of credit for seizing the opportunity. They improved by 10 wins during the regular season, and the defense has been downright dominant all postseason, allowing 629 yards of total offense in three games. The model predicts that New England wins 39% of the time, making this a value play that boosts your payout considerably. Back the Patriots at FanDuel here:AJ Barner, Seahawks, Over 24.5 receiving yards (-110)\"The majority of props in the Super Bowl are low yardage. One that I expect to cash is AJ Barner of the Seattle Seahawks,\" Cimini said. \"He is coming off a minimized role in the playoffs with just two catches for thirteen yards. Not expecting a huge game, but for enough looks his way to cash a small prop. An area where Barner was effective as he cleared this in five of the final six regular season games.\" Back Barner at FanDuel here:Mack Hollins, Patriots, Over 24.5 receiving yards \"I do feel that Mack Hollins' yards line is undervalued here. He comes into this game having cleared this line in 9 of his last 11 games. No injury designation, so I expect him back to his 70-75% snap share on pass plays,\" Prop Bet Guy Doug said. \"Over the last eight games, the Patriots' pass catchers were fully healthy, Hollins is first on the team with 380 yards, second in targets (40, Stefon Diggs has 41), and first in yards per route run amongst the starters, (2.03). It's not the best matchup, but he should see more of Josh Jobe than Devon Witherspoon on the outside. I have him conservatively at five targets, with upside given the Patriots tough run matchup and gamescript.

    "body": "\nThe final game of the NFL season takes place on Sunday with the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks squaring off in Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, Calif. The Seahawks are looking to get some long-awaited revenge for the infamous goal-line interception back in Super Bowl 49 against New England, while the Patriots are trying to complete one of the greatest one-year turnarounds in league history after winning just four games last season. All eyes will be on the quarterbacks, as the Patriots' Drake Maye has been phenomenal as an MVP finalist in just his second NFL campaign, while Seattle's Sam Darnold has gone from draft bust to journeyman to on the cusp of being a Super Bowl-winning starting quarterback. Darnold is listed as the +120 favorite (risk $100 to win $120) to be named Super Bowl MVP. The defenses will also be a key aspect of this matchup, with Seattle ranking first in the NFL in points allowed, while New England was close behind at fourth. The Patriots' defense has been dominant this postseason, allowing just 26 points across three wins over Los Angeles, Houston and Denver. The Seahawks' defense dominated San Francisco in the Divisional Round, allowing just six points, before the team leaned on Darnold, star receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and the offense to get past Los Angeles in a thrilling NFC title game. Kickoff from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara is set for 6:30 p.m. ET. The Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites, according to the latest Patriots vs. Seahawks odds at DraftKings, and the total, or Over/Under, is 45.5 points. Before you make any Super Bowl picks and bets of your own, you need to see what the SportsLine Projection Model has to say. The model simulates every NFL game 10,000 times before sharing its top game picks and player props for every game, including the Super Bowl.\nWhere to watch Patriots vs. Seahawks on SundayWhen: Sunday, Feb. 8Time: 6:30 p.m. ETTV: NBCStream: FuboFollow along: CBS Sports AppPatriots vs. Seahawks betting previewOdds: Seahawks -4.5, over/under 45.5These teams combined to go 33-6 this season, and they also combined to go 28-11 against the spread, with Seattle 14-5 ATS and New England 14-6. The Seahawks have covered each of their last four games, including the playoffs, while the Patriots have covered five of their last six, with the lone exception being a 10-7 win over Denver in the AFC title game. Both teams have leaned to the Over despite fielding elite defenses, with the Seahawks 10-9 to the Over and the Patriots 12-8. Three of Seattle's last five games have finished Under, with the two Overs both coming against Los Angeles.

    "body": "\n        The worst-case scenario for Olympian Lindsey Vonn came just seconds into the women's downhill final in Cortina, Italy, on Sunday afternoon.Vonn's body struck a gate as she made her first big jump less than 13 seconds into her run, altering her momentum and direction, prompting a scary crash as she flung sideways and bombed out.The race was on hold for more than 20 minutes as Vonn was tended to on the course. The scene at Tofane Alpine Skiing Centre was eerily quiet, as thousands at the bottom of the mountain, including Vonn's family, were left stunned and largely speechless. The worldwide feed initially caught audio of Vonn's brutal cries from pain after her horrifying spill. Downhill skiing is the fastest and most dangerous alpine event; the Olympia delle Tofane course routinely saw Sunday's racers eclipse 75 miles per hour as they hurled themselves down one the world-renowned venue.Vonn was put on a stretcher and had to be airlifted by helicopter to a nearby hospital. In a Sunday afternoon update, Vonn has a broken left leg, according to the Associated Press. Vonn received treatment from a \"multidisciplinary team\" and \"underwent an orthopedic operation to stabilize a fracture reported in her left leg,\" the Ca' Foncello hospital said in a statement to the AP.\n\"Lindsey Vonn sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians,\" a statement from U.S. Ski and Snowboard said Sunday morning.A photo captured by the Associated Press shows the split second where Vonn's critical mistake led to her crash.\nVonn, 41, was attempting to make history as the oldest woman to ever medal in the event that she took gold in back at the 2010 Vancouver Games. \nNORLANDER: Vonn knew the risks. It's why she's an all-time greatVonn's run was the most anticipated event of these Games not just because of her worldwide fame and a longstanding place among the all-time greats in her sport, but also due to the torn left ACL she suffered nine days ago in Switzerland while competing in her final pre-Olympics race. Vonn successfully made it down the same mountain and ski trail on Friday and Saturday in the lead-up to Sunday's final. Karin Kildow, Vonn's sister, was interviewed on Peacock less than an hour after the crash.\"That definitely was the last thing we wanted to see,\" Kildow said. \"She always goes 110%, there's never anything less, so I know she put her whole heart into it and sometimes things happen. It's a very dangerous sport.\"\nAnother skiier, Cande Moreno of Andorra, also crashed during the race and had to be airlifted off the mountain.Vonn is one of the greatest competitive skiers in history, with an astounding 84 World Cup wins in her career. That's third all time to fellow American Mikaela Shiffrin (who skis a different discipline) and Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark. On Sunday, Shiffrin — who will compete in two days — posted a condolence message to Vonn.\nVonn was the 13th skier of the day and was chasing 30-year-old American Breezy Johnson, who posted the top time after racing sixth. Johnson's 136.10 run held by race's end. The Jackson Hole, Wyoming, native wound up producing the first gold medal for the United States of the Milan Cortina Games. She's also only the second American woman to win gold in the history of the event, joining Vonn's 2010 conquest.\nGermany's Emma Aicher, 22, won silver, becoming the youngest woman to medal in the women's downhill since 1994. At 136.14, she was a mere .04 seconds behind Johnson's winning run. Italy's Sofia Goggia (1:36.69) took home the bronze, marking her third straight Olympics with a medal in this event; she won gold in 2018's Pyeongchang Games and earned silver four years ago in Beijing. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The PGA Tour's annual Super Bowl weekend stop at TPC Scottsdale has entered the final round. The 2026 WM Phoenix Open is once again serving as the Tour's biggest party of the season, one featuring hundreds of thousands of fans creating a vibe as unique as any on the circuit. While the event may not be everyone's cup of tea, those teeing it up this week are well aware of what they're walking into, and those who embrace the frenzied atmosphere can become beloved figures in the desert. Headlining this week's field is Scottie Scheffler, who on Thursday struck his first over-par round since June 2025. However, Scheffler has bounced back remarkably, surging up the Phoenix Open leaderboard despite still sitting five shots back of 54-hole leader Hideki Matsuyama entering the final 18 holes. Scheffler has continued to assert his dominance over the last few seasons, and now at TPC Scottsdale, where he picked up his first career win in 2022 and backed it up with another in 2023, he might put together a huge comeback as the clear favorite entering the tournament. Matsuyama is similarly looking for his third win at TPC Scottsdale, and sitting in pole position to do it, he has an opportunity to win for the sixth time when in front after three rounds.Beyond the World No. 1 and 54-hole leader, the WM Phoenix Open features a number of the game's other top stars and former winners. Brooks Koepka is playing his second event of the season in his return to the PGA Tour at a tournament he's also won twice. Hideki Matsuyama is another two-time WM Phoenix Open champ in the field. Meanwhile, Xander Schauffele, Cameron Young, Collin Morikawa, Jordan Spieth, Chris Gotterup, Viktor Hovland and more will all be looking to capture their first WM Phoenix Open victory. Here is how you can watch Scheffler, Matsuyama, Koepka and the rest of the PGA Tour's best vie for the title in the desert. 2026 WM Phoenix Open TV scheduleAll times Eastern\nRound 4 - SundayRound 4 starts: 11 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 11 a.m. - 6 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 12-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 12-3 p.m. on NBC Sports AppLive TV coverage: 3-6 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-6 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App\nRadio: 1-6 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Manchester City's flurry of late goals ensured they would keep pace in the Premier League title race with a 2-1 win at Liverpool on Sunday, a match in which an entertaining second half came to a close with chaos and two big calls from the refereeing team led by Craig Pawson.Pep Guardiola's side turned a 1-0 deficit around with two late goals, first an 84th minute effort from Bernardo Silva that he hit from close range. City doubled their lead in the third minute of stoppage time when Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson fouled Matheus Nunes in the penalty area, allowing Erling Haaland to convert the spotkick to ensure they would stay within touching distance of Arsenal in the race to win the title.As both sides charged at either goal to close out the match, though, chaos eventually ensued. Alexis Mac Allister had perhaps Liverpool's best chance at an equalizer in the 100th minute, forcing an impressive save out of City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to ensure the visitors would maintain their advantage. The ball was played straight back into traffic, though, so Alisson charged forward to help his teammates score. The visitors quickly gained ahold of the ball and from his own half, City substitute Rayan Cherki took a shot and hoped that the slow pace of the ball would still be faster than any Liverpool player who was chasing it.\nHaaland and Dominik Szoboszlai, who scored Liverpool's opener in the 74th minute, chased after the ball, the City player edging out his opponent early on in the sprint. Szoboszlai tugged on Haaland's jersey to slow him down, successfully doing so but only until Haaland caught up and pulled his jersey moments later, neither of them able to catch up as the ball rolled into the back of the net.\nReferee Pawson awarded the goal and City broke into celebrations, the game killed off with moments to spare. Pawson, though, was then prompted by the video assistant referee team to head to the on-field monitor to check if Szoboszlai deserved a red card for the initial tug on Haaland's jersey.In the 113th minute, Szoboszlai was issued a red card for denial of a goalscoring opportunity. The fact that he committed the foul before the ball rolled into the back of the net, though, meant that Cherki's strike was ruled off, Pawson following the letter of the law. It did not impact the end result, though it did cause a delay in proceedings and ensured the game would stretch beyond the seven minutes of stoppage time that were initially awarded by the fourth official.\nCity, having swept Liverpool in the league for the first time since 1936-37, close out the weekend six points behind league leaders Arsenal, the result potentially causing a momentum swing for Guardiola's side after a middling start to the new year. Liverpool, meanwhile, finish the weekend in sixth place and are on the outside looking in at the UEFA Champions League berths. They are five points behind fourth-place Manchester United and four behind fifth place Chelsea, with the Premier League set to earn a bonus Champions League spot for next season's competition because of their strong showing in UEFA's confident race.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Big 12 levied a $50,000 fine against Oklahoma State after it conducted an investigation into \"inappropriate chants\" that allegedly occurred during Oklahoma State's 99-92 win against No. 16 BYU Wednesday night. Broadcast audio caught Oklahoma State fans chanting either \"f--- the Mormons\" or \"Ref's a Mormon\" after a foul was assessed against the Cowboys late in the second half. Oklahoma State will not appeal the fine.Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark issued a statement after the game and said both schools had been notified of the investigation and that the conference has \"no tolerance\" for the purported behavior.\"In accordance with the Big 12 Conference Principles and Standards of Sportsmanship, the Conference has issued Oklahoma State University a $50,000 fine following its investigation into inappropriate chants which referenced the Mormon religion that occurred during Wednesday's men's basketball game,\" the conference said Sunday in a statement. \"The Big 12 Conference will not tolerate any behavior that targets or demeans others.\"Oklahoma State announced that it conducted its own immediate investigation into the allegations and that it will accept the Big 12's ruling.\n\"It was determined that a derogatory chant followed a disputed call and referenced the Mormon faith in relation to game officials,\" Oklahoma State said Sunday in a statement. \"The reference to religion did not meet our standards and expectations. Oklahoma State respects the Big 12's decision and will not appeal the fine.\"The Cowboy Code calls us to treat others with respect and dignity. Oklahoma State University values the relationship we have with BYU and deeply respects its community and faith. We will continue to ensure that the atmosphere at our events reflects the values of the Cowboy family.\"The Big 12 fined Colorado $50,000 and publicly reprimanded it in September after its student section reportedly chanted \"f--- BYU\" and \"f--- the Mormons\" during a football game between Colorado and BYU. BYU, founded and supported by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has previously been the target of similar religiously charged chants at other schools.\nBYU coach Kevin Young asserted that Oklahoma State's student section chanted \"f--- the Mormons.\" \"It's a great win for Oklahoma State University. Their fans should be proud,\" Young said. \"But it would be great if some class was in there as well. I got four small kids at home, you know. I'm a Mormon. When I go home, they're going to ask me about it, same way they asked me about it last year at Arizona. There's just too much hate in the world to be saying stuff like that. We've got enough problems in our world without going after peoples' religion and beliefs.\" Oklahoma State fans stormed the court following the Cowboys' upset win against the Cougars, which may also be subject to a fine.\n            ",

The Cowboys will reportedly place the franchise tag on Pickens, but that doesn't guarantee he will be in Dallas next year.The Cowboys view tagging and trading Pickens away as a possibility, according to NFL Media. Dallas acquired Pickens and a 2027 sixth-round pick from the Pittsburgh Steelers last year for a 2026 third-round pick and 2027 fifth-round pick. The Cowboys could fetch an upgraded return if Pickens were to be dealt.Questions remain about the Cowboys' ability to give Pickens a lucrative, multi-year deal. Dallas already has the highest-paid quarterback, the highest-paid offensive guard and the No. 3 highest-paid wide receiver on roster. Spotrac predicts Pickens could sign a deal that averages beyond $30 million per year. Pickens has said that he's searching for the \"ultimate best deal\" that benefits both parties, but the 24-year-old pass-catcher put up career numbers across the board in a contract year with 93 receptions, 1,429 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. That earned Pickens Second Team All-Pro honors, and his first Pro Bowl appearance.\nPublicly, the Cowboys are posturing as if Pickens will be in Dallas for years to come.\"I'm talking to George all the time by virtue of my excitement for him,\" Jerry Jones said recently when asked if contract talks had begun. \"He's better than, as far as what he contributed to our team, showing the potential that he could contribute. I'm looking forward to getting things worked out so George can be a Cowboy a long time.\"\nThe problem is Jones has said things like this before about one of his elite players searching for a new contract. This is Déjà vu in a way for Cowboys fans, as Dallas traded a talent it was unable to pay just last year in Micah Parsons for two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark. The Cowboys would love to keep Pickens in the fold long-term, but also understand that a tag-and-trade is in play. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are the main attraction when Super Bowl LX kicks off tonight, but the roster of singers on Super Bowl Sunday are all stars in their own right. In addition to the announcement months ago that Bad Bunny was named the featured halftime performer, Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones will perform before the big game.The pregame entertainment will come ahead of the 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff on NBC and Peacock at Levi's Stadium, and the halftime show will take place roughly one and a half to two hours later.\"Charlie, Brandi, and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them -- alongside our extraordinary deaf performers -- on Super Bowl LX's world stage,\" said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation. \"This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance, and our country, perfectly kicking off game day.\" The Bad Bunny announcement followed months of rumors and predictions and came in a subtle way at the end of September. Headlining the Super Bowl halftime show is one of the top singing gigs of the year, and this was how the 31-year-old singer made the announcement on social media.\nThe Puerto Rican singer is the most-streamed artist in the world. Bad Bunny has 16 Grammy nominations, with six wins. His first three Grammy wins came for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album for YHLQMDLG, Best Música Urbana Album for El Último Tour Del Mundo and Un Verano Sin Ti. He also took home one of the biggest awards - Album of the Year - at last week's Grammys for DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS. It was the first Spanish-language album to win the award.Some of his other awards include the American Music Award for Favorite Latin Artist, the BET Award for Single of the Year for his hit song \"I Like It\" with Cardi B and J Balvin, and Billboard Top Latin honors.Bad Bunny's top songs include \"Vete,\" \"Tití Me Preguntó,\" \"Qué Pasaría\" and \"BAILE INoLVIDABLE.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 60 Halftime Show set list predictions: Bad Bunny will perform DtMF, bring up Cardi B and J Balvin\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nUsually the special guests are announced closer to the championship game. One early guess for a special guest is Cardi B, who is also connected to the NFL because she recently gave birth to a boy with Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs.Rapper Kendrick Lamar, who brought out multiple special guests including SZA and Serena Williams, was last year's headliner. Some other iconic halftime performers include Prince, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Paul McCartney, U2 and Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few. The halftime show has become a cultural moment for the masses, as it is typically the most-watched performance of the year.Here's a look at who will perform each pregame song tonight: 'The Star-Spangled Banner'Charlie Puth and renowned deaf music artist Fred Beam will perform the national anthem ahead of the big game. Puth is a multi-award-winning and multi-platinum singer, songwriter and producer. His hits include \"See You Again,\" \"Attention\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore.\" Beam is an actor, dancer, poet, educator, choreographer, director and visual artist.\n'America the Beautiful'Brandi Carlile and deaf music performer Julian Ortiz will perform \"America the Beautiful.\" Carlile has an impressive résumé that includes an Oscar nomination, two Emmy wins and a book that reached No. 1 on The New York Times bestsellers list.'Lift Every Voice and Sing'\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" will be performed by Coco Jones and renowned deaf music artist Fred Beam. Jones has quickly made a name for herself in R&B music, with eight Grammy nominations. Her hit \"ICU\" is platinum-certified. She is an actress as well as a musician.\n            ",

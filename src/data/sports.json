During Atlanta's current three-game winning streak, Cousins has thrown for six touchdowns and just one interception and taking just two sacks.Shough, meanwhile, has shown encouraging flashes since becoming the Saints' starter in Week 9. During New Orleans' current four-game winning streak, Shough has thrown for four touchdowns (and run for two more) and just one interception. He has completed over 71% of his passes during that span, and he has gone over 300 yards passing in each of his last two games.However, the biggest importance in this game might not have anything to do with either team. Thanks to a long list of tiebreakers, if the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Carolina Panthers on Saturday night, the Falcons could still save Carolina's playoff hopes by winning this game. The Saints would do the same for the Buccaneers with a win.\nLong story short, if the Buccaneers win Saturday night, they still need the Saints to win come Sunday. Any other combination, and the Panthers will head to the playoffs as NFC South champs.Here's how to watch Atlanta-New Orleans, along with betting odds, top things to know and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Falcons vs. Saints liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, GeorgiaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Falcons -3, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)Falcons vs. Saints: Need to knowBijan Robinson chasing history. Even in a disappointing season in Atlanta, Robinson has distinguished himself as arguably the best player in the NFL, bar none. Robinson had 229 yards from scrimmage in the Falcons' 27-24 upset win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 17 and is now up to 2,255 on the season. With another 100 yards from scrimmage, he'd move into the top 10 for a single season. With another 200 yards from scrimmage, he'd move into second. The all-time record is 2,509, set by Chris Johnson in 2009. Robinson would need 255 yards from scrimmage to pass that. Regardless, it has been a magnificent season.Cousins, Shough trying to prove themselves. With Penix recovering from a torn ACL, there's a chance Cousins heads into the offseason as the Falcons' potential starter to open 2026. There's also a chance, however, that the Falcons get out of the Cousins contract. Cousins is due a $10 million roster bonus on March 17, 2026. Whether it's in Atlanta or elsewhere, though, Cousins, assuming he wants to keep playing, will want to put more positive play on display. Shough, meanwhile, has impressed as a second-round rookie, so much so that the Saints could continue to build around him, rather than try to replace him this offseason.Rams also have a vested rooting interest. As outlined above, there's a chance the Panthers and the Buccaneers are watching this one very closely. The Rams won't be watching it as closely, but they will still be impacted by it. The Falcons' 2026 first-round pick belongs to Los Angeles. The more Falcons losses, the better for the Rams; the pick could still end up in the top 10.Falcons vs. Saints pick, prediction\nBoth of these teams have played some surprisingly inspired football down the stretch of seasons in which they've long been eliminated from the playoffs. The difference here, between two clubs already with one eye on the offseason ahead, will be Robinson. He totaled 107 yards from scrimmage in the first meeting, a 24-10 Falcons win, as ATL's defense sacked Shough five times.

Mike Vrabel's squad clinched the AFC East last week, but their work is not complete. The Patriots can clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC and the invaluable first-round bye with a win on Sunday paired with a Denver Broncos loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. The Patriots are coming off a dominant 42-10 win over the New York Jets last week. New England scored touchdowns on six straight drives to begin the game, while Drake Maye became the first player to ever complete 90% of his passes and throw for 250 yards and five touchdowns. As for the Dolphins, they upset Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 17, 20-17. Rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers earned his first NFL victory, and flashed some of his potential as well. Let's break down this divisional matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game\nWhere to watch Dolphins vs. Patriots liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium - Foxborough, MassachusettsTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -10.5; O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings)Dolphins vs. Patriots: Need to knowStefon Diggs situation: The Patriots were in the headlines for the wrong reasons this week. Wide receiver Stefon Diggs faces charges of felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery following an incident in his home earlier this month, according to CBS Boston's review of paperwork filed in Dedham District Court. While the NFL is looking into the matter, Diggs is expected to play Sunday. Drake Maye's MVP case: The Patriots' second-year signal-caller registered just four incompletions compared to three total touchdowns last week against the Jets, and is now a relatively heavy favorite to win NFL MVP. He is listed at -295 at DraftKings, while Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is now +225 following his three-interception performance in Week 17. Maye leads the NFL in completion percentage (71.7%), yards per attempt (8.9) and passer rating (112.9).Containing De'Von Achane: A key to victory for New England is containing the explosive Dolphins running back. De'Von Achane ranks fifth in the NFL in scrimmage yards (1,838) and leads the league with 40 rushes for 10 or more yards. He's crossed 100 scrimmage yards in 10 games this season, including a 225-yard explosion against the Buffalo Bills in Week 10. Quinn Ewers gets another start: The Dolphins ended the Tua Tagovailoa era in Week 16, and gave the keys to the offense to the rookie Ewers. In two starts, he's thrown for 432 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. The former Texas star would really turn some heads if he were able to upset the Patriots on Sunday. Dolphins vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThe Patriots are 13-3 against the spread in their last 16 games when favored by double digits, and are an impressive 11-5 against the spread this season. While the Patriots destroyed the Jets by 32 points last week, I don't see this game being as lopsided. Miami has won five of its last seven games after starting the season 2-7, and is 9-1 against the spread in its last 10 games against the Patriots. New England wins this game, but the Dolphins cover the big number. Pick: Dolphins +10.5, Under 45.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Los Angeles Rams are already playoff bound, and the Arizona Cardinals just need a win in the worst way.There isn't much drama for Los Angeles in this one. The Rams will either be the No. 5 or No. 6 seed in the NFC, and they are the type of lower seed that no division winner wants to face. Matthew Stafford is playing at an MVP level, and Puka Nacua is the best receiver in the NFL this season. Exactly how much those two will play on Sunday remains to be seen, but they will get some action as they prepare for what could be a deep playoff run.The Cardinals, on the other hand, just want to taste a victory before going on vacation. Arizona has lost eight straight games, and that 2-0 start feels like it was an eternity ago. The defense has been getting gashed, and while Jacoby Brissett has been serviceable at quarterback, he hasn't been able to outscore opponents on his own. At this point, Cardinals fans might just be rooting for one more loss to protect the team's draft position. What's one more loss?Here is everything you need to know about this NFC West matchup.\nWhere to watch Rams vs. Cardinals liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium -- Inglewood, CaliforniaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -7.5, O/U 46.5 (via DraftKings)Rams vs. Cardinals: Need to knowRams will play starters. Coming off a shocking Week 17 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, the Rams will not be resting their starters in Week 18. That's a departure from how Sean McVay has handled these situations in the past, when he was very conservative with his stars. Perhaps Los Angeles just needs to wash the taste of that loss out of its mouth with a good showing on Sunday. If things get out of hand, will McVay plant his key players on the bench at that point?Ball hogs facing off. Rams receiver Puka Nacua and Cardinals tight end Trey McBride both have 119 receptions, tied for the top mark in the NFL. Both players have been the focal point of their respective offenses, and they've shown off their spectacular hands all season. McBride has already broken the record for single-season catches by a tight end, and Nacua has at least 160 receiving yards in three of his last four games. Who will finish as the league's reception leader?Cardinals looking to avoid new low. Arizona's 13 losses are already tied for a franchise record, so one more would make this the worst season in team history. That brings into question the job security of Jonathan Gannon, who is now 15-35 in his three seasons as Cardinals coach. His best season was in 2024 when he led the team to an 8-9 mark. Can he rally the troops to avoid a record-setting 14th loss?Rams vs. Cardinals prediction, pick\nThe Cardinals have been a gigantic mess for a couple months now, and I get the sense the Rams didn't like the way they performed in last week's loss. Picking Los Angeles is risky because of the chance that the team sits its starters midway through the game, but I still think the Rams' backups would have more juice than this lifeless Cardinals squad.

Both should go off in their matchups, and both are great prices on DraftKings and FanDuel.I'll start with Wilson, who is $6,600 on DraftKings and $7,300 on FanDuel. Marvin Harrison Jr. (foot) is out, which means Wilson should be a star against the Rams. Harrison missed four games this season and left early in another, and Wilson averaged 25.8 PPR points over that span. In those five games, Wilson averaged 14 targets per game, and he also had 11 catches for 142 yards and two touchdowns on 16 targets against the Rams in Week 14.\nBurden is $5,300 on DraftKings and $6,100 on FanDuel, and he should stay hot against the Lions, who are No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Burden just had eight catches for 138 yards and a touchdown on nine targets in Week 17 at San Francisco, and he now has at least 14.4 PPR points in each of his past two games. Both of these receivers will be popular in Week 18, but I don't care. Wilson and Burden are going to go off in this scoring period, and I want them in my lineups on DraftKings and FanDuel.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 18, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        The injury to Nikola Jokic (knee) has sent shockwaves through the fantasy basketball world. He is also just one of several big names to go down with an injury lately. As we look to pick up the pieces, here are five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Isaiah Collier, Utah Jazz (49% rostered)Last week, Collier was rostered in more than half of leagues, so he wasn't eligible for this column. He has been dropped by some fantasy managers recently, which is a bit perplexing. His role hasn't changed as he continues to be one of the primary players off the bench for the Jazz. Over his last 10 games, he has averaged 10 points and 8.7 assists, while shooting 49.3% from the field.It's not always easy to be able to grab a player off the waiver wire who can have the type of impact in assists that Collier is capable of. In just 23 minutes per game this season, he has averaged 6.6 dimes. That comes on the heels of him averaging 6.3 assists over 26 minutes a night last season. The Jazz have already started to sit players out for rest, so Collier could play even more as we enter the new year. If he's still available in your league, now is the time to add him.Bilal Coulibaly, Washington Wizards (48% rostered)Coulibaly has seen his season limited by injuries. He has appeared in just 18 games and has averaged 27 minutes across them, which is down from 33 minutes per game last season. While his numbers weren't off the charts last season, he provided value with averages of 12.3 points, five rebounds, 3.4 assists, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 3-pointers.\nSince his most recent return from injury, Coulibaly has averaged 14.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 3-pointers over five games. That's despite him shooting just 41.4% from the field during that span. The Wizards are once again one of the worst teams in the league, so they could be looking to move veterans CJ McCollum and Khris Middleton at the trade deadline. If they don't, those two could receive additional rest days down the stretch. Look for Coulibaly to play more during the second half of the season.Ayo Dosunmu, Chicago Bulls (44% rostered)Another big injury recently was Josh Giddey (hamstring) going down for the Bulls. He won't even be re-evaluated for two weeks, so he could be sidelined even longer. As if that injury wasn't bad enough, Coby White (calf) has also been ruled out for at least one week. It's the same calf that White missed time for earlier in the season, so expect the Bulls to take a cautious approach with his return.With Giddey and White out Tuesday against the Pelicans, Dosunmu produced 12 points, four rebounds, six assists, and two 3-pointers over 25 minutes off the bench. That wasn't an increase over his season average of 26 minutes a game, but the assists were nearly double his season average. He should have the ball in his hands more with the Bulls missing their top two guards, making him a viable addition in most leagues.\nBrook Lopez, Los Angeles Clippers (33% rostered)Lopez has started five straight games with Ivica Zubac (ankle) out. He has logged 28 minutes a game during that span, which is a significant increase over his season average of 17 minutes per game. The Clippers are 5-0 with him as a starter, and all five of their victories came by at least 13 points. That should leave Lopez in the starting five for the foreseeable future.Even in his new role, Lopez has averaged a modest 10.8 points and 5.2 rebounds. The main reason to consider adding him is because of the combination of 3-pointers and blocks that he can provide. Over the last five starts, he has averaged 2.8 triples and 1.4 rejections. Zubac will likely miss at least another week, making Lopez a great addition for fantasy managers who need help in those two categories.Jalen Smith, Chicago Bulls (14% rostered)In addition to Giddey and White being out, the Bulls announced that Zach Collins (toe) will miss at least 10 days. Prior to his injury, he averaged 11.3 points and six rebounds over his last six games. During that span, he averaged 19 minutes a night. The Bulls were playing more two-big lineups, and Collins performing well was a big reason why.\nWith three key players out against the Pelicans, Smith moved into the starting lineup. He played 26 minutes, recording 14 points, 14 rebounds, two blocks, and one 3-pointer. Over the seven games that Smith has logged at least 20 minutes this season, he has averaged 11.7 points, 8.3 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and two 3-pointers. He has a clear path to that kind of role for at least the next week, making him worth adding in most formats.\n            ",

Their game against the Las Vegas Raiders will be the last of their 2025 season, and it could be the last of Travis Kelce's prolific career.As injuries mount, Kansas City is limping to the finish line this season. Third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun will try to get the first win of his career and halt the Chiefs' five-game losing streak. The major story going into this one is the future of Kelce, who might be suiting up for the final time. While a win would hurt the Chiefs' position in the 2026 NFL Draft, I'm sure they would love to send their legendary tight end out with a win, if this is it for him.How bad have the Raiders been? They've lost 10 in a row, and the latest one was a 24-point defeat at the hands of the lowly New York Giants. Las Vegas now possesses the No. 1 pick in the draft, and why mess it up now? The Raiders have gone nearly three months without a win, and there are no signs that will change this weekend. Maybe Las Vegas can force feed Ashton Jeanty in the hopes of getting him to 1,000 rushing yards.Here is everything you need to know about this AFC West matchup.\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Raiders liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Allegiant Stadium -- Las Vegas, NevadaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chiefs -5.5, O/U 36.5 (via DraftKings)Chiefs vs. Raiders: Need to knowKelce's farewell?: Kelce hasn't announced that he is retiring after the season, but it seems like that's certainly a possibility. If Sunday does bring the end of his career, it was one of the best we've ever seen from a tight end. He's third all-time among tight ends in both receptions (1,077) and receiving yards (12,990). He's also the franchise leader in total touchdowns with 85. Whenever his career ends, Kelce can start getting sized up for his Hall of Fame jacket.Raiders have lots to lose by winning. The Raiders haven't won anything since Oct. 12, so why start now. By beating the Giants last week, the Raiders took possession of the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft. That will allow them to get their pick of whatever quarterback they desire -- or trade down for a haul if they determine the 2027 quarterback class is stronger. Either way, Las Vegas has little to gain from actually winning this game.AFC West woes for Las Vegas. Few teams have been as terrible against their own division than the Raiders. Over the team's last 11 divisional games, Las Vegas is 0-11 with an average margin of defeat of 11.8 points. Oftentimes, division games are more competitive than you might expect, but that's not been the case when the Raiders match up against other AFC West teams.Chiefs vs. Raiders prediction, pick\nThis may be a trap, but I don't see how the Raiders cover this spread. Sure, Oladokun has struggled mightily in each of his first two appearances this season, but have you seen Las Vegas play football recently? At least Kansas City has shown the ability to play competent football. The Chiefs just went toe-to-toe withe Broncos last week. Give me Andy Reid's squad by a wide margin. Pick: Chiefs -5.5, Over 36.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Jacksonville Jaguars clinch the division with a win over the Tennessee Titans, but this matchup may not be as lopsided as the records suggest.The Jaguars look like a very dangerous team heading into the playoffs. They are riding a seven-game winning streak and can make it eight with a win over the Titans. Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars offense have momentum under first-year coach Liam Coen. On defense, Jacksonville is elite against the run, and that unit allows just 20.6 points per game. The Jags seek their second consecutive season sweep of the Titans.Tennessee has been more competitive in recent weeks, and rookie quarterback Cam Ward is progressing nicely. He has displayed a level of consistency he didn't have earlier in the season, and the entire Titans offense is better for it. The Tennessee defense still has its share of issues, and a lackluster secondary is at risk of being exposed by the red-hot Jaguars.Here is everything you need to know about this AFC South matchup.\nWhere to watch Jaguars vs. Titans liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: EverBank Stadium -- Jacksonville, FloridaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Jaguars -12.5, O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings)Jaguars vs. Titans: Need to knowHistoric turnaround in Jacksonville: What a difference a year makes. Last season, the Jaguars went 4-13 and fired coach Doug Pederson. Now, they are knocking on the door of 13 wins and a division title. Only two teams in NFL history have gone from 13-plus losses one season to 13-plus wins in the next. One of those teams, the 2025 New England Patriots, pulled off that feat just last week.Ward catching fire: Critical mistakes and inconsistency plagued the early portion of Ward's rookie season. Lately, however, Ward seems to have adjusted to NFL defenses. The No. 1 pick now has two or more touchdown passes in four straight games, and the Titans haven't had a quarterback put together a streak like that since Ryan Tannehill in 2020.Lawrence fulfilling his potential: The No. 1 overall pick in 2021, Lawrence was considered a generational prospect at the quarterback position. It's taken him a while to approach that potential in the NFL, but it sure looks like he's getting there now. Lawrence has 26 passing touchdowns and nine rushing touchdowns this season, and he's just the fourth quarterback ever to put up those kind of dual-threat numbers, joining Kyler Murray, Cam Newton and Josh Allen.Jaguars vs. Titans prediction, pick\nThe Jaguars have a lot to play for, including the No. 1 seed in the AFC, even if that is a bit of a longshot. That makes it tempting to pick Jacksonville, despite the large 12.5-point spread. However, the Titans have shown a lot of fight over the last month or so. I don't think Tennessee will just roll over in this one. It will make Jacksonville earn that AFC South crown.

And depending on what happens in Week 18, still have a chance at winning a third straight AFC South title. Standing in their way is an Indianapolis Colts team playing for pride after an injury to Daniel Jones sent a once promising season into a tailspin. Houston (11-5) claims the AFC South with a win and a Jaguars loss to the Titans. As it stands, the Texans would enter the playoffs as the No. 5 seed and to face the AFC North champion (either the Ravens or Steelers) in the wild card round. If they win the AFC South, the Texans become the No. 3 seed and host either the Bills or Chargers next weekend. The Jaguars eliminated Indianapolis (8-8) last week from playoff contention. After an 8-2 start, the Colts lost six straight games, becoming the first team in 30 years to hold such a dubious distinction.\nWhere to watch Colts vs. Texans liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation:  NRG Stadium -- Houston, TexasTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Texans -10.5, O/U 38.5 (via DraftKings)Colts vs. Texans: Need to know New QB for Colts. After starting 44-year-old Philip Rivers for the past three games, the Colts turn the offense over to rookie Riley Leonard, who attempted 33 passes over four games. Leonard helped lead Notre Dame to the College Football Playoff National Championship Game last season, throwing for 21 touchdown passes while running for 17 more scores. Taylor in pursuit of rushing title. Colts running back Jonathan Taylor is 47 yards behind James Cook in the race to win the rushing title. Taylor faces a Texans defense Sunday that is fourth in the NFL in rushing. He had 21 carries for 85 yards in the Colts' 20-16 loss to Houston back in Week 13. Money in the red zone. Despite their recent slide, the Colts remain one of the NFL's best red zone teams on both sides of the ball. The Colts rank third and ninth in the NFL in red zone offense and defense, respectively. Taylor has been a key to the Colts' offensive red zone success as his 18 rushing touchdowns leads the NFL. Steady C.J. One of the NFL's most overlooked players, C.J. Stroud has once again been solid for the Texans. He is completing a career-high 64.8% of his passes with 18 touchdowns against just eight picks. Stroud received solid protection this season with just 23 sacks taken.Emerging skill players. Stroud's success can also be attributed to the Texans' young but emerging group of skill players. While Nico Collins continues to be the Texans' primary weapon, rookies Jayden Higgins, Jaylin Noel and Woody Marks add to the skill arsenal. No. 1 defense. Houston's defense may be the primary reason why it is playoff bound after an 0-3 start. The unit allows an average of just 16.5 points per game, featuring a ferocious pass rush led by Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr.. They have a combined 26 sacks. The secondary features four players with at least four interceptions.Colts vs. Texans prediction, pick \nThe Colts would be better off starting Rivers if they're serious about winning this game. Instead, they gave Leonard his first career start against the league's top defense. Good luck, kid. Pick: Texans -10.5, Under 38.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest games in Week 18 will be going down in Tampa Bay with the Buccaneers hosting the Panthers in a game where there will be a lot on the line.If the Panthers win, they'll clinch the NFC South, but if they lose, that means we'll see an NFL rarity: A team with a losing record will make the playoffs. A loss by Carolina would guarantee that the NFC South winner would go into the postseason with a losing record at 8-9. Whether it's the Panthers or the Bucs, the winner of the division will get to host a playoff game on wild card weekend and that will likely spark a new debate about whether the NFL needs to change its playoff format so that a team with a losing record can't host a postseason game. Over the past five years, there have been two teams that have won a division with a losing record and in that span, there's certainly been some outcry that the NFL shouldn't award a home playoff game to a team with a losing record or to a team that has a much worse record than its opponent. After the 14-win Vikings were forced to play a road playoff game last season, the Lions decided to propose a new playoff format for 2025. \nUnder the Lions' proposal, the seven teams in each conference would still consist of four division champions and three wild card teams. However, the big change is that the teams would be seeded by who has the best record. Under this proposal, a wild card team could be seeded ahead of a division winner if the wild card team has a better record. This means that a wild card team could be seeded as high as No. 2. Under the current format, the four division winners get the top four seeds followed by the three wild card teams. In the current format, no wild card team can be seeded higher than fifth. The Lions decided to withdraw their proposal just before it was set to be vote on back in May, so no changes were made to the NFL's existing playoff format for this year. If this new proposal would have been in place this year, the NFL playoff race would have a much different look, especially in the NFC. \nHere's what the NFC playoff seedings look like right now: 1. Seahawks (13-3) 2. Bears (11-5)3. Eagles (11-5)4. Panthers (8-8)5. 49ers (12-4) 6. Rams (11-5)7. Packers (9-6-1)If the Lions' proposal had passed, here's what the NFC standings would have looked like heading into Week 18: 1. Seahawks (13-3) 2. 49ers (12-4) 3. Bears (11-5) 4. Eagles (11-5)5. Rams (11-5) 6. Packers (9-6-1) 7. Panthers (8-8)In this situation, the Seahawks would have already clinched a home game, but the NFC West would still be on the line when they play the 49ers on Saturday night. Also, the Panthers and Buccaneers would be going into Week 18 knowing that the winner of the NFC South would be getting the seventh seed and playing a road game in the opening round. \nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell has been showing support for a possible change to the playoff format. When Goodell was asked about Detroit's proposal back in April, he seemed to be enthusiastic about it. \"I thought it is a very healthy proposal and a very healthy point that we need to evaluate and continue to look at,\" Goodell said. \"It went through many different forms. There was some great data to show that we should really look at some form or version of this.\"If the the NFL gets another team with a losing record hosting a playoff game this year, it certainly wouldn't be surprising if there's a new proposal to change the playoff format at the next owner's meeting in March. \nThat being said, the Panthers could make the playoffs with a winning record (9-8) if they beat the Bucs on Saturday, but even if that happens, there could still be a call for change. In 2024, the NFL didn't have a team with a losing record make the playoffs, but the Lions still made their proposal. Last year, the Lions' proposal didn't have enough support, but that could change if another 8-9 team hosts a playoff game. If the Buccaneers or Panthers do make the postseason with a losing record, it would mark just the seventh time in NFL history that a sub-.500 team has made the playoffs. \nHere's the full list of teams that have gotten into the postseason with a losing record: 1982 Browns (4-5)1982 Lions (4-5)2010 Seahawks (7-9)2014 Panthers (7-8-1)2020 Commanders (7-9)2022 Buccaneers (8-9)Note: The Browns and Lions both made it during a strike-shortened season where the NFL expanded the playoff field to 16 teams. The other four teams on the list all won their division. \nAs you can see, both the Panthers and Buccaneers have already made the playoffs once with a losing record, which means if one of them makes it to the playoffs this year at 8-9, they'd become the first team in NFL history to do it twice. For the Panthers to make the playoffs with a losing record, they'd have to lose to the Bucs on Saturday and then the Falcons would have to beat the Saints on Sunday. For the Bucs to get in at 8-9, they'd have to beat the Panthers and then have the Falcons lose to New Orleans. \n            ",

After two seasons atop the division, the Detroit Lions will miss the playoffs for the first time since 2022. On Sunday, they'll try to play spoiler against the new division champion, the Chicago Bears, who are playing for a chance to capture the NFC's No. 2 seed. With a win over the Lions, the Bears would host division rival Green Bay in the wild card round. Chicago will drop to the No. 3 seed, however, if they do not defeat the Lions and the Eagles beat the Commanders. The Bears will be the No. 2 seed if both they and the Eagles lose on Sunday. Along with playing the role of spoiler, the Lions are also trying to record their fourth consecutive winning season. Detroit started 7-4, but were eliminated from playoff contention after last week's loss to the Vikings evened its record at 8-8. \nWhere to watch Lions vs. Bears liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation:  Soldier Field -- Chicago, Illinois TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bears -3, O/U 50.5 (via DraftKings)Lions vs. Bears: Need to know Last time we met. After a season-opening loss, the Lions responded with an emphatic, 52-21 win over the Bears in what was Ben Johnson's first game against his former team. Johnson was asked afterward about Dan Campbell's decision to go for it on fourth-and-goal late in the game despite the lopsided score. \"What's he supposed to do?\" Johnson said. \"It's fourth-and-goal, what do you want him to do? Yeah, he could have kicked the field goal. They don't kick field goals; they go for it there. He was doing what he's supposed to do. That's what he does.\"Hungry Bears. A big reason for Chicago's success this season has been its ability to force turnovers. The Bears lead the NFL with 32 forced turnovers this year, which includes at least one forced turnover in 14 of their first 16 games. Ironically, Chicago's loss to Detroit in Week 2 is just one of two games this year where it didn't force a turnover. Ball hawking secondary. The Bears' secondary has played a key role in the defensive's success in terms of getting turnovers. Chicago has picked off 22 passes, with safety Kevin Byard recording a league-high six picks. Captain Comeback. Caleb Williams has often been at his best late in games. He's led six fourth quarter comebacks and six game-winning drives this season. Dynamic duo. Williams has been complemented by one of the league's best running back duos in D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai. This duo has combined to rush for 1,816 yards and 14 touchdowns and caught 50 passes for 440 yards and one score. Wounded Lions. Injuries have played a key role in Detroit's disappointing season. They are currently dealing with several notable injuries, including ones to wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee), defensive tackle Alim McNeill (abdomen), lineman Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness) and linebacker Alex Anzalone (concussion). Lions vs. Bears prediction, pick \nWhile I can definitely see the Lions duplicating what they did in 2022 (upsetting Green Bay on the road in a game that meant nothing in terms of the playoffs), it's hard to pick against a Bears team that still has something to play for, along with the fact that there is a score to settle after losing by 31 points in Detroit back in Week 2.  Pick: Bears, -3, Over 50.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        We're just a few days away from the end of the 2025 NFL regular season, which means we're just a few days away from the start of the 2026 NFL coaching carousel. We don't yet know exactly how many jobs will become available when all is said and done, but we do know that two are already open: those of the Tennessee Titans and New York Giants.On Friday, ESPN reported a wide-ranging list of candidates who are expected to either get interviews or be candidates for the Giants job. Working off the list reported by ESPN, we're going to separate the candidates into tiers and then rank them within said tiers.Head coachesBrowns HC Kevin StefanskiBroncos DC Vance JosephFormer Cowboys and Packers HC Mike McCarthyFormer Raiders HC Antonio PierceGiants Interim HC Mike KafkaIf Stefanski becomes available, he'd be an excellent fit as an offensive-minded head coach who has shown he can scheme quarterbacks into success. The Browns are a disaster, but Stefanski himself is widely respected as a play-caller, and he's still young enough (he'll be 44 in May) that he can be considered up-and-coming despite having already been a head coach for six years.McCarthy would bring stability to what has been an unstable franchise. He's won in both Dallas and Green Bay, though he had the benefit of coaching Dak Prescott and Aaron Rodgers in those stops. He helped both of those players reach the peak of their talents, though, and could potentially do the same for Jaxson Dart.\nJoseph got his first head-coaching opportunity back in 2017 and 2018, going 11-21 with the Broncos. But his defenses have been some of the best and most creative in the league since he went back to being a coordinator. He's earned another shot at a top job, and if he could bring in a strong offensive coordinator, he'd be a good fit for New York.Pierce is a former Giants linebacker and Super Bowl champion. His lone season as the full-time head coach of the Raiders was pretty disastrous, though, and it's not like he's had an opportunity to prove himself elsewhere like Joseph has.\n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 4.0: Cowboys beef up the trenches as the Steelers look for help at WR\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Kafka era has not exactly been a smashing success since he started filling in for the deposed Brian Daboll. The Giants are 1-5 and they haven't lit the world on fire offensively. Kafka was a hot coordinator candidate during his time as the quarterbacks coach for the Chiefs but the shine might be off when it comes to his head-coaching prospects. He's presumably on the interview list because he's the internal candidate, but it's hard to see the Giants wanting to hold over anything from the Daboll era.\nCurrent coordinatorsChargers DC Jesse Minter Packers DC Jeff HafleyRams DC Chris ShulaColts DC Lou Anarumo Minter's Chargers defense is one of the best in the league. He has the pedigree of working under both John and Jim Harbaugh and is considered one of the top defensive minds in the league. He's shown that he can coach in both college and the NFL, which could help him with New York's young roster.Hafley has ties to both New Jersey (he was born and raised in Bergen County, which is also home to East Rutherford) and Boston College, which helps out with the Giants, because John Mara also went there and has a history of valuing that sort of thing. His Packers defense was also one of the best in the NFL when healthy this season.Shula is considered a rising star and has the family pedigree of being Don Shula's grandson and Dave Shula's son. He also has the all-important ties to Sean McVay, which we've seen over the last decade or so is very important when it comes to getting jobs in the NFL. It doesn't hurt that he's kept the Rams defense afloat the last two years post-Aaron Donald.\nThey would all be considered a hire in the mold of Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald as young defensive mind who could potentially help the Giants and their elite pass rush stop some of the best and most explosive offenses in the NFL. You could probably put them in any order you want on this list, but they'll all have to show that they have a plan for how to build the offense around Dart. Anarumo also has New York ties as he was born and raised and went to college in Staten Island. He's quite a bit older and more experienced than the other defensive coordinators on this list, but that age (he'll be 60 at the start of next season) might make him a bit less desirable. Coaches don't usually get their first head-coaching chance that late in their careers.Other coachesSeahawks OC Klint KubiakCommanders OC Kliff Kingsbury Vikings QB Coach Josh McCownJaguars OC Grant UdinskiTexans DC Matt Burke Panthers DC Ejiro Evero This is the group of coaches considered to have an \"outside chance\" at being the Giants' next coach, according to ESPN.\nKubiak is part of the McShanahan tree, which is always desirable in interviews, and he's shown during his time as a coordinator that he can put players in position to succeed -- see Sam Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Kingsbury's offense seems like a pretty good fit for Jaxson Dart's skill set, given the success he had with Jayden Daniels during Daniels' rookie season in Washington. McCown and Udinski are considered rising stars on the offensive side of the ball because of their work with quarterbacks. McCown was there for Darnold's excellent 2024 season in Minnesota, as was Udinski, who has also had a hand (along with Liam Coen, obviously) in Trevor Lawrence's breakthrough year.Burke calls the defensive plays for Houston's elite defense despite DeMeco Ryans being the head coach. He also has ties to BC, having been a graduate assistant there early in his coaching career. Evero is respected despite Carolina's defense being up and down during his tenure but it seems like other defensive minds are more toward the forefront of searches this offseason.\n            ",

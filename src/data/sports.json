    "body": "\n        New users can capitalize on the latest DraftKings promo code to receive $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass when online sports betting on some of the biggest teams in college football on Saturday. For the first time in more than a month, USC will play a team without a number before its name, as the Trojans are coming off a 1-2 stretch with three straight games against ranked opponents. USC did go 2-1 against the spread in those three games, though, playing competitively in all three games. The SportsLine model projects a matchup against unranked Nebraska to lead to strong results for the Trojans, making USC covering as 4.5-point favorites one of its Saturday best bets at DraftKings for a 7:30 p.m. ET road contest. The Trojans are 5-2 overall this season, with all five of their victories coming by at least 14 points, making them one of the model's most confident picks of the entire Week 10 college football schedule for Saturday best bets at DraftKings.In addition, the model sees strong value in a pair of college football totals for its Saturday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The model is backing Under 55.5 points for Oklahoma vs. Tennessee in an SEC showdown, but it's taking Over 47.5 points for Washington State vs. Oregon State, which takes place at 7:30 p.m. ET for its Saturday best bets. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college football game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks, and it enters Week 10 on a profitable 47-33 combined run on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024. Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Saturday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookUSC -4.5 vs. Nebraska (-108)Under 55.5 in Tennessee vs. Oklahoma (-115)Over 47.5 in Oregon State vs. Washington State (-105)Combining the model's three picks into a Saturday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +634 (risk $100 to win $634). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nUSC -4.5 vs. Nebraska (-108)The Trojans are 5-2 in Year Four of the Lincoln Riley era at USC, and the Trojans appear on their way to their best year under Riley since his 11-3 first season when Caleb Williams won the Heisman Trophy. Now, not saying he's going to be the No. 1 overall pick one day, but current Trojans quarterback Jayden Maiava has USC ranked third in the nation in passing yards per game (326.1) and first in total yards (530 per game). USC is No. 2 in scoring offense (42.4 ppg), and the Trojans are 4-1 straight-up in games when favored by at least 4.5 points this season. All five USC wins have come by at least 14 points, and the model projects USC to cover in 60% of simulations. Back USC at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Under 55.5 in Tennessee vs. Oklahoma (-115)One of the nation's top offenses is set to face one of the country's best defenses in a test of strengths on Saturday. Tennessee has the No. 3 scoring offense at 41.9 ppg this season, but Oklahoma has the No. 6 scoring defense at 13.9 ppg allowed this year. The Sooners held teams like Michigan, Auburn and South Carolina to fewer than 20 points, so their statistical success isn't strictly from lopsided non-conference matchups. They also held Texas and Ole Miss to below their season averages, so that could happen again on Saturday for an Under result. The model projects the Under to hit in 63% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Over 47.5 in Oregon State vs. Washington State (-105)The final two teams playing Pac-12 football this season go head-to-head for the 110th time, with Washington State leading the all-time series, 57-49-3. Oregon State won this matchup, 41-38, last year to blow past this over/under total. The year before, Washington State won 38-35, so they've had extremely high-scoring contests in their recent history. They've gone Over this total in 11 of their last 12 head-to-head meetings. The model projects that trend to continue, with the Over hitting in 65% of simulations for this 7:30 p.m. ET matchup. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Saturday college football picks?You've seen some of the model's Saturday best bets.

The QB has a 71.2% completion percentage and a 13-3 TD-INT ratio while the RB1 leads the NFL with 850 yards on 143 carries and 12 rushing touchdowns. One of the Colts' few flaws is that the passing defense is allowing 252.0 yards per game, which could open the door for Rodgers to connect with DK Metcalf and rebound from last Sunday night's loss.  Rodgers completed 24 passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns against the Packers. He didn't play as well as Jordan Love, however, who lit up the Pittsburgh defense for 360 yards and three touchdowns. The Steelers passing defense is allowing a league-worst 273.3 yards per game and is about to go up against a surging quarterback in Jones. The run defense was able to limit Josh Jacobs to 2.5 average yards on 13 carries, so their best course of action in Week 9 will be to limit the damage Taylor can do.Click here to bet Colts vs. Steelers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Colts vs. Steelers score prediction, picksIndianapolis is a league-leading 6-2-0 ATS this season while Pittsburgh is 3-4-0 ATS, although the SportsLine model foresees a rebound performance from Rodgers and the Steelers.

Meanwhile, James Cook is averaging a league-high 107.6 rushing yards per game with seven touchdowns in 2025, and he should be fired up to go up against Kansas City's sturdy run defense after scoring two TDs against the Panthers in Week 8. Kansas City is only allowing 16.4 points per game, but Buffalo has only scored fewer than 20 points once this season.Click here to bet Chiefs vs. Bills at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Chiefs vs. Bills score prediction, picksThe Chiefs are 5-3-0 ATS and have covered the spread in each of their last three games.

    "body": "\n        The Hawks were among the teams expected to take a step forward this season in the Eastern Conference, but a 3-3 start and injury concerns for star point guard Trae Young have stripped away some of the excitement early in Atlanta. After Young injured his knee on Wednesday night against the Brooklyn Nets when a teammate fell into him, there was some initial good news in it not being a torn ACL. However, the team announced an MRI on Saturday revealed a sprained MCL that will keep him out for at least four weeks before they re-evaluate him -- which means the absence could extend beyond that initial timetable. For a Hawks team that has been largely built around Young's abilities on the offensive end for years, they'll face a serious challenge navigating the next month without him. That said, the reason for optimism entering this season was the Hawks were the deepest, most talented group of teammates Young has had in Atlanta on paper, and that means they should be better equipped for his absence. How the Hawks can succeed without YoungFriday's 128-108 win over the Pacers in their NBA Cup opener provided a glimpse at the ideal scenario for how the Hawks can play without Young in the lineup. \nDyson Daniels had one of his best offensive games of the season stepping into the point guard role with Nickeil Alexander-Walker taking over at the two guard spot. Those two combined for 39 points and Daniels had six assists and nine rebounds to do a bit of everything for Atlanta from the point guard spot. Their ability as a duo to wreak havoc on defense can lead to easy offense, and the Hawks will have to lean on their defensive upside in Young's absence. Daniels living up to the $100 million contract the Hawks just gave him prior to the season will be critical to whether they can stay afloat in November. This is also an opportunity for Jalen Johnson to prove himself as a leading man, as many in Atlanta hoped to see him take a leap as an All-Star this season. On Saturday, his full skillset was on display when he led the team in all three major categories with 22 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists in the win in Indiana. Johnson was having a breakout 2024-25 campaign before an injury shut him down, and without Young they'll need him to not just show flashes of brilliance but be a consistent star-level player for the Hawks to reach their goals. While it'll take a group effort to cover for what Young brings as a scorer and facilitator, Daniels and Johnson are the two most important players in terms of taking on the playmaking role for Atlanta over the next month. \nThe schedule will get more difficult than the Pacers and Nets, and their next five games against the Cavs, Magic, Raptors, Lakers and Clippers will offer a more true assessment of what this group is capable of without Young. \n            ",

Speaking to the media ahead of the game, Flick spoke on the matter, saying, \"Normally I don't think about the injured players, but it's not easy to manage. The important thing is for them to raise their level and for the others to do so too, especially the young ones. After the match in Madrid, Pedri only had a minor discomfort, just fatigue, but when we checked it, we found the injury. We have to accept it.

    "body": "\n        When Josh Giddey averaged better than 20 points, nine rebounds and eight assists on 45% 3-point shooting over the final 25 games of last season, nobody knew quite what to make of it. On the one hand, his shooting had improved every year in the league, especially with time to take aim, and his creative talents were never really in question as long as he had control of an offense, an opportunity the Bulls were able to give him that he was never going to get in Oklahoma City.On the other hand, the last six weeks of the NBA regular-season calendar often produces some dicey data. Not every team is, shall we say, fully committed to putting its best product on the floor at this point, though it should be noted that pretty much every team Chicago faced down the stretch was still battling for playoff positioning. Still, even the Bulls didn't know how much to trust what they'd seen from Giddey, who was a restricted free agent entering the summer and didn't get a deal closed until the second week of September -- a four-year, $100 million swing that, at this moment, looks like a home run for a Chicago team that is off to a 5-0 start for the first time since 1996. \nGiddey is not an NBA alpha in any sort of traditional sense. He's not particularly athletic or fast; he can, at times, look like he's about one step from turning clumsy. He doesn't generate one-on-one advantages if a blow-by or in-your-bag step-back is the standard. But he's bigger than just about any guard he faces at 6-foot-7 and knows how to bump his way into the paint and continue downhill as a scorer or passer through contact. Until the end of last season, that was always the problem with Giddey. If he wasn't pushing in the open floor, his lack of shooting allowed defenses to sag on him, negating the physical advantages he can create in tighter quarters with a shoulder here or a hip there. It was particularly a problem off ball, where he could basically be ignored. But this shooting has been going on long enough -- 61 for his last 135 from 3 dating back to Feb. 1 of last season -- that we have to consider the possibility that it's real (he also shot the 3 well at the Olympics; a shorter international line, but still). \nAnd if that's the case, Giddey, as the only player in the league putting up at least 22 points, eight rebounds and eight assists on 40% 3-point shooting so far, becomes a perfect captain for an inclusive offense that is designed around his strengths. It was all on display in a career-best scoring night against the Knicks on Friday. \nLong mired in play-in perpetuity, the Bulls might really be on to something here. Giddey (who, let's be honest, felt like an almost laughable return for what was long one of the league's most valuable trade assets in Alex Caruso) is only 23 years old. And he's not alone. The Bulls play nine guys double-digit minutes, and seven of them are 25 or younger. When 20-point scorer Coby White comes back, it'll be 10. Six of them are scoring at least 11 PPG, and Patrick Williams is at 9.2. Nikola Vučević is on a tear to start the year. Matas Buzelis is a walking highlight. Pretty much everyone can shoot, pass and dribble, allowing for a flow that has produced a league-high 30.6 assists per game. \nAgain, this is the perfect setup for Giddey, who isn't suited to stationary offense. Nobody on the Bulls, in fact, is going to take over a game, or even a possession, on his own. They rely on pace and hot potato passing to expose defenses in rotation little by little until an advantage attained by committee emerges. It sometimes takes a while. The Bulls score 10.2 PPG in the final four seconds of the shot clock, third most in the league. When it's working, it looks like this. That's not a shot Giddey has traditionally had, but he's 7 for 14 on catch-and-shoot 3s this year after sitting just under 39% on such shots last season. That changes everything as it weaponizes him off ball, where he is already a solid cutter and catch-and-go driver. If now you have to stay spaced to account for him in the half court and close out honestly to him in rotation, he's going to continue getting into the teeth of defenses en route, potentially, to his first All-Star selection. \n\"I'm in a place where I'm wanted,\" Giddey said Friday of his situation with the Bulls. \"I love being here. I'm happy here. I think having confidence from your teammates and coaches to trust me to go out there and make plays, that's what you kind of need as a player. When you have the belief of everyone around you, it propels you in the right direction.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin is not just a passenger on his team's ride to a possible Big Ten championship and another College Football Playoff berth. He's a wheelman.For much of the season, Sayin was looked at as another cog in the machine at Ohio State -- a young QB taking advantage of playing on an offense that surrounded him with elite talent, particularly at the wide receiver position. That was certainly true to start the year. Ohio State opened its season with what looked to be its most difficult game on the schedule against Texas. It was in that game that Ryan Day and the Buckeyes staff took an approach of not putting too much on Sayin's plate.They've loaded more onto it as the season has progressed, however, and Sayin continues to answer every challenge and excel.Sayin completed 20 of his 23 pass attempts for 316 yards and four touchdowns in Ohio State's 38-14 win over Penn State on Saturday. It's the seventh straight game he's completed at least 70% of his pass attempts, and the fourth time he's finished a game with a completion rate over 85%. It's the fifth time this season he's thrown for at least 300 yards and three touchdowns in a game, becoming the first Ohio State QB to do so since CJ Stroud in 2021. Stroud, like Sayin this year, was a redshirt freshman during that season. I'm sure Ohio State would love it if Sayin's career in Columbus follows the same path as Stroud's, though perhaps with a national title or two.\nAnd it's not like he's out there dinking and dunking.\nSayin's performance against Penn State launched him to the lead of the Heisman Trophy odds at multiple sportsbooks, but it's not a reactionary measure. Sayin has been slowly building toward this and has been playing at an elite level for a while now.His box score stats betray his play in wins over Washington and Illinois. In Seattle, it was clear early that the Huskies weren't going to put up many points, which led to the Buckeyes leaning more on their run game in a tough road environment. Sayin and the Buckeyes' passing attack were happy to make short throws and nick the Huskies' defense at will while it dropped guys deep looking to take away explosives.Against Illinois, Ohio State's offense was gifted with short fields by the Illini turnovers, so it was impossible to rack up big yardage numbers. He was still remarkably efficient in those games, which is the hallmark of who he is.\nIt's that efficiency that likely causes some people to look at Sayin as an exceptional game manager, but that viewpoint ignores what truly separates him from so many college quarterbacks. Ohio State's offense has always done a great job of making things \"easier\" on its quarterbacks, but Sayin shows a high IQ in the offense for somebody who remains relatively inexperienced. The ball is out on time and typically with impeccable placement. It's either going to be caught by his target and give him a chance to get yards after the catch, or it's going to fall incomplete.\nSayin also doesn't force things that aren't there, which is not typical of most freshmen, redshirt or otherwise. He has not thrown an interception since Ohio State's Week 3 win over Ohio. He hasn't even fumbled. In other words, he manages the game while making exceptional plays that few other quarterbacks in the country are capable of.The last thing other contenders wanted to see this year was an Ohio State team with an incredible defense and NFL talent on offense find itself with an elite QB to boot, but they've got one. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Duke picked up its first road win over Clemson since 1980, a 46-45 shootout, on Saturday, but the Blue Devils' game-winning drive was kept alive by a controversial call. In his postgame press conference, an incredulous Dabo Swinney was still flabbergasted by a late pass interference call that helped Duke pull out the win.With under a minute remaining in the game, Duke faced fourth down while trailing by a touchdown. Blue Devils quarterback Darian Mensah lofted up a prayer over the middle of the field, and it fell harmlessly to the ground after receiver Que'Sean Brown collided with Clemson defensive back Avieon Terrell. Despite Brown pushing Terrell to the ground on the play, the officials flagged the latter for defensive pass interference. Swinney called it \"one of the worst calls\" he's ever seen. \nThe penalty gave Duke new life, and Nate Sheppard found the end zone on the next play with 40 seconds to go. And rather than play for the tie, the Blue Devils went for two and the lead. They converted and then the defense held on to seal the 46-45 win.\n        \n            \n                Bowl season in jeopardy for Clemson: Tigers' postseason hopes take hit as season bottoms out in loss to Duke\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter the loss, which dropped Clemson to 3-5 on the year, Swinney put that pass interference penalty among the worst he's witnessed in his three decades as a coach.\n\"I don't even know what to say about the last call,\" Swinney said. \"You all saw it. Shouldn't have come down to that. We had plenty of opportunities to win the game, but that's one of the worst calls I've ever seen in a game ever in my entire coaching career. Ever. I don't really know what else to say.\"I don't wanna make that a deal because we should've won the game. We had plenty of opportunities to win the game. But you fight your butt off, you scratch and claw to get in a situation like that. Then you have a call like that. Man, that's just more salt in the wound.\"When he first saw the play live, Swinney thought it was offensive pass interference. Then he realized the call was going against his Tigers.\n\"I saw OPI,\" Swinney said. \"What'd you see? ... That's what I thought the call was. I was shocked there wasn't a flag. Then when there was a flag, I was like, 'Oh good, they called OPI.' It didn't go our way. They must've seen something I didn't see.\"The penalty may have been questionable, but Clemson made plenty of mistakes of its own. The pass defense was abysmal, allowing Mensah to throw for 361 yards and causing Swinney to melt down on the sideline right before halftime. The Tigers also surrendered a 100-yard kickoff return after taking the lead early in the third quarter.After beginning the season ranked inside the top five, Clemson will have to win three of its last four games just to reach bowl eligibility. The Tigers will try to get back in the win column next week against Florida State.\n            ",

The final kickoff on the slate, Chiefs vs. Bills, also has the highest over/under of the day at 52.5 points.

Williams has been trending down the past couple weeks, with two games in a row with no touchdowns and an interception in both. He's also totaled just 20 rushing yards over the past three weeks.That's lowered his DFS price, but this is an ideal spot to use him as a value pick as the Bears take on the Bengals. Cincinnati has been one of the worst passing defenses in the league recently as opposed defenses have feasted against the Bengals, and Williams has an over/under of 237.5 passing yards. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, who is $9,500 on FanDuel and $8,800 on DraftKings. McCaffrey missed some practice earlier this week, but that turned out to be for rest and precautionary reasons, as he's full go for Sunday against the Giants.New York is tied for 25th in terms of most Fantasy points given up to opposing backs this season, so McCaffrey is in a great bounce-back spot after a slow week against the Texans in Week 8. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 9 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

It started with him in concussion protocol after a rough hit the week before against Mississippi State. Then it took another turn when he was caught in a viral photo at a traffic stop before he finished the week by leading the No. 20 Longhorns to a 34-31 win over No. 9 Vanderbilt on Saturday. The photo, which surfaced earlier in the week, appeared to show Manning pulled over near campus in a black GMC Denali. After throwing for three touchdowns in the win, he laughed off the moment and explained what happened.\"It was a crosswalk that was solid red. I didn't think there was anyone around so I went,\" Manning said, via CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. \"I guess there was someone around.\"\nBetween concussion check-ins and a run-in with campus police, the sophomore still managed one of his best performances of the season -- completing 25 of 33 passes for 328 yards with no interceptions.\n\"I do think he's grown up,\" Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said postgame. \"He just looks so much more mature. He looks so much more poised. He looks so much more confident and he's got a lot more trust in those guys around him. I think that continuity of playing with him more and more and more. Just his ability to manage the game, change protections and work the shot-clock and take the shots when they're there and check the ball down when the check-downs were there. ... Very proud of him.  It's been a long year.  He's been through a lot and so for him to have some of the success he's having right now -- he deserves it.\"Manning had been cleared to play Friday after spending much of the week in concussion protocol. He sustained the injury in last week's 45-38 overtime win when his helmet hit the turf on a 13-yard scramble late in the game. He was evaluated immediately and did not return.Sarkisian told ESPN's Molly McGrath Friday afternoon that Manning had not experienced any setbacks or symptoms during the week, and was set to meet with doctors Saturday morning for a final evaluation before kickoff. \nBy the end of the week, he had passed all tests and was removed from the injury report, setting up his strong return Saturday -- a timely boost as Texas notched its second top-10 win and stayed firmly in the SEC title hunt.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Memphis Grizzlies suspended Ja Morant one game for conduct detrimental to the team. The looming absence comes after Morant challenged coach Tuomas Iliaso's leadership in an exchange after Friday's 117-112 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Morant also made pointed postgame comments about the Grizzlies' coaching staff in the wake of the defeat in NBA Cup group stage action.Morant will miss Sunday's game against the Toronto Raptors as a result, and the suspension will cost him $272,042 -- 1/145 of his more than $39 million salary.Much of the focus coming out of the loss was on Morant's rough performance. The All-Star guard finished the game with eight points and seven assists in 31 minutes. He went just 3-of-14 from the field and was a complete non-factor down the stretch.After the game, Morant was asked about his performance and what could've gone better for him. He told reporters multiple times to \"go ask the coaching staff.\" When asked how the Grizzlies could've gotten a different outcome, Morant said \"according to them, probably don't play me, honestly. That's what basically the message was. It's cool.\" \nThere has never been a less convincing delivery of \"it's cool\" in history than Morant gives here, as he is clearly extremely frustrated with the coaches. It wasn't just that Morant had a rough shooting night, it was the lack of effort from a player known for bringing energy to the floor that was most concerning for Grizzlies fans. It was noticeable enough that Blake Griffin called it out on the Amazon postgame show. \nThe Grizzlies fired Taylor Jenkins as coach at the end of last season, turning things over to Iisalo, which was notable after Jenkins shifted to an offensive scheme early last season that went away from Morant's preferred style. After trading Desmond Bane this summer, it seemed like they were once again going to put the focus again on Morant as the offensive engine, but that's clearly not going according to plan for any of the parties involved. \nAt 3-3, it's not been a disastrous start to the season, but the Grizzlies' three wins have all come against some of the league's worst teams early -- the Phoenix Suns, Indiana Pacers and New Orleans Pelicans. Against playoff caliber teams, they've been outclassed and if Iisalo and the staff were trying to set the tone by being hard on their star player, it doesn't seem to be well received by Morant, who seems to feel isolated and unwanted at the moment. That's not a great place to be as a new coaching staff, and Morant's comments Friday night will undoubtedly catch the attention of teams around the league who will be monitoring whether those frustrations fade or build. \n            ",

    "body": "\nWith the possible exception of the very early weeks of the season, when Celtic and Rangers meet, it is usual for one of them to be hovering somewhere close to crisis. It is simply the nature of Scottish football, the overwhelming strength and remorseless antipathy of the Glasgow sides. When one is down, the other is presumably up.Not this season, however. For the first time in a generation, there seems to be a real prospect that someone other than the Old Firm might win the title. Hearts' 3-0 win over Celtic on Sunday gave them a six-point lead at the top of the Premiership with 10 games played and set the reigning champions in freefall. There is a chance the title might shift out of Glasgow and it has been a very long time since that has been the case, let alone since another team won it, Sir Alex Ferguson's Aberdeen in 1985. The last time Hearts were Scottish champions in 1960, a little-known Liverpool five-piece had just named themselves the Silver Beetles.Celtic and Rangers might occupy second and third but both already bear the scars of 2025-26. The former go to Hampden Park without a manager, Brendan Rodgers resigning in incendiary fashion after the Hearts defeat. Long-bubbling tension with ownership boiled over as major shareholder Dermot Desmond accused the outgoing manager of \"divisive, misleading, and self-serving\" statements and actions that contributed to a toxic atmosphere at Celtic Park. That has only partially been eased by the interim return of the enormously successful Martin O'Neill, winner of three league titles in his past tenure.In a way, Celtic are merely playing catch-up with Rangers on the tumult stakes. Their manager, Russell Martin was sacked on October 5, four months into a three-year contract. It took more than a fortnight of setbacks and near misses before former Sheffield Wednesday boss Danny Rohl was appointed. Since then, results have improved domestically, a 1-0 win at Hibernian moving Rangers up to third in the Premiership even as they remain rooted to the bottom of the table in the Europa League league phase.There is, of course, a long way to go in the title race but amid their travails, this semifinal of the Scottish League Cup looks like an opportunity. This trophy is the most recent major honor that Rangers lifted in 2024 and no team has won it more frequently. It could be an ideal early Christmas present for their supporters, though much the same is true at Celtic. Given that both clubs could well by then have new managers keen on ingratiating themselves, a win in the 448th Old Firm derby is as vital as ever.Viewing informationDate: Sunday, Nov. 2 | Time: 10 a.m. ETLocation: Hampden Park -- Glasgow, United KingdomTV: CBS Sports NetworkOdds: Celtic -133; Draw +280; Rangers +290Possible lineupsCeltic XI: Kasper Schmeichel; Anthony Ralston, Auston Trusty, Liam Scales, Kieran Tierney; Benjamin Nygren, Callum McGregor, Arne Engels; Daizen Maeda, Johnny Kenny, Sebastian Tounekti.Rangers XI: Jack Butland; Nasser Djiga, John Souttar, Derek Cornelius; James Tavernier, Mohamed Diomande, Nicolas Raskin, Jayden Meghoma; Danilo, Youssef Chermiti, Djeidi Gassama.PredictionThe bookmakers would have you believe that Celtic are quite strong favorites for this game on neutral turf but it is rarely so clear cut when these two meet.

Despite those large NFL spreads, not every home favorite is giving a touchdown or more.

He is backing Indianapolis (-3.5) to cover at Pittsburgh on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.\"Aaron Rodgers is not quite past his sell-by date, but his receivers aren't making enough difficult catches, too reliant upon DK Metcalf (especially if TE Pat Freiermuth is out). It was the defense, however, that alarmed vs. the Packers, as Sunday night became target practice for Jordan Love. Meanwhile the Colts are doing everything right in their 7-1 break from the gate, with Jonathan Taylor supplying the thunder on the ground and Daniel Jones the lightning thru the air.\" See all of Marshall's NFL picks at SportsLine.\nHow to make Week 9 NFL against the spread picksSportsLine's team of experts also includes R.J.

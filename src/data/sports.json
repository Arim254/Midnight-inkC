Bet it at bet365 here:\nUnder 56.5 in Clemson vs. Florida StateClemson and Florida State have combined to win 13 of the last 14 ACC titles, but they are simply fighting for bowl eligibility this season. The Tigers are 3-5 entering Saturday's matchup, while the Seminoles are 4-4 through their first eight games. Florida State was held to 13 points at Stanford two games ago, and it finished with 22 points against Miami in early October. Clemson failed to surpass 24 points in losses to SMU, Syracuse, Georgia Tech and LSU, so the model has the Under cashing in 61% of simulations. Bet Florida State vs. Clemson at bet365 here:  Navy +28 vs. Notre DameNavy rattled off seven consecutive wins to open the season prior to its 31-17 loss at North Texas last Saturday, and its offense features a better passing attack than normal campaigns.

Alabama has won three of its last five games by seven points or fewer, including its most recent outing at South Carolina.

The difference for me is the spot. The Hoosiers were coming off a big win over Illinois and in a letdown spot the following week at Iowa. Oregon is coming off a bye after a lackluster win over Wisconsin and should be better prepared to avoid the upset,\" SportsLine college football handicapper Thomas Casale said. \"And remember, Indiana was -9.5 in that matchup, while the Ducks are laying less than a touchdown. I expect a razor focused Oregon team on Saturday after a sloppy effort against Wisconsin at home before the bye. Look for Oregon to pull away and cover the six points.\" Back Oregon at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Missouri +7 vs. Texas A&M (-115)\"Matt Zollers is a four-star prospect ranked 72nd nationally and 8th among quarterbacks in the 2025 class. In an emergency backup role against Vanderbilt, he completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and 1 touchdown against a top-10 defense,\" SportsLine college football expert Jeff Hochman said. \"Missouri relies heavily on Ahmad Hardy's rushing attack, averaging 244.9 yards per game, with Hardy providing over 50% of their offense. Zollers should focus on 15-20 short/intermediate passes rather than 30+. The Aggies defeated Missouri 41-10 last season and should be motivated at a sold-out Faurot Field. Both teams are coming off extended rest. The bye is not ideal for undefeated teams in November as the pressure mounts. SEC home teams are 51-33 against the spread this season.\" Back Missouri at BetMGM Sportsbook now:LSU +10.5 vs. Alabama (-110)Brian Kelly was fired after a blowout loss to Texas A&M and now long-time SEC assistant Frank Wilson takes over as the interim head coach. When LSU last turned to an interim head coach during the regular season in 2016, Ed Orgeron led the Tigers on a 6-2 run and LSU could get a similar bounce with a well-liked assistant taking the reins here too. LSU has covered the spread in three of its last four trips to Tuscaloosa and the model predicts that the Tigers cover in 59% of simulations. Back LSU at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant Week 10 NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Saturday.

LSU takes the field on Saturday for the first time since Brian Kelly was fired, and while much of the speculation around the program surrounds who will be the next head coach, the Tigers still have a season to worry about. They'll travel to No. 4 Alabama in Tuscaloosa.The SportsLine model is projecting LSU to hang with Alabama and cover as a 10.5-point underdog as one of its Saturday best bets at FanDuel Sportsbook. Many teams rally following a coach's firing, and LSU still has some of the best talent in the nation, leading the model to value the Tigers getting more than a touchdown. The model's Saturday best bets at FanDuel also include backing Iowa State as a 7.5-point underdog against TCU, along with Over 48.5 total points scored for Texas A&M vs. Missouri.

Texas A&M is coming off a 49-point performance in its victory over Brian Kelly in his final game as LSU head coach, and it was its fifth 40-point performance in an 8-0 start to the season to climb to No. 3 in the nation. Missouri has a capable offense of its own, averaging 31.7 ppg this season, while ranking 16th in scoring defense at 18.3 ppg this season. Missouri hasn't faced a top 10 scoring offense this season, though, so this will be a daunting challenge for the unit against Marcel Reed quarterbacking the Aggies' offense. The model projects the Over to hit in 63% of simulations. Back the Over at FanDuel Sportsbook:Iowa State +7.5 vs. TCU (-118)Iowa State's season has been a tale of two streaks, opening the year with a five-game winning streak before going on its current four-game losing skid to fall to 5-4 on the season. The Cyclones reached as high as No. 12 in the nation, and they still have the talent that opened at 5-0 with wins over teams including Kansas State, Iowa and Arizona. Junior quarterback Rocco Becht has thrown for 2,119 yards this season, but his seven interceptions, including at least one over each of the last three weeks, have gotten him in trouble. But if he can eliminate the turnovers, Iowa State can cover this number against a TCU that does enter off back-to-back victories, but neither of those wins came by more than six points. The model projects Iowa State to cover in 58% of simulations. Back Iowa State at FanDuel Sportsbook:LSU +10.5 vs. Alabama (-110)LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier was in the Heisman Trophy conversation earlier in the season for the Tigers. Now, he's fighting to maintain his starting job. Interim coach Frank Wilson said Nussmeier will start, but he also said backup Michael Van Buren Jr. has seen more time in practice, and that could lead to a role in the game. Sometimes there's nothing like legitimate competition to bring the best out of top athletes, and the model expects LSU offensive success regardless on Saturday. If Nussmeier gets off to a fast start, he could keep the sophomore at bay for at least the week, and he'll certainly be motivated to do that. The model projects LSU to cover in 59% of simulations. Back LSU at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more Saturday picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Saturday.

    "body": "\nWith the first College Football Playoff rankings of the 2025 season having been released earlier this week, the race to determine the 12 teams who will compete for the national championship is really starting to materialize. Games are especially amplified in November as a single loss could boot a team out of the CFP race or prevent them from making a conference championship game. Week 11 has quite a few matchups on the docket that will go a long way in determining which teams make the 12-team field.Arguably the biggest game of the Week 11 slate is the game of the year in the Big 12 when undefeated BYU takes on a one-loss Texas Tech squad that many have pegged as the favorite in the conference. The Red Raiders can't afford another loss, while the Cougars may not have the style points to handle a loss like this. Texas Tech is a sizable 10.5-point favorite at home for this matchup.Other notable Week 11 games with playoff implications include Oregon visiting Iowa, Missouri hosting Texas A&M and Navy taking on Notre Dame. All six of those teams have two or fewer losses, with the Aggies being undefeated entering the weekend, and every team mentioned has a path to the playoff within reach.While Saturdays are synonymous with college football, this Saturday also features an eight-game NBA slate and a whopping 13 NHL games on the schedule, giving sports fans plenty of viewing choices to kick off the weekend. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on at the top sportsbooks on Saturday, Nov. 8. All times Eastern. CFB best bets today, where to watchNo. 7 BYU at No. 8 Texas TechTime: 12 p.m. | Location: Lubbock, Texas | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 52.5 | Expert: Texas +10.5 (Mike Tierney)\nIt's rare to see an undefeated team ranked in the top 10 enter any game as a double-digit underdog, but that's the reality for BYU, which heads to Lubbock for a massive clash with Texas Tech to kick things off on Saturday. These teams have had very different 2025 campaigns so far, with the Red Raiders blowing out every opponent besides Arizona State, which was the team's lone loss. The Cougars haven't lost, but three of their five conference wins have come by one score, and the other two were by two scores, so the \"style points,\" if you will, haven't been there for BYU. Combine all that with the game being at Texas Tech and you have BYU as a sizable underdog in this critical November clash. The model expects this one to be high scoring, with Over 52.5 hitting in over 60% of simulations. And SportsLine expert Mike Tierney thinks BYU will at the very least cover the spread, which is something the Cougars have done very well this season. \"The Cougars are as feisty as their QB (Bear Bachmeier), with seven covers in their last eight outings as underdogs,\" Tierney says. \"Their defense can curtail Tech's big-play potential and keep the margin in single figures.\"\nNo. 6 Oregon at IowaTime: 3:30 p.m. | Location: Iowa City | TV: CBS and Paramount + | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Oregon -6.5 | Expert: Oregon -6 (Thomas Casale)\nThe Hawkeyes have flown under the radar this season, with their two losses coming to rival Iowa State (16-13) and No. 2 Indiana (20-15). Iowa has scored 34 or more in five of its other six games, which isn't something we're used to saying for Kirk Ferentz-led teams. The Hawkeyes have a massive opportunity in Week 11 with No. 6 Oregon coming to town. Iowa has just those two losses so far, so a win here and winning out the rest of the way could get the Hawkeyes into the playoff. As for Oregon, this is the first of a tough four-game November schedule, with ranked clashes against USC and rival Washington still on the docket. The Ducks have plenty of firepower and talent, but their best win so far has been over a Penn State team that wound up firing its head coach. This is arguably the team's toughest test to date outside of the loss to Indiana at home. The model likes the Ducks to win and cover against the unranked home side, and SportsLine expert Thomas Casale agrees, noting this should be a get-right spot for Oregon. \"I expect a razor focused Oregon team on Saturday after a sloppy effort against Wisconsin at home before the bye,\" Casale says. \"Look for Oregon to pull away and cover the six points.\"More CFB best bets:Thomas Casale's Week 11 spots to targetBruce Marshall's Week 11 spread tips and trendsBrandon Gustafson's five Week 11 upset bidsNBA best bets today, where to watchSuns at Clippers Time: 10:30 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Los Angeles -5.5 | Expert: Under 227 (Bruce Marshall)\nTwo Western Conference foes looking to get rolling in the early stages of the season meet in L.A. Saturday night when the Clippers play host to the Suns in these teams' second meeting in three days. Phoenix enters the contest at 4-5 on the year after beating Los Angeles 115-102 on Thursday. The Clippers are 3-5 and have lost three games in a row. This is an interesting year for both teams as the Suns traded Kevin Durant to Houston this offseason, making Devin Booker the clear go-to guy for the franchise while also adding Jalen Green and Dillon Brooks. The Clippers have a similar roster to previous seasons with Kawhi Leonard and James Harden leading the charge, and they're hoping to get out of the first round of the postseason for the first time since 2020-21. The model likes the Clippers to win and cover the 5.5-point spread, as L.A. covers in nearly 70% of model simulations. SportsLine's Bruce Marshall, who's 4-1 over his last five NBA picks, has two picks for this game, including Under 227. \"Neither offense, however, seems to be going full guns at the moment, and this total is being posted roughly the same as Thursday night when the teams stayed comfortably under in the desert,\" Marshall said. Looking ahead: Steelers vs. ChargersTime: 8:20 p.m., Sunday | Location: Los Angeles | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Pittsburgh +2.5 | Expert: Los Angeles -2.5 (R.J. White)\nTwo playoff contenders meet in prime time on Sunday Night Football in Week 10 as the Chargers host the Steelers. Pittsburgh is now 5-3 after snapping a two-game losing streak, and the team did so in great fashion by beating the Colts 27-20, handing Indy just its second loss of the year. The Steelers control the AFC North and need to keep stacking wins as the Ravens are getting healthier and have won two in a row. The Chargers are 6-3 after a 3-0 start, but the offensive line has been an issue due to injuries, same with the running back room. Justin Herbert has had to shoulder the load and has already tossed eight interceptions after throwing three and seven, respectively, over the last two seasons. The model likes the Steelers to at the very least cover the spread, as that occurs in over 50% of simulations. R.J. White, however, is going the other route, backing the Chargers to both win outright and cover on their end. \"While the Steelers' pass rush could be an issue, I'm not sure they'll be able to cover all the weapons Herbert has at his disposal,\" White said. \"I'm more intrigued by the matchup on the other side, where the Chargers defense has looked excellent the last two weeks against the Vikings and Titans.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two sets of division leaders clash to headline the NFL Week 10 schedule. On Sunday, the AFC East-leading New England Patriots, led by quarterback Drake Maye, battle the NFC South-leading Tampa Bay Buccaneers and quarterback Baker Mayfield. On 'Monday Night Football,' Jalen Hurts leads the Philadelphia Eagles into Lambeau Field to face Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers. Both Tampa Bay and Green Bay enter as 1.5-point favorites. Another matchup involving contenders sees the Los Angeles Rams (6-2) traveling to San Francisco to face the 49ers (6-3) in a key NFC West matchup. Mac Jones will remain the starter for the Niners this week in place of Brock Purdy (toe), who is questionable to be active as the backup.The Rams are 5-point favorites as Matthew Stafford looks to avenge a 26-23 overtime loss to San Francisco on Oct. 2. He has won three of his last four starts against the 49ers. The largest remaining spread on the odds board is Buffalo -9.5 vs. Miami. The game with the most line movement has been Jets vs. Browns, with Cleveland moving from a 2.5-point underdog to a 1.5-point favorite after New York unloaded Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams in separate trades before the trade deadline. Before making any Week 10 NFL picks or NFL score predictions on those games or others, you need to see the NFL against the spread, over/under and money line predictions powered by the self-learning SportsLine AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game.

Josh Allen leads the Buffalo offense, completing 70.4% of his passes for 1,833 yards and 13 touchdowns with four interceptions. He has also rushed 55 times for 280 yards (5.1 average) and seven touchdowns, including two in the 28-21 Week 9 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Running back James Cook (ankle) has been cleared to play, further boosting Buffalo's chances. Miami has struggled of late, losing four of their last five games, including a 28-6 loss to the Baltimore Ravens on 'Thursday Night Football' on Oct. 30. In the aftermath of the game, the Dolphins parted ways with longtime general manager Chris Grier. Even with James Cook (ankle) missing practice on Wednesday, SportsLine AI rates the Bills as an A+ pick on the money line and also predicts a 36-22 win on average. See its other Week 10 football predictions and football picks at SportsLine, and bet the Bills here:How to make Week 10 NFL picksIn addition, the AI PickBot has generated well over 20 highly-coveted A+ picks for Week 10.

    "body": "\n        Tulane's back in contention for the Group of Five's College Football Playoff bid this season following Friday night's win at Memphis, a result that once again shakes up the title picture in the American. The Green Wave (7-2, 4-1) were able to thwart the Tigers' comeback bid in the fourth quarter behind 332 yards passing and three touchdowns from Jake Retzlaff.No Group of Five team was ranked in Tuesday's initial College Football Playoff Rankings from the selection committee; however, Memphis (8-2, 4-2) was ahead of the rest of others in the picture and would've been placed at No. 12 in the bracket.Entering Saturday's games, one-loss teams within conference play inside the American include North Texas (8-1), Navy (7-1), USF (7-1), Tulane and East Carolina (5-3). Assuming tiebreaker scenarios in the American come into play in a few weeks, the conference first looks at where one of the tied teams was ranked in the latest playoff rankings. If that team doesn't lose in the final weekend of regular-season conference play, it will be declared a championship title game participant. Following USF's win over UTSA on Thursday night, Alex Golesh and the Bulls essentially play a playoff elimination game next weekend at Navy. On the heels of three straight wins, North Texas is in great shape right now with an open date this weekend and clinches a berth in the American Championship by winning out against UAB, Rice and Temple.\nEast Carolina has a head-to-head loss to Tulane, which pushes the Pirates back in the mix. They host Charlotte on Saturday before closing out the season against Memphis, UTSA and FAU in conference play.\n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Texas returns to College Football Playoff contention, Miami's hopes fading down stretch\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe most likely conference championship game pairing in the American following Tulane's win over Memphis is North Texas against USF at Dec. 5 if both of those teams win out given where we expect the selection committee to rank both squads.Tulane has a chance, too, after ending Memphis' 11-game home winning streak.\"I'm so proud of our guys for their resiliency,\" said Tulane coach Jon Sumrall. \"It was so cool to see how our guys responded (after last week's loss at Texas-San Antonio). Bad things are going to happen sometimes. You just have to keep showing up.\"\nTheoretically, we could see a three-team tie in first place with North Texas, USF and Tulane assuming East Carolina fails to win out and USF beats Navy on Nov. 15.If that happens, North Texas would be guaranteed one of the title game spots since the Mean Green beat the Bulls head-to-head and the other would be determined by the selection committee's penultimate poll on Dec. 2 based on where USF and Tulane is ranked.James Madison, San Diego State's opportunitiesWhile there was no data provided on one-loss James Madison and San Diego State from the selection committee earlier this week, those are potential conference champions from the Sun Belt and Mountain West who could be ranked higher than the winner in the American a few weeks from now.\nJMU (7-1, 5-0) has won six straight entering Saturday's bout with Marshall, and its only loss this season came against Louisville, who the selection committee slotted as the ACC's second-best team behind Virginia in its first rankings.The Aztecs (7-1, 4-0) are flying under the radar in the Mountain West with an unblemished conference mark, their lone setback happening back on Sept. 6 at Washington State. San Diego State takes on Hawaii in Week 11, before playing Boise State and New Mexico down the stretch, three six-win teams that will beef up this team's resume if they're able to win out.There's no guarantee the winner of the American gets the Group of Five's playoff bid given the hot streaks for JMU and San Diego State. Following Saturday's games, the selection committee should provide considerably more transparency this week on who they believe is the Group of Five's frontrunner with a few games to play.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Chiefs and Cowboys are among the most popular franchises in the NFL, and they both also happen to be on a bye in Week 10. That creates some Fantasy football lineup challenges as well with Patrick Mahomes, George Pickens and Travis Kelce -- all among the leaders in Fantasy points at their respective positions -- out of the mix this week. Fantasy players did get some positive news on Friday, however, as James Cook (ankle) and Puka Nacua (rib) both didn't get injury designations, meaning both are good to go this week. There are also some big names coming off a bye who can be returned to lineups such as Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, Breece Hall -- who remained with the Jets despite trade rumors -- and Emeka Egbuka. Where should all those players factor in the Week 10 Fantasy football rankings? Before making your Week 10 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 10 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 10 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 10 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 10 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 10: The model is fading Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs, a four-time Pro Bowler who ranks as the WR14 over the last six weeks. Despite that, he may not warrant a spot in Week 10 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in WR rankings. Diggs has salvaged his Fantasy value over the last two weeks with a touchdown in each game, but he had only 52 total yards and three catches in each. Over his last four games, the veteran is averaging just 37.3 receiving yards, and for the season, Diggs has only two games with at least 70 yards.The Patriots are seeing their younger receivers, namely Pop Douglas and Kayshon Boutte, emerge as each player has more touchdown catches than Diggs' pair on the season. Additionally, Diggs doesn't have the best Week 10 matchup versus Tampa, which has done a good job at keeping receivers out of the endzone. Over the last 14 touchdowns scored against the Bucs, just three of them have come via wideouts, as Diggs is a player to fade this week.Another curveball: The model is high on Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart, who is being started in fewer than half of Fantasy leagues. The rookie has rushing touchdowns in each of his last four games and also has a 7:1 TD:INT over that stretch. Dart's legs are one of his biggest Fantasy assets as only Jayden Daniels is averaging more rushing yards per start, amongst quarterbacks, and only Josh Allen has more rushing touchdowns at the position.On Sunday, he gets to face one of the most Fantasy-friendly defenses to running quarterbacks as just six teams allow more rushing yards per game to QBs than the Bears. Chicago was also shredded thru the air by Joe Flacco on Sunday, to the tune of 470 passing yards and four touchdowns. With Chicago having the No. 29 scoring defense and ranking 25th versus the pass, Dart finds himself in the top 10 of positional rankings.

    "body": "\n        Familiar matchups abound on the NFL Week 10 schedule as there are half a dozen divisional games you can make Week 10 NFL picks on. The highlight of that slate is Rams vs. 49ers, which has L.A. as the 4.5-point road favorite, per the latest NFL odds. The Niners won, 26-23, when the two met in early October, but the Rams had won the three prior matchups. This is one of five games with a Week 10 NFL spread that favors the road team, with the Browns flipped from road underdogs to favorites (-1.5) against the Jets after New York traded away star defenders Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams before the trade deadline on Tuesday.Other divisional contests include Bills vs. Dolphins (+9.5), Saints vs. Panthers (-5.5) and Texans vs. Jaguars (-1), with the Jags now favored with C.J. Stroud (concussion) ruled out for Houston. The non-divisional slate is highlighted by Steelers vs. Chargers (-2.5) on Sunday night and Eagles vs. Packers (-1.5) on Monday night. All of the updated Week 10 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 10 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Head here to see every pick. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:Top Week 10 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 10 NFL picks is that the Bucs (-2.5, 48) cover at home versus the Patriots in a Sunday 1 p.m. ET kickoff. New England extended its win streak to six games on Sunday versus Atlanta, but the Pats failed to cover for the first time during the streak. Meanwhile, the Bucs covered their last time out and have the rest advantage in coming off a Week 9 bye. That advantage for Tampa -- and disadvantage for New England -- can't be overlooked as the Pats are 4-12-1 ATS over their last 17 with a rest disadvantage, which dates back to the Tom Brady era.With that ATS loss to the Falcons, New England is only 3-9-1 ATS versus NFC opponents since 2023. On the field, the Patriots have the NFL's worst redzone defense this season, and Drake Maye has been sloppy with the ball as of late. He has three fumbles (one lost) and two interceptions over his last two games, which Tampa can capitalize on as it boasts the fourth-best turnover differential (+7) in the league. With the model projecting the Bucs to win the turnover battle on Sunday, and racking up twice as many defensive sacks, Tampa prevails versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 10 NFL predictions: 49ers (+5, 49.5) cover versus the Rams in well over 50% of simulations. San Francisco is 8-4 versus the spread over these teams last dozen meetings, including outright winning as 8.5-point underdogs in Week 5. The Niners are coming off a double-digit road victory over the Giants with Mac Jones under center. Jones will get another start on Sunday, though Brock Purdy (toe) could be active. It hasn't mattered a ton who is at quarterback for the team as long as Christian McCaffrey is at running back. He set an NFL record on Sunday with his 16th game with both a rushing and receiving touchdown as he leads the NFL with 1,222 yards from scrimmage.Los Angeles has only truly been tested in a road environment just once this season, and it lost at Philadelphia. The team's other true road games include facing the Ravens without Lamar Jackson, and facing the lowly Titans. While L.A. has impressive metrics on both sides of the ball, one can't overlook its subpar special teams. The Rams are last in field goal percentage, third-worst in extra point percentage and just seven teams give up more yards per punt return. With San Fran having the edge on the margins, it covers, and the model also says the Under hits well over 60% of the time in an A-rated total pick. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 10 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 10 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that cover in 60% of simulations or more, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 10 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        The Detroit Lions were the No. 1 seed in the NFC last season, but their season immediately ended in their first postseason game with a 45-31 upset loss against the Washington Commanders. The Lions meet the Commanders in Week 10 for the highly anticipated rematch, although some of the matchup's juice has diminished following Jayden Daniels' gruesome elbow injury last week. However, the Lions' motivation should remain unchanged, and with revenge playing a role on Sunday, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model expects a strong offensive performance from Detroit. It has Jared Goff Over 247.5 passing yards as one of its top picks for Week 10 NFL prop betting. Along with Goff, the model is also backing a pair of Unders in Browns running back Quinshon Judkins Under 86.5 rushing yards and Cardinals tight end Trey McBride Under 65.5 receiving yards in its best bets for Week 10 NFL player props. Goff threw for 313 yards against the Commanders in that postseason game, adding to the reasons to play his Over for NFL betting for Week 10 NFL player prop bets. Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach Week 10 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, SportsLine's Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 10 NFL picks at various sportsbooks.

The Detroit quarterback is having another strong season with 17 touchdowns compared to three interceptions, and he's going up against one of the worst defenses in the NFL. Washington is 28th in yards allowed (377.8 per game), including 29th in passing yards allowed (253.6). The Commanders are last in yards per attempt (8.9), and Goff threw for 313 yards against Washington in the playoffs last season. With revenge in mind, the model projects a strong offensive performance by Detroit, led by Goff's arm. The model projects 278 passing yards for Goff on Sunday.Click here to bet Goff Over 247.5 passing yards at FanDuel, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins.Quinshon Judkins, Browns, Under 85.5 rushing yards (-114)The Browns play the Jets, who gutted their defense at the NFL trade deadline with high-profile trades in sending star cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Colts and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams to the Cowboys. This significantly hinders New York's defense, but the model views Judkins' over/under of 85.5 rushing yards as too much of an overreaction to the moves. He's gone Over this total just twice in his seven games this season, and hasn't gone Over it in any of his last three contests. The Jets already had one of the worst rush defenses in the NFL before trading away two key defensive pieces, ranking 26th by allowing 135.8 rushing yards per game, but they held the opposing team's RB1 below this number in three straight weeks. The model projects Judkins to rush for 60 yards on Sunday. Click here to bet Judkins Under 85.5 rushing yards at DraftKings, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free:Trey McBride, Cardinals, Under 65.5 receiving yards (-115)The Arizona tight end has performed better in Jacoby Brissett's three starts than he did with Kyler Murray, and Brissett remains under center on Sunday. McBride is averaging 67 yards over his three games, just barely going Over this total, but Sunday could be a tougher matchup against the divisional rival Seattle Seahawks than he's faced in recent weeks. The Seahawks are 11th in total yards allowed (303.9 per game), and Seattle is allowing 63.8 yards per game to opposing tight ends. McBride was heavily involved the last time Arizona played Seattle with seven receptions, but totaled just 52 yards in Week 4. The model projects 51 yards for McBride on Sunday. Click here to bet McBride Under 65.5 receiving yards at BetMGM, where new users receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses. Want more Week 10 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some popular NFL player props for Week 10.

    "body": "\n        The Lone Star State will take center stage for many with Week 11 college football picks as the two ranked matchups on the slate involving Texas teams. There's Texas Tech vs. BYU in the Big 12, which has the ninth-ranked Red Raiders favored by 11.5 points over the No. 8 Cougars, per the latest college football odds. Then over in the SEC, Texas A&M vs. Missouri sees the No. 3 Aggies as 7-point favorites over 19th-ranked Mizzou. BYU and Texas A&M are two of the last four undefeated teams entering Week 11. There are, however, several other intriguing matchups to place Week 11 college football bets on, including a pair of interim head coaches taking on some tough challenges. No. 4 Alabama vs. LSU (+10.5) is a classic rivalry as the Tigers play their first game in the post-Brian Kelly era. Auburn also moved on from its coach, Hugh Freeze, and it is a 6.5-point underdog to No. 15 Vanderbilt. Before locking in any Week 11 college football picks on those games or others, be sure to see the latest Week 11 college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times and has returned over $2,200 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated college basketball picks over the past three seasons.

OSU's 12-game win streak is the longest in the nation, and the defense has been utterly dominant in 2025. The Buckeyes' 6.9 points allowed are the fewest by any Big Ten team through the first eight games of a season in the last 40 years. Meanwhile, Purdue ranks 109th (out of 136 FBS teams) in scoring, as the Boilermakers have lost seven straight games. With Ryan Day boasting a 53-1 record versus unranked opponents -- including a +32.6 margin of victory -- the model has Ohio State covering well over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Clemson (-1.5, 56.5) covers versus Florida State in a 7 p.m. ET Saturday kickoff well over 50% of the time. The season hasn't gone according to plan for either team, but the Tigers are 2-2 ATS over their last four, while FSU is just 1-4 ATS over its last five. The Clemson defense has the ability to make Florida State one dimensional, as the Tigers have kept three of their last four opponents to 85 or fewer rushing yards. That could be a major issue for the Seminoles, especially considering QB Thomas Castellanos' road struggles. His team has outright lost in each of his last five away starts, and he has just a lone touchdown pass, versus two picks, on the road this year. The Under is projected to hit almost 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 11The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 11, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a Big Ten underdog outright winning. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which Big Ten favorite goes down?

    "body": "\n        Daily Fantasy players struggled to find much offense on Thursday night, but the Week 10 NFL schedule continues with 10 more games on Sunday afternoon, providing a much larger NFL DFS player pool. Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson and Jared Goff are some of the top quarterbacks to consider for NFL DFS picks, while Derrick Henry, Amon-Ra St. Brown and George Kittle are some of the big names at the skill positions to build around. Who are the top NFL DFS picks for Week 10, and which daily Fantasy football sleepers can give your roster a huge edge? Before locking in any NFL DFS picks on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once.

You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Week 10Part of McClure's NFL DFS strategy is rostering 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey at $9,700 on FanDuel and $9,000 on DraftKings. He continues to be one of the premier pass-catching backs in the NFL, but he's really hit his stride as a runner recently, recording a pair of 100-yard games on the ground in his past three outings. He draws a tough matchup against the Rams, but his price is down a bit on DraftKings compared to last week, making this a value spot. McCaffrey had 139 yards a score against the Rams back in Week 4. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Bucs receiver Tez Johnson, who is $4,500 on DraftKings and $5,800 on FanDuel. Often overlooked in a crowded receiver room, Johnson has had to step up with Chris Godwin (fibula) out. He's been a bigger part of the offense the past two weeks, combining for nine catches, 101 yards and a score. The Patriots have been below average in Fantasy defense against receivers. This game also has an over/under of 48, one of the highest totals on the board in Week 10. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Week 10McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        No. 3 Texas A&M will seek to protect its undefeated record and inch closer to an SEC championship on Saturday when it hits the road to face No. 22 Missouri. It is the third consecutive game away from home for the Aggies, who already boast two road victories over ranked opponents.Missouri, meanwhile, remains in search of its first top-25 win. And making matters even more challenging is the absence of quarterback Beau Pribula, who is out for an undetermined period with a significant ankle injury. The Tigers will likely need to lean on their stellar defense and running game to keep their College Football Playoff hopes alive.Bet Missouri vs. Texas A&M at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass: Click here to get started:Both sides are coming off a bye week, giving their outstanding coaching staffs additional time to prepare for a vitally important showdown. The chess match between Mike Elko and Eli Drinkwitz should be among the most tantalizing coaching battles of the year in the SEC. The latter had more pressing work to do during the off week, given the tall task of preparing a true freshman quarterback for his first career start.\nTexas A&M and Missouri open the final month of the regular season with a high-stakes, top-25 clash that carries ample postseason implications. That is November college football at its finest.Texas A&M vs. Missouri: Need to knowReed for Heisman: Marcel Reed has climbed to the fourth-best odds to win the Heisman Trophy, per FanDuel, and strengthened his case with another standout performance. The Texas A&M quarterback threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more while rushing for 108 yards against LSU, boosting his profile among the nation's top contenders. Though still a modestly accurate passer, Reed is a big-play threat who punishes defenses with his arm and legs while leading an undefeated team. His résumé grows stronger each week, and he'll have a chance to add another top-25 win against the Tigers.No Beau: Missouri will play its first full game without starting quarterback Beau Pribula, who exited the Tigers' most recent contest with a gruesome ankle injury. While not expected to be season-ending, the dislocation could sideline the Penn State transfer for \"a while,\" coach Eli Drinkwitz said. True freshman Matt Zollers, a four-star 2025 recruit, is expected to start after stepping in against Vanderbilt and completing 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and a touchdown — the most meaningful action of his young career.\nTrench battle: Something has to give when Texas A&M has the ball. The Aggies' offensive line — anchored by Midseason All-American Ar'maj Reed-Adams — is among the nation's best and has allowed just 21 tackles for loss, fewest in the country by a wide margin. On the other side, Missouri's defensive front is elite at generating backfield pressure, ranking 13th nationally against the run. The Tigers are led by a disruptive edge duo in Zion Young and Damon Wilson II.Hard to stop Hardy: Only three running backs in college football average more yards per game than Missouri's Ahmad Hardy. The SEC rushing leader enters the matchup with 937 yards and 11 touchdowns in a stellar debut season and could surpass 1,000 yards this week. Texas A&M's defense, however, is stout against the run and will present one of Hardy's toughest challenges yet.Where to watch Texas A&M vs. Missouri liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 8 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ETLocation: Memorial Stadium -- Columbia, MissouriTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nTexas A&M vs. Missouri prediction, picks  \nThe 49.5-point total is tantalizing because Texas A&M games tend to shoot over -- often with plenty of room to spare. But with Missouri trotting out a true freshman quarterback to make his first career start, and with the Tigers potentially forcing Reed into mistakes with their pass rush, there is some under risk.That makes Texas A&M -7.5 the better play.The Aggies are 3-0 in road games and beat more than half of their SEC opponents by double digits, and there is a good chance they will reach a number in this game that Missouri simply cannot hit given its quarterback situation. After all, they scored at least 45 points in each of their last two games, both of which came away from Kyle Field. The potential for their dominant offensive line to neutralize Missouri's edge players makes that all the more likely.

    "body": "\n        Roughly 25% of the college basketball regular season is complete, and the amount of star power coursing through the sport is staggering. While a handful of well-known returners are thriving in familiar uniforms, much of the top-end talent has come from freshmen and transfers.The high-powered group of diaper dandies includes Duke's Cameron Boozer, North Carolina's Caleb Wilson, Louisville's Mikel Brown Jr. and BYU's AJ Dybantsa, among others. Impact transfers such as Kansas State's PJ Haggerty, Baylor's Cameron Carr, Iowa's Bennett Stirtz and Indiana's Tucker DeVries are also playing like early All-Americans.And that's before getting to USC's prolific duo of Chad Baker-Mazara and Rodney Rice — both averaging more than 20 points per game entering the week — or Louisville newcomer Ryan Conwell, who's hitting 3-pointers from everywhere. Those names represent just a fraction of the players emerging as early challengers for All-America status and other national awards.They're part of a deep group pushing established stars such as Purdue's Braden Smith and Texas Tech's JT Toppin a couple laps into the race for postseason hardware.\nWith a month of data to chew on, our writers are taking stock of the national landscape and issuing updated predictions for who will be named National Player of the Year at season's end.Cameron Boozer, DukeAs I noted on Wednesday's episode of the Eye On College Basketball Podcast, there's still a ways to go, and anything can change things, most notably unfortunate injuries. But, all of that acknowledged, through the first month of this season, Boozer is clearly the leading candidate to be the CBS Sports National Player of the Year.Whomever is in second isn't close.Boozier is now averaging 23.6 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.0 blocks for an undefeated Duke team ranked fourth in the Associated Press Top 25 poll. His national-best KenPom.com Payer of the Year rating is 2.352, which would've fallen somewhere between Duke's Cooper Flagg and Auburn's Johni Broome last season, and is 0.723 percentage points ahead of his next closest competitor (Iowa State's Joshua Jefferson, by the way) this season. So, no, let's not go ahead and start engraving any trophies quite yet. But, as long as Boozer and Duke continue to perform at this level, all NPOY trophies should ultimately be his. -- Gary Parrish\nYaxel Lendeborg, MichiganBoozer is the indisputable pick through the first five weeks of the season. Can he hold it for the next three months? Absolutely. But it wouldn't be much of a Dribble Handoff if we all had the same answer, so let me offer Lendeborg as a legitimate alternative. The one thing he has over Boozer right now: a claim as the best player on the best team. Duke is very good, but Michigan has been better. The Wolverines rank No. 1 in every predictive metric, and Lendeborg has fully delivered on his offseason reputation as perhaps the best portal addition in the country.He's averaging 16.0 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.3 assists while shooting 61.3% from the field and 39.4% from 3. And he's posting those numbers on a loaded roster while playing fewer than 28 minutes per night. It's easy to assume Boozer will hold the lead wire to wire, but there's a real chance this turns into a compelling race by the time we hit January. I like Yax's chances to be heavily in the mix. -- Matt NorlanderCameron Boozer, DukeMy preseason top-100 player rankings had Braden Smith and Cameron Boozer at No. 1 and 2 after I went back and forth on that order for days. One month into the season, I've flipped it -- and there's a real chance Boozer, not Smith nor anyone else, ends up having the best season in college basketball.\nHis growth over just the last two games is reason enough for optimism: He scored 35 and 29 in wins over ranked Arkansas and ranked Florida, grabbed a combined 15 rebounds and added five assists. He's also showing real progression as a perimeter shooter with a confidence that keeps rising.The appeal of Smith's case was always obvious: He was projected to be the best player on the best team in the sport. And that still might be true. But Boozer is Duke's system. He leads the Blue Devils in points, rebounds, assists, minutes and steals. Smith, meanwhile, is currently third on his team in scoring, his per-40 numbers look similar to last year aside from a bump in assist rate, and sharing the spotlight with star Trey Kaufman-Renn may cut into his case.That's a lot of hedging to say this plainly: I'm officially flipping my Player of the Year pick from Braden Smith to Cameron Boozer. Boozer has a chance to be the first freshman ever to lead the nation in scoring, and his 38.4 Player Efficiency Rating is pushing into the rare air usually reserved for past POYs. The only other players to finish a season with a PER above 38 since the stat's introduction in 2002 -- Zach Edey (three times) and Zion Williamson -- all went on to win the award. Boozer is tracking with the same historical markers.. -- Kyle Boone\nCameron Boozer, DukeThere are plenty of other realistic contenders for National Player of the Year, so betting on someone over Boozer could still make sense. But even with a deep field of stars chasing him, Boozer is clearly the top choice. Through nine games, he's on a Cooper Flagg–level pace after consecutive blockbuster performances against SEC opponents. As if 35 points and nine rebounds against Arkansas weren't enough, he followed that up with 29 points and six rebounds in a Tuesday night victory over reigning national champion Florida. He's both tough and skilled, gritty and smart, and his seamless adjustment to college basketball speaks to his physicality and basketball IQ. The bet here: Boozer will only continue to improve as his freshman season unfolds, collecting a smorgasbord of individual honors, including National Player of the Year. -- David Cobb\nCameron Boozer, DukeBoozer hasn't just been the best freshman in college basketball through the first month of the season -- he's been the best player overall. The only player with a legitimate chance to challenge him has appeared in just two games this season: Kansas' Darryn Peterson, who would be my pick to go No. 1 in the 2026 NBA Draft.Coming into the season, I had Boozer ranked No. 2 on my personal big board, just ahead of BYU's AJ Dybantsa. What sets him apart is his basketball IQ -- every time he touches the ball, he seems to make the right read. Against Arkansas, coach John Calipari refused to send double teams, and Boozer made them pay. He's such a tough cover thanks to his combination of size and strength.If Duke is going to reach the Final Four, Boozer will need to continue playing at his peak. If he does, he should also be the frontrunner for National Player of the Year. Based on what we've seen, he would be my pick for NPOTY if the season ended today. -- Cameron Salerno\nBraden Smith, PurdueBraden Smith was my preseason pick for National Player of the Year, but the incredible crop of newcomers has generated plenty of buzz. We should be enamored with the shiny new toys this season, but Smith has been outstanding for an undefeated Purdue team. He ranks second nationally in assists (8.9 per game) and is shooting 41% from three on 5.1 attempts per game.For me, it's a Cameron Boozer or Smith conversation in early December. To settle it, I turned to my trusty points-created stat. Smith has generated 308 points for Purdue in eight games -- that's an astounding 38.5 points per game created directly from his brilliance. Boozer sits at 304 points created in nine games. On that metric, Purdue's maestro gets my vote. -- Isaac Trotter\n            ",

UFC is closing out its 2025 calendar quickly and the final PPV event of the ESPN era goes down on Saturday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. UFC 323 is headlined by a pair of title fights in the lower weight classes. The main event sees bantamweight kind Merab Dvalishvili look to fend off his latest challenge from a familiar foe in Petr Yan.There have been more than 100 UFC champions. Not one of them has done what Dvalishvili gets the shot to do. The UFC bantamweight champion has successfully defended his title against Umnar Nurmagomedov, Sean O'Malley and Cory Sandhagen in 2025. Should Dvalishvili overcome Yan, who he previously beat in 2023, \"The Machine\" will hold a record uniquely his own. Against Yan, Dvalishvili faces a former champion finding his second wind after ripping off three straight wins.A second title fight supports UFC 323. Alexandre Pantoja is building a strong case for being the second-best flyweight champion in UFC history, behind only Mount Rushmore fighter Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. His next challenger is compelling. Joshua Van burst onto the scene, going from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years. Like Dvalishvili, he fights for the fourth time this year in pursuit of becoming a UFC champion.\n        \n            \n                UFC 324: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett, Kayla Harrison vs. Amanda Nunes to headline Paramount+ debut card\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe undercard also features some veterans looking to get back to the title level.

Plus, former two-division champ Henry Cejudo is back in what could be his final fight when he takes on top prospect Payton Talbott at bantamweight.

    "body": "\n        After a historically special 2024-25 campaign, the SEC was always primed to take a step back on the hardwood this winter, especially with 26 of the top-30 scorers vamoosing for greener pastures. To no surprise, the SEC started a bit slow, winning just five of its first 23 games against top-60 competition, per The Field of 68, but it rebounded this week with a 9-7 comeback victory in the ACC/SEC Challenge. It was not the 14-2 shellacking of its ACC brethren from a year ago, but progress in watering holes like The Plains or Norman, Oklahoma, is apparent.November proved to be an exploration month for a 16-team league, featuring so many fresh faces. So, what have we learned about each SEC club? Let's dive into some first-month grades.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Auburn (7-2)Initial KenPom rank: 31Current KenPom rank: 20You can never accuse Auburn of being unwatchable. This team is equally as fickle as fantastic. Pound for pound, this may be the SEC's most talented roster, and when the barrage of in-your-eyehole 3s are going in, the Tigers are overwhelming. Keyshawn Hall may score 22 points a night, but give up 18 on the other end. It just is what it is. 6-1 point guard Tahaad Pettiford is leading all Auburn rotation players in block rate. Because sure. Kevin Overton can give you a two-piece and then an avalanche of 29 eight days later. Elyjah Freeman will score the loudest seven points in a game that you'll ever see.Mercurial is the word that I'll keep using with this group for the time being, but overall, Steven Pearl has to feel pretty good about the direction of this club after nine games. The interior defense is not as big a red flag as initially feared, thanks to the emergence of burly freshman Sebastian Williams-Adams, who is already one of my favorite role players in the league. Losses to Michigan and Houston won't hurt. Wins over St. John's and NC State will age well on Selection Sunday. They have to clean up the decision-making and the transition defense, but Auburn is a rock-solid club that will likely steamroll teams at Neville all year. Grade: B+\n    \n                                        \n    Alabama (6-2)Initial KenPom rank: 23Current KenPom rank: 14Alabama is so annoying to play against. Nate Oats' group plays with relentless pace, and the Tide generate a barrage of open corner 3-pointers. Over 15% of Alabama's shots are those ultra-valuable corner 3s. That rates in the 97th percentile nationally, and it's fueled by All-American Labaron Philon, speedy deadeye Aden Holloway and multiple lineups that feature five shooters.\nWhen Alabama gets pelted on the boards, it's going to lose. It just is what it is. But give Oats credit. Alabama has been super banged up. Holloway, Keitenn Bristow, Jalil Bethea and Latrell Wrightsell Jr. have all missed time, and Alabama keeps grinding out victories over good teams, partially because Oats has found a real gem in freshman forward Amari Allen. The 6-8, 205-pound wing connects so many dots for these lineups and impacts winning in a ton of different ways. Grade: A-\n    \n                                        \n    Vanderbilt (9-0)Initial KenPom rank: 19Current KenPom rank: 7Vanderbilt is smoking hot. One does not eviscerate a Randy Bennett defense for 96 points. As of now, Vanderbilt -- not presumed powerhouses like Florida, Alabama, Kentucky or anyone else -- is the favorite to win this league. This team doesn't have a five-star recruit or a five-star transfer, but Mark Byington's squad has built one of the most dangerous offenses, starring a vroom-vroom transition attack, unselfish playmaking and a boatload of know-your-role, all-stars.Maybe this is a tad aggressive, but Vanderbilt reminds me a smidge of those Florida Atlantic teams under Dusty May. The Owls were great because the ball had energy and popped all over the floor to find a galore of open looks. That's what Vanderbilt is cooking with right now, too. The guard play was tremendous for FAU, and Vanderbilt has it with Tyler Tanner and Duke Miles, who are bringing it on both ends. This interior defense could be a stumbling block, but Vanderbilt makes so, so, so many teams uncomfortable with its pressure. That effort and attention to detail can cover up plenty on the back end. Grade: A+\n\n    \n                                        \n    Kentucky (5-3)Initial KenPom rank: 3Current KenPom rank: 15The vibes are miserable in Kentucky these days. The 'Cats just aren't playing winning basketball. Good teams end strong possessions defensively with rebounds. Good teams don't take this many ill-advised shots. Good teams share the ball and make the extra pass.Kentucky isn't playing with an edge or stacking enough of those winning plays together right now. Mark Pope has been frustrated with his inability to get a pulse of this roster, but I do believe there were more positives than negatives defensively in Tuesday's 67-64 loss to UNC. Defense has to be the calling card for this group because the offense is just unrecognizable right now from previous iterations of Pope-led squads. The lack of play-creation without point guard Jaland Lowe is jarring, and it's exacerbated by the fact that there are too many lineups for Kentucky with three iffy shooters on the floor together.\nThere's no magic switch. You either play better or you keep losing. Grade: F\n    \n                                        \n    Florida (5-3)Initial KenPom rank: 2Current KenPom rank: 12For the expectations internally and externally, the first month has been extremely frustrating for Florida. This may be a time to buy the dip on the Gators, even though they aren't running quite as flawless an operation as a year ago. The smash-mouth brand of basketball can unequivocally work. Florida has out-rebounded five of the six high-majors it has played. It's still dominating the paint at will and suffocating the best 3-point shooter on almost every scouting report.But this group is turning it over more (19.2%) than any other Todd Golden team. This group is also shooting it worse from 3-point range (27.4%) than any other Golden-coached club. I expect the rim dominance and rebounding to travel every night. I do not expect the 3-point shooting and turnovers to be this glaring a red flag all year. Albeit the late turnover, Boogie Fland showed encouraging signs down the stretch against Duke, and you already know Tommy Haugh is a superstar who still plays like a high-energy role player. Once Fland gets rolling next to Alex Condon, Rueben Chinyelu and Haugh, the Gators have enough pop to make serious noise.\nThe depth concerns are real, though. Xaivian Lee has to play better. Point blank. Getting contributions from one of the freshmen, namely Alex Lloyd or CJ Ingram, would be ideal. Grade: C+\n    \n                                        \n    Tennessee (7-2)Initial KenPom rank: 9Current KenPom rank: 16Tennessee has two offensive engines (Nate Ament and Ja'Kobi Gillespie) and scores of excellent big men who love to rebound and control the paint. That's a very dangerous combination, especially since you'd expect a Rick Barnes defense to get better by the day. When Ament and Gillespie are clicking at the same time, you're in hot water, and Tennessee's offensive process is mostly encouraging after the first month. The Vols have leaned into finding actions that incorporate both Ament and Gillespie at the same time to give defenses real headaches. Plus, they can throw it to JP Estrella, Jaylen Carey or DeWayne Brown on the block to punish mismatches and pound the glass against anyone who doesn't play two bigs.\nBut can a team be awesome with just one guard you have to truly worry about? Tennessee is putting that to the test right now. If one of Ament or Gillespie is off, Tennessee's offense doesn't have many other get-out-of-jail-free cards. Grade: B+\n    \n                                        \n    Georgia (8-1)Initial KenPom rank: 44Current KenPom rank: 21Somto Cyril has to be one of the scariest dudes to go up against in the country. The chiseled, 6-11, 260-pound big man ranks 14th nationally in block rate and has jackhammered 20 dunks already in nine games. He is a freak, and Georgia has two fill-it-up guards in Blue Cain and Jeremiah Wilkinson, who don't turn it over much, which allows Georgia to go hunt offensive rebounds.This roster is just so dependent on transition buckets, and I hesitate to believe that will stick against the SEC rosters that can match up with UGA's athletes up front. The point guard play on this roster is really, really unproven at the high-major ranks and could be the stumbling block against the big boys. Grade: B\n\n    \n                                        \n    LSU (8-0)Initial KenPom rank: 56Current KenPom rank: 25Point guard play matters! LSU's got a gem in Dedan Thomas, who rescued the Tigers late in regulation against Boston College with a pair of huge buckets to force overtime on Wednesday. Thomas is an organizer with God-like feel in pick-and-rolls who raises the level of everyone around him. That may explain why Marquel Sutton, Max Mackinnon and Mike Nwoko have been so productive.LSU still hasn't played a top-100 team, so it's hard to get overly enthusiastic about a potential breakthrough, but the talent level has clearly been raised here. The Tigers have to find a way to split the upcoming games against Texas Tech and SMU, easily the best two teams they face in nonconference play. Another season-ending injury for Jalen Reed is depressing, though. Grade: A-\n    \n                                        \n    Missouri (8-1)Initial KenPom rank: 28Current KenPom rank: 38I still have more questions than answers with Missouri after seven buy games surrounding a win over Minnesota and a road loss to a solid Notre Dame club. Mark Mitchell probably should stop shooting treys, but everything else is excellent. He's one of the best 4-men in the league. The Anthony Robinson Breakout is still in hibernation, but it's coming eventually. Jacob Crews still takes some crazy shots, but this time, they're going in at a 49% clip from downtown. This defense also still makes some head-scratching decisions, but the addition of Shawn Phillips Jr. has helped Missouri scare opponents away from the rim way, way more often. I still think this defense could be a top-30 unit if it quit the riverboat gambler act a few more times. Grade: B-\n\n    \n                                        \n    Arkansas (6-2)Initial KenPom rank: 29Current KenPom rank: 30When the lights are bright, this Arkansas team brings it. Losses to Michigan State on the road and Duke on a neutral are nothing to be ashamed about. Arkansas is only the 32nd-best defense in America right now, but there's a great unit in here somewhere. You saw glimpses of it in Wednesday's 89-80 win over Louisville. Arkansas held the high-powered Cardinals offense to just 1.05 points per possession. Yes, Louisville expects to make more than eight of its 37 3-point attempts, but you go through the tape, and Arkansas' size, speed and length forced a ton of tough looks. I charted eight clean attempts out of Louisville's 37 3s. Everything else was hotly contested.That type of effort can't just appear in the biggest games. If this defense can bring it nightly, Arkansas is going to be a brutal out because Darius Acuff and Meleek Thomas are hard for anybody to keep under wraps. Grade: B+\n    \n                                        \n    Texas (6-3)Initial KenPom rank: 39Current KenPom rank: 57Texas is 1-3 against high-major competition this year, and the lone victory was on a night when it drained an unsustainable 16 of 32 treys against NC State in Maui.\nThat's not super encouraging.It's a new era under Sean Miller, but you can understand some of the hesitancy from this fanbase to wrap its arms around a basketball team that has been blown out in three of the last four games at home against high-major competition. We'll see what tweaks Miller can concoct this year, but this roster may simply not have enough two-way players outside of Matas Vokietaitis and Dailyn Swain. Grade: D\n    \n                                        \n    Texas A&M (7-2)Initial KenPom rank: 35Current KenPom rank: 45Bucky McMillan, long a poker fiend, is embracing high-variance hoops. The Aggies are attempting nearly 31 3-pointers per game and shooting 38% from downtown. That's a dangerous combination, and the newfound work on the glass gives A&M a chance to compete with the big dawgs. Out-rebounding both Pitt and Florida State is the way for Texas A&M to stay afloat. But the personnel here is uninspiring at best defensively, so McMillan is leaning heavily on takeaways to combat it. No one -- not even the mad scientists at IU Indy -- is pressing more often than Texas A&M (44.6%) right now, but if you can break the press, there are open shots to be had.It's a wager McMillan is willing to make. Grade: C\n    \n                                        \n    Oklahoma (6-2)Initial KenPom rank: 58Current KenPom rank: 46As expected, Oklahoma is leaning all the way in on its fabulous guard pairing of Nijel Pack and Xzayvier Brown. Pack is back to his flamethrower ways (51% from 3-point range on 67 attempts), and Brown is a walking paint touch. Oklahoma has one of the best pick-and-roll offenses in the country right now. But any team with an inside-out big man could have a field day against this group, and there are easy targets to poke at on the perimeter, too. Grade: B-\n    \n                                        \n    Ole Miss (5-3)Initial KenPom rank: 24Current KenPom rank: 52It's already soul-searching season in Oxford. Chris Beard was fed up with the lack of effort in Tuesday's nine-point home loss to Miami that came on the heels of two frustrating, tight losses to Iowa and Utah.I tend to think a sharp coach like Beard is going to figure this out because there's enough high-major talent on this roster to find answers to the test. Veteran French guard Ilias Kamardine (I refuse to label 22-year-olds as true freshmen) is unequivocally a keeper, and the interior defense should be a strength when James Scott or Corey Chest is on the floor. But Ole Miss needs more from AJ Storr and Malik Dia immediately. Dia, specifically, played just two minutes in the second half against Miami. How will the Rebels respond against another desperate St. John's club on Saturday? Grade: D\n    \n                                        \n    Mississippi State (4-4)Initial KenPom rank: 26Current KenPom rank: 77Mississippi State has plunged in every metric after a 4-4 start that included blowout losses to Iowa State and Kansas State.Josh Hubbard is carrying an insane burden and feels all but certain to win the SEC scoring title, but Mississippi State isn't getting much from a few of its buy-low moves in free agency. It's odd to see a Chris Jans-coached team make this many scouting report errors defensively and give up this many unguarded treys (90th percentile nationally).To his credit, Jans has already tweaked the rotation dramatically, inserting freshman Jamarion Davis-Fleming into the starting lineup. The 6-10 forward rewarded that move with 11 points and five boards in Wednesday's 85-73 road win over Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets aren't good, but beggars can't be choosers at this point. Mississippi State's at-large hopes are already on life support on Dec. 4. The margin for error is slim from here on out. Grade: F\n    \n                                        \n    South Carolina (5-3)Initial KenPom rank: 86Current KenPom rank: 90Lamont Paris' best chance to win is dragging opponents into the mud and making it a halfcourt execution grinder. South Carolina currently ranks in the first percentile nationally in transition frequency. It just isn't getting much free cheese in the open floor these days. That means the vet (Meechie Johnson) and the rookie (Eli Ellis) have to be excellent against set defenses, which can be a hard life to live.You need bigs to survive in this league, and South Carolina's frontcourt is one of the least-proven units in the league. But the Gamecocks will not finish in the cellar as currently projected by most models. It's going to sucker teams into playing some nip-and-tuck grinders all year. Grade: D\n            ",

What do the numbers mean?           \nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard), and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.           What do the numbers mean?           \nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard), and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                      If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                  Ready to get off on the right foot?

    "body": "\n        It's getting down to crunch time as NFL Week 14 hits, with several crucial matchups set to shape the playoff picture. Things kick off with Thursday Night Football, where the suddenly surging Cowboys (6-5-1) visit Ford Field to take on the uneven Lions (7-5) in an NFC showdown. And on Sunday, the free-for-all for the top seed in the NFC really heats up when the Chicago Bears (9-3) visit Lambeau Field to face the Green Bay Packers (8-3-1). It's the final bye week of the season, so four teams are off (Panthers, Patriots, Giants, 49ers), but there is still some NFL line movement that is worth noting.The Kansas City Chiefs (6-6) also face a virtual must-win game as they host the Houston Texans (7-5). The lines are getting sharper as it gets deeper into the season, but there is still some NFL line movement to keep an eye on. Here, we break down the games that have seen the biggest shifts since lines first opened, with all odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first bet wins:Bengals vs. Bills (1 p.m. ET)Open: Bills -6.5, O/U 53.5Now: Bills -5.5, O/U 53.5\nThe Bengals got Joe Burrow back last week, and he threw for 261 yards and two scores in a win over Baltimore. But now he faces a Bills defense that ranks first in the NFL in passing yards allowed (163.2 per game). Cincinnati has the worst defense in the NFL, but Burrow's presence at least gives them a chance to keep it pretty close.Colts vs. Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)Open: Colts -2.5, O/U 49.5Now: Colts -1.5, O/U 47.5\nIt's expected to be a tight battle between a pair of 8-4 teams, but the Colts are looking to turn things around after starting 7-1. The Jaguars have won four of their past five, averaging 29 points per game over that span. The Colts have scored 36 total points in losses over the past two weeks but still have the best scoring offense in the NFL (29.8 per game). Steelers vs. Ravens (1 p.m. ET)Open: Ravens -6.5, O/U 47.5 Now: Ravens -6, O/U 42.5\nThe rivals are both 6-6, but the Ravens had won five in a row before Joe Burrow and the Bengals snuck up on them on Thanksgiving. Pittsburgh has lost five of its past seven, and last week's home loss against Buffalo wasn't pretty. Quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers of the Steelers (wrist) and Baltimore's Lamar Jackson (ankle) are both a little banged up, so the total has dropped considerably. Broncos vs. Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)Open: Broncos -8.5, O/U 40.5 Now: Broncos -7.5, O/U 40.5 \nDenver has won nine in a row but hasn't been scoring as much as expected. The Raiders held the Broncos to just 10 points in Week 10 but only managed a touchdown. That's why they have lost six in a row. This one shouldn't be THAT low-scoring, but the Denver defense is ruthless. It all comes down to how Bo Nix and Co. execute.Texans vs. Chiefs (8:20 p.m. ET) Open: Chiefs -4.5, O/U 43.5 Now: Chiefs -3.5, O/U 41.5 \nMost are expecting Patrick Mahomes to bring Kansas City back to life, but the Texans are coming off consecutive big victories against the Bills and Colts. They won't roll over, and the Houston defense is the league's best, allowing 265.7 yards and 16.5 points per game. The Texans are 6-3 against the spread in their past nine games, but K.C. is 4-2 ATS at home. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        When BYU walked off the field after a crushing 29-7 loss to Texas Tech in Lubbock, Texas, wide receiver Chase Roberts boldly claimed the Cougars would see the Red Raiders again. On Saturday, BYU gets its second chance in the Big 12 Championship Game. In the College Football Playoff era, every power conference team to finish the regular season 11-1 has ranked in the top 10… except for No. 11 BYU. The program is projected as the first team outside of the playoff field in the most recent rankings, passed over by at least three two-loss teams. With the blatant slight by the CFP Committee, the Cougars now have no choice but to win the Big 12 title game against a daunting and fourth-ranked Texas Tech squad. And to take advantage of their second opportunity, BYU needs to put the ball in the hands of standout freshman quarterback Bear Bachmeier. The Murrieta, California, native has become one of the breakout stars of 2025 after joining BYU over the summer. Bachmeier was thrust into a starting role after the unexpected departure of Jake Retzlaff, and has been electric. Bachmeier has thrown for 2,593 yards, rushed for 529 yards and recorded 25 total touchdowns. His 79.6 QBR is good for 12th, a spot above Alabama QB Ty Simpson. \nBYU offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick came up with a strong development plan for Bachmeier heading into the season, slowly adding more to his plate. For most of the season, that's involved leaning on a short and intermediate passing game to great success.  Only 12% of Bachmeier's targets have come from more than 20 yards downfield. A quarter of them were graded Big Time Throws by Pro Football Focus. Retzlaff, for example, was at more than 15% in 2024. Former first rounder Zach Wilson -- also coached by Roderick -- neared 17% of targets. Granted, Wilson had an otherworldly rating on those passes, but those plays are in the playbook. \n        \n            \n                How BYU kept Kalani Sitake: A visit with LaVell's widow, a donor push and a community love bomb\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTexas Tech is one of the great defenses in college football, maybe even the best. However, their greatest strengths come in the front seven. Edge rusher David Bailey, nose tackle Lee Hunter and linebacker Jacob Rodriguez are top All-America candidates. Between the speed and strength of the linebackers, the screen game has also been a no-go against the Red Raiders. \nIn the limited opportunities that Texas Tech has been gettable, the cracks have started with downfield shots. Their lone loss came against Arizona State star Sam Leavitt, an ugly 26-22 decision. Leavitt was constantly under pressure against the Red Raiders' front, but managed to buy time and create opportunities. The sophomore completed passes of 49, 45 and 33 yards, all of which led to points. Bachmeier is still a young player and is still developing the NFL-level playmaking that makes Leavitt a star. But regardless, even taking those opportunities gives the BYU offense a chance to open up. Wide receivers Parker Kingston and Chase Roberts are big-play machines. Tight end Carsen Ryan has similarly averaged over 13.5 yards per reception. Forcing Texas Tech's second level to play in coverage would also open running lanes for star running back LJ Martin, who was dealing with injuries in the first matchup. \nAnd furthermore, the final score hid just how close the initial BYU-Texas Tech was to being much more competitive. Kingston, an All-America caliber returner, had a rare muffed punt. The defense was sensational, holding Texas Tech to 3.5 yards per carry and locking down in the red zone to force five field goals. Even Bachmeier tried to make things happen, buying time and delivering multiple passes that were dropped. But in the rematch, BYU has to put its faith in the hands of its star quarterback. Granted, mistakes will happen. The freshman threw two interceptions in a come-from-behind victory against Arizona, including one to the deep outside level of the field. Rodriguez picked off Bachmeier in the loss earlier this season, which proved costly. But in a win-or-go-home spot, BYU can't worry about the downsides. They need playmaking, and Bachmeier has the talent to deliver the Cougars a shot at the College Football Playoff. \n            ",

Dallas defeated both teams that played in last year's Super Bowl, defeating the Eagles, 24-21, in Week 12 and then the Chiefs, 31-28, on Thanksgiving. The Lions were the No. 1 seed in the NFC last season, but as we've seen recently, Dallas won't be intimidated by playing a perceived top opponent. Dallas' defense has significantly improved following its trade deadline moves, which included acquiring defensive tackle Quinnen Williams from the Jets and linebacker Logan Wilson from the Bengals. The Cowboys are allowing 21.7 ppg since their bye week during a 3-0 stretch after allowing 30.8 ppg over their first nine contests. The model projects the Cowboys to cover in 50% of simulations, showing the better value is with Dallas while factoring in the possibility of a push.Over 53.5 pointsThursday Night Football has seen many lower-scoring games this season, but this isn't your typical TNF matchup. The Cowboys are the No. 2 scoring offense in the NFL at 29.3 ppg, with the Lions closely following in third at 29.2 ppg this season. Both sides feature elite, game-changing playmakers such as CeeDee Lamb, Amon-Ra St. Brown, and Jahmyr Gibbs with reliable quarterbacks in Dak Prescott and Jared Goff. St. Brown left Detroit's Thanksgiving matchup in the first quarter with an ankle injury, so that's a situation to monitor, but even without St. Brown, the Lions still scored 24 points against the Packers, who have the No. 5 scoring defense (18.8 ppg allowed) in the league. The Over is 3-1 when listed at more than 50 points in Cowboys games this season, including hitting last week against the Chiefs. The Over has also hit in four of the last five Lions games, as the model projects the Over to hit in 53% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

The Lions (7-5), who have lost three of five, have fallen two games behind Chicago in the NFC North.

Lions starting linemen Penei Sewell (shoulder), Taylor Decker (shoulder) and Graham Glasgow (knee) are all questionable as well.Kickoff from Ford Field in Detroit is set for 8:15 p.m. ET.

    "body": "\n        Yes, we're in the thick of the NFL playoff race and trying to figure out which clubs will be in or out of the postseason picture as we enter the final full month of the regular season, but it's never too early to look at some looming free agents. That's especially true in Baltimore after the Ravens came to terms on a three-year, $39.3 million contract extension with veteran tight end Mark Andrews on Wednesday evening. Andrews was in the final year of his prior deal with the franchise and was set to hit free agency this spring. This extension prevents that and secures his long-term future with the organization. However, this extension does send a cloud of uncertainty over the future of fellow tight end Isaiah Likely, who is also in the final year of his deal. Before this Andrews extension, it was logical to assume that Baltimore could let the 30-year-old explore the open market and ink Likely, 25, to an extension as the ascending top option at the position. This new pact with Andrews, however, throws a wrench into that line of thinking and begs the question of whether or not Likely is the one who could be on the outs. \nLikely has spent his entire career with Baltimore to this point after being selected in the fourth round of the 2022 NFL Draft out of Coastal Carolina, and he has proven to be an electrifying talent who still hasn't reached his full potential. Of course, given that the Ravens are projected to have roughly $58.2 million in cap space (via Spotrac) this offseason, they could look to retain Likely either with an extension or via the franchise tag. \nBut what if Likely reaches the open market? Which teams could be interested in bringing him aboard? Let's explore some intriguing landing spots. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsFirst and foremost, Kansas City will have a lot of work to do to get cap-compliant this coming offseason, as it is currently projected to be $31.1 million over the cap (via Spotrac). If we put that to the side for the moment, however, and simply look at the potential fit, this could be an exciting pairing. It remains to be seen if Travis Kelce will play beyond this current 2025 season. The future Hall of Fame tight end mulled retirement last offseason before ultimately deciding to return to action. If he decides this time around to hang it up, Likely would be a great successor. Even if Kelce decides to stick around, it wouldn't hurt to bring Likely in as the heir apparent. \nAs we've seen over the years with Kelce, the tight end position is heavily featured in Kansas City's offense. Likely's athleticism and knack as a pass-catcher would be a fascinating addition for Patrick Mahomes, potentially injecting some much-needed burst into the offense overall. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington CommandersThe Commanders are in the midst of a lost season in 2025, entering December well under .500 due to injuries to both Terry McLaurin and Jayden Daniels. Given where they are in the standings, Washington's front office is probably looking toward how it'll reconstruct this roster for 2025, and it could include getting younger at some skill positions.Similar to Kansas City, the Commanders could see their veteran tight end call it a career, with Zach Ertz only signed through 2025 and playing in his age-35 season. Daniels has shown an affinity for peppering the tight end position, so bringing in Likely would not only fit a need, but it'd bring another young pass-catching option for the 2024 first-rounder. The Commanders also have the fifth-most cap space to work with this offseason at a projected $94 million. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New England PatriotsThis would be a homecoming for Likely, who grew up in Massachusetts. New England has emerged as a legitimate Super Bowl contender in 2025 thanks to Drake Maye's ascent in Year 2, and while the Patriots have rather quickly rebuilt, they can't get complacent. Maye could still use some more weapons, and with a projected $62.1 million in available space next offseason, some of that could be used to bring in Likely. Of course, Hunter Henry is the top tight end on the roster, but the 30-year-old is only under contract through 2026. Meanwhile, fellow tight end Austin Hooper is only signed through this season. Likely could come in as a 1B option beside Henry in 2026, with room to grow into the top option over the long haul for Maye. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia EaglesDallas Goedert is in the final year of his current contract and was the subject of trade rumors coming into 2025. If Philadelphia decides to let him head into free agency this offseason, they could look to Likely to get younger at the position while still maintaining a steady pass-catching presence at that spot for Jalen Hurts.\nEntering Week 14, Goedert is third on the Eagles in targets (56) and first in receiving touchdowns (seven), so the tight end position is a heavily involved figure within this offense, giving Likely an opportunity to shine as the primary option. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee TitansTennessee is earmarked for a league-worst finish in 2025, currently sitting with an abysmal 1-11 record. It secured its franchise quarterback in Cam Ward with the No. 1 overall pick last offseason, and now will need to better surround him with talent. Fortunately for them, the Titans will have the most cap space in the NFL this offseason (roughly $120.1 million). Current No. 1 tight end Chig Okonkwo is going to be a free agent this offseason, creating a need at the position. Likely should be looked at as an upgrade for Ward if they were to ink him to a deal. \n            ",

Carter is considered week to week. Carter will continue to undergo treatment on his shoulders and hopes to be as close to 100% as possible for the playoffs. Philadelphia (8-4) has a 1.5 game lead over the Dallas Cowboys for first place in the AFC East with five games remaining in the regular season. The Eagles would be the No. 3 seed if the postseason started today. The ninth overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, Carter earned his first Pro Bowl nod last year after recording 4.5 sacks, two forced fumbles and 12 tackles for loss in 16 games. He had two more sacks during the Eagles' win over the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs. \nThis season hasn't been as productive for Carter, though. In 10 games, Carter tallied 2.0 sacks and four tackles for loss. He has, however, batted down six passes which ties his single-season high that was set last year. \nCarter experienced an inauspicious start to the season as he was ejected prior to Philadelphia's Week 1 win over Dallas after he spit on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. While he didn't receive an additional suspension, the NFL docked Carter $57,222 for his actions. \nWith Carter out, rest assured that the Chargers will look to exploit the middle of the Eagles' defense with Kimani Vidal, who ran for a career-high 126 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries during the Chargers' Week 13 win over the Raiders. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- Giannis Antetokounmpo is expected to be sidelined 2-4 weeks with a right calf strain, per ESPN. After a full day of trade rumors, more immediate concerns about his future with Milwaukee Bucks rose after he collapsed with a non-contact injury minutes into the team's 113-109 win over the Detroit Pistons. The Bucks announced that Antetokounmpo suffered a right calf strain and he did not return to the game. There was initial concern related to an Achilles injury, but it is simply a calf strain that could sideline him for the rest of December.\"He's doing an MRI right now, so we'll know more hopefully by the end of [Wednesday night],\" Rivers said. \"I didn't know what it was. I just wanted the trainers to tend to him. Right when they brought him in they took him to the hospital.\" Just under three minutes into the first quarter, Antetokounmpo drove along the baseline and found a cutting AJ Green for an easy layup. As he turned to run back up the floor, he suddenly fell and immediately motioned to the bench for help. He remained seated on the floor until Kevin Porter Jr. took a foul to stop play. \nAntetokounmpo was then helped to his feet and walked off the court under his own power. He initially took a seat on the bench, but later made his way to the locker room. Footage from the Bucks' broadcast showed him walking through the tunnel on his own, but moving very slowly. Bobby Portis told reporters that Antetokounmpo was keeping up with the action from the hospital and reached out to his teammates immediately after the final buzzer. \"What's so crazy is Giannis was the first person that texted in the team group message: 'Good job fellas, way to get one.' I haven't talked to him personally, but in the group message, yeah,\" Portis said. \"He was the first one to text congratulating us on the win. Hopefully he's feeling better, feeling well. Haven't seen the video yet either so don't know what it looked like or how bad it was. Praying for him, always in prayers and hopefully everything is OK.\"\nWith Antetokounmpo expected to miss a few weeks, this is a major blow for a Bucks team that, despite their surprise win Wednesday, is still only 2-5 without their two-time MVP this season and has sunk to 10th place in the Eastern Conference at 10-13. \n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo trade destinations: Ranking all 29 landing spots with Knicks as the clear No. 1\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAntetokounmpo missed nearly two weeks earlier this season with a left groin strain, and he does have a previous history of calf issues. In 2024, he strained the soleus muscle in his left calf just before the end of the regular season and missed the team's entire first-round playoff series against the Indiana Pacers, which they lost in six games. Last season, he sat out the All-Star Game and missed nearly three weeks with a left calf strain. Entering Wednesday, Antetokounmpo was averaging 30.6 points, 10.7 rebounds and 6.4 assists on 63.9% shooting. He was fourth in the league in scoring, fifth in rebounds and seventh in field goal percentage, and was on pace to average 30/10/5 for the fourth consecutive season (every other player in NBA history combined has eight such seasons). \nAntetokounmpo was well on his way to a 10th consecutive All-Star appearance and eighth consecutive All-NBA First Team honor. A lengthy absence could put both of those streaks in jeopardy. With the league's new 65-game threshold for major awards, Antetokounmpo would be ineligible for honors such as MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and All-NBA if he misses 12 more games. Prior to Wednesday's game, ESPN reported that Antetokounmpo and his agent are in the process of discussing his future with the Bucks. A resolution was reportedly expected in the coming weeks, but this injury may disrupt any potential trade talks. Bucks coach Doc Rivers refuted the idea that Antetokounmpo has asked out of Milwaukee. \n\"Giannis has never asked to be traded. Ever. I can't make that more clear,\" Rivers said before Wednesday's game. \"The thing I keep saying is I go to the source. I talk to the source every single day. Every single day. He loves Milwaukee and he loves the Bucks,\" Rivers continued. \"I've heard guys say they've talked to sources. I talked to the source. If I've learned anything in life, the source usually knows.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NWSL reportedly rejected the Washington Spirit's multimillion-dollar contract offer to star Trinity Rodman as a back-and-forth between the league and the club over the player's future continues.The Spirit reportedly offered Rodman a four-year deal worth more than $1 million annually, with commissioner Jessica Berman rejecting the proposal because it was against the spirit of the rules, according to Bloomberg. The NWSL Players Association has since filed a grievance against the league on the grounds that the Spirit's offer is compliant with the collective bargaining agreement that the league and the players struck last year, which runs through the 2030 season.\"Our goal is to ensure that the very best players in the world, including Trinity, continue to call this league home,\" the NWSL said in a statement to CBS Sports. \"We will continue to do everything we can, utilizing every lever available within our rules to keep Trinity Rodman here.\"Rodman's previous deal with the Spirit expired at the conclusion of the 2025 NWSL season, making her a free agent. The 23-year-old has been with the Spirit since her rookie season in 2021 and the Washington, D.C.-based club has intended to re-sign her all year but there have previously been concerns that they would be unable to because of the NWSL's salary cap. The cap sits at $3.1 million for the 2026 season and will rise up to $5.1 million for the 2030 season. There is an article in the CBA that allows the NWSL to raise the salary cap outside of the scheduled increases but there is currently no indication the league plans to do so.\nThe Spirit declined to comment.  The NWSLPA, though, said the Spirit's offer actually complies with the CBA as it currently exists.\"Trinity Rodman agreed to a compensation structure in good faith that would allow her to remain loyal to her first professional club, consistent with both the CBA and NWSL Competition Rules,\" the NWSLPA said in a statement to CBS Sports. \"The NWSLPA has challenged the League's rejection of this agreement on the grounds that it violates her free agency rights, but this isn't about Trinity Rodman. If NWSL can deny her free agency rights, they can deny anyone's. The NWSLPA will not allow it.\"Further, the NWSLPA claims the Spirit's offer is compliant for three reasons – \"Compensation structure fits within the projected team salary cap, which is calculated to include the team revenue share; under the CBA, NWSL can and may increase the base salary cap in any given year; and even if, despite both of the above scenarios, the deal does not fit within the cap by 2028, the League's own rules permit each team one buyout per year without hitting their cap.\"\nAhead of last month's NWSL Championship, Berman said the league would \"fight\" to keep Rodman, believing the NWSL offers the best overall package for star players.\"Specifically, as it relates to Trinity and candidly, any other top player in the world, we want those top players here in the NWSL and particularly, we want Trinity in the NWSL and we will fight for her,\" Berman said at the time.\"We really believe that there is a holistic picture that players evaluate and the reason we believe this is because we hear it from players in our league and around the world,\" she continued. \"I go and sit with the players on every single team in the NWSL every season and they tell me that yes, compensation matters but they also think about compensation not just from the perspective of what their club is paying them … We also know that our market here in the U.S. has more interest in supporting female athletes and women sports than any other market in the world and then there's all the other components outside of compensation, which I referenced earlier, the other three Css, which is the competition, the club and the coaching and we believe on a holistic basis If you're a player who wants to be performing at your best and wants to be valued and supported and feel like you have the opportunity to train in a best-in-class environment with the best-in-class league, that the NWSL is the place for you.\"\nFor her part, Rodman said she was flattered by Berman's remarks but had not made a decision on her future before the championship, during which the Spirit lost to Gotham FC.\"I'm honored to have her say that,\" Rodman said. \"Really happy about that, but at the same time, like, I don't want to put that pressure on myself, of like, because she said that now I'm like, 'Oh shoot. Like, I'm trapped.' But at the same time, I'm focused on this weekend, and that's really all I can focus on, and then moving forward, that's when I really have those conversations and tough calls that I need to have,\"In addition to the Spirit's attempts to re-sign her, Rodman reportedly has interest from three clubs in England's Women's Super League and the USL Super League's D.C. Power.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        College football's championship weekend always delivers plenty of excitement. Over two days, 18 teams will battle for league glory -- and more beyond that.In the 12-team College Football Playoff era, five spots are automatically reserved for the highest-ranked conference champions. Several of those contenders are also jockeying for a first-round bye as one of the top four seeds.That adds another layer of importance to an already momentous slate of title games. A lot is on the line for a lot of teams in Week 15.We here at CBS Sports have been overreacting to every college football weekend for a while now. For a change, let's try to manifest a few things ahead of a packed championship weekend.\nNotre Dame gets left by the wayside Notre Dame shouldn't be in the projected playoff field at this point, but that's another conversation already covered in this overreactions column. The Fighting Irish lost their two most meaningful games and they've spend the last 12 weeks beating up on irrelevant teams. Hardly the résumé of a deserving at-large contender. Saturday's championship games will put the Fighting Irish in their proper place. All eyes will be on No. 11 BYU in the Big 12 Championship Game. The Cougars should, arguably, be ahead of Notre Dame in the rankings already. They'll certainly leap ahead if they beat No. 5 Texas Tech, stealing one of the automatic conference champion bids while relegating the Red Raiders to the at-large conversation. In that scenario, Notre Dame gets bounced as the last team in. \nThe ACC re-evaluates championship game qualificationsIt is, objectively, hilarious that of the four teams tied with a 6-2 conference record, the five-loss Duke Blue Devils made the cut for the ACC Championship Game. It's a fitting result for a league that cannibalized itself all season, leaving its only school that looks like a legitimate national contender (Miami) in the cold. While the rest of the country is basking in the big sickos energy projected by an ACC title clash between Duke and Virginia, Saturday represents a legitimate disaster scenario for the conference. If Duke wins, there's almost no chance the ACC sends a team to the CFP. An 8-5 Duke isn't going to magically ascend past many more deserving schools into the CFP rankings. If it does, that would be the final signal that the selection committee cares more about optics and logos than it does actual results on the field. \nIf Duke wins, the ACC is going to scramble to re-evaluate its conference championship game tiebreakers. The Blue Devils only made it in because they played a harder conference schedule than the other three teams that finished with a 6-2 ACC record. Not because they won those difficult games, mind you, but simply because they played harder opponents. The ACC can start with that ridiculous qualifier when it's deciding what to change. Sayin, Mendoza fall flat in \"Heisman showdown\" Saturday's Big Ten Championship Game between No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Indiana is being billed as a Heisman Trophy showdown. In one corner you have Buckeye quarterback Julian Sayin, who has slotted into one of the nation's most coveted starting roles well as a redshirt freshman. In the other corner you have veteran Fernando Mendoza, who has taken his game to another level after transferring to Indiana from California. \nBoth have been spectacular this season. Sayin has a wealth of weapons, but his individual talent is evident every time he drops back. Mendoza has likely played his way into being the first quarterback taken off the board in the 2026 NFL Draft. They're not going to be the story Saturday. They may each have a decent game, but nothing that stands out as an exclamation mark on a Heisman Trophy case. Defense will dominate in the Big Ten Championship Game. Ohio State has smothered every opponent it's played this season under first-year coordinator Matt Patricia. The Buckeyes are loaded with stars at every level like Kayden McDonald, Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs. \nIndiana has been just as impressive. The Hoosiers rank third in the Big Ten in total defense (251.8 yards per game) and second -- behind only Ohio State -- in scoring defense (10.9 points per game). They've got standout talent of their own, headlined by linebacker Aiden Fisher and defensive back D'Angelo Ponds. Those defenses are going to make things very difficult for Sayin and Mendoza. James Madison makes its playoff statementJames Madison is first in line to benefit from the ACC chaos. The Dukes made their CFP rankings debut Tuesday after capping a successful 11-1 season with a 59-10 win against Coastal Carolina. Bob Chesney's squad finally got the respect it's deserved almost the entire season. Now they'll play their biggest game of the year in the Sun Belt Championship Game against Troy. \nJames Madison will take care of business against the Trojans and then spend Saturday cheering for Duke. If the dominoes fall that way, the Dukes should be in no matter what. There's no need to shoehorn another undeserving Power Four school into the conversation. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Heading into their Week 10 bye, the Dallas Cowboys were sitting at 3-5-1 and their playoff hopes were on life support. However, a lot of things have changed over the past three weeks: The Cowboys have now won three in a row heading into their Thursday night showdown with the Detroit Lions and thanks to that winning streak, they're now VERY much in the NFC playoff race. At 6-5-1, everything is currently on the table for the Cowboys: They could get in the playoffs as a wild card, they could get in as a division winner and in one wild scenario, they could even get in the postseason as the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. That's right, if everything (and we mean everything) goes the Cowboys' way over the final five weeks of the season, they could steal the top seed in the NFC. \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: What Cowboys-Lions means for NFC seeding, wild-card chaos and teams on the bubble\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's what would have to happen down the stretch for the Cowboys to pull that off. First, the obvious part is that Dallas has to win out against a schedule that looks like this: at Lions, Vikings, Chargers, at Commanders and at Giants. If they can pull off the upset on Thursday, they'll only face one more team that is currently above .500 and that game will be at home, so winning out isn't crazy if Dallas can somehow pull off an upset in Detroit. Now, let's take a look at the rest of the NFC: \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago Bears (9-3)Remaining schedule: at Packers (Loss), Browns (Win), Packers (Loss), at 49ers (Win), Lions (Loss)What Cowboys need: In the Cowboys' dream scenario, the Bears would go 2-3 over their final five games, with the wins coming against the Browns and 49ers. The Bears are an underdog to Green Bay this week, so it's not out of the question that they get swept by the Packers. Also, they'll be facing a Lions team in Week 18 that destroyed them, 52-21, back in Week 2. Basically, what the Cowboys need here isn't all that crazy. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Rams (9-3)Remaining schedule: at Cardinals (Win), Lions (Loss), at Seahawks (Loss), at Falcons (Win), Cardinals (Win)What Cowboys need: The Cowboys need the Rams to go 2-3 over their final five games, which is somewhat doable. For that to happen, the Cardinals would need to split with the Rams, which is something that has happened in two of the past three seasons. In this scenario, the Rams would beat the Cardinals once and beat the Falcons and lose their other three games. Matthew Stafford has lost his last two games against the Lions, so a loss to Detroit is within the realm of possibility. And the Rams losing to the Seahawks could definitely happen as long as Sam Darnold doesn't throw four interceptions as he did in their first meeting.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Remaining schedule: at Chargers (Loss), Raiders (Win), at Commanders (Win), at Bills (Loss), Commanders (Win). What Cowboys need: The Eagles are going to be favored big against the Raiders and Commanders, so we'll just give them the wins in those three games. If that happens, the Eagles have to lose to the Chargers and the Bills for Dallas' division title dreams to stay alive. Both games are on the road for Philly, so it wouldn't be shocking to see them go down in both games. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seattle Seahawks (9-3)Remaining schedule: at Falcons (Win), Colts (Loss), Rams (Win), at Panthers (Loss), 49ers (Loss)What Cowboys need: The Cowboys will definitely need some help here, but it's not impossible. The Seahawks are 2-2 this season when they give up more than 100 yards rushing, so if the Colts get Jonathan Taylor going, Indy could certainly pull off an upset there. In the Carolina game, the Panthers just pulled off a home upset against the Rams, and their game against Seattle will also be at home, so they'll likely be confident going into that. The Cowboys will also need the 49ers to beat Seattle, which is something they've already done once this season. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)Remaining schedule: Bears (Win), at Broncos (Loss), at Bears (Win), Ravens (Loss), at Vikings (Loss)What Cowboys need: The Cowboys need the Packers to sweep the Bears, which comes with one downside, that will allow Green Bay to clinch the conference record tiebreaker over the Cowboys (No one would win the head-to-head tiebreaker since these two teams TIED back in Week 4). Since the Packers have the conference record tiebreaker, they'd need to finish 10-6-1, meaning they'd have to lose all their non-Chicago games. The Ravens and Vikings games might be a stretch, but not impossible. Lamar Jackson is 25-3 as a starter against NFC teams and the Vikings have won three of their past five against the Packers. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Remaining schedule: BYE, Titans (Win), at Colts (Loss), Bears (Loss), Seahawks (Win)What Cowboys need: The game against the Titans seems like a layup for the 49ers, so we'll give them that one. In Week 16, they have to travel to Indianapolis, where the Colts are 6-1 this year, so it's certainly a game the 49ers could lose. The final two games will be huge no matter what, and it wouldn't be surprising if the 49ers go 1-1 over the final two weeks. If that happens, the Cowboys will need that one win to be against the Seahawks to keep their dream scenario alive. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit Lions (7-5)Remaining schedule: Cowboys (Loss), at Rams (Win), Steelers Win), Vikings (Win), at Bears (Win)What Cowboys need: The Cowboys need to beat the Lions on Thursday for their crazy No. 1 seed scenario to stay alive, but after that, they're going to need Detroit's help. The Lions have to beat the Rams in Week 15 and then close the season with a win over the Bears. Detroit also has two games against the Steelers and the Vikings, which won't matter to the Cowboys but will matter very much to Detroit. If Dallas' dream scenario plays out, then the Lions will WIN THE NFC NORTH if they beat both the Vikings and Steelers. If they slip up in either game, then they'll miss the playoffs. The Lions will almost certainly be favored in both games, so we'll give them the two wins. \nNote: We're going to ignore the NFC South and assume it ends up being a one-bid division where no one gets to 11 wins. If all of the above plays out, here's what the final NFC playoff seedings will look like: FINAL NFC STANDINGS1. Cowboys (11-5-1): NFC East champion2. 49ers (11-6): NFC West champion3. Lions (11-6): NFC North champion4. Buccaneers (10-7): NFC South champion5. Eagles (11-6): Wild Card 16. Bears (11-6): Wild Card 27. Rams (11-6): Wild Card 3\nAnd there you go, that is the wild scenario that would give the Cowboys the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. Although this would be the Cowboys' dream scenario, it would be a nightmare for the Seahawks, who would be left out of the postseason with an 11-6 record (in this scenario, the Seahawks would get in if the Lions were to lose to the Steelers or the Vikings). \n            ",

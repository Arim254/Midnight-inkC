    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos and Washington Commanders meet in the penultimate game on the Week 13 schedule as they play on 'Sunday Night Football' at 8:20 p.m. ET. With Denver bringing an elite defense into this game and Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels (elbow) ruled out, the over/under is down to 43.5 after opening at 45.5. Further making life difficult for Washington receivers, Denver cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) is back in the lineup for the Broncos.How should those injury updates impact your NFL DFS picks for 'Sunday Night Football,' and which sleepers should you insert into your NFL DFS lineups?

Nix is not a quarterback known for putting up Fantasy numbers, but he is coming off a 295-yard day against the Chiefs in his last game. The Commanders, meanwhile, have given up the third most Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this season, making this an ideal spot for Nix to return value. See who else to roster at SportsLine.McClure is also building his 'Sunday Night Football' NFL DFS strategy around Washington receiver Terry McLaurin. He does not have an injury designation, clearing the way for him to play for the first time since Oct. 27. He's a veteran presence that backup quarterback Marcus Mariota can depend on. With the Commanders listed as underdogs, there's a great chance they'll need to throw late, giving McLaurin plenty of opportunities to pile up production. McLaurin had 54 yards and a touchdown in the last game he played, and he also had the same stat line of 54 yards and a score when he last played the Broncos. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set Broncos vs. Commanders NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Sunday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        Teams coming off byes but going in opposite directions will meet in the 'Sunday Night Football' NFL Week 13 matchup as the Denver Broncos visit the Washington Commanders. Denver (9-2) has won eight in a row and defeated Kansas City, 22-19, in its last game. Meanwhile, Washington has lost six in a row, most recently falling to Miami, 16-13, in the first-ever NFL Madrid Game on Nov. 16. Jayden Daniels (elbow), who has been out since Week 9, has been ruled out. However, Terry McLaurin will return for Washington, as will reigning Defensive Player of the Year, Patrick Surtain II, for Denver. Broncos safety, Talanoa Hufanga, who was originally listed as questionable with an illness, is active.Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Northwest Stadium in Landover, Md. The teams have alternated wins and losses over their last eight matchups, with Washington prevailing in the last meeting in 2023. The latest Commanders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 6-point road favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 43.5 via SportsLine consensus. Denver is 5-6 against the spread this season, while Washington is 3-8 ATS. The Under is a combined 14-8 for the two squads in 2025.

That contrasts with Washington which has not only lost six in a row straight up, but the Commanders have also lost versus the spread in all six of those. The Broncos possess an elite defense, leading the NFL in sacks, having allowed the fewest passing touchdowns, and holding opponents to a league-low in yards per rush. The defense gets another boost with cornerback Surtain II (pectoral) cleared to play. At the other end of the spectrum is Washington's defense, which has bottom-five rankings in points allowed, yards allowed and turnovers forced. Washington has allowed an average of 34 points over its last five games, while the Broncos haven't given up 34 points in any game this season. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Commanders can coverWashington HC Dan Quinn took over defensive play-calling duties prior to the team's last game, and the results were instant as the Commanders gave up just 16 points and a season-low of 142 passing yards. That's a promising sign heading into SNF, especially facing a Broncos offense that does not travel. The Broncos are averaging just 18 points over their last four road games, and they've failed to rush for more than 100 yards in three straight games overall. While Daniels' return is in doubt, receiver Terry McLaurin (quad) has been cleared to return after being out since Week 8, and he had 54 yards and a touchdown in his last game versus the Broncos. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Broncos vs. Commanders picksSportsLine's model has simulated Commanders vs. Broncos 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 45 combined points.

Per his contract, Stoops is owed his full $38 million buyout within 60 days of termination, which could make it one of the most expensive firings in college football history.It's a steep price to pay for a Kentucky athletic department that is all-in on men's basketball and getting a late start on a coaching carousel that has been spinning for two months. But amid lopsided season-ending losses to Vanderbilt and Louisville, Stoops lost the goodwill he briefly regained in the first half of November.Following a season-ending 41-0 road loss to the rival Cardinals, Stoops struck a defiant tone over whether he planned to return in 2026. He said there was a \"zero percent chance\" he would leave on his own accord.\"I'm going to be here as far as I'm concerned,\" he said. \"Now, I can't control what decisions that are made. But if you're asking me, I said zero. Zero means zero.\"\nFollowing a 2-5 start, the Wildcats reeled off three straight wins, including victories over Auburn and Florida. Those wins, combined with the promising play of redshirt freshman quarterback Cutter Boley appeared to offer a path forward for Stoops. Then came back-to-back listless efforts against Commodores and Cardinals, which ended UK's bowl hopes and laid bare the program's shortcomings. At 9-15 (3-13 SEC) over the past two seasons, Stoops was mired in his worst run since taking over the job from Joker Phillips after the 2012 season. His final record of 82-80 (38-68 SEC) is heavily weighed down by a slow beginning and poor ending. In between came some of the program's finest moments.\nIt took four seasons for UK to reach its first bowl under Stoops, but 2016 marked the first of eight straight postseason trips for the Wildcats. Stoops produced the program's first 10-win season since 1977 in 2018 and did it again in 2021.After consecutive 7-6 showings in 2022-23, the bottom fell out in 2024 with a 4-8 team weighed down by an offense that finished 114th nationally in yards per game. Even with Boley's midseason emergence in 2025, the Wildcats failed to produce competitive showings against Tennessee, Vanderbilt and Louisville -- all important regional foes.SEC peers Arkansas, Auburn, Florida, LSU and Ole Miss have already made coaching hires this cycle. Most significantly, the Gators snagged beloved former UK linebacker and defensive coordinator Jon Sumrall -- long-coveted by many Kentucky fans as a potential heir to Stoops -- from Tulane. When UK hired Stoops, he was the defensive coordinator at Florida State and had never been a head coach. He will depart as the longest-tenured coach in program history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In Week 13, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 14 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Adonai Mitchell, WR, JetsWhen the Jets traded Sauce Gardner, they made sure the deal included not just two first-round picks but also a former second-round pick in Mitchell. Coming out of Texas, Mitchell proved a 1-on-1 matchup winner when isolated on the outside with the length and speed to burn over the top. That's exactly what he did in Week 13 when he caught a long touchdown. His rapport with Tyrod Taylor was evident right away. What has Fantasy managers even more excited is the fact that Mitchell finished the game with a whopping 12 targets in Week 13. He turned those 12 into 8 receptions, 102 yards receiving and a touchdown.Dontayvion Wicks, WR, PackersWicks has been a frustrating asset for Fantasy managers for two seasons now because his advanced metrics are typically electric and he breaks out every once in a while with an explosive scoring output. That happened for Wicks in Week 13 as he racked up 94 yards and two touchdowns on six receptions from Jordan Love. As Love continues to heat up heading into the Fantasy playoffs, Wicks is worth stashing.Brenton Strange, TE, JaguarsStrange was on his way to a breakout season earlier this year before landing on injured reserve. After spending time out of the lineup, Strange found himself on waiver wires in most leagues. Make sure that is not the case any longer. Strange has returned as arguably Trevor Lawrence's favorite red zone solution and a player he looks to in key third-down situations. Strange finished Week 13 with 45 yards and a touchdown on three receptions.Devaughn Vele, WR, Saints \nThe Saints shocked the NFL world this offseason when they trade a mid-round pick for a what appeared to be a back-end roster receiver in Vele. Fast forward to Week 13 and Vele finally made his mark with 93 yards and a touchdown on eight receptions. He was also targeted eight times. Vele is only worth stashing in deep PPR leagues. Jakobi Meyers, WR, JaguarsMeyers is most likely not a free agent in your leagues, but just in case a fellow manager panic-dropped him after his slow start with the Jaguars following the trade, we want to make sure he's on your radar. Meyers racked up 90 yards and a touchdown on six receptions in Week 13. As we enter the stretch run, Meyers may prove to be Lawrence's No. 1 target in the pass game as Brian Thomas Jr. continues to struggle to make an impact. Meyers will improve his rapport with LawrenceJalen Coker, WR, PanthersCoker has found lightning in a bottle with Bryce Young before -- last season his per target metrics were through the roof -- and he might've found some again in Week 13. Coker had 74 yards receiving and four receptions. He was also targeted six times. Chuba Hubbard, RB, Panthers\nHubbard was likely dropped in your leagues after the Panthers turned the offense over to Rico Dowdle midseason, but the veteran worked his way back into the rotation in a big way in Week 13. Hubbard is an explosive playmaker and could be worth a desperation FLEX play down the stretch in the right matchups for Carolina. At the very least, he's a stash in case Dowdle gets hurt. \n            ",

    "description": "\n        The WNBA's current collective bargaining agreement will expire at 11:59 p.m. ET on Sunday, and there has been no announcement from the league",
    "body": "\n        The WNBA's current collective bargaining agreement will expire at 11:59 p.m. ET on Sunday, and there has been no announcement from the league or the Women's National Basketball Players Association regarding a new CBA or an extension. While the WNBPA released a statement on Sunday evening saying it has proposed a six-week extension, it's unclear if the league will agree to those terms. With just hours remaining until the current CBA expires, four options remain on the table. Let's quickly run through them. A new collective bargaining agreementIt's unlikely that the two sides will announce a new CBA late on Sunday night. Earlier this month, the WNBA made a new offer to the players that included substantial salary increases including a new minimum salary (more than $220,000) that would be more than the 2025 regular max salary ($214,466), according to the Associated Press. However, the players did not believe that offer moved negotiations forward, per ESPN. While the players want more money, a new revenue-sharing model is their top priority, not just higher salaries. \n\n        \n            \n                As new WNBA CBA deadline nears, players and league remain at odds over meaning of 'transformational change'\n                \n                    Lindsay Gibbs                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"If me and you aren't set on going to the correct restaurant, who cares what we're ordering as an appetizer?\" WNBPA first vice president Kelsey Plum said earlier this year. \"First, second, third is rev share (and) salary. So when I say that we continue to propose and the counter proposals that are coming back are further away from where we thought we would be, that to me is -- and I think a lot of the players are in agreement as a union -- this is literally the meat and potatoes.\"Under the current CBA, however, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. Currently, players reportedly only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive. While the current CBA does have a clause to trigger revenue sharing if the WNBA hits certain benchmarks, they have never been met, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nESPN's report on the players' response to the WNBA's latest offer came 10 days ago, and there's been radio silence since then. If the two sides were moving closer to an agreement, we likely would have heard rumblings about progress in the past few days. Another extension to the current CBAThe current CBA was originally set to expire on Oct. 31, but the two sides agreed to a 30-day extension on Oct. 28, which set Nov. 30 as the new expiration date. The WNBPA issued a statement late on Sunday night saying that it has proposed a six-week extension. \"We expect substantive movement from the league within this window,\" the WNBPA wrote. It's unclear whether the league will agree to this extension. \nA status quo periodIf 11:59 p.m. ET passes without a new CBA or another extension, there would not automatically be a work stoppage. Instead, the two sides would enter a status quo period, which appears to be the most likely next step. Per the Cornell Law Review: \"Courts developed the 'status quo' doctrine from the Katz prohibition of unilateral changes. This doctrine requires employers 'to maintain, during ther period of negotiations, the status quo concerning conditions of employment in order to avoid committing [a violation of the duty to bargain in good faith].'\"The key difference between status quo and an extension is that either side could announce a work stoppage at any point during status quo, while an extension would lock in the current CBA until a set date (or until a new CBA is agreed upon).\nA work stoppageAt any point during a status quo period, either side could enact a work stoppage. That would most likely come via the owners locking out the players, though the players could also go on strike. In the event of a lockout, all league business would cease and players would be prevented from accessing team facilities. That would mean no expansion draft, no free agency, no trades, no 2026 WNBA Draft, nothing until a new CBA is in place. Depending on how long the lockout lasted, it's possible that the 2026 season could be delayed or, in a worst-case scenario, cancelled. The WNBA has never lost games due to a work stoppage. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A day after becoming the youngest player in NBA history to record 10 assists in a loss to the Lakers, No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg made some more history in a 114-100 win against the Clippers Saturday night. Flagg became the youngest player in NBA history to record at least 35 points. Flagg did so at 18 years and 343 days, which is five days faster than when LeBron James did it in his rookie season.Flagg also did it more efficiently than James did, going 13 of 22 from the floor (59.1%), while adding eight rebounds and two assists. He was aggressive from the opening tip, racking up 21 of his 35 points in the first half.\nThings came easy for Flagg in the first half, as James Harden's level of defense was minimal at best, and non-existent on most occasions. The Clippers orange-red jerseys were actually quite fitting for the occasion, as their defense looked like traffic cones out there as Flagg knifed his way to the iron for countless layups with minimal rim pressure.Despite the poor defensive display from the Clippers, who rank 26th on that end of the floor and have now lost four consecutive games, it was an impressive feat from the rookie. You could tell Flagg looks far more comfortable on the floor, and he's been more assertive in looking for his own shot, even when the game is on the line.\nIt was Flagg who made a pull-up, mid-range jumper with under two minutes to go to put the Mavericks back out in front against the Clippers. He once again answered the call with 45 seconds to go, when he attacked the rim out of a pick-and-roll and took it straight at Clippers big man Ivica Zubac. Flagg got the foul call and nearly got the shot to fall after the whistle blew, but made sure to convert both free throws to put the Mavericks up by four points.It felt like Flagg's first signature win of his career, and an inflection point of his rookie season that should earn him more attention for Rookie of the Year. If you were to take a poll right now, many would vote Charlotte Hornets rookie Kon Knueppel for the award. He's leading all rookies in scoring (18.4), is averaging 5.7 rebounds and three assists, while shooting incredibly efficiently, too (47% FG, 41.3% 3FG). But over the last five games, Flagg has surpassed Knueppel's production. He's averaging over 20 points on shooting 48.1%, while tacking on 7.2 rebounds and 4.4 assists during the span.In the last five games, we're seeing a version of Flagg everyone expected to get from the opening tip of the season. But a failed point guard experiment and clunky lineup rotations made it seem as though the Mavericks weren't putting Flagg in the best position to succeed. However, since benching D'Angelo Russell in favor of Brandon Williams and Ryan Nembhard as the point guard duo, and better floor spacing created by the absence of Anthony Davis, the former Duke phenom has flourished.\nHis averages are up across the board, and while his 3-point shooting is suffering, he's settling for fewer 3s and instead wrecking havoc inside the arc. His 3-point shot was always going to be a work in progress, but what's important is he's been more efficient from everywhere else recently.Cooper Flagg's statsTimespanPPGRPGAPGFG%3P%First 15 games15.56.33.145.5%29.3%Last 5 games20.27.24.448.1%11.8%It's a small sample size, and integrating Davis back into the starting lineup will be an interesting thing to watch, but if Flagg maintains this level of play from the past five games, he'll have certainly done enough to seriously challenge his former Duke teammate for Rookie of the Year.Knueppel's still putting up massive numbers, but he'll also have to make some adjustments of his own now that Brandon Miller is back healthy in Charlotte's starting lineup. Between LaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges and Miller there's a ton of scoring coming from that trio that Knueppel's production might wane over the course of the season. The main reason he's had so much opportunity is because of early-season injuries to both Ball and Miller, but if those two can remain healthy, Knueppel's numbers may dip.Either way though, Flagg's recent scoring outburst felt like an \"I've arrived\" moment. He started the season slow, and with a stacked rookie class he didn't even crack the top 3 of our Rookie Rankings through the first month of the season. Now, though, he's risen up the ranks. With how things have been going lately, it feels like this Rookie of the Year race might come down to the wire between two former Duke teammates.\n            ",

After the news broke, Meyer posted his seal of approval on social media.Meyer praised Sumrall for his ability to win everywhere he's been. In four seasons, split evenly between Troy and Tulane, Sumrall has compiled a career record of 42-11 with two Sun Belt Conference championships. He can add an American Conference title to his resume this weekend.\"What a special day for Gator Nation,\" Meyer said. \"Welcome head football coach Jon Sumrall, one of the top five coaches in winning percentage in college football. I've studied coach Sumrall. I got to spend some time with him over the last few months. His teams are tough, they're physical and he creates a competitive environment. If he wins the conference championship this year, it'll be the third conference championship over the past four years.\"\nMeyer knows what it takes to win in Gainesville. He put together a 65-15 record at Florida, which included two SEC championships and two national championships. Throughout his 17-year coaching career at the college level, Meyer went 187-32 with seven conference championships and three national titles.Since Meyer stepped down at Florida following the 2010 season, the Gators have struggled to regain their status as national championship contenders. Florida hasn't won more than eight games since 2019, and Sumrall will be the program's fifth coach since Meyer's departure.\nOne of the team's biggest issues in recent years has been the lack of explosiveness on offense, a staple of Florida football under coaches like Meyer and Steve Spurrier. In his first statement as the Gators' next head coach, Sumrall said it's \"mandatory\" for the program to have a high-powered offense.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State is firing coach Jonathan Smith one day after the Spartans concluded a 4-8 season, sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Michigan State capped its 2025 campaign with a 38-28 victory over Maryland, which gave the Spartans their first Big Ten win of the season. Zenitz also reports the Spartans are expected to hire former Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald as Smith's replacement. Fitzgerald won 110 games in 17 seasons with the Wildcats. Smith departs Michigan State after just two seasons and an official record of 4-15. The Spartans won five games in 2024, but vacated them due to recruiting violations committed by former Michigan State coach Mel Tucker. Michigan State started the season 3-0 against nonconference opponents, including a double-overtime victory against 2-10 Boston College, before losing eight-straight Big Ten games. Those eight conference losses are its most since 2016. Six of those losses came by at least two possessions, as well. \nThe Spartans finished in the bottom third of the Big Ten in both total offense (345.5 yards per game; 13th) and total defense (378.8 ypg; 14th). They failed to score more than 20 points in six out of their nine conference games while allowing 32.1 points per game to Big Ten opponents. Smith, a former quarterback at Oregon State, spent six seasons coaching his alma mater prior to his hiring at Michigan State. He left Corvallis with a 34-35 record, including three straight winning seasons in each of his last three years. The Beavers went 10-3 in 2022 and finished at No. 17 in the AP Top 25 with Smith leading the way. Fitzgerald could make Big Ten return Fitzgerald has been out of the college game for three seasons now, but it seems as if that could change soon. He'd bring a wealth of Big Ten experience to East Lansing from his time at Northwestern. \nFitzgerald delivered a hall of fame career as a linebacker with the Wildcats and served as a defensive assistant from 2001-05 before his promotion to head coach ahead of the 2006 season. After amassing a 10-14 record in his first two years, Fitzgerald took the Wildcats to their first of five straight bowl appearances in 2008. Fitzgerald's Wildcats also went to four straight bowls from 2015-18. His 110 wins and 64 Big Ten victories as Northwestern's coach are both program records. The Wildcats also made it to 10 bowls during Fitzgerald's tenure despite making the postseason just six times in 123 seasons prior to his hiring. His five bowl victories are the most for a coach in school history and he's the only Northwestern coach to ever make it to back-to-back bowl games. But his tenure unraveled quickly in the final years. Outside of a 7-2 record, capped by a a win in the Citrus Bowl and a top-10 finish in the AP poll, during the COVID-shortened 2020 season, Fitzgerald won seven games from 2019-22. \nThe Wildcats had a losing record in three out of his last four years with the program. They went 1-8 in Big Ten play in 2019, 2021 and 2022. Then, on July 8, 2023, Northwestern suspended Fitzgerald without pay for two weeks after details surfaced alleging graphic instances of hazing within the program. University administrators opted to revisit his status with the program after two former players provided details of the hazing, which was sexual in nature, to The Daily Northwestern student newspaper and he was fired three days later.   In Aug. 2025, Northwestern and Fitzgerald reached a settlement ending his wrongful termination lawsuit against the university. \nSmith's tenure represents lose-lose situation for Michigan State, Oregon StateSmith's failures perpetuated a stretch of mediocrity at Michigan State and created an even murkier outlook for the Spartans' future. That he even took the job in the first place ahead of the 2024 season also set his former school, Oregon State, back to an enormous extent. Once a rising star in the industry, Smith arguably did more harm than good over the last two calendar years.Given his accomplishments at Oregon State -- where he pulled his alma mater out of the depths of the Pac-12 and turned it back into a perennial winner -- Smith looked like a lifeline for a Michigan State program that needed similar help. Instead, the Spartans are now two more years removed from their last winning season and will be on their second coaching search since 2023 with little recent success to sell to prospective candidates.Meanwhile, back at Oregon State, Smith bolted at an inopportune time for the Beavers. Conference realignment effectively relegated their program out of the Power Four, and the coaching change precipitated a mass exodus through the transfer portal that left them devoid of the caliber of talent they had been used to rostering as power conference members. Smith's former defensive coordinator, Trent Bray, took the reins and went just 5-14 before his firing midway through the 2025 campaign.\nSmith went 25-13 (.658) over his final three years at Oregon State. Since his departure, the Beavers and Spartans posted a combined winning percentage of 0.333. Neither program is better off today than it was when he made his decision to leave Corvallis.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Max Brosmer made the wrong type of history in his first NFL start, and the Vikings offense officially hit rock bottom. With its undrafted rookie quarterback leading the way, Minnesota lost 26-0 at the Seahawks. It's the first time the Vikings have been shut out since Nov. 11, 2007, ending a 294-game streak with at least one point. Entering Sunday, it had been the third-longest active scoring streak in the NFL.Longest active NFL scoring streaks entering SundayGamesRavens382Steelers308Vikings294<<49ers246>> Ended SundayBrosmer, starting because Week 1 starter J.J. McCarthy (concussion) was ruled out and backup Carson Wentz (shoulder) is done for the season, finished 19 for 30 for 126 yards and four interceptions. He also took four sacks. His 32.8 passer rating was the worst by any starter this season and the worst by a Vikings starter in a game since Spergon Wynn in 2001. For reference, throwing an incompletion on every pass carries a passer rating of 39.6The situation -- an undrafted rookie facing one of the league's best defenses on the road in his first start -- had all the makings for a disaster, and it ended up being even worseMinnesota punted on each of its first four drives but trailed just 3-0 in the second quarter when Dallas Turner strip-sacked Sam Darnold and Jalen Redmond recovered. That put Brosmer and the offense in business at Seattle's 22-yard line, in seemingly sure scoring distance. Instead, Brosmer threw a fourth-and-1 interception to Ernest Jones IV, who went 84 yards the other way for a touchdown.\nBy the end of the half, Minnesota trailed 13-0 and had just three first downs.\nIt got worse in the second half. The Vikings worked their way into the edge of field goal range when Aaron Jones Sr. lost a fumble and got injured in the process. On their next possession, the Vikings again got into Seattle territory, but Brosmer threw high for Jalen Nailor, and Coby Bryant picked it off.\nBrosmer threw another interception to Jones and then a fourth interception, this time to Riq Woolen. Woolen lost a fumble on the return, though, giving Minnesota yet another short field. Again, the Vikings failed to cash in, beset by a holding penalty and a pair of Brosmer sacks, including one on fourth downThat sequence sealed Minnesota's first time failing to score a point in a game since a 34-0 loss to the Packers more than 18 years ago. That game similarly included a third-string quarterback starting; with both Tavaris Jackson and Kelly Holcomb hurt, Brooks Bollinger got the call. Bollinger had more succes than Brosmer -- 16 for 26 for 176 yards and just one interception -- but was unable to generate any points.\nThe Vikings face the Commanders in Week 14.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin, the top candidate of the 2025 college football coaching carousel, has decided to leave Ole Miss for LSU and will not coach in the College Football Playoff, he announced Sunday after a days-long saga. \"After a lot of prayer and time spent with family, I made the difficult decision to accept the head coaching position at LSU,\" Kiffin said on social media. Kiffin leaves Ole Miss after six seasons and a 55-19 record. Defensive coordinator Pete Golding will be named the school's new coach, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz, as the Rebels look to prevent a massive exodus with the school's first CFP appearance on the horizon. 247Sports' Neal McCready reports Ole Miss is looking to double the pay of its offensive coaches to keep them on staff. Kiffin released a statement around 2 p.m. local time Sunday laying the blame for his early exit at the feet of athletics director Keith Carter.\nI was hoping to complete a historic six season run with this year's team by leading Ole Miss through the playoffs, capitalizing on the team's incredible success and their commitment to finish strong, and investing everything into a playoff run with guardrails in place to protect the program in any areas of concern. My request to do so was denied by Keith Carter despite the team also asking him to allow me to keep coaching them so they could better maintain their high level of performance. Unfortunately, that means Friday's Egg Bowl was my last game coaching the Rebels.While I am looking forward to a new start with a unique opportunity at LSU, I will forever cherish the incredible six years I spent at Ole Miss and will be rooting hard for the team to complete their mission and bring a championship to Oxford.A decision was expected on Saturday by Kiffin after he met with athletic director Keith Carter and university administration, but both parties left the meeting without a public resolution. A team meeting was called at 9 a.m. local time on Sunday but was later pushed to 1 p.m. as the football world scrambled to fill in the blanks of Kiffin's decision and Ole Miss' next move. One of the highest-profile coaches in college football since joining the Rebels in 2020, Kiffin led the program to four 10-win seasons and three finishes of No. 11 or better in the AP Top 25. His tenure marked the most successful period at Ole Miss since integration. However, at LSU, Kiffin has the chance to elevate his resume. Three of the last four coaches in Baton Rouge have won national titles, which have been elusive to Kiffin. Additionally, Brian Kelly won an SEC West division championship in 2022 before the league moved to a divisionless format. \"I am incredibly honored to have the opportunity to lead the storied LSU Football program,\" Kiffin said in an LSU statement. \"From national championships to iconic players, LSU is synonymous with excellence and is among the most powerful brands in all of sports. I'm grateful to President Rousse, Verge Ausberry and LSU's leadership for placing their faith in me to lead this program. Our staff will recruit the very best student-athletes in the country – starting at home in the state of Louisiana -- and will work tirelessly every day to bring championships that the LSU fans deserve. Geaux Tigers!\"Kelly was fired in only his fourth season after the program invested heavily in his roster. The Tigers limped out to a 5-3 start, including a 49-25 decimation at the hands of Texas A&M. Kiffin defeated Kelly 24-19 in what appeared to be a marquee matchup in Oxford, Mississippi, but the Tigers ultimately fell from No. 4 to unranked. While Kiffin is one of the most well-traveled coaches in college football, he has never coached in the state of Louisiana. However, he worked under former Tigers coach Nick Saban at Alabama, as well as Pete Carroll at LSU. Kiffin has previous stints as head coach at Tennessee (2009), USC (2010-13) and with the Oakland Raiders (2007-08). \n\"We are thrilled to welcome Coach Kiffin as the next head coach of the LSU Football program,\" LSU athletic director Verge Ausberry said. \"We shared when we began this search that LSU would secure the best coach in the country and Lane Kiffin is just that. Lane is a proven winner who has thrived in an era of college athletics that requires coaches to adapt and innovate. His passion, creativity and authenticity make him the ideal leader to guide LSU into the future and consistently position us among the sport's elite. I want to welcome Lane and his family to Baton Rouge, and I'd like to thank our search committee, as well as our university and state leadership, for their critical support and counsel throughout this process.\"At LSU, Kiffin is tasked with bringing the Tigers back to national contention. The program has not won a national championship or SEC championship since firing coach Ed Orgeron after the 2020 season. What's next for Ole Miss?The timing of Kiffin's decision really couldn't be worse for the Rebels, who secured the program's first College Football Playoff appearance on Friday after a 38-19 win over rival Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl. \nCarter will hope to keep the current formula intact with the 41-year-old Golding, who got his first big break as the defensive coordinator and cornerbacks coach at UTSA and parlayed that into an opportunity as defensive coordinator at Alabama from 2018-22, where he coached under Nick Saban. Golding left for Ole Miss in January 2023. In August, Ole Miss made Golding the highest-paid defensive coordinator in the SEC with a three-year contract extension worth around $2.61 million annually. How does leaving now affect Kiffin's legacy?On one hand, Ole Miss fans should be thankful for Kiffin's time in Oxford. He's delivered some of the greatest seasons in program history and singlehandedly improved the Rebels' SEC outlook. To even have Ole Miss in the conversation as a consistent national contender in the modern era is a testament to Kiffin's efforts. \nOle Miss fans also have every right to be outraged. A coach abandoning a school for a perceived better opportunity stings, but it isn't unheard of; a coach abandoning a school on the precipice of its first College Football Playoff run is unprecedented, however, and it smacks of betrayal. It's reminiscent of the time, just under 16 years ago, when Kiffin suddenly left Tennessee in the cold after one season with the Vols to replace Pete Carroll at USC. Kiffin's decision precipitated Tennessee's fall into a decade of irrelevancy. There's no telling if the same thing will happen at Ole Miss, but this move is arguably worse from the onset. Kiffin gave the Rebels six seasons, the longest he's ever stayed in one place as a coach. He took the program to heights it hasn't seen since Johnny Vaught was patrolling the sidelines. \nIn an era where sustained success is harder than ever, Kiffin more than acclimated -- he thrived and molded Ole Miss into the model of a bought-in program. Now, he could use some of those same tactics to take Ole Miss' stars with him to Baton Rouge, which would plunge the dagger even further. The offseason campaign pointing towards Kiffin's growth -- professionally, at least -- rings hollow. It's fair to question whether he's motivated by anything except the almighty dollar, since winning and resources obviously weren't issues at Ole Miss. What will Kiffin inherit at LSU?Kiffin is inheriting an LSU roster that could look a lot different next year. The Tigers went all-in on building a roster meant to compete for championships in the offseason, which meant adding a lot of veterans via the transfer portal while investing significant capital into retaining top talent. \nLSU has 18 seniors or draft-eligible juniors/redshirt sophomores listed atop its depth chart. That includes standout names like quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, cornerback Mansoor Delane and safety A.J. Haulcy. Maybe Kiffin can convince a few of LSU's impact players with eligibility to come back, but there's still going to be plenty of turnover. Not that that's necessarily a problem for Kiffin, who touts the well-earned moniker of \"Portal King.\" Flipping rosters isn't anything new to him; Kiffin leaned heavily on the transfer portal to inject Ole Miss' roster with talent on a yearly basis. The Rebels landed a top-five transfer class in every cycle between 2022 -- when 247Sports started ranking transfer hauls -- and 2025. Expect much of the same at a place like LSU, which hasn't shied away from talent acquisition in recent years. \n            ",

Once 3-5-1, Dallas has strung together three straight wins thanks to a defensive turnaround, and now, more defensive help is on the way. On Sunday, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer told reporters that the team has designated cornerback Trevon Diggs to return from injured reserve, and opened his 21-day practice window. Diggs has missed the past six games after he was placed on injured reserve following an accident in his home that landed him in the concussion protocol. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones referred to it as a \"fluke situation.\"\"I don't know the combination of the injury and how it impacted, regarding concussion issue, I'm not sure that I know the detail of how that happened,\" Jones said last month. \"He said what happened, and I'm not saying that didn't happen, but a lot of times, you're not the best viewer of what happened to you. … Yeah, no I won't get into that [what Diggs said happened], but the bottom line is that I do expect him back.\"\nIn six games played this season, Diggs recorded 18 combined tackles with zero passes defensed or interceptions. Diggs is a two-time Pro Bowl player, and was named a First Team All-Pro in 2021 when he led the league in interceptions with 11.The Cowboys are off this weekend after defeating Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs on Thanksgiving, 31-28. With that win, the Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to defeat both of the previous year's Super Bowl teams in a five-day span. In Week 12, the Cowboys overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Philadelphia Eagles. \nEntering NFL Sunday, the Cowboys are the No. 9 seed in the NFC, one spot above the 6-6 Carolina Panthers, and one behind the 7-5 Detroit Lions. Dallas is also 1.5 games back of the 8-4 Eagles in the NFC East, who lost to the Chicago Bears Friday. Up next for the Cowboys are the Lions in Detroit this Thursday. \n            \n    ",

The Spartans acted quickly to replace former coach Jonathan Smith, who was fired Sunday afternoon after two seasons in East Lansing. Fitzgerald was initially reported as a top target in Michigan State's search. This will mark a return to the Big Ten for the 50-year-old coach, who spent 17 seasons at Northwestern from 2006-22. He has not coached at the collegiate level since. Fitzgerald, who was a hall of fame linebacker and a longtime defensive assistant with the Wildcats, departed Evanston with a 110-101 overall record. His 110 wins and 64 Big Ten conference wins were both program records. As were his 10 bowl appearance and his five wins in bowl games. Fitzgerald also became the first Northwestern coach to ever lead the Wildcats to back-to-back bowl appearances. Northwestern made it to the postseason five straight times from 2008-12 and four straight times from 2015-18. \nHe was named the 2020 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year after guiding Northwestern to a 7-2 record, including an appearance in the Big Ten Championship Game and a win against Auburn in the Citrus Bowl. The Wildcats also finished top 10 in the AP poll for the first time since 1995. Fitzgerald's tenure ended in controversy Though he had his fair share of successes at Northwestern, Fitzgerald's career with the Wildcats ended quickly. Outside of that COVID-shortened 2020 season, he won just seven games from 2019-22. Northwestern also finished with just one win in Big Ten play each year in that span except 2020. Northwestern went 1-11 in 2022 -- Fitzgerald's final season -- with losses to Miami (Ohio) and FCS Southern Illinois. Fitzgerald's 14-31 record from 2019-22 was the worst of any four-year span during his tenure. \nOn July 8, 2023, Fitzgerald was suspended without pay for two weeks after reports emerged alleging graphic incidents of hazing within the program. He was fired three days later after university administrators opted to revisit his status when The Daily Northwestern student newspaper published details of the hazing provided by two former players. Fitzgerald claimed that he was \"not aware of the alleged incidents.\" An investigation conducted by Northwestern also found that the hazing was \"well-known by many in the program,\" though it was not determined whether or not Fitzgerald knew about it. In Aug. 2025, Fitzgerald and Northwestern reached a settlement regarding the former coach's wrongful termination lawsuit against the university. \nMichigan State acts quickly Michigan State fired Smith and moved to hire Fitzgerald in a span of less than two hours. That's big for the Spartans, as it seems they had a solid plan in place with the high school early signing period approaching this week. That means Fitzgerald will have at least a couple of days to evaluate Michigan State's roster and its current recruiting class, which ranks No. 32 in the 247Sports Team Composite. That's good for 10th among Big Ten schools. He'll likely prioritize retaining the commitment of wide receiver Samson Gash, a four-star product of Novi, Michigan's Catholic Central High School. Gash is one of two four-star prospects in Michigan State's 2026 recruiting class. \nFitzgerald will also have plenty of time to assess things before the winter transfer window opens in January. He may need that time to adjust, given how long he's been out of coaching. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Despite the Cleveland Browns scoring just one touchdown in a 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, quarterback Shedeur Sanders will get another look as the starter next week against the Tennessee Titans. Coach Kevin Stefanski declined to comment on whether he locked up the role for good or if he remains in a week-to-week competition with Dillon Gabriel.The announcement came after an ESPN report stated the Browns are open to giving Sanders an \"extended look\" in the starting job. They previously gave Gabriel a six-game opportunity, but after he suffered a concussion in the last of those starts, he ceded the job to his fellow rookie.Sanders made his second career start in the loss to the 49ers and completed 16 of 25 passes for 149 yards and a touchdown. He also ran once for a 6-yard gain.\"He's battling like all of our guys are battling,\" Stefanski said of Sanders. \"I know there's plays he wants back, but we'll look at it and we'll correct it.\"\nAlthough it came in a losing effort, Sanders at times looked more comfortable running the offense than in his previous two outings. He was more accurate than in his starting debut against the Las Vegas Raiders when he went just 11 for 20, and he was dramatically more effective than his 4-for-16 relief appearance against the Baltimore Ravens.\"Obviously we lost, so I ain't play well,\" Sanders said. \"It's definitely things on film I'm gonna look back and want to get back and want to see, but at least moving forward I know what we could do differently going about the week and being able to get fully prepared for every possibility.\"Sanders, Cam Ward set for rookie duelIt will be a rookie-versus-rookie battle next week when the Browns host the Titans' No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward. Tennessee (1-11)  heads to Cleveland (3-9) on the heels of another blowout loss, this time a 25-3 defeat at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nSanders and Ward were often compared in the pre-draft process as first-round prospects. Ward lived up to expectations when he came off the board at No. 1, but Sanders experienced one of the most dramatic draft slides in recent memory when he slipped all the way to the fifth round. Neither found much success in the early going of their NFL careers.PlayerComp-AttYardsTDINTShedeur Sanders31-61 (50.1%)40522Cam Ward246-412 (59.7%)2,35176One of the quarterbacks will earn his second win of the year. A victory would give Sanders a winning record as a starter, while Ward is already in a much deeper hole with his larger sample size of 12 starts. If Sanders improves to 2-1 in his role, he could strengthen his grip on the job and distance himself from Gabriel, who logged just one win in his six opportunities atop the depth chart.\"In the midst of everything that's going on -- wins, losses, anything -- I remember when I wasn't playing,\" Sanders said. \"So I never forget that feeling. I try my best to not let that happen again, for me to be in that position.\"\n            ",

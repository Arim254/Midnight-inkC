Real Madrid are coming off an eventful weekend as the Spanish giants were whistled by the home fans following defeats against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final and the shocking loss against second division side Albacete in the Copa del Rey. Brazilian star Vinicius Jr was targeted by the Real Madrid fans on Saturday, as the player was constantly booed before and during the 2-0 win against Levante. Spanish manager Arbeloa spoke ahead of the game in the pre-game press conference on the situation that involves the home fans and the Real Madrid star. \"What he wants, and what I expect, want and wish for, is that the Bernabeu will support and get behind every player and of course, that includes Vinicius Jr. This is a guy who has been writing his story at Real Madrid for many years. He's given us two Champions League titles and many magical nights. He needs the Bernabeu to bring out his best. He has a huge heart, he's very emotional, and his football reflects that. He loves this badge and the fans; he wants them on his side. As a coach, I would love to see a Bernabeu that stands behind its players.\"Here's what you need to know ahead of the match against AS Monaco that will take place on Tuesday: Viewing informationDate: Tuesday, Jan. 20 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio Santiago Bernabeu -- MadridLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Real Madrid -338; Draw +500; AS Monaco +756Possible lineupsReal Madrid XI: Thibaut Courtois; Federico Valverde, Raul Asencio, Dean Huijsen, Fran Garcia; Arda Guler, Aurelien Tchouameni, Jude Bellingham; Franco Mastantuono, Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior.AS Monaco XI: Philipp Koehn; Vanderson, Thilo Kehrer, Eric Dier, Caio Henrique; Maghnes Akliouche, Jordan Teze, Denis Zakaria; Aleksandr Golovin; Mika Biereth, Folarin Balogun.PredictionReal Madrid will be back at the Santiago Bernabeu after what happened over the weekend and it will also be the Champions League debut for the new coach Alvaro Arbeloa.

    "body": "\n        After an abbreviated stop in Hawaii, the 2026 PGA Tour schedule begins the West Coast Swing with The American Express 2026 beginning on Thursday at the Pete Dye Stadium Course in La Quinta, Calif. After skipping the one-week Hawaii Swing, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is set to make his 2026 debut as part of The American Express field. The four-time major winner hasn't played particularly well in this event, however, recording just one top-10 finish in five tries. Still, the 2026 American Express odds list Scheffler as the clear-cut +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300). Ben Griffin, ranked No. 8 in the world, is next on the PGA odds board at +1900, with Robert MacIntyre at +2000 and Ludvig Aberg at +2200. Before locking in any 2026 American Express picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 American Express predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at The American Express 2026: Sam Burns, one of the favorites at +2500, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to avoid at La Quinta this week. Burns had some highlights in 2025, including finishing T7 at the Tour Championship after a strong playoff run. There were also some low points as well like going nine straight tournaments without a top-20 finish, including three straight missed cuts in that run. He has a pair of top-10 finishes at The American Express, but no top-5s, and he finished T29 last year, so the model doesn't like him as a top contender this week. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Matt Fitzpatrick a top-four contender this week even though he's tied for the eighth-lowest odds at +3000. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. This will be his debut at The American Express, but he finished 2025 strong with four top-10 finishes in his last six events. He finished the season 34th in Strokes Gained: Total and 30th in Strokes Gained: Putting, making him a golfer to target with slightly longer odds this week. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 American Express picksThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of +2700 or higher as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 American Express, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

On the field, Indiana is peerless, ranking second in the nation in both scoring offense and scoring defense, despite having the ninth-hardest strength of schedule. Heisman winner, and Miami native, Fernando Mendoza has more touchdown passes (8) than incompletions (5) during Indiana's CFP run, and he plays on the most disciplined team in college football. No team has a better turnover differential than the Hoosiers, who also average the fifth-fewest penalties per game in the country. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Miami can cover In addition to having home-field advantage, Miami also has a spread edge with Carson Beck under center. He's both won and covered in nine straight versus ranked foes, while the Hurricanes are on a 7-0 ATS run against Top 25 teams. Miami has a pair of future first-round draft picks on its D-line as the Canes average the fourth-most sacks per game in FBS. That pass rush is a strength which plays into what's Indiana's biggest weakness. Mendoza has been under pressure recently as he's been sacked an average of 2.5 times over his last six games, following only going down 0.8 times over his first nine games. On the other hand, Beck should have plenty of time in the pocket as Miami allows the lowest pressure rate in the nation. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Indiana picksSeverance has analyzed Indiana vs. Miami and is leaning Under on the total.

Hurricanes in the 2026 College Football Playoff National Championship game on Monday. Miami (13-2) upset Texas A&M and Ohio State in the first two rounds and then won and covered (-3.5) against Ole Miss in the semifinals. Indiana (15-0) has breezed through its CFP schedule after enjoying a first-round bye, beating Alabama 38-3 in the quarterfinals and dominating Oregon 56-22 in the semifinals.

In 15 games, he has completed 73% of his passes for 3,349 yards and 41 touchdowns with just six interceptions. He also has rushed 83 times for 284 yards and six scores. In the national semifinal win over the Oregon Ducks, he completed 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards and five touchdowns. Mendoza's elite accuracy makes Indiana's offense extremely tough to stop, but the Hoosiers are also incredibly strong on defense. Indiana finished the regular season ranked fourth nationally in total defense.

In 15 games, he has completed 73.3% of his passes for 3,581 yards and 29 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. He has also rushed for a pair of touchdowns. In the national semifinal win over Ole Miss, he completed 23 of 37 passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns with one interception. The Miami ground attack is led by junior running back Mark Fletcher Jr. In 13 games this season, he has carried 199 times for 1,080 yards (5.4 average) and 10 touchdowns. Miami's defensive front could be an x-factor in this matchup.

    "body": "\n        Miami came up just short in the College Football Playoff National Championship, but that doesn't take anything away from the Hurricanes' magical run through the CFP in 2025-26. Mario Cristobal led the program to its best season in 24 years, including three program-changing postseason wins that can serve as proof of concept for his plans for the future. Coaches said this week that Miami is a year ahead of schedule in Cristobal's fourth season, which raises the obvious question: What does 2026 look like? The roster remains loaded even with several projected departures, and the Hurricanes are poised to make another splash with Duke quarterback Darian Mensah expected to sign at any moment.Miami may already boasts the ACC's most expensive roster, and that investment paid off in 2025. The Hurricanes' postseason run netted the program at least $20 million in College Football Playoff payouts. An early-season home loss to Louisville and an overtime setback at SMU -- Miami's first game outside Florida -- could have derailed the year. Instead, the Hurricanes rallied to win four straight games, slipped into the CFP as the final at-large team and validated the idea that strong late-season play deserves weight in the selection process. That path could influence committee thinking in 2026 and beyond.Miami is positioned to return perhaps the most talented roster in the ACC next season, but significant holes must be filled. Quarterback Carson Beck is headed to the NFL, while defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. and right tackle Francis Mauigoa are projected first-round picks. That turnover comes with success for a program that had a school-record 19 players earn all-conference honors.\nIs it playoff-or-bust again for Cristobal?It starts in the trenchesMiami won't just be replacing its quarterback and top pass rusher. The Hurricanes must also rebuild an offensive line that could lose as many as four starters. That unit started the same five players in every game this season -- one of only eight teams nationally with that level of continuity.The veteran group allowed just 51 negative plays entering the postseason, the fourth-best mark in the FBS. The departures of Mauigoa, center James Brockermeyer, left tackle Markel Bell and right guard Anez Cooper will be a major storyline this spring, even as most attention centers on the quarterback position.Cristobal prides himself on building from the inside out, and the former Miami offensive lineman has stayed true to that philosophy.\nThe Hurricanes may be strongest on the interior, with senior Matthew McCoy and junior Samson Okunlola set to return. Miami also signed five-star Jackson Cantwell, the nation's No. 2 offensive tackle in the 2026 class.Is Mensah the next playoff quarterback?Miami's pursuit of Duke quarterback Darian Mensah is the worst-kept secret of the portal cycle. He is expected to join the Hurricanes in the near future.Cristobal and offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson have taken a Moneyball-like approach in recent offseasons, targeting players with comparable production rather than identical skill sets. That philosophy guided Miami's aggressive pursuit of Beck a year ago after he left Georgia. While Beck didn't offer the rushing element of former quarterback Cam Ward, his passing efficiency and yardage profile aligned with what Miami needed.\nMensah fits Dawson's vision, blending finesse with power. The ACC Championship Game MVP threw for 3,973 yards and 34 touchdowns against just six interceptions last season and appears primed to thrive in South Florida.Miami is widening the talent gapMiami's transfer portal success draws headlines, but its high school recruiting may be even more significant.The Hurricanes signed the ACC's top class in December, landing 30 prospects and finishing No. 10 nationally, according to 247Sports. The gap between Miami and the rest of the league continues to grow. Miami's class totaled 280.45 points in the 247Sports composite -- 25.58 more than the ACC's second-ranked class. Combined with a 19.36-point margin in 2023, the trend is unmistakable.\nTwenty-one of Miami's 30 signees are blue-chip prospects. That haul includes three blue-chip offensive linemen, highlighted by Cantwell, and six blue-chip defensive backs.A tougher road in 2026Miami opened the season with a marquee win over Notre Dame, a head-to-head result that helped propel the Hurricanes into the CFP. Next season, Miami travels to Notre Dame on Nov. 7.That trip is part of a more demanding schedule that includes an expanded nine-game ACC slate, a road game at Clemson and a cross-country flight to Stanford. How the conference arranges those road trips could go a long way in determining whether Miami returns to the playoff conversation.\nFor Cristobal and the Hurricanes, the margin remains thin -- and the expectations are no longer theoretical.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Mario Cristobal stood alone, his eyes scanning for Miami players, heads down and feet dragging toward the locker room ",
    "body": "\n        MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Mario Cristobal stood alone, his eyes scanning for Miami players, heads down and feet dragging toward the locker room as a shower of red-and-white confetti littered the night sky and settled onto the field.He hugged and consoled those who approached him near the 19-yard line along the Hurricanes' sideline. This was not how it was supposed to end. This was supposed to be Miami's coronation. A generation had waited for this moment. Instead, the Hurricanes watched upstart Indiana celebrate a pitch-perfect season with a 27-21 victory and a national championship on Miami's home field at Hard Rock Stadium.It was not until Cristobal sat next to his players roughly 30 minutes later that emotion cracked his voice or softened his stern expression.\"I want to do well by them, and the fact that they leave here without the national title in hand, that -- that,\" Cristobal glanced down with a hard swallow, \"is really hard to deal with that.\"\nMiami (13-3) had chances to unseat college football's darling, but Indiana (16-0) kept the Hurricanes at arm's length throughout the night. Miami never led, but twice cut double-digit deficits to seize momentum. When the defense forced a late field goal and handed quarterback Carson Beck the ball with less than two minutes remaining -- the same script that carried Miami past Ole Miss weeks earlier -- the moment felt inevitable.\"I was telling them, it's another Wednesday practice,\" senior receiver CJ Daniels said. \"We do two-minute (drills) every Wednesday. We had the same situation a couple weeks ago versus Ole Miss, so I thought we were gonna be able to go down and get the job done.\"But things happen.\"Beck, who threw only two interceptions during Miami's seven-game winning streak entering the title game, made the lone mistake that defined the night. Miami aligned in trips to the boundary, with two receivers breaking open to his right. Instead, Beck turned left, hunting a bigger play with Keelan Marion streaking up the sideline. Beck wanted it all: a massive gain, maybe a game-winning touchdown.\nWith no threat in the flat, Indiana defensive back Jamari Sharpe drove across the field, undercut the route and intercepted the underthrown pass.Game over.\"You can sit back and think of every if-and-or-but situation, but, you know, that's what happened and it sucks,\" Beck said. \"It's going to sting for a while.\"The play was there as a cornerback funneled Miami inside, but Beck's throw was too short and not wide enough against Indiana's Cover 2 defense. On the opposite side of the formation, freshman Malachi Toney -- Miami's go-to threat all night -- climbed the sideline and was open in a tight window. He finished with 10 catches for 112 yards and two touchdowns.\n\"Ultimately, I don't think it was a bad place to go with the ball,\" offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson said. \"I kinda like the way he went with the ball.\"Championships often collapse into a single moment, even though they are decided long before the final snap. A stop here, a throw there, and Miami is lifting the trophy.\"The gravity of this game, if you psychoanalyze it, there probably would be 10 other reasons,\" Dawson said.\nThat was not the message afterward.For the first time in 24 years, Miami had ignited something in this city again. Even with more than 30,000 Indiana fans flooding South Florida and outbuying the home crowd, there was still something to cling to late Monday night.\"We've set the standard, you've got to get it over the hump,\" Miami athletic director Dan Radakovich told CBS Sports.The night carried uglier moments, too. Emotions boiled over. After the game, Miami running back Mark Fletcher Jr. struck Indiana defensive lineman Tyrique Tucker before staffers intervened.\nCristobal chose to focus on what had been built.He pointed to the seniors and to future first-round pass rusher Rueben Bain Jr. as the foundation of the program he began reshaping four years ago.\"They had the guts, the faith and the trust to look at a place that was a complete mess and say, 'I'm going to be the person, I'm going to be a man of action, and I'm going to make things real, and I'm going to make the University of Miami a prominent program once again -- and we're going to win and we're going to win big and we're going to change the culture,\" Cristobal said. \"That's not easy. A lot of people look at that, they shy away from it. These guys are legitimate big-time human beings.\"A year after Miami wasted a generational offense with a defense that struggled to hold opponents under 30 points, the Hurricanes retooled through the transfer portal and hired defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman. His defenses at Minnesota and James Madison finished in the top 10 nationally each season. Miami also convinced Beck, a pro-bound quarterback, to finish his career in Coral Gables.\nBeck arrived with a surgically repaired elbow and more doubt than he admitted.\"I was in just a really dark place and trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel was a really difficult thing,\" said Beck, who left Georgia with two national titles but never started in a championship game. \"There was just a lot going on mentally, physically, emotionally and to be able to battle and fight through the roller coaster that life is, I really couldn't have done it without all these people around me.\"Minutes after the biggest loss of his career, Beck called the season the best year of his life.\"This university truly saved me,\" he said, \"and helped me rebuild into the man that I am today.\"\nWhat comes next for Miami is uncertain. In college football, rosters change overnight, and even the losingest programs can morph into champions -- as Curt Cignetti has done at Indiana, now a national title winner with a 27-2 record in two seasons.\"You don't just automatically return to a game like this just because you're mad,\" Cristobal said. \"That's the biggest misconception in sports; 'Well, they almost got there, they'll be back next year.' That's a bunch of bull. You've got to imply all the lessons learned, you got to improve from a roster standpoint, a regimen standpoint, discipline, everything, and move forward, and these guys have set the standard to help us get there.\"Cristobal arrived at Miami hoping to restore a national power that dominated the 1980s, when the Hurricanes won four national titles in eight years and another in 2001. Several of his former teammates from the 1987 championship team were inside Hard Rock Stadium, some lining the sideline -- reminders of the past and, perhaps, the future.\n\"They're the best thing that's happened to Miami and the University of Miami in over two decades,\" Cristobal said of the 2025 Hurricanes.He rejects the phrase \"The U is back.\" He prefers something harder: a New U, built for an era where dynasties are fragile and opportunity is fleeting.As Indiana celebrated nearby, one of Cristobal's old teammates stood close -- Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, a sideline fixture and consoler of the inconsolable. His job was simple: hug players, steady them and remind them what this meant.\n\"All we need to do is get back on this stage,\" Irvin told CBS Sports after embracing players outside the Hurricanes' locker room. \"We completed the first phase of building back to the dynasty that we know and wanted to be. We got there. Now, when these top players around here start thinking about where they're going, they'll remember the excitement that lit up this city and they'll want to be a part of it.\"Next time, we'll finish.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- As heavy cigar smoke wafted through the room and celebratory Hoosier beers cracked open, a song started blaring inside the celebratory Indiana locker room. With cigars in hand, newly crowned national champion Indiana players smiled and danced as Bankroll Fresh's \"Take Over Your Trap\" blared inside the bowels of Hard Rock Stadium. \"Walk in your trap and take over your trap,\" the lyrics went. There was no coincidence here. Indiana just beat Miami inside its home stadium, 27-21, to win a historic national championship. The traditional Big Ten football bottom-dweller knocked off \"The U\" with all those famous former players like Michael Irvin, Ray Lewis and Ed Reed having to watch in horror. Indiana not only beat the Hurricanes on the field but in the stands, too. \"We definitely flipped Miami's home stadium,\" left tackle Carter Smith said. \"These fans have done an amazing job rallying behind us.\" \nTwo years ago, this felt impossible. Indiana winning a national championship … in football?! The losingest program in college football history?! And doing it in as dominant fashion as possible as it dispatched powerhouse programs Ohio State, Alabama, Oregon and Miami for a perfect 16-0 record that will go down as one of the all-time great teams. It's the greatest turnaround story in sports history. Indiana didn't just take over Miami's trap. \n        \n            \n                Where Indiana ranks among college football's best teams of 21st century after CFP title game win over Miami\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIndiana wrested control over college football with a quirky, 64-year old coach who took the most improbable path possible to joining the exclusive club as a national champion. Only Curt Cignetti would have left an Alabama program coming off a national championship for Division-II Indiana University of Pennsylvania. The journey from IUP to Elon to James Madison and finally, Indiana for college football immortality will prompt a cottage industry of books, documentaries and commemorative memorabilia. He took the road less traveled, and forever changed college football in the process. \"Don't put no limitations on this,\" receiver Elijah Sarratt said. \"Indiana isn't just little old Indiana anymore. We're here to stay.\"\nThis wasn't a team that did it the traditional way through five-star prospects. CBS Sports' Bud Elliott's famous blue-chip ratio, which has correctly predicted since 2013 the teams capable of winning a national championship, finally busted. On paper, Indiana should not have been capable of winning a national championship with only seven players rated as four-star prospects coming out of high school. \"Are there eight first-round draft choices on this team? Probably not, no, there aren't,\" Cignetti said. \"But this team, the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.\"Cignetti found value in the market inefficiencies. He built a veteran-laden team full of guys who came with him from James Madison and key transfers like quarterback Fernando Mendoza. He brought what turned out to be the nation's best coaching staff, full of like-minded film junkies who knew exactly what Cignetti wanted in players and how to bring the best out of them once they got on campus. He capitalized on Indiana finally deciding it didn't want to be a laughingstock in football anymore and was willing to invest significant financial resources to change that reality. \n\"It's somewhat entrepreneurial in that you have to differentiate yourself and you have to stand out when people aren't taking you seriously,\" Indiana alumnus and billionaire booster Mark Cuban told CBS Sports. \"That's what it was when Cig came, and that's exactly what he did.\"Monday night was Indiana's toughest challenge of the College Football Playoff. After beating Alabama and Oregon by a combined score of 94-25, the Hurricanes made the Hoosiers work for it. Miami's 1-2 punch of Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor battered and bloodied Indiana star quarterback Fernando Mendoza. By the end of the game, one of the men responsible for protecting Mendoza, center Pat Coogan, said he was on his third blood-soaked towel. Mendoza took a big shot on what looked like a late hit in the first quarter, leading to a bloodied lip. Cignetti was furious over the non-call. The Miami native never seemed to let it impact his play, however. The Heisman Trophy winner never backed down. \n\"He got up slow after a few of them, so it was in the back of my mind, but he's tough as hell,\" offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan told CBS Sports. \"Super competitive. He's strong enough, big enough to take on some of those blows. Just super tough.\"\"When he's out there bleeding for us,\" Smith said, \"we have to do the same thing for him\" There were moments when Indiana's offensive line struggled to contain Miami's stars, but on the biggest play of the night, they delivered. On a fourth-and-4 from Miami's 12-yard line, the offensive line did exactly as it was asked on a quarterback draw, and Mendoza made the play of his college career, fighting his way through Miami defenders before leaping into the endzone for a 12-yard touchdown. There will be paintings and framed photographs of that Mendoza leap for years to come. \nIndiana's perfect 16-0 season makes it three consecutive Big Ten national champions. As the game neared its finish and Miami tried to launch one final rally, Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti nervously watched alongside Indiana athletic director Scott Golson and university president Pam Whitten. When Miami quarterback Carson Beck threw the game-sealing interception, the trio exploded in celebration with big hugs. Dolson, who got his start as a student manager under Bobby Knight, wore a \"I can't believe this is real\" look of wonder and pure joy on his face. \"The Big Ten postseason gauntlet continues,\" an ecstatic Big Ten official said. \"Three-and-oh.\"Said Sarratt: \"Big Ten baby, that's what we do. Best conference in football, man.\"\nCignetti will go down as quite possibly the greatest hire in college football history for what he's been able to accomplish in just two seasons in Bloomington. Don't expect Cignetti to get complacent, either. He's too competitive, too obsessed with chasing perfection to allow himself to slip. It's the characteristic that is most reminiscent of his former boss in Tuscaloosa, Nick Saban, who famously was so good at turning the page after a championship it was as if he hadn't won one at all. \"I think next week when when he doesn't have a game to prepare for, he may be miserable to be around,\" tight ends coach Grant Cain told CBS Sports before the game. \"He loves doing this. That's what gets him going, what keeps him going and I think that's one of the reasons he took this job at Indiana. He wanted one more challenge, and that's just who he is as a person.\" \nEarly Tuesday morning, with confetti still scattered all across Hard Rock Stadium, his mind was already turning to player draft decisions. He did, at least, allow himself a celebratory beer of Hoosier Lager. \"This was absolutely the best beer of my life,\" Cignetti said,\" and made me want to have another.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        At the onset of the year, I made a list of goals I want to accomplish in my own personal golf game. They have your run-of-the-mill hits, of course, like playing more rounds, making a hole-in-one and going on a buddies trip, but there are two actions items that have been seared into my brain the last few weeks because the way in which they run, counterintuitive to each other.You see, I want to lower my handicap to the lowest figure of my life. I want to play smarter golf. I want to shoot scores in the 60s and feel the rush of stringing together birdie after birdie. I want that plus sign next to my name again. But, the thing is, I still want to be able to hit shots while I accomplish this. I want to shape them. I want to flight them. I want to use the conditions to carve them. I want to play Golf with a capital G, even if this tightrope act may ultimately be one which results in a faceplant. It's just more fun that way, score be damned.You may read this and think, \"Well, yeah, you have to hit shots in order to play golf,\" but actually, I don't think you do. At least not the type of golf you have in mind. I'm talking about the type of golf that was on display at Waialae Country Club this past weekend at the Sony Open. \nMeasuring around 7,000 yards and playing to a par 70, the Seth Raynor design should be obsolete by now. The game should have passed it by, but yet it remains and is still one of players' favorites for what it requires out of them. It's not distance that they need but rather skill -- the ability to hit different shots out of different windows at different times while considering a whole myriad of factors.Now, that is timeless.\n        \n            \n                Chris Gotterup runs pulls away from field to win 2026 Sony Open, first tournament of PGA Tour season\n                \n                    Patrick McDonald                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen trying to compare eras in different sports, a common refrain among those who side with recent or active players is that these guys become more athletic through general evolution, right? Technology has improved. Equipment and training aids have become more helpful. Data is being implemented in ways to drive decisions like never before. Players' eating habits are way better. They rarely consume alcohol and stick to the same meals that they know fuel them in the most effective manner. Workouts are getting more out of them, while recovery methods like cold plunges and red light therapy restore muscles and alleviate aches and pains in a blink of an eye.\nWhile not basketball or football players, golfers fall in this same boat. Equipment is a far cry from what it was at the start of the century as big mis-hits continue to be a thing of the past. Driving ranges are littered with Trackman and Foresight launch monitors as some players are beholden to their numbers like toddlers with a tablet in front of them.On the golf course, players and caddies know where to press their luck and can quantify how much more advantageous it may be to take, say, driver off the tee on a certain hole as opposed to laying back and playing for position.As such, many believe golfers have gotten better. I'm not here to say they haven't -- I mean, have you seen what Scottie Scheffler has done the last four years? Have you seen Rory McIlroy when he is firing on all cylinders? -- but I don't think all of them have. I think the bulk have just become more efficient.\nThey have gotten better at identifying the path of least resistance, taking it and attempting to put as few strokes as possible on their scorecard. That's the name of the game, after all, isn't it?This weekend in golf got me thinking about this. Over in Dubai, blustery conditions wreaked havoc on players in the second round to the point that 2019 Open champion Shane Lowry took to social media and expressed how much fun he had in them. He signed for a 3-under 68 and beat the field average by nearly six strokes.\"It was refreshing playing in those conditions today,\" Lowry wrote. \"Fun needing to shape shots and hitting 8 irons 130 yards.\"\nOn the other side of the the planet, something similar unfolded at the Sony Open. In what some believe to be the last trip the PGA Tour takes to Hawaii due to future scheduling changes, Waialae Country Club enjoyed one last hoorah. From Thursday afternoon through Saturday, players were forced to play golf with a capital G. If you weren't about it, you were on your flight back to the mainland on Friday.Nearly everything had to be accounted for on every shot -- varying wind directions depending on which way the hole ran, shot shapes and run outs and how they affected the total yardage, where the correct miss was. Golf may be played in an arena during the early portion of the week, but when it actually matters and real stakes are on the line, it is best that it remains an outdoor sport.\"On a driving range you're not normally hitting a lot of those shots,\" Jordan Spieth said. \"You're not hitting 5-iron from 160 and trying to like chip it. You just get a really good gauge on where things are at, and when you're doing it well it's really fun.\"\nIn a perfect world, this would be the case every week. Golfers required to play golf, required to do more than see the target, know the number and swing away. The juggling act in between the ears of deciding which variables to weigh and which to ignore is an integral part of the game. It's where the elite separate themselves even more.Instead, there are only a handful of instances each year in which the confluence of variables set the table in such a way. It's part golf course, part time of year and part luck. For the 2026 season, it happened to be served in the first week, and although the PGA Tour may be leaving Hawaii in the future, I hope the tournament was enough to remind them it doesn't need to leave the golf behind, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty images\n            \n            \n    \n        Kansas coach Bill Self did not make the trip with his team to Boulder, Colorado, and will not coach the Jayhawks' game against the Buffaloes on Tuesday night. Self, 63, felt sickness on Monday and, according to a two-sentence press release from KU, went to the hospital to make sure matters weren't worse. Fortunately, it seems all is OK.\"Bill Self felt under the weather earlier today and, out of an abundance of caution, was taken to [Lawrence Memorial Hospital] Health where he received IV fluids. He is feeling better but did not accompany the team to Boulder,\" the release said.A source told CBS Sports that the acting coach for the game will be determined either late Monday night or early Tuesday morning. Jeremy Case is KU's associate head coach, while longtime assistant Kurtis Towsend has experience coaching in Self's stead. KU also recently brought on alum and veteran NBA assistant Jacque Vaughn. \nMonday's trip to the hospital was the latest health event for Self, who did not coach in the 2023 Big 12 and NCAA tournaments after having a heart procedure to insert two stents to alleviate blood flow. Self had a second significant hospital stay for heart treatment last summer. At Big 12 Media Day last October, a slimmed-down Self told CBS Sports, \"I feel better now than I have in a long time.\"It's been a bit of a bumpy season for Kansas. The Jayhawks are 13-5 and coming off an 80-62 home win Friday against Baylor, but that was just the ninth game out of 18 of which star freshman guard Darryn Peterson was available. Peterson's battled an annoying hamstring problem for the entire season. Not having Self for the Colorado game is the latest disruption for a program looking to bounce back after going 21-13 last year, its worst campaign in Self's 23-year tenure.\nBarring any setbacks, Self is expected to resume his coaching duties when the team returns for practice later in the week. KU plays Saturday at in-state rival Kansas State.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Chicago Bears coach Ben Johnson rolled the dice often this season en route to an NFC North title and nearly eight quarters of playoff football, trusting Caleb Williams and a talented offense to convert in critical situations -- until the waning seconds of regulation on Sunday night's classic following an epic touchdown toss to Cole Kmet.Johnson said he considered a two-point conversion try with 18 seconds to play rather than tie the game with a PAT and play for overtime, but had strong reasoning for his decision prior to Chicago's 20-17 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.\"Thought about it,\" Johnson said. \"Probably what played a little bit of a factor was our goal-to-go situations hadn't gone very clean. Our inside the five-[yard line] plan hadn't worked out quite like we had hoped. I just felt better about taking our chances there in overtime.\"The Bears converted 57% of their two-point conversion attempts this season, which was above the league average per Stats Muse, and converted a NFL-leading 15 times on fourth downs en route to a playoff berth. Johnson has a handful of trick plays his team executed well this fall, but when it was time to potentially offer another one up to get to the NFC Championship, the offensive guru declined.Johnson trusted Chicago's defense, a unit that came up with a three-and-out stop on the Rams' first possession prior to Williams' interception in the extra session. The Bears turned it over three times on mistakes from their franchise quarterback and were stuffed on a fourth-and-goal attempt with 3:06 remaining in the fourth quarter on Williams' incompletion to Luther Burden.\nIt was that errant throw and run-game malfunctions near the goal line that made Johnson hesitate to gamble on a two-point conversion try rather than go with the confident approach he's shown as Chicago's play-caller in his first season.\"It's tough. In these moments you feel that you let your team down,\" Williams said his interception in overtime led to the Rams' game-winning field goal several players later. \"It's a good lesson learned for us, first time being in this situation for me and for us as a team. I'm excited for what's to come, but obviously going to go back and watch this and figure out how I can be better.\"Williams finished with 257 yards and two touchdowns, including the 14-yard heave in the back of the end zone to Kmet on a pass that traveled 51 yards in the air and sent Soldier Field into a frenzy.\n\"They all believed, man,\" Johnson said. \"They all believed that we could find a way to win each and every week. And so it's disappointing like that. I'm proud of the group. It's a special group.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Robert Saleh is returning to the main chair, finalizing a deal to become head coach of the Tennessee Titans, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Saleh, 46, spent the 2025 season in his second stint as defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers, managing an injured unit that nevertheless advanced to the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs.Titans brass spent Monday interviewing Saleh and Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy before selecting Saleh, who will get a second chance at helming an NFL franchise. He previously led the New York Jets to a 20-36 record over three-plus seasons, getting fired five games into the 2024 campaign.After going 4-12 in 2021, he guided the Jets to consecutive 7-10 seasons on the strength of a defense that finished fourth and 12th in the NFL in points allowed, respectively. In 2023, the Jets' season was quickly derailed by Aaron Rodgers' Achilles injury, sustained during the team's first offensive series of the season.Similar to his start with the Jets, Saleh is linking with a Titans team that has not had much success in recent years. The Titans finished 3-14 this season, last in the AFC South. Tennessee got an up-close and personal look at Saleh in a 37-24 loss to San Francisco on Dec. 14. The Titans do have several promising young players, though, specifically quarterback Cam Ward, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. It'll be up to Saleh and his staff to help Ward and the rest of the Titans' young core realize their potential in the years to come.\nTennessee is slated to have the fourth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft this April.Saleh is the fourth head coach to land a job during this cycle. John Harbaugh recently came to terms with the New York Giants after he was fired by the Baltimore Ravens. Former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski was hired by the Atlanta Falcons, where he will succeed Raheem Morris, who was fired after leading Atlanta to consecutive 8-9 campaigns. The Miami Dolphins hired former Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley on Monday afternoon after somewhat-surprisingly firing Mike McDaniel. With Saleh heading to Nashville, there are now six remaining head coaching vacancies. The Buffalo Bills' job opened up Monday morning after Sean McDermott was fired despite going 98-50 during his nine seasons as the team's coach. The Ravens, Browns, Las Vegas Raiders, Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals continue to conduct interviews as they look to fill their respective coaching vacancies in the coming weeks. \nAmong the notable head coaching candidates are Nagy, McDaniel, former Packers and Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiac, Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, Vikings defensive coordinator and former Dolphins coach Brian Flores, Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Rams pass game coordinator Nate Sheelhaase, former Giants coach Brian Daboll and Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Buffalo Bills have fired coach Sean McDermott following the team's AFC divisional round playoff loss to the Denver Broncos. Brandon Beane is being retained with the title of president of football operations/general manager and will help lead the search for Buffalo's next coach. \"Sean has done an [admirable] job of leading our football team the past nine seasons,\" Bills owner Terry Pegula said in a statement. \"But I feel we are in a need of a new structure within our leadership to give this organization the best opportunity to take our team to the next level. We owe that to our players and to Bills Mafia.\" McDermott, 51, had a largely successful nine-year run with the Bills that included five consecutive AFC East division titles from 2020-24. However, Buffalo went just 8-8 in the playoffs under McDermott with repeated gut-wrenching losses, including Saturday's 33-30 defeat to the Broncos that included several self-inflicted wounds. While McDermott led the Bills to the franchise's first road playoff win in 33 years a week earlier against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he was unable to snap Buffalo's longtime stretch without a Super Bowl appearance, which dates back to the 1993 season. Buffalo has been unable to advance past the AFC Championship despite having one of the NFL's best players in quarterback Josh Allen, whose eight playoff wins without a Super Bowl start is an NFL record. With Allen at quarterback, the Bills lost once in the wild-card round, four times in the divisional round, and twice in the AFC Championship.\nIn all, McDermott posted a 98-50 record with the Bills and made the postseason in eight of his nine seasons. McDermott's eight postseason wins are the most by any coach without a Super Bowl appearance. His 98 wins is the second-most in NFL history during a coach's first nine seasons. When McDermott arrived in 2017, the Bills had not been to the postseason since 1999.\"Sean helped change the mindset of this organization and was instrumental in the Bills becoming a perennial playoff team. I respect all the work, loyalty and attention to detail he showed for this team and community,\" Pegula said.McDermott released his own statement Monday night.For nearly a decade I have had the opportunity to wake up every morning as the Head Coach of the Buffalo Bills, which has truly been a gift. I want to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to the Pegula family, the Buffalo Bills organization, and to the fans for allowing me to live out the dream of being a Head Coach in the NFL in this incredibly special place.I am proud and humbled to have worked alongside amazing staff and players as we shared life together and poured out our hearts and souls into both winning football games and making a positive impact in our community. This community graciously embraced not only me but my family and in some ways helped raise our children over the last 9 years. For that I say thank you to all of the teachers, coaches, and friends whom we met along the way...the City of Good Neighbors! We Love You! We will miss Buffalo.Bills Mafia, you are one of one! It has been a joy and inspiration to witness your passion and commitment first hand. I always wanted our teams to play with the same level of toughness and grit that is true to Buffalo and that you demonstrate every day!God gave me and my family an incredible opportunity, one that we will cherish for the rest of our lives. Yet we know that HE has a plan.Thank you for allowing me to serve as your head coach.\n        \n            \n                Firing Sean McDermott is a risk. Promoting Brandon Beane is the real mistake.\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBuffalo's 73-27 record since 2020 is the best in the NFL. This season, the Bills became the fifth team in NFL history with six straight 11-win seasons. They also became the first team in NFL history to lose a playoff game by three points or less in three straight seasons. The Bills enter an offseason where they are slated to have just $3 million in projected cap space (which ranks 24th in the NFL) but will have at least one pick in each of the first five rounds of the upcoming NFL Draft. Receiver, defensive tackle and edge rusher are the Bills' biggest projected areas of need heading into the offseason. Buffalo also has several notable pending free agents, including pass rusher Joey Bosa, defensive lineman DaQuan Jones, center Connor McGovern and linebacker Matt Milano. McDermott is the latest in a string of high-profile coaching moves in the AFC. Mike Tomlin stepped down after 19 seasons leading the Pittsburgh Steelers and John Harbaugh was fired after 18 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens. Harbaugh has already landed with the New York Giants. With the Giants and Atlanta Falcons jobs filled (Atlanta hired Kevin Stefanski Sunday), the Bills become the eighth NFL opening, joining the Arizona Cardinals, Ravens, Cleveland Browns, Las Vegas Raiders, Miami Dolphins, Steelers and Tennessee Titans. \n            ",

The Hoosiers are seeking their first title in program history, while Miami is looking to claim its first championship since 2001.Indiana's road to the title game began earlier this month with a blowout 38-3 win over Alabama in the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl. That win marked the Hoosiers' first bowl game win of any kind since 1991. Curt Cignetti's program followed up that performance with an even more dominant showing the following week with a 56-22 win over Big Ten foe Oregon in the Peach Bowl.Bet Indiana vs. Miami at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Miami had to win three games away from South Florida to become the first team in the CFP era to play for the national title at its own stadium. The Hurricanes defeated Texas A&M 10-3 in the first round of the CFP before eliminating reigning national champion Ohio State in the CFP quarterfinals at the Cotton Bowl.\nFollow live updates as Indiana vs. Miami headlines in the CFP National ChampionshipThe Hurricanes punched their ticket to the title game with a dramatic 31-27 win over Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl after quarterback Carson Beck scored a go-ahead touchdown with 18 seconds remaining.Where to watch Miami vs. Indiana in CFP National ChampionshipGame: 2026 College Football Playoff National ChampionshipDate: Monday, Jan. 19 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, FloridaTV: ESPN | Live stream: fuboTV (Try for free)\nMiami vs. Indiana: Alternate viewing optionsField Pass with Pat McAfee Show -- ESPN2, fuboTV (Try for free)Film Room -- ESPNU, fuboTV (Try for free)Skycast -- ESPNEWS, fuboTV (Try for free)Field Pass with ACC Huddle  -- ACC Network, fuboTV (Try for free)All-22 with ESPN Radio, High Skycast, Command Center, hometown radio, halftime band performances and more available via ESPN's appMiami vs. Indiana storylinesMiami: Miami is seeking its sixth national championship in program history and first since 2001. Miami coach Mario Cristobal could become the first coach in the AP poll era (since 1936) to win a national title as a player and the coach of his alma mater. Cristobal played at Miami (1989-92) as an offensive tackle.With a win, Miami can become the third two-loss national champion in FBS history. The Hurricanes would join LSU (2007) and Ohio State (2024). It would also mark the second consecutive season that the 12-team CFP format produced a two-loss champion. Ohio State lost to Oregon and Michigan before winning four games in a row en route to a title.Miami's path to the CFP title game was difficult with three games away from home, but now the Hurricanes will do something that no team in the BCS or CFP era has done: play for a title at their home stadium. Miami has played at Hard Rock Stadium since 2008 and lost the Orange Bowl in 2017 to Wisconsin.\nIndiana: The Hoosiers are in the midst of one of the most unlikely turnarounds in college football history. The Hoosiers could become the lowest-ranked team (No. 20) in the AP preseason poll to win the national championship since Auburn, who began the season at No. 22, did it in 2010.The Big Ten (Michigan and Ohio State) has won the last two national titles. If Indiana wins, it would be the first time since the 1940s that the conference has won three consecutive national titles. It would also become the third time (SEC twice) a conference had won three consecutive national titles with three different schools.Indiana star quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Fernado Mendoza will be returning to South Florida for the national title game. Mendoza grew up near the Miami campus, and his father, Fernando Mendoza Sr., was teammates with Cristobal at Christopher Columbus High School in Miami.\nMiami vs. Indiana prediction, pickHaving watched Indiana up close at the Rose Bowl earlier this month, Cignetti's squad feels like a team of destiny. Indiana has everything you need to win a title. The Hoosiers are physical in the trenches on both sides of the football, have a star quarterback to pair with talented skill position players and are disciplined. This game is going to come down to who can control the line of scrimmage. I'll give the edge to Indiana, although Miami is very talented up front on both sides of the football. I don't think this will be a blowout, but Indiana wins by 10. Pick: Indiana -8.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Curt Cignetti had choices and the only one worth making was the right one. Indiana's unbeaten season had its storybook ending, a fourth-down touchdown run from Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza with 9:18 remaining to give the Hoosiers a 10-point cushion in Monday night's College Football Playoff National Championship.After a touchdown from Miami star Malachi Toney on the ensuring possession, the wind once again left Miami's sails as Indiana got the ball back, kicked a field goal and capped its season with a 27-21 win. The mostly-crimson crowd inside Hard Rock Stadium was on the cusp of jubilation throughout the second half as Indiana's crowning achievement neared -- solidifying the Hoosiers as one of college football's best all-time teams.Few believed it would happen in college football's expansion era, but it only took two postseasons for a worthy national champion to go end to end as an unblemished, 16-0 juggernaut. Cignetti's Hoosiers peaked at the right time, playing their best in the College Football Playoff against three top-10s, culminating with Monday's effort against the Hurricanes.\nWhat exactly constitutes \"best team\" when putting together a ranking like this? The overall makeup of talent factors in, how well you dominate your schedule relative to its toughness with wins over quality opponents and, frankly, eye test during the era in which a team captured a national championship. Only that season and those results matter, not the eventual number of draft picks or future performances.Sifting through college football's last 25 national champions, these are the best teams of the 21st century and where the unbeaten Hoosiers rank among them.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. 2019 LSU (15-0)Not since Miami's impressive run during the 1980s and early 1990s did a team show up to the field dripping with as much confidence and swagger as Ed Orgeron's Tigers in 2019. This team was different, evidenced by seven wins over top-10 teams including a 20-point average margin of victory over five top-5 opponents. Heisman-winning quarterback Joe Burrow (5,671 yards, 60 TDs, 6 INTs) and his two studs at wideout -- Ja'Marr Chase (84 catches, 1780 yards, 20 TDs) and Justin Jefferson (111, 1,540, 18) -- were just three of LSU's record-number of head turners on both sides of the football. Clyde Edwards-Helaire had a quiet 1,414 yards rushing with 16 touchdowns while the Tigers were a menace in the secondary defensively, fueled by five-star freshman Derek Stingley Jr.'s six interceptions and Jim Thorpe Award winner Grant Delpit at safety.\nLSU's 48.4 points per game is the second-highest average by a national champion since 2000, behind 2020 Alabama (48.5). The Tigers outscored their opponents by a combined total of 726-328, scoring 50-plus points in seven different games. Burrow's seven touchdown passes in the first half of LSU's semifinal win over Oklahoma remains the most notable individual performance in CFP history. In nine other seasons as a head coach, Oregon only eclipsed nine wins once and went 11-11 overall over his next two years in Baton Rouge.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. 2020 Alabama (13-0)The only team with three top-5 Heisman finishers over the past 25 years including winner DeVonta Smith, the Crimson Tide were unstoppable to the highest degree in 2020. Smith nuked program records with 117 catches for 1,856 yards and 23 touchdowns, while Mac Jones had a 4,500-yard season with a touchdown to interception ratio of 10:1. Najee Harris accumulated 1,466 yards rushing and 26 scores and was a threat as a pass-catcher, too. Freshman edge Will Anderson Jr.'s best numbers came the next two years, but he still notched 10.5 TFLs and seven sacks as a game-wrecker up front, along with Christian Barmore (8 sacks).Some stick an asterisk on the 2020 campaign given the mass schedule changes for many teams after the COVID-19 outbreak, but Alabama's slate was full, jam-packed with 10 SEC contests for the first time in history. The Crimson Tide's average margin of victory entering the league title game against Florida was 32.9 points per game, arguably the most impressive regular-season run in conference history highlighted by three wins over ranked competition -- Texas A&M, Georgia and Auburn. Alabama beat Florida in a 52-46 thriller in Atlanta before disposing of Notre Dame in the playoff semifinal prior to a 52-24 clobbering of Ohio State in the CFP title game. That Buckeyes team was unbeaten and coming off a 21-point win over Trevor Lawrence and Clemson in the semis.\nNick Saban's sixth national title at Alabama and seventh overall was his greatest feat, considering the Crimson Tide's defense rarely showed its usual strong effort reflected during much of the legend's historic tenure. In fact, Alabama's unit was the third-worst statistically ever to win a national championship, giving up 352.2 yards per game.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. 2025 Indiana (16-0)Good luck picking the right spot to squeeze Indiana within this list of elite title winners. Curt Cignetti and the Hoosiers did it their own way, a considerably different recipe toward victory offering the same, satisfying result. This wasn't a talent-laden roster full of four- and five-star recruits. These were seasoned college football players, all working as one with a level of synergy we haven't seen on the grand stage in the CFP era. Heisman-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza was terrific throughout, his individual laurels driven by a pair of fourth-quarter comebacks, while the Hoosiers' version of \"Moneyball\" through transfer portal acquisitions, enhanced preparation and player development came up aces. Indiana might not be the greatest team of the 21st century, but this performance from Cignetti was easily the top coaching job in the last 25 years.The Hoosiers only had to play two ranked opponents during the first 14 weeks of the season (Illinois and Oregon) before embarking on their season-defining run, enhanced by heightened execution against Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game, a backhanded slap of Alabama in the Rose Bowl and complete destruction of the Ducks in the Peach Bowl CFP semis. Monday night's victory over Miami to close it out was the gold star atop a worthy crown for Cignetti and his players, punctuating a singular campaign that won't soon be forgotten in college football postseason lore.\nObjectively, even the metrics love the Hoosiers. Only three times in the last decade has college football's national champion finished inside the top 5 in total offense and total defense. Indiana is one of those programs, joining 2022 Georgia and 2018 Clemson. Also, Indiana owns the best single-season point differential by a team in the CFP era at +473 (add Miami difference), which bests 2018 Clemson (+467) and 2019 LSU (+398). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. 2013 Florida State (14-0)Heisman winner Jameis Winston pushed the Seminoles to the third unbeaten season in program history during the final year of the Bowl Championship Series in 2013 with an all-time showing offensively. FSU's FBS-record margin of victory at 39.5 points per game still stands and the Seminoles led the country in scoring defense as well at 12.9 points per game under Jeremy Pruitt's tutelage on Jimbo Fisher's elite staff, which included six new additions during the offseason. The Seminoles annihilated ACC competition behind Wiinston's heroic campaign, including four wins over ranked teams (Maryland, Clemson, Miami, Duke) by an average of 41.2 points per game. FSU's 51-14 beatdown of Clemson on the road remains one of the program's best performances away from Doak Campbell Stadium in school history.FSU trailed Auburn at the Rose Bowl in the national championship game by 11 points at halftime before three lead changes over the final 4:31 of the fourth quarter provided the Seminoles with a 34-31 memorable win. Winston's go-ahead, 2-yard touchdown pass to Kelvin Benjamin with 13 seconds left capped a historic seven-play, 80-yard march after the Tigers had taken a 31-27 lead with just under 90 seconds to play. Winston led college football that season with a 184.8 passer rating after finishing with 4,057 yards, 40 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Benjamin and Rashad Greene each eclipsed 1,000 yards receiving while Kenny Shaw and tight end Nick O'Leary were nearly equally proficient as third and fourth options in the passing game.\nSixteen different players recorded interceptions on defense, driven by Nate Andrews (4) and P.J. Williams (3). Linebacker Telvin Smith was the team's leading tackler and Timmy Jernigan led pass-rush efforts with 4.5 sacks and a bevy of stops at nose. Only one team recruited on defense at an elite level in the ACC more than a decade ago and it was the Seminoles.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. 2001 Miami (12-0)There's a difference between the best team and the most-talented team, though the Hurricanes have an argument for both. This Hurricanes squad is often mentioned as one of the top in program history given their litany of stars, including six All-Americans -- Jeremy Shockey, Bryant McKinnie, Joaquin Gonzalez, Ed Reed, Phillip Buchanon and Todd Sievers. The standouts who did not earn AA status were equally impressive, difference-makers like Ken Dorsey, Clinton Portis, Willis McGahee, Vince Wilfork, Jonathan Vilma and Sean Taylor, among others.Under first-year coach Larry Coker, Miami destroyed the seven teams it played during Big East play outside of an 18-7 win at Boston College, which finished 8-4 that year with Brian St. Pierre at quarterback. The Hurricanes led 12-7 in the final minute of play on the strength of four field goals before Reed's 80-yard interception return sealed the victory. Notable wins included Penn State, 13th-ranked Florida State in Tallahassee, No. 15 Syracuse, 11th-ranked Washington, 14th-ranked Virginia Tech on the road and a 37-14 clubbing of Nebraska in the national championship game. Miami led 34-0 at intermission of that one against Huskers Heisman-winning quarterback Eric Crouch. Miami's overall talent level, relative to what the Hurricanes faced on a weekly basis against a favorable schedule, is why this team is outside of the top 5.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. 2018 Clemson (15-0)Many would argue Dabo Swinney's one-loss 2016 team with a Deshaun Watson-led offense from two years prior was more explosive after Clemson shattered numerous program records for total offense as its star quarterback finished with 5,222 total yards and 50 touchdowns (41 passing, nine rushing). However, freshman signal caller Trevor Lawrence and several first-round defensive linemen were even more dominant in 2018 when the Tigers captured another national title. Clemson played only two single-possession games (Texas A&M, Syracuse) and beat four ranked opponents by an average margin of 27 points per game, including the most lopsided defeat of Nick Saban's career at Alabama in the title game (44-16). The 14-0 Crimson Tide were led by Tua Tagovailoa and an elite defense, but were no match for Lawrence and the Tigers. During that season with Tony Elliott as offensive coordinator, the Tigers' offensive attack was paced by Lawrence's 3,280 yards passing and 30 touchdowns, Travis Etienne's 1,658 yards and 24 scores, and the duo of Justyn Ross and Tee Higgins on the outside. The ACC had no answers for any of those standouts.Clelin Ferrell led the Tigers with 11.5 sacks, followed by eight from Austin Bryant and six from Christian Wilkins. Clemson produced five first-team All-Americans in 2018, including offensive tackle Mitch Hyatt. Clemson's three consensus All-America selections in 2018 was a first in school history (Wilkins, Ferrell, Hyatt).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Gabriel Bonfim and Randy Brown took very different paths to their first UFC Fight Night main event. Bonfim is a relatively new addition to the UFC roster; meanwhile, Brown celebrates a decade with the promotion in January. They collide on Saturday night at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.Bonfim (18-1) is defending his ranking, but arguably has more to prove than his opponent. Bonfim became a top 15 welterweight off a controversial decision win over longtime contender Stephen \"Wonderboy\" Thompson. Two years ago, nearly to the day, he was knocked out by Nicolas Dalby. A close decision win over Brown, an unranked fighter approaching 10 years with the promotion, won't do him much good. Bonfim needs a standout performance.\"If I let Brown control the distance and keep the fight standing, he has an advantage, that's his game. But not with me,\" Bonfim told CBS Sports through a Portuguese interpreter. \" I'm very comfortable exchanging punches. I know he's afraid and weary of my ground game.\"\n        \n            \n                Jon Jones rips Tom Aspinall's skills after UFC 321: 'His wrestling and jiu-jitsu are incredibly overrated'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown (20-6) is determined to make the most of his first main event. He's a promising contender, but every time he builds steam, his momentum gets cut short by guys like Belal Muhammad, Jack Della Maddalena and Vicente Luque. But all that experience has given him a level head. Brown is coming off a KO win over Dalby, the only person to beat Bonfim, but he isn't putting much stock in it. Brown knows exactly what Bonfim did wrong, but he can't guarantee he'll make those mistakes again. \n\"I know exactly what he lost that fight and what happened. I can't assume he's in that same place. He was pushed, overwhelmed, got tired, and was stopped...\" Brown told CBS Sports. \"I can't bank on him making those same mistakes. For all I know, he's in the best shape of his life, and when he shows up he'll be ready to do 10 rounds.\" There isn't a lot to write home about on the undercard. Ricky Simon vs. Raoni Barcelos is solid matchmaking. Neither fighter is currently ranked, but they're veteran fighters who've mixed it up with the best. Simon notably holds a controversial win over reigning UFC bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili and has fought former WEC champ Urijah Faber. Barcelos mixed it up with title challenger Umar Nurmagomedov in recent years.Rising flyweights are set for the co-main event when Joseph Morales takes on Matt Schnell. Morales is fresh off winning The Ultimate Fighter 33 in August with a submission of Alibi Idiris in August. He had a previous run with UFC in 2017 and 2018 before three years of inactivity. He posted a 1-2 record in that time, including a TKO loss to former champion Deiveson Figueiredo. Schnell, meanwhile, has been a fixture since 2016 where he's posted a 7-7, 1 NC record. He ended a three-fight losing skid in April with a decision win over Jimmy Flick.\nBelow is the rest of the fight card for Saturday, with the latest odds before we get to a prediction and pick on the main event.

Many believe \"Wonderboy\" beat Bonfim. Dalby knocked him out. They were Bonfim's two most experienced opponents. Brown is another such veteran, having faced world-class competition for over a decade. He's fully capable of exploiting whatever holes Bonfim gives him, especially should he wilt over five rounds. Skill-wise, I lean towards Bonfim. He has fantastic submissions, judicious wrestling, and responsible striking defense. Thompson outstruck Bonfim in totality, but their significant strike outputs were almost identical. \nLast year, Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos took down Brown four times. The year before that, Della Maddalena submitted Brown -- one of only two submission wins in the champ's 20-fight pro career. There are conditions we should acknowledge in those two fights: Brown still beat Dos Santos, and Della Maddalena locked in the rear-naked choke off a knockdown. The fight benefits Brown the longer it goes. Ultimately, Bonfim shines more where Brown struggles. The inverse isn't quite as true. I'll take Bonfim, hesitantly, by submission. Bonfim via SUB2\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LUBBOCK, Texas -- The wait for Texas Tech forward JT Toppin to get back on the court after turning down the NBA in the offseason was longer than anticipated. A few days after a lower body injury kept him out of No. 10 Texas Tech's season-opening win against Lindenwood on Monday, it didn't take Toppin long to show he's ready for the 2025-26 season in Friday's 98-77 win against Sam Houston.Toppin won the opening tip for the Red Raiders and scored his first layup 16 seconds into the game. He quickly blocked a shot, grabbed a rebound and powered through for another layup. Even as Sam Houston ran a few impressive offensive sets to keep the game close for a half, Toppin's gravity wore the Bearkats down. \"I was a little winded, just first game,\" Toppin said. \"But it was exciting to get back out there and share the court with my teammates.\" Hard to stop ToppinIf Toppin's performance was a diminished version, Texas Tech's potential is limitless. Toppin finished with 31 points and 14 rebounds in 32 minutes. He added four assists, three steals and a block. But most dangerous, he was relentless attacking the basket. \nSam Houston threw several bodies at Toppin across the floor, but none were able to contain him. Toppin was fouled 13 times and helped foul out two of Sam Houston's players. He shot 10 of 16 on 2-point attempts, even as he tried to stretch his range out to the 3-point line. Later in the game, he started settling down and whipping passes from the mid-post out to open shooters. His four assists matches his season high from the 2025 season; a 30% assist rate in the game tripled his previous season mark. \"Let's not take it for granted,\" Texas Tech coach Grant McCasland said. \"He's gotten better and will keep getting better… Before his injury, he was bringing up the ball in transition. Passes he was making out of the post tonight, he was making in transition. His ball handling is tight. That's where he's improved the most.\" \nIn their first game with all the pieces available, the Red Raiders were sloppy for stretches on defense. The Bearkats had 18 offensive rebounds and connected on half of their 3-pointers in the first half, which opened up drives to the basket. However, point guard Christian Anderson and Toppin were steadying forces in the second half for the roster. Newcomer Donovan Atwell was also tremendous, hitting six 3-pointers, with several coming off passes from Toppin and Anderson. The duo had 11 combined assists, matching the number Sam Houston produced across the game. Red Raiders thinking bigExpectations have been high for Texas Tech heading into a heralded season. Toppin was projected as a potential first round NBA Draft pick, but turned down the draft after the Red Raiders made a strong financial offer for him to stick around. The program also retained Anderson and landed a stacked portal class. \nThree of Texas Tech's five starters against Sam Houston were newcomers, while Big 12 Newcomer of the Year LeJuan Watts came off the bench. This weekend is also a big one for the athletic department. Texas Tech's football team hosts No. 7 BYU in one of the school's most high-profile matchups ever. Several basketball players came through a pregame campout at \"Raiderville\" to hand out pizzas, sign autographs and take pictures with fans. The 2025-26 school year marks perhaps the most pivotal in Texas Tech history, and a transient basketball roster has felt the pressure. The win was only a first look of what Texas Tech can accomplish, especially as the roster gets healthier. But if Toppin plays like the First Team All-American that he is, the Red Raiders will be tough to stop. A road trip to No. 17 Illinois on Tuesday is an early proving ground. \n\"I don't think we've practiced as a whole enough for us to be at our best yet,\" McCasland said. \"We've got the right pieces. We've just got to keep getting better.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The clock is ticking on College Football Playoff decision-makers as they discuss potential expansion for the 2026 postseason, and with a Dec. 1 deadline quickly approaching, the stakeholders may not reach an agreement to restructure the bracket. Mississippi State president Mark Keenum said Friday that he is \"not real optimistic\" the conference commissioners will agree upon an expansion plan.Among the primary holdups in CFP expansion talks is the lack of a consensus on how many automatic bids should be included in a larger field. While the Big Ten has long been a proponent of dishing out numerous guaranteed spots -- with most going to Big Ten and SEC teams -- other conferences have been wary of the idea. In fact, Keenum said that the SEC would prefer to do away with automatic bids altogether.\"I'm not a big fan of automatic qualifiers,\" Keenum said on \"The Paul Finebaum Show.\" \"I think the best teams ought to play in our nation's national tournament to determine who our national champion in college football is going to be, and not have automatic bids. That's the position of the Southeastern Conference presidents, chancellors, our commissioner and probably most of the conferences that are part of CFP.\"The Big Ten and SEC hold the most power in constructing future playoff models, and it is in their best interests to adopt formats that reward as many spots as possible to their member schools. They have conflicting opinions, though, on how to achieve that goal.\nOn one hand, the Big Ten seeks to guarantee a base number of bids by conference and backfill the bracket with at-large selections. On the other hand, the SEC appears willing to eliminate a guaranteed floor and instead swing for the fences, thus potentially sending more teams to the postseason with at-large bids than it would with a predetermined number of automatic berths.Specifically, the Big Ten favors a 16-team playoff with four automatic qualifiers reserved for each of the two most powerful conferences while SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said his league is open to various expansion formats including 5+7, 5+9 or 5+11 models -- all of which cap guaranteed spots to one per conference. Sankey also made clear that his personal preference is to remove automatic bids altogether.\"We're still negotiating,\" Keenum said. \"We have to make a decision before the end of this month if we're going to expand to 16 next year. We've got just a few more weeks. I'll be honest, I'm not real optimistic that we'll get to that, but we'll keep working on it.\"\nIf the commissioners cannot reach an agreement by Dec. 1 on how a 16-team bracket would be structured, the CFP will remain in its present state for 2026. This season is the second of the 12-team era and the first with a straight-seeding model, which awards first-round byes to the four highest-ranked teams regardless of conference championship status.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Lone Star State will take center stage for many with Week 11 college football picks as the two ranked matchups on the slate involving Texas teams. There's Texas Tech vs. BYU in the Big 12, which has the ninth-ranked Red Raiders favored by 10.5 points over the No. 8 Cougars, per the latest college football odds. Then over in the SEC, Texas A&M vs. Missouri sees the No. 3 Aggies as 7-point favorites over 19th-ranked Mizzou. BYU and Texas A&M are two of the last four undefeated teams entering Week 11. There are, however, several other intriguing matchups to place Week 11 college football bets on.No. 4 Alabama vs. LSU (+10.5) is a classic rivalry as the Tigers play their first game in the post-Brian Kelly era. Auburn also moved on from its coach, Hugh Freeze, and it is a 6.5-point underdog to No. 15 Vanderbilt. Not to be overlooked, Notre Dame vs. Navy (+27.5) will see the teams play for the 98th time, and that game has one of the largest Week 11 college football spreads. Before locking in any Week 11 college football picks on those games or others, be sure to see the latest Week 11 college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times and has returned over $2,200 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated college basketball picks over the past three seasons.

OSU's 12-game win streak is the longest in the nation, and the defense has been utterly dominant in 2025. The Buckeyes' 6.9 points allowed are the fewest by any Big Ten team through the first eight games of a season in the last 40 years. Meanwhile, Purdue ranks 109th (out of 136 FBS teams) in scoring, as the Boilermakers have lost seven straight games. With Ryan Day boasting a 53-1 record versus unranked opponents -- including a +32.6 margin of victory -- the model has Ohio State covering well over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Clemson (-1.5, 56.5) covers versus Florida State in a 7 p.m. ET Saturday kickoff well over 50% of the time. The season hasn't gone according to plan for either team, but the Tigers are 2-2 ATS over their last four, while FSU is just 1-4 ATS over its last five. The Clemson defense has the ability to make Florida State one dimensional, as the Tigers have kept three of their last four opponents to 85 or fewer rushing yards. That could be a major issue for the Seminoles, especially considering QB Thomas Castellanos' road struggles. His team has outright lost in each of his last five away starts, and he has just a lone touchdown pass, versus two picks, on the road this year. The Under is projected to hit almost 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 11The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 11, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a Big Ten underdog outright winning. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which Big Ten favorite goes down?

    "description": "\n        Well, No. 25 North Carolina has a Quad 1 win in its holster now after the Tar Heels rallied from a double-digit deficit to run away from No. ",
    "body": "\n        Well, No. 25 North Carolina has a Quad 1 win in its holster now after the Tar Heels rallied from a double-digit deficit to run away from No. 19 Kansas 87-74 in a Friday barnburner.We'll dive into some takeaways, but first — take a bow, Caleb Wilson.North Carolina has something special brewing with Wilson, a five-star freshman. The 6-10 forward left his imprint all over this one. He dove on the floor to corral loose balls. He ripped down boards. He diced Kansas' defense as a playmaker and a play-finisher. Wilson jack-hammered three dunks and splashed more than a couple face-up jumpers on his way to a 24-point, seven-rebound, four-assist, four-steal night.He was utterly tremendous.Wilson played like a potential top-five pick in exhibition play and also in the Tar Heels' 94-54 season-opening win vs. Central Arkansas on Monday, but consider Friday his introduction to college basketball at large.\nNorth Carolina has a flat-out dude, who plays with the tenacity and passion of a role player who would do simply anything to stay on the floor. He has quickly become an emotional leader for the Tar Heels, who makes defense cool and has changed the complexion of this roster with his unselfishness.\tWhen your best player is your best passer and your highest-energy workhorse, he's a beacon of light for others to follow. Buckets won't come as easily every night as they did Friday, but the burgeoning skill to go along with the hyperactive defense and energy is extremely appealing for both Wilson's long-term stock and North Carolina's short-term quest to be an ACC contender.\nUNC will go as Kyan Evans goesKansas went on a 15-6 run late in the first half to seize control, and that conveniently was synced up with Evans looking all out of sorts. UNC's much-discussed portal addition was passing up open 3-pointers, giving up straight-line drives and couldn't get the basketball out of his hands faster.That flipped in the second half, and predictably, UNC followed suit. Evans delivered 12 points, three dimes and two net-shredding triples in the second half. After wobbling a little after some fullcourt pressure from Melvin Council Jr. in the first half, Evans responded with a zero-turnover second half.UNC turned it over just once in the second half and fried Kansas' defense to the tune of 1.71 points per possession.\nWilson, Seth Trimble and Henri Veesaar (more on them in a minute) were the stars, but Evans is the key to all of it.Darryn Peterson needs help from Jayhawks Wonder how Peterson felt after that bloodbath? The Kansas freshman played 28 minutes with Trimble draped inside his jersey for 26 of 'em. The UNC senior tried to give the five-star freshman a rude \"welcome to college basketball\" moment, and Peterson seemingly rarely flinched. He still hit tough contested midranges. He tickled the twine for three 3-pointers. Even with UNC expanding the lead out to 16 midway through the second half, there was still an inkling of fear because that dude was still balling. \nTrimble played torrid defense, and Peterson still finished with 22 points on efficient 8-for-14 shooting. I have a feeling a lot of defenders will feel like that after trying to handle Peterson.He is All-American good, but Kansas has to figure out some secondary answers to the test.\nWhen Peterson exited the first half with two fouls, Kansas' offense eroded for a stretch. Tre White tried (and failed) to operate as the takeover guy. Kansas simply has to get more from its guards if it wants to be a real-deal contender. Melvin Council gave KU a boost with his point-of-attack defense, playmaking and jet-quick drives, but there are offensive limitations. North Carolina went under every single one of his ball screens, and he couldn't make 'em pay (0-for-4 from downtown).Kansas is a good team, and Friday's result doesn't change that. But if KU doesn't become a true National Championship contender, you can harken back to losing out in the final hour in the Darrion Williams Sweepstakes.This UNC recipe is not fakeEarly-season games need to be taken with a grain of salt sometimes. This was not one of those games. This blueprint for winning basketball games feels extremely duplicatable for UNC moving forward. The Tar Heels were all over the offensive glass, lassoing in 16 offensive rebounds and turning it into six second-chance points. UNC's 44% offensive rebound rate was a higher mark than any game last year when North Carolina just didn't play North Carolina basketball.\nOh, and this frontcourt is the goods. Wilson and Veesaar were the two highest-paid additions this offseason, and they are worth every penny. Veesaar needs to get a few more rebounds (he only had four), but his four assists were enormous. So were the two top-of-the-key treys he hit to start loosening up Kansas' defense. The Veesaar-Wilson marriage looks extremely promising for the future, thanks to the combination of size, speed, athleticism, skill and passing. Their big-to-big passing gave Kansas serious fits and is eerily similar to the Alex Condon-Tommy Haugh, 1-2 punch that gave Florida a different gear. Defensively, that combination is working, too. Trimble was able to be so aggressive at the point of attack because of Wilson and Veesaar on the back end. Kansas shot just one layup and one dunk in the final 16 minutes of regulation. Veesaar and Wilson combined for just one block, but the rim deterrence was noticeable down the stretch.If the offensive rebounding is a staple for UNC moving forward, you can see the vision where this group competes with Duke and Louisville for the ACC crown because the other strengths of this club aren't going anywhere. All nine Tar Heels who played were threats to knock down a triple. Trimble, Wilson and Veesaar present three real-deal defenders at all three levels of the floor. \nA top-five pick, armed with offensive rebounders, defenders and shooters is a real-deal combination. But finding consistent guard play will be essential for UNC to elevate into that elite tier.\n    \n                                        \n    TarHeel247.com is the largest site that covers North Carolina athletics.

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco 49ers have faced a slew of injuries, including to their starting quarterback, but have managed to put together wins anyway. Brock Purdy missed seven games due to a turf toe injury, leaving former first rounder Mac Jones leading the offense for the majority of the season. And ahead of Sunday's divisional clash with the Los Angeles Rams, coach Kyle Shanahan said Jones will be the starter for an eighth consecutive game.The 49ers (6-3) labeled Purdy as questionable for the Week 10 contest, and while Shanahan said he could be active, Purdy would serve only as the No. 2 quarterback if he is ready to play. His status will become clearer once he and Shanahan meet on Saturday.\"We're trying to ease Brock out there in the practice stuff, but anytime you're dealing with this turf toe, it's something that probably won't fully go away all year,\" Shanahan said this week. \"Regardless of when he comes back, he's going to always have to deal with it a little bit, especially with the people you talk to who have gone through turf toe.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 10 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can the Colts bounce back in Berlin?

His five wins are more than he tallied in the last two seasons combined. In Sunday's win against the New York Giants, Jones went 19-of-24 with 235 yards and two touchdowns. \nShanahan said Purdy's unclear status won't affect how Jones prepares. \"No, nothing changes Mac in that way,\" Shanahan said.While Jones has won the majority of his games this year, logic dictates the 49ers will go with their $265 million quarterback once he proves he is healthy enough to start.Purdy suffered the injury in Week 1 and attempted a return in Week 4, but aggravated the injury and has been sidelined since. \nShanahan was hopeful that Purdy, who was limited in practice leading up to Week 9, could serve as the backup or emergency quarterback, but he was inactive for the win over the New York Giants.\n            ",

The last eight of those games have come with Bear Bachmeier under center as he's the first true freshman quarterback to begin his career 8-0 since Trevor Lawrence at Clemson 2018. He's dangerous with both his arm and his legs as he has a passing and rushing touchdown in four straight games, which is tied for the longest active streak in FBS.The Cougars lead the Big 12 in turnover margin (+10) this season and have at least one takeaway in an astounding 22 consecutive games. Thus, a team likes Texas Tech plays right into BYU's hands as the Red Raiders have at least one giveaway in seven straight games, including multiple turnovers in each of their last two contests. Texas Tech also has a disastrous history versus AP Top 10 teams like BYU, which is No. 8 in the AP Poll. TTU is on a 16-game losing streak versus top 10 teams and is allowing 51.1 ppg during this streak. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why Texas Tech can coverThe Red Raiders are 8-1 versus the line this season, as no team has more spread victories than Texas Tech. Coach Joey McGuire can make the case that he has the best offense in all of FBS, considering TTU's statistical rankings. His team ranks third in scoring offense, has the fourth most offensive touchdowns and ranks fifth in total yards per game. The Red Raiders have scored at least 42 points in every home game in 2025, averaging 51.6 points at Jones AT&T Stadium.The exploits of the offense somewhat overshadow what Texas Tech's defense does to opponents. The Red Raiders rank fifth in the nation by allowing 13.2 points per game, which makes TTU and Indiana the only teams to rank in the top five in both scoring offense and scoring defense. Leading the brigade on defense is senior linebacker David Bailey, who leads the nation with 11.5 sacks and ranks second with 14 tackles for loss. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make BYU vs. Texas Tech picksSportsLine's model has simulated Texas Tech vs. BYU 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 61 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The lead in the Big 12 will be on the line when the No. 7 BYU Cougars and No. 8 Texas Tech Red Raiders collide in a crucial matchup on Saturday at Jones AT&T Stadium in Lubbock. The Cougars (8-0, 5-0 in Big 12) sit atop the conference and are seeking back-to-back 9-0 starts for the first time in school history. Meanwhile, the Red Raiders (8-1, 5-1) are tied for second in the Big 12, with Cincinnati and are looking to end a 16-game losing streak against teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Top 25.The winner of Saturday's game will have an inside track to reaching the Big 12 Championship Game on Dec. 6 in Arlington, Texas, and move one step closer to a berth in the College Football Playoff. Bet college football Week 11, including Texas Tech vs. BYU, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three months of NBA League Pass. Click here to sign up:Saturday's game may come down to Texas Tech's ability to generate turnovers. The Red Raiders lead the conference and are tied for second in the country in takeaways (20), but the Cougars have committed the fewest turnovers in the Big 12 (six) and lead the conference in turnover margin (+10).Top sportsbooks have made Texas Tech a 10.5-point favorite over BYU. The line has risen slightly after opening at -10.Is that line movement an overreaction or market correction? Here's a look at the BYU-Texas Tech point spread, as well as the line movement on the other two matchups featuring two top 25 teams in the CFP rankings and two other games with big line changes. All times Eastern.No. 7 BYU at No. 8 Texas Tech (noon)Open: Texas Tech -10 Current: Texas Tech -10.5The point spread for the game of the week has remained pretty steady from the start. Even the reports on Wednesday that Cougars running back LJ Martin is expected to play didn't drop this line into single digits. This is significant since A, the Red Raiders haven't been a double-digit favorite against a ranked team in the last 30 years, and B, BYU is just the fourth FBS team in the last 10 years to enter a conference game 8-0 or better as a double-digit underdog. Both teams have been bettors' best friends this season; Texas Tech is 7-2 against-the-spread, and BYU is 6-2 ATS.Bet Week 11 college football games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Click here:Bowling Green at Eastern Michigan (1 p.m.)Open: Bowling Green -2 Current: Eastern Michigan -2.5This game features the biggest line move of the week, with Bowling Green (3-6, 1-4 in MAC) going from a small favorite to a small underdog. This seems like a market correction. The Falcons rank 124th in the country in total offense (304.9 yards per game) and 123rd in scoring offense (18.2 points per game), which prompted the firing of offensive coordinator Travis Partridge earlier this week. Bowling Green also played last week, while the Eagles are coming off a bye.FIU at Middle Tennessee (3 p.m.)Open: FIU -2.5 Current: Middle Tennessee -1.5Bettors prefer how the Blue Raiders (1-7, 0-4 in Conference USA) have played recently more than the Panthers (3-5, 2-3) have, making Middle Tennessee a small favorite after opening as a 2.5-point underdog. Though the Blue Raiders have lost five in a row, each of the last three games have been decided by three points or fewer. That includes a three-point defeat last week against Jacksonville State, which is currently tied atop the conference. On the other hand, the Panthers have lost four of their last five games, with the average point differential being 14.0 points a game. In addition Middle Tennessee has won nine of the last 10 meetings between the teams played in Tennessee.Bet college football at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens. Click here to get started:No. 3 Texas A&M at No. 22 Missouri (3:30 p.m.)Open: Texas A&M -7 Current: Texas A&M -7Here's another point spread that has been pretty much spot-on from the start. This line has toggled between -7 and -6.5 all week and doesn't figure to move much if at all before kickoff since none of the players who are questionable are potential line-movers. This game will come down to whether the Tigers (6-2, 2-2 in SEC) can reignite their potent ground game after averaging just 3.1 yards per rush over the last two weeks. Missouri doesn't want to rely on true freshman quarterback Matt Zollers, who will be making his first college start, to drop back too many times against the defense that leads the country in sacks per game (4.00).No. 9 Oregon at No. 20 Iowa (3:30 p.m.)Open: Oregon -6 Current: Oregon -6.5This line opened at some places with the Ducks favored by 5.5 and has inched up to 6.5, but a couple sportsbooks have juiced this to -115 on Oregon, which tells me that they don't want to move this number to -7. That's interesting because the Hawkeyes have struggled in these type of games recently. They are 1-8-2 ATS in their last 11 games against ranked teams and 0-6 ATS in their last six games against top 10 teams. Meanwhile, the Ducks are 11-3 ATS as road favorites under coach Dan Lanning.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The highly-anticipated 2026 WNBA Draft Lottery, which will determine which team receives the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft next spring, will be held on Nov. 23, the league announced on Friday. The Dallas Wings have the best odds for the top pick. A date for the 2026 draft has not yet been announced.  The WNBA offseason has been in a holding pattern due to the ongoing labor battle between the league and the players association, who recently agreed to a 30-day extension to continue negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement. Until the two sides agree to a new CBA, none of the major items on the offseason agenda can take place, including the expansion draft for the Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo, free agency and the 2026 draft, because the rules for all of those events have to be collectively bargained.  \n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: Everything to know after two sides agree to extension\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, the Draft Lottery falls outside the purview of the CBA. That is great news for all the teams involved, as they will finally know which pick they'll receive. 2026 WNBA Draft LotteryDate: Sunday, Nov. 23 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETTV: ESPN | Stream: fubo (try for free)\nThe five teams that missed the playoffs in the 2025 WNBA season were the Chicago Sky, Connecticut Sun, Dallas Wings, Los Angeles Sparks and Washington Mystics. Those are not the five teams involved in the lottery, however, due to a series of trades.  The Sky owe their first-round pick to the Minnesota Lynx and the Sparks owe their first-round pick to the Seattle Storm. In addition, the Sun owe swap rights to their first-round pick to the Sky. Because the Sky also own the Phoenix Mercury's first-rounder, the Sky will get the more favorable of the Sun/Mercury picks, while the Sun will get the least favorable of those selections. With the Sun in the lottery and the Mercury in the playoffs, the Sky are guaranteed to receive the Sun's pick.  How the Lottery will workVia the WNBA:\"In the drawing, 14 balls numbered 1-14 will be placed in a lottery machine and mixed.  Four balls will be drawn to determine a four-digit combination.  The team assigned that four-ball combination will receive the No. 1 pick. The four balls will then be placed back into the machine and the process will be repeated to determine the second pick.  Of the three teams not selected in the drawings, the team with the worst cumulative two-year record shall select third; the team with the next worst record will select fourth; and the remaining team shall select fifth.\"A representative from the league's independent accounting firm Ernst & Young will be in attendance to oversee the Draft Lottery process.\"Lottery odds are based on the team that originally owns the pick. As a reminder, the WNBA calculates lottery odds based on the combined records of the past two seasons.  TeamCombined 2024 and 2025 recordOdds of winning No. 1 pickWings \t\t\t\t19-65  \t\t\t\t42% \t\t\t\tSky (owe to Lynx) \t\t\t\t23-61 \t\t\t\t26.1% \t\t\t\tSparks (owe to Storm) \t\t\t\t29-55 \t\t\t\t16.7% \t\t\t\tMystics \t\t\t\t30-54 \t\t\t\t9.5% \t\t\t\tSun (owe to Sky) \t\t\t\t39-45 \t\t\t\t5.5% \t\t\t\tPrevious No. 1 overall picks in each franchise's historyWings2021: Charli Collier2025: Paige BueckersLynx\n2006: Seimone Augustus2001: Maya MooreStorm2001: Lauren Jackson2002: Sue Bird2015: Jewell Loyd2016: Breanna StewartMystics1999: Chamique HoldsclawSkyNeverTop prospects in the 2026 classThe 2026 class does not have a player on the same level as Caitlin Clark or Paige Bueckers, though to be fair, that's an extremely high bar to reach. Still, there are a number of talented players set to enter the league who could immediately help their new franchises. \n        \n            \n                2026 WNBA Mock Draft: Wings take high-upside center to pair with Paige Bueckers, Lauren Betts goes second\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpanish center Awa Fam and UCLA center Lauren Betts are seen as the top prospects, though there is no clear-cut choice for No. 1. The athletic and versatile Fam is still only 19, and while talented, will need a few years to develop. The 6-foot-7 Betts, meanwhile, is more of a traditional, back-to-the-basket center, and will not be a fit for every team. There are also an array of backcourt options in this class, including TCU's Olivia Miles -- who stunned everyone by returning to school and transferring from Notre Dame -- UConn's Azzi Fudd, LSU's Flau'jae Johnson and South Carolina's Ta'Niya Latson. \n            ",

Smith Center on Friday in Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels and Jayhawks both opened the season with a win earlier this week, and this game will mark the first major test of the season for both programs.Kansas is led by star freshman Darryn Peterson, who could very well be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. Peterson scored 21 points in his collegiate debut Monday in the Jayhawks' 94-51 win over Green Bay. The Jayhawks have won the last five meetings against the Tar Heels.North Carolina also has a star freshman of its own in Caleb Wilson. The former blue-chip recruit scored 22 points during UNC's 94-54 win over Central Arkansas. Wilson is a projected lottery pick this summer. The Jayhawks are one of three ranked teams the Tar Heels will face before ACC play begins.\n        \n            \n                Tracking college basketball freshman debuts: Cameron Boozer, AJ Dybantsa impress, Koa Peat explodes\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere is everything you need to know ahead of North Carolina's matchup with Kansas on Friday.\nWhere to watch Kansas vs. North Carolina live Date: Friday, Nov. 7 | Time: 7 p.m. ET  Location: Dean E. Center -- Chapel Hill, North Carolina  TV: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  Kansas vs. North Carolina prediction, picks\nCollege basketball fans were introduced to Peterson earlier this week when he scored 21 points in just 22 minutes. Because of the blowout, Peterson didn't play as much as he could've. That won't be the case against the Tar Heels. This is a chance for both programs to pick up a statement win and an opportunity to watch two projected lottery picks square off against each other. My prediction is that Peterson has a big game in front of a hostile environment and Kansas pulls off the upset win on the road. Pick: Kansas +1.5Odds via FanDuel Sportsbook\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            UNC -1.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            N.

That was always the expectation, even if some fans hoped that a new loss every week would lead McIntosh to change his mind and become the latest athletic director to swallow a large buyout so he could go spend even more money on a new coaching staff.Fickell's buyout was around $25 million, and anybody with an understanding of life in Madison these days understood how unlikely Wisconsin was to spend it. McIntosh indirectly told you again while discussing the future plans for Wisconsin under Fickell.\"Chancellor [Jennifer] Mnookin and I are aligned on significantly elevating investment in our program to compete at highest level,\" McIntosh told ESPN. \"We are willing to make an investment in infrastructure and staff. As important, is our ability to retain and recruit players in a revenue share and NIL era.\"Any time somebody tells you they're going to significantly elevate the investment in the program, that means there's a lot of elevating that needs to be done. Simply put, Wisconsin hasn't been playing on the same financial field as the rest of its Big Ten brethren -- it participates in the rev-sharing that gives about $13 million to its football program, but it is clear its NIL offerings are lacking. It's a huge reason why Fickell has been so unsuccessful to this point, while other Big Ten programs, which were much further behind Wisconsin with on-the-field results when Fickell was hired, have been able to take such giant leaps forward.\n\n        \n            \n                Armed with Mark Cuban donations and Curt Cignetti's brash approach, Indiana sets up for sustained success\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIndiana and Illinois have seen the investment in their football programs significantly elevated already. That investment is a big reason why (hiring the right coach is the other big one) the Hoosiers are No. 2 in the country and on the verge of a second-straight playoff appearance, while Illinois is in position to win at least nine games in consecutive seasons for the first time in program history.As they've risen, Wisconsin has fallen. All of which seemed highly unlikely when the Fickell hire was announced. It was a move that was heralded by nearly everyone, including me, but Fickell is 14-19 at Wisconsin and 8-15 in Big Ten play. Fickell has been foiled by a lack of resources comparatively, as well as bad luck (injuries) and bad decisions (RIP Dairy Raid experiment).\nThe problem with the decision to bring Fickell back in 2026 is not about Fickell himself, though. He's still the same coach who led Cincinnati to the College Football Playoff as a Group of Five school. Wisconsin's schedule, which has been one of the most difficult in the country this year, will be far easier next season (though that should not be taken as it'll be easy, because they still have to play Notre Dame to start the season). No, the problem is money can't fix everything. At least, not the way Wisconsin needs it to. It's one thing to say you'll have an investment; it's another to actually have it. How much money will Chris McIntosh be able to raise for a program when everybody he's asking knows the situation both he and Fickell find themselves in? The simple truth is, unless Wisconsin suddenly churns out a bunch of wins next season, there's a high likelihood neither Fickell nor McIntosh sees the end of the 2026 season, let alone 2027.It's a lot easier to ask for money when there's hope to sell.Just look at the way one of Wisconsin's most prominent former players spoke about the program this week. On Wednesday's episode of The Pat McAfee Show, J.J. Watt didn't sound like a man who's very interested in throwing good money after bad.\nFor the sake of argument, though, let's say McIntosh is able to raise a significant amount of funds this offseason. Now, Wisconsin has a bunch of money it wants to fire at the transfer portal to overhaul the roster.Well, it's going to have to pay a premium on that talent, because like J.J. Watt, you and I know Fickell will be in one of the hottest seats in the country going into next season. So if there's a quarterback available in the portal, how much will Wisconsin have to pay to convince that player to come to Madison in that situation?\n        \n            \n                Meet the candidates -- 88 of them: The only list you need for college football's wildest coaching carousel\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRemember, Wisconsin won't be the only Big Ten team looking for a QB in the portal this winter. Odds are, Indiana and Illinois will be sniffing around, too. Maybe Penn State's new coach brings a QB with him, or maybe the Nittany Lions are also fishing in the same waters.\nWhich option looks more attractive to you? An Indiana team coming off two playoff appearances, or a Wisconsin team where the coach you're signing up to play for could be fired by mid-October?The simple truth is, if Wisconsin had the kind of money available to pull off a Texas Tech and overhaul the program in one offseason, it would've paid the $25 million buyout to start over. But it doesn't, so it didn't.Wisconsin may be serious about putting more money into its football program, but it's far more likely to be another coach who reaps the benefits of that money than Luke Fickell.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL divisional round schedule features two games on Saturday, and two on Sunday. Saturday's intriguing matchup will pit NFC West rivals when Bock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers battle Sam Darnold and the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks are favored by 7 (over/under 45.5 points) at DraftKings Sportsbook in what's the largest of the divisional round NFL lines. Darnold (oblique) is listed as questionable, but told reporters that he's planning to play. Other divisional round NFL spreads include Texans vs. Patriots (-3, 40.5) and Rams (-4.5, 48.5) vs. Bears, both on Sunday. The smallest spread in the divisional round is Bills vs. Broncos (-1.5, 45.5) on Saturday, and those odds flipped after Buffalo opened as 1.5-point favorites.

    "body": "\nThe divisional round of the 2026 NFL playoffs kicks off with the Denver Broncos hosting the Buffalo Bills on Saturday. The Broncos (14-3) tied for the league's best record, won back-to-back games to close the regular season and earned a bye as the AFC's No. 1 seed.

Buffalo safety Jordan Poyer (hamstring) has been ruled out.Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. ET from Empower Field at Mile High in Denver. The latest Broncos vs. Bills odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Denver as a 1.5-point favorite, after Buffalo opened as 1.5-point favorites. The over/under for total points is 45.5.

The Bills are 8-1 against the spread versus the Broncos over their last nine meetings, with three of those games taking place in Denver. Buffalo just defeated an elite defense in Jacksonville, which had the No. 1 run defense and forced the second-most turnovers. Thus, the Bills should find an easier time on the ground come Saturday, and Denver has the least opportunistic defense in the postseason. No 2026 playoff team forced fewer turnovers than the Broncos' 14, which is fewer than one per game. The Bills are undefeated (8-0) when they don't give away the ball and boast an 11-1 record with one or fewer turnovers. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverThis will be Buffalo's eight divisional road game since the 1970 merger, and the Bills have covered just once over that span. One also can't discount Denver coming off a bye, as the Broncos are 3-1-1 ATS over their last five with a rest advantage, while the Bills are 1-4 ATS this season when having less rest than their opponents. Denver possesses a ferocious pass rush as its 68 sacks are the fifth-most in NFL history, and the Bills have struggled when Josh Allen is under attack. The Broncos average 4.0 sacks per game, and Buffalo has lost six straight games, including being 0-3 this season, when Allen is sacked at least four times. Additionally, Sean Payton and company can exploit Buffalo's porous run defense as just four teams allowed more yards on the ground than Buffalo this season. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Bills vs. Broncos   picksSportsLine's model has simulated Broncos vs. Bills 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 47 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in more than 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Bills vs. Broncos, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time?

    "body": "\n        The first main event of the Zuffa Boxing era is set. UFC president and CEO Dana White announced that the Jan. 23 event from the UFC Apex in Las Vegas would be headlined by a junior middleweight bout between Callum Walsh and Carlos Ocampo. The card will stream live on Paramount+ and take place the night before UFC 324 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.Walsh (15-0, 11 KO) has been heavily hyped by White for years, with several of Walsh's fights streamed on UFC Fight Pass. With TKO's expansion into the boxing world with the new promotion, Zuffa Boxing, Walsh seemed like a sure thing to have been an anchor for the new promotional body, and his headline spot confirms those suspicions.Thus far, Walsh has lived up to the hype, impressively dispatching of a string of lower and mid-tier fighters. He currently sits as the No. 4-ranked junior middleweight by the IBF, as well as No. 5 and No. 13 by the WBC and WBO, respectively.In his most recent outing, Walsh took a unanimous decision over Fernando Vargas Jr. on the undercard of Terence Crawford's win over Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez.In Ocampo (38-3, 26 KO), Walsh faces a man with far more high-level experience, though Ocampo has come up short in his biggest fights.\nOcampo's three losses have come against Errol Spence Jr. for the IBF welterweight title in 2018, Sebastian Fundora for the WBC interim junior middleweight title in 2022, and Tim Tszyu for the interim WBO title in 2023. Both Spence and Tszyu stopped Ocampo in the first round.Since the loss to Tszyu, Ocampo has rattled off a trio of stoppage wins against club-level fighters.There will be two additional main card bouts on the Z01 card. Also in the middleweight division, Misael Rodriguez will take on Austin Deanda. Rodriguez is 14-0 as a pro with seven knockouts. He also earned a bronze medal for Mexico at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Deanda, meanwhile, is 17-0 as a pro with 11 knockouts. \nPlus, Julian Rodriguez and Cain Sandoval are set to throw down in the welterweight division. Rodriguez is 24-1 with 15 knockouts as a pro while Sandoval is 17-0 with 15 knockouts.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWhat's the best thing going for the Houston Rockets right now? The Houston Texans.Because if the Texans weren't in the AFC Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs, there would be much more scrutiny in H-town on the Rockets and their recent woeful stretch. Houston, which entered the season as a popular pick to knock off the reigning NBA champion Thunder after the team added Kevin Durant in the offseason, has lost five of its last seven games, including defeats to the Mavericks and Kings. The team has dropped to sixth in the Western Conference standings.The Rockets haven't been able to find the Gulf from Galveston. Over the last seven games they are shooting just 41.0% from the field, which ranks last in the league over that time. For comparison, the Nuggets are shooting 41.3% on 3-pointers alone during that same stretch.And on Friday night, Houston will play the second half of a back-to-back, against the Minnesota Timberwolves, at the Toyota Center in Houston. On Thursday, the Rockets shot just 33.7% in a 111-109 loss to Oklahoma City.Houston is a 4.5-point favorite against Minnesota.While Rockets vs. Timberwolves is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes five other NBA matchups and a seven-game college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Jan. 16. All times Eastern.NBA best bets, where to watchCavaliers at 76ersTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Philadelphia | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Cavaliers +2.5 | Expert: 76ers -126 (Matt Severance)\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers (23-19) and Philadelphia 76ers (22-17) play the second half of a baseball-style series at Xfinity Mobile Arena. On Wednesday, the Cavaliers blew out the 76ers 133-107, but Cleveland guard Darius Garland, who scored 20 points, left that game with a foot injury and he's already been ruled for Friday night. SportsLine's Matt Severance notes that the losing team from the first game of these baseball-style series often has the advantage in the second game. \"I expect a major response tonight from the home side,\" he says. Meanwhile, the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NBA game 10,000 times, says the Cavaliers have a 67.0% chance to cover and assigns a 'B' grade to Cleveland +2.5. \nTimberwolves at RocketsTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Houston | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Rockets -4.5\nDespite Houston's shooting woes, the Rockets are still favored over the Timberwolves (27-14). The main reason is that Anthony Edwards already has been ruled out for a second consecutive game with a right foot injury. Edwards leads the team in scoring (28.9 points per game) while also averaging 5.0 rebounds and 3.8 assists. His on-ball pressure also triggers Minnesota's defense, which ranks eighth in the league (112.4 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 67.0% chance Houston covers and gives a 'B' grade to Rockets -4.5.College basketball best bets, where to watchBaylor at KansasTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Lawrence, Kan. | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Kansas -7.5\nThe Kansas Jayhawks (12-5, 2-2 in Big 12) have been up-and-down all season while dealing with potential No. 1 overall pick Darryn Peterson being in and out of the lineup. But Tuesday's 84-63 blowout of No. 2 and previously-undefeated Iowa State showed what the Jayhawks are capable of achieving this season if they continue learning how to play with each other and if Peterson stays in the lineup. Kansas ranks seventh in the country in field goal percentage defense (38.3%) and is 20-1 all-time against Baylor at Allen Fieldhouse. The Bears (11-1, 1-3) are coming off a 94-79 victory at Oklahoma State, which ended a three-game losing streak. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 59.0% chance the Jayhawks cover and assigns a 'B' grade to Kansas -7.5.Looking aheadNFL: Bills at BroncosTime: 4:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Denver | TV: CBS | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Broncos -1.5 | Expert: Bills +1.5 (Brady Kannon)\nOne season after meeting in the Wild Card round, the Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills will square off in the playoffs again, this time in an AFC Divisional Round matchup on Saturday at Empower Field at Mile High. Last year, the Bills cruised to a 31-7 victory over the Broncos in Buffalo. This year's game features the reigning NFL MVP, Bills quarterback Josh Allen, against one of the league's top defenses. Allen led all quarterbacks in rushing yards (539) and ranked second in total touchdowns (39) during the regular season. Meanwhile, the Denver defense had 68 sacks this season (tied for the fifth most by a NFL team all-time) and ranked second in completion percentage (57.8) and yards per attempt (6.1). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Broncos have a 51.0% chance to cover and gives a 'C' grade to Denver -1.5. But SportsLine's Brady Kannon disagrees. He believes Broncos quarterback Bo Nix is merely average. \"Bills strength on defense is [against] the pass. which will make the game difficult for Nix, and the Broncos' rushing attack is just average too,\" he says.NFL: 49ers at SeahawksTime: 8 p.m. Saturday | Location: Seattle | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: 49ers ML | Expert: 49ers +7.5 (Emory Hunt)\nThis NFC Divisional Round matchup between NFC West rivals Seattle and San Francisco gained some intrigue on Thursday when Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold popped up on the injury report with an oblique injury. However, Darnold said he still expects to play on Saturday. The 49ers won't be feel bad for Darnold or Seattle; San Francisco has dealt with more than its share of injuries this season, most recently losing tight end George Kittle for the season. Interestingly, the 49ers have won their last four games against the Seahawks in Seattle. The SportsLine Projection Model says San Francisco has a 35.0% chance to win and assigns a 'B' grade to the 49ers money line. Meanwhile, SportsLine's Emory Hunt likes San Francisco to cover. \"There is a commonality here that [the 49ers] have entering a game [against] their division rival Seattle that'll help them be in position to keep this one tighter than the spread, which they will,\" he says.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There are 13 teams scheduled to play three or fewer games next week. That leaves an advantage in fantasy for those who roster players on the teams that will play at least four times each. Let's keep that in mind as we hit the waiver wire and highlight five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Royce O'Neale, Phoenix Suns (47% rostered)After logging 25 minutes per game in both of the previous two seasons, O'Neale has played 30 minutes a game this season. That has helped him average 10.5 points, 5.1 rebounds, three assists, 1.2 steals, and 2.9 3-pointers. Of his 8.5 shot attempts per game, seven of them have come from behind the arc. That's significant because he is shooting 41.8% from deep.O'Neale can help fantasy managers in multiple categories, but he doesn't really excel in any one area, outside of 3-pointers. With that in mind, he's best deployed as a streaming option when the Suns have a favorable schedule. That's the case for the upcoming week, with the Suns set to play four times. One of their matchups will be against a Nets team that has the 10th-worst defensive rating. Another will come against the Heat, who play at the fastest pace in the league.Keldon Johnson, San Antonio Spurs (41% rostered)Johnson has proved to be a reliable veteran off the bench for the Spurs. With teams focusing their efforts on trying to slow down Victor Wembanyama, De'Aaron Fox, and Stephon Castle, Johnson has received plenty of quality looks on his way to shooting 56.3% from the field and 41.3% from behind the arc. With his improved efficiency, he has averaged 13.4 points and 1.3 3-pointers to go along with 6.3 rebounds a night.\nThe downside that comes with rostering Johnson is that he provides very little in terms of assists and defensive stats. Still, those who need points, 3-pointers, and rebounds could do worse on the waiver wire. The Spurs will play three games next week, including two against the Jazz and one versus the Pelicans. Those two teams rank inside the bottom five in the league in defensive rating.Tim Hardaway Jr., Denver Nuggets (30% rostered)In a season that has been filled with injuries for the Nuggets, Hardaway has missed just one game. Entering this campaign, he had appeared in at least 71 games in each of the last three seasons. He has hit the ground running with his new team, averaging 13.8 points and 2.9 3-pointers over 28 minutes per game. Known for his 3-point prowess, Hardaway is shooting a career-high 41.4% from deep.Hardaway is on pace to average at least 2.2 3-pointers for the ninth straight season. Of his 10 shot attempts per game, seven of them have been 3-point tries. The Nuggets will play four times next week, making Hardaway a top waiver wire target for those who need 3-pointers. However, don't expect much else from him, considering he has provided only 2.4 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 0.5 steals per game. \nBrandon Williams, Dallas Mavericks (24% rostered)Anthony Davis (finger) is hurt again. While it appears he has avoided surgery, the Mavericks announced that he will be out for at least six weeks. Davis has been involved in trade rumors, so given his return timeline, he may have already played his final game with the Mavericks. Cooper Flagg (ankle) missed Thursday's game against the Jazz, robbing the team of their top two scoring options.With Flagg being forced out of Wednesday's game against the Nuggets, Williams stepped up to provide 20 points and seven rebounds off the bench. He followed that up with 18 points and three assists Thursday. He has caught fire from the field lately, shooting 57.5% over his last eight games. Even if Flagg isn't out long-term, the absence of Davis makes Williams worth rostering with the Mavericks playing four games next week.De'Anthony Melton, Golden State Warriors (12% rostered)News broke Thursday that Jonathan Kuminga has requested a trade from the Warriors. He hasn't played in 14 straight games as he has fallen completely out of their rotation. Steve Kerr tends to change his rotations often, but Kuminga still hasn't been able to find his way onto the floor. One recent change that Kerr has made has been playing Melton more. Over their last seven games, the veteran has averaged 23 minutes.\nWith Melton playing more, he averaged 13.9 points, three rebounds, one steal, and 2.4 3-pointers over that seven-game span. He shot 50% from the field and 42.5% from behind the arc, both of which likely aren't sustainable. For his career, he shoots 41.1% from the field and 36.6% from 3. Still, those in deeper formats might want to take a chance on riding his hot streak with the Warriors set to play four games next week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a six-season run during which he accumulated a 44-56 record, Kevin Stefanski was fired on Monday by the Cleveland Browns. \"We appreciate all [Stefanski's] hard work and dedication to our organization but our results over the last two seasons have not been satisfactory, and we believe a change at the head coaching position is necessary,\" Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam wrote in a statement.Stefanski was a two-time Coach of the Year with the Browns, having won 11 games in both 2020 and 2023. In 2020 he led the team to its first playoff appearance in 18 years and its first playoff win in 23 years. In 2023 the Browns made the playoffs again but lost in the first round. But the team went just 3-14 and 5-12 over the last two seasons, leading the Haslams and general manager Andrew Berry to make a change.Berry will remain in his post as general manager and lead the search for Stefanski's replacement. Here are some candidates the Browns could look at, with most of them being first-time head coaches, as CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports that the search will likely yield another first-time coach.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\nJesse Minter (Chargers DC)Minter is arguably the top candidate on the market this offseason so it may be difficult for Cleveland to land him given its generally unstable (in terms of process) ownership and management situation, but that doesn't mean the Browns shouldn't try. Minter is one of the premier defensive schemers in the league and he could figure out the best way to utilize Myles Garrett, who will be coming off a Defensive Player of the Year season. Like the other defensive-minded coaches on this list, Minter would have to have a good plan for what he's going to do at offensive coordinator, though it remains to be seen what kind of talent he'd be working with on that side of the ball, and whether the Browns will be pursuing an upgrade at quarterback. Matt Burke (Texans DC)Burke spent the first five years of his NFL career working under current Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, then worked with him again for a couple years in Philadelphia. Schwartz turned his unit into one of the best in football over the last few years, so the Browns could be tempted to keep the good times rolling on that side of the ball by going with a younger version of the coach who has been coordinating a top unit. He may even want to keep Schwartz as the DC if he comes aboard. Burke calls the plays for the Texans' defense despite the presence of DeMeco Ryans as head coach, and we've seen that he can call a top defense himself. Jeff Hafley (Packers DC)Hafley, like Minter and Burke, is considered one of the top defensive minds in the sport. His Green Bay defenses have been excellent when healthy and he is considered a rising star in the league. He's going to be in the mix for multiple jobs this cycle and might not consider the Cleveland job to be the most desirable because of the aforementioned issues, but if the Browns could land him, they could maintain their excellent defense. He'd have to have a strong plan at offensive coordinator, as mentioned for Minter, and that's not just a secondary consideration when it comes to hiring defensive-minded head coaches -- it's really important. Hafley would be a hire in the mold of the Seahawks' Mike Macdonald, and we've seen that Seattle needed a new OC to really take off this season. Speaking of that new OC...Klint Kubiak (Seahawks OC)The Browns have hired an offensive-minded head coach each of the last three times they've been in position to hire a new one, and Kubiak is considered one of the top offensive candidates this cycle. His offense puts quarterbacks in position to succeed, as we've seen this year with Sam Darnold, and any connection to the Kyle Shanahan/Sean McVay-style offense is always desirable in head-coaching searches, as we have seen over the last decade or so. Kubiak would be a hire in the mold of Stefanski (who had previously been the Vikings' quarterbacks coach and then offensive coordinator before he headed to Cleveland), but the Browns have shown an affinity for bringing in offensive coordinators from top offenses before.\nMike McCarthy (Former Cowboys and Packers HC)The lone retread on this list, McCarthy interviewed for the Browns job back in 2020 before ultimately landing in Dallas. He's had a lot of regular season success and generally tends to get the best out of his quarterbacks, though he's had the good fortune of coaching Aaron Rodgers and Dak Prescott during his tenures in Green Bay and Dallas, and he wouldn't be walking into a similar situation in Cleveland. McCarthy has his faults but he is respected around the league and would give the Browns an air of professionalism, though he may also give them a defined ceiling considering his limitations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The pressure on Liverpool manager Arne Slot to turn around what has been a disappointing season is now higher that it's ever been. Despite leading the Reds to a Premier League title last season, time waits for no one in top level management, and with Xabi Alonso on the market, pressure has now been ramped up for Slot. In an alternative timeline, Alonso would've been the man who Liverpool moved on from club legend Jurgen Klopp for, but things didn't align at the time while he was in the midst of a successful tenure with Bayer Leverkusen.How to watch Liverpool vs. Burnley, oddsDate: Saturday, Jan. 17 | Time: 10 a.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool, EnglandTV: USA Odds: Liverpool -450; Draw +550; Burnley +1000But now, Alonso is gone from Real Madrid after only seven months, and Liverpool are trying to secure a Champions League spot for next season while the title race is already out of their reach. After a summer of spending that included adding former players under Alonso in Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, there are too many connections to draw of why the Reds would consider making a change during the summer if Slot doesn't turn things around.Liverpool is still a club where the manager can have input from the top down and look to instill a culture stopping the issues leading to Alonso's Real Madrid departure from repeating themselves, but it creates a tenuous situation for Slot. Managing a club is hard enough when a replacement to do the job is on the market, and now, with any poor performance, whispers will arise of when Alonso will come in to right the ship. \nEven facing a team like Burnley, now anything but an emphatic victory won't be enough for the Reds to move past this. Slot also has the added challenge of integrating Mohamed Salah back into the squad after Egypt finishes Africa Cup of Nations duty. During Salah's absence, Wirtz has been able to get back to being more of a ball-dominant player, turning in some of his best performances in a Liverpool shirt with two goals and an assist in his last five Premier League matches. It may not seem like buch but when Wirtz didn't register a single attacking return in the league until December third, it's quite an uptick in production for the young attacker.Slot has his work cut out for him, and Champions League play is also on the verge of returning giving the Reds even more matches to deal with. If they can string together wins in them, it will help change the vibes around a club who have drawn three consecutive league matches, but they also run the risk of deepening their spiral. \nUnder Slot, Liverpool have been able to be extremely consistent, and it led them to a league title, but that has all gone out the door this season after starting off unbeaten in their first five league matches. In a managerial world where you look at what a manager has done for you now instead of their past success, these are the kinds of runs that can lead to shifts of who is in charge so Anfield will be a place to watch.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Duke star quarterback Darian Mensah plans to enter the transfer portal, multiple sources told CBS Sports. Mensah is one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the country after signing a multiyear deal last offseason that pays him $4 million annually, according to sources. His name has surfaced repeatedly this cycle as a potentially movable quarterback in conversations with industry sources, and that chatter only intensified in the closing hours of the 2026 portal window as quarterback-needy programs look to add a proven passer.Mensah emerged as an all-ACC selection in his first year with Duke, finishing the 2025 season second nationally with 3,973 passing yards and 34 touchdowns.The 6-foot-3, 205-pound California native transferred to Duke last offseason from Tulane.\nWhy now for Mensah? Mensah and Duke were an ideal partnership during the 2025 season. Duke spent big to land him, and it led to an ACC championship. Meanwhile, Mensah emerged as one of the truly elite passers on the Power Four level, finishing in the top 10 nationally in almost every major passing category. There were even reports last month that Mensah decided to return to Duke for the 2026 season, passing on the NFL Draft to do so. At that time there were rumors Mensah could consider the portal. He was a popular potential name for several schools, but he seemed to shut all that down midway through December. \nBut in recent days, Mensah's name began to pick up steam again talking with industry sources. There are several QB-needy teams without solutions to their quarterback issues, and no real answers to be found in the portal. The top 26 quarterbacks in the 247Sports portal rankings are all accounted for and the only quarterback in the top 50 with starting experience is EJ Colson, who is coming from Incarnate Word.Mensah instantly becomes the most in-demand prospect in the portal. Industry sources also consider Mensah's contract language with Duke to be more stringent than those of other contracts across college football, which will make it more difficult for Mensah to get out of his deal. Miami interest?Earlier this week, CBS Sports reported that Miami was aggressively shopping for a quarterback to replace the graduating Carson Beck, and their list of targets might include names not yet in the transfer portal. The Hurricanes pursued Ty Simpson, but the former Alabama quarterback reaffirmed his commitment to the NFL Draft. \nNow, sources tell CBS Sports that Miami is an early team to watch as a potential landing spot for Mensah. No. 10 Miami will face No. 1 Indiana on Monday night in the College Football Playoff National Championship at Hard Rock Stadium, a surreal setting that underscores both how quickly the program has risen and how fragile that ascent can be without the right quarterback. Over the past two seasons, the Hurricanes have leaned aggressively on veteran transfers to fuel their climb, pulling off moves few programs can match.Miami convinced Cam Ward to withdraw from the 2024 NFL Draft, a decision that ultimately led to him becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. The Hurricanes followed that by landing Carson Beck, who reversed course after initially declaring for the draft following four seasons at Georgia.\nBoth moves were transfer-portal coups. Both were big gambles. And both worked exactly as intended. Could Mensah be the the next in line? It'd be the third straight year the Hurricanes made the seemingly impossible happen once again. What would Duke do? Mensah decision puts the Blue Devils in an extremely difficult position. There's only a few hours left in the 2026 transfer portal window and very few starter-quality players left on the board at quarterback. Duke's room has also experienced so much upheaval during the portal window, with backup QB Henry Belin transferring to Missouri State. The Blue Devils did add North Alabama QB transfer Ari Patu, and they're optimistic about the future of true freshman quarterback Dan Mahan. \nStill, a starter, let alone an All-American candidate, leaving at the last moment would be devastating for Duke's hopes of repeating as ACC champions in 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and with the new year having come and gone we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. With plenty of big-name free agents and trade candidates still on the board even at this increasingly late hour, there's a daily supply of rumors and reporting regarding them. Speaking of which, you can find Friday's roundup just below. Angels, Rays, Reds pull off three-way tradeThe Angels, Rays, and Reds have agreed to a three-team trade that, most notably, sends outfielder Josh Lowe to (greater) Los Angeles, the teams announced. Here's the full trade: Angels get: OF Josh Lowe from Rays Rays get: INF Gavin Lux from Reds, RHP Chris Clark from AngelsReds get: LHP Brock Burke from AngelsLowe, who turns 28 in February, enjoyed a standout season in 2023 when he hit 20 home runs in 135 games and put up an OPS+ of 128. Over the last two seasons, however, his offensive numbers have declined significantly. Lux is a veteran lefty bat who has a career OPS+ of 99. He can play second base and get by in left field. Lux is going into his walk year in 2026. Clark, a former fifth-round draft pick, is 24 and reached Double-A last season. Across parts of three minor league seasons, he has an ERA of 5.25 and a K/BB ratio of 2.52 in 54 starts and a pair of relief appearances. Burke is a 28-year-old lefty reliever with a career ERA+ of 110. Yankees, Mets targeting Peralta in trade talks\nIt's not known whether the Brewers, coming off back-to-back NL Central titles, will trade their ace this winter, but they appear to at least be considering it. On that front, the Yankees and Mets have engaged the Brewers in discussions about Peralta as there's an increasing perception that Milwaukee will indeed deal him away this offseason, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports.Peralta, 29, is entering the final season of his contract. He's compiled a 3.40 ERA (123 ERA+) and a 3.27 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 95 starts since 2023. His consistency, reliability, and affordability (he's owed $8 million) make him an attractive target for teams seeking front-of-the-rotation help.\nYankees adjusting offer to Bellinger\nThe Yankees remain in negotiations with free-agent outfielder Cody Bellinger, who was a key driver of their success last season. Thus far the sticking point has been contract length, and rather than meet Bellinger's ask the Yankees are proposing an alternative structure, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Specifically, the Yankees are willing to give Bellinger not one but two opt-outs in a contract that includes a substantial signing bonus and no deferrals. Whether that's enough to move Bellinger's camp off their contract-length stance depends upon the market. Red Sox checking in on Paredes\nThe Red Sox need infield help after losing out on Alex Bregman, who inked with the Cubs, and the Astros have infielders to spare. As such, the two sides are discussing Isaac Paredes, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Paredes, who soon turns 27, is coming off a strong bounceback campaign in 2025 in which he had an OPS+ of 123 and earned his second career All-Star selection. He's best suited to third base and is under team control through the 2027 season. Tigers at least listening on Skubal\nWill the Tigers trade back-to-back AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal heading into his walk year? The guess is no as they aim for a third straight trip to the postseason in 2026, but they're at least listening to trade inquiries, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Skubal and the organization may be at odds given the chasm between their respective filed arbitration figures, and that at least theoretically may increase the odds of a trade. Even with only one year of team control remaining, Skubal will command a high cost in return, as he's perhaps the best starting pitcher in all of baseball. \nTwins, Caratini agree to deal\nThe Twins and free-agent catcher Victor Caratini have agreed to a two-year deal, according to FanSided. Caratini has also seen time in recent years at first base and designated hitter and going back further has also played third base and left field. In 114 games for the Astros last season, he was worth 0.9 WAR. The 12 homers marked a career high for the part-timer, who has now slugged above .400 in two straight seasons. Ryan Jeffers is the likely starter for the Twins heading to 2026 and Caratini slides in as a nice backup option.\n            ",

Collins did not practice on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday as he attempted to work through the concussion protocol. In 15 regular season games this year, Collins caught 71 passes for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns. He tied Andre Johnson and DeAndre Hopkins in having the most consecutive seasons with 1,000 yards receiving in franchise history with three. He entered this postseason boasting the fifth-most playoff receiving yards per game (91.8) in NFL history (minimum four games played). \n\n        \n            \n                NFL divisional round picks: Our experts face off on Bills at Broncos, 49ers vs. Seahawks and more\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCollins a big-bodied target that can beat safeties deep for long touchdowns. With Collins out, more pressure will be placed on players like Jayden Higgins and Xavier Hutchinson, but Christian Kirk is the receiver to watch. He caught eight of nine targets on Monday night for a career-high 144 yards and a touchdown. Kirk averaged just 18.2 receiving yards per game in the regular season.This Patriots defense will be a tough test for quarterback C.J. Stroud, as coach Mike Vrabel's unit had Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert looking like a rookie in the wild card round. In the Patriots' 16-3 victory, Herbert completed 19 of 31 passes for 159 yards. The Chargers offense as a whole scored three points, converted just one third down and recorded 207 total yards.\nStroud's lone 300-yard game this season came without Collins in the lineup. In a 26-15 victory over the San Francisco 49ers back in Week 8, Stroud completed 30 of 39 passes for 318 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Hutchinson was the game's leading receiver that day with 69 yards and a touchdown.\n            \n    ",

Chambliss led Ole Miss to the College Football Playoff semifinals before losing to Miami.Chambliss had a deal in place at Ole Miss to return in 2026 under first-year coach Pete Golding, contingent on the NCAA granting his waiver request.\nChambliss argues the legitimacy of his case because of \"incapacitating injury or illness\" in 2022. The NCAA argued that proper documentation from that time period wasn't provided and Ferris State's reasoning for Chambliss not playing after redshirting the previous season was \"development needs and our team's competitive circumstances.\"If Chambliss is ruled ineligible for the 2026 season, he will be eligible for this spring's NFL Draft. In CBS Sports' NFL Draft Prospect Rankings, Chambliss is ranked as the No. 3 signal caller behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Alabama's Ty Simpson. Chambliss finished the 2025 campaign by throwing for 3,927 yards and 22 touchdowns to just three interceptions.\nWith Chambliss' eligibility in limbo, the Rebels signed former blue-chip quarterback recruit Deuce Knight. The former Auburn signal caller would be the projected starter for Ole Miss in 2026 if Chambliss heads to the NFL.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Just eight teams remain in the NFL playoffs, and a trip to Championship Sunday is on the line this weekend as the divisional round takes center stage. The league is coming off a truly wild Wild Card Weekend, with most games decided in the final moments, setting the stage for what's shaping up to be one of the most memorable postseason runs in recent memory. The bar is high for the divisional round -- and it has a lot to live up to.As much as the focus is on the matchups that will determine who advances and who goes home, injuries are also looming large. Wild Card Weekend delivered plenty of drama, but it also took a toll. The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle for the remainder of the season with a torn Achilles, while Texans wide receiver Nico Collins and Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez each exited their games with concussions. Meanwhile, the Seahawks are keeping a close eye on Sam Darnold after he suffered an oblique injury during practice.With teams wrapping up their on-field preparations for this latest round of the playoffs, let's take a look at the final injury reports to see who's in, who's out and whose status remains up in the air.Buffalo Bills at Denver BroncosSaturday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBillsMaxwell HairstonCBAnkleOutJordan PoyerSHamstringOutTerrel BernardLBCalfQuestionableDamar Hamlin (IR)SPectoralQuestionableTy JohnsonRBAnkleQuestionableEd Oliver (IR)DTBicepQuestionableCurtis Samuel (IR)WRElbowQuestionableBroncosDrew SandersLBAnkleOutLucas KrullTEFootOutJosh Allen began the week as a limited participant due to foot, knee and right finger injuries. However, the franchise quarterback logged back-to-back full practices to close out the week and carries no injury designation for Saturday's matchup. Meanwhile, defensive end A.J. Epenesa (neck), tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee, calf) and linebacker Matt Milano (ankle) also enter the weekend without injury designations after each was limited throughout the week. On Friday, Buffalo did activate both defensive tackle Ed Oliver and receiver Curtis Samuel off of injured reserve, signaling their return. Oliver hasn't played since Week 8. Denver is relatively healthy heading into this matchup. Just four players appeared on the final injury report, and only two have been ruled out. Most notably, linebacker Dre Greenlaw logged a full practice on Thursday and carries no injury designation.\nSan Francisco 49ers at Seattle SeahawksSaturday, 8 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatus49ersJi'Ayir BrownSHamstringOutFred WarnerLBAnkleOutJacob CowingWRHamstringQuestionableLuke GiffordLBQuadQuestionableRicky PearsallWRKneeQuestionableDee WintersLBAnkleQuestionableSeahawksElijah ArroyoTEKneeOutJosh JonesOTKneeOutChazz SurrattLBAnkleOutSam DarnoldQBObliqueQuestionableDespite making a strong push to return, the 49ers ruled out linebacker Fred Warner for this playoff matchup. Meanwhile, the status of wide receiver Ricky Pearsall remains up in the air, though he did practice all week on a limited basis. On a more positive note, star left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) carries no injury designation after practicing fully in each of the final two sessions of the week.All eyes are on Sam Darnold after he popped up on the injury report Thursday with an oblique injury. Darnold has said he's confident he'll be able to play through it, but he is officially listed as questionable. If he's unable to go, backup Drew Lock would be thrust into the starting role for this playoff matchup.\nHouston Texans at New England PatriotsSunday, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN, ABC | Fubo, try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusTexansNico CollinsWRConcussionOutPatriotsTerrell JenningsRBConcussion ProtocolQuestionableHarold LandryLBKneeQuestionableThe Texans are relatively healthy entering this divisional-round matchup, but the one absence looms large. The club has ruled out top wide receiver Nico Collins after he suffered a concussion last week against Pittsburgh. Collins did not practice at all this week.The Patriots will have top cornerback Christian Gonzalez available after he cleared the concussion protocol and practiced fully over the final two days of the week. Right tackle Morgan Moses (knee) also carries no injury designation after being limited earlier in the week. One player worth monitoring is Harold Landry III. He was limited on Wednesday and Thursday with a knee injury but did not practice Friday, putting his status in doubt heading into the game.\nLos Angeles Rams at Chicago BearsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC | Fubo, try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusRamsJimmy GaroppoloQBBackQuestionableDesjuan JohnsonDEIllnessQuestionableBearsNick McCloudDBGroinOutJalen Reeves-MaybinLBBackQuestionableRome OdunzeWRFootQuestionableL.A. will get right guard Kevin Dotson back after missing the last few weeks due to an ankle injury. He was a full participant during Friday's session. Chicago is listing wide receiver Rome Odunze as questionable for Sunday's contest, but he practiced fully on Friday, which suggests he should be available. DJ Moore is also expected to play after logging a full practice Friday following limited sessions Wednesday and Thursday due to a knee injury. As for McCloud, he did not practice at all this week while dealing with a groin injury and is the lone Bears player who has been officially ruled out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michael Carrick might fulfil the one criterion that so many of his former team mates have been saying is critical to managing Manchester United -- he knows the club, probably better than you do, probably better than the club knows itself come to mention it, actually probably better than you know yourself -- but this is not an episode of Mastermind that the former Middlesbrough manager is preparing for. Carrick has been handed the United reins at the gallop to the finish line, 17 games of Premier League and Premier League only with the chance to pip an awful lot of other big name runners and riders in the final furlongs. There is an immense opportunity to deepen his status in Old Trafford folklore over the coming months but how might Carrick go about claiming it?The first thing to say is that Carrick has done his apprenticeship and while the United job, even on an interim basis, is an almighty step up, it would be for almost anyone. At least the 44-year-old does not need to learn the basics on the job like the man he replaced, caretaker Darren Fletcher. Beyond a successful three game spell holding the Old Trafford fort in 2021 -- United cycle through safe pairs of hands like the Robot Devil -- there is three years at Middlesbrough to fall back on and it is at the Riverside Stadium that we get our first hints at what kind of manager Carrick might be.How Carrick managed MiddlesbroughThe most important takeaway from his time at Middlesbrough might be that Carrick seems to be absolutely fine. That is not nothing when it comes to appointing a new manager. Most statistical analysis on the impact of head coaches has suggested that only the very best have an outsized positive impact, most might come in and deliver a short term boost before performances settle down. Much as a small few might overhaul a club for the better there are those who can do so for the worst. No thank you, I will not be naming examples today. Carrick though, does not appear to be from that dreaded latter category.His trajectory in the north east is that aforementioned middle of the road output. Coming to Middlesbrough with a record of two wins and a draw as United's pre-Ralf Rangnick interim, Carrick inspired an immediate upswing in performances. On his appointment on October 24, 2022, Boro were hovering above the relegation zone. When they crushed Preston North End 4-0 in March automatic promotion was only three points away, their style of football one of the most thrilling in England with Carrick coming to be viewed as an outstanding coaching prospect.\nIt never quite got better than that. Middlesbrough committed one of the EFL's cardinal sins of heading into the playoffs without momentum and found themselves beaten by Coventry City in year one. The next saw Boro slip just outside the top six and the following ended with them in 10th. A record of 60 wins, 28 draws and 50 losses was not to be sniffed at, but few tears were shed on Teeside when owner Steve Gibson sacked Carrick in the summer.After all Middlesbrough were one of the leading sides in the second tier. Their salary bill last season was estimated to be the sixth largest in the division, much as it had been the previous year. Here's the thing though, while an upper midtable finish on a fringe playoff wage bill might seem like an underperformance at the Riverside, you would take that in a heartbeat if you were Manchester United. That's bringing European football back to Old Trafford. Where does Sir Jim sign up for that?It might ultimately have been a disappointing ending for Carrick, but it was one that the man himself \"learned an awful lot\" from. Just how much of that he will be able to apply during a tenure with a defined end point is an open question, particularly when it comes to his tactics.\nIt would perhaps be wise not to expect too much of an overhaul from a man who has professed his hatred for the word \"philosophy.\" Anyone who has spent most of their playing career under Sir Alex Ferguson will appreciate that management is about much more than turning up with a formation and expecting the club to bequeath you the players to best deploy that. It might just be that Carrick adapts to what Ruben Amorim has left him.That might not be as hard as you imagine. During his Middlesbrough tenure Carrick played what on paper looked to be a 4-2-3-1, but his approach is perhaps best illustrated from this pass network in a 2-1 win over Oxford United last season. Playing Samuel Iling-Junior at left back makes for a particularly extreme example, but note just how dramatically the left back, No.29, has pushed on, with right back Anfernee Dijksteel (No.15) notably more withdrawn. This was consistent across Carrick's three seasons in the Championship, his left back pushing on and his left sided forward moving infield to create the standard 3-2-5 attacking shape, a strong double pivot shielding against counters.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Now imagine how that might look at United, with Patrick Dorgu bombing on from left back into space created by Matheus Cunha's movement infield with Noussair Mazraoui tucking into a position he is very confident in. If need be the roles could be reversed too with Luke Shaw well suited to the third center back in possession role now that he has lost the burst of his youth. It wouldn't exactly be Dorgu and Amad Diallo charging down the flanks, but United can probably cope with a bit of a downgrade on what is, in expected goals terms, the second best attack in the Premier League. \nWith the ball at their feet, Middlesbrough played how you would expect from a team managed by one of the few great tempo-dictating midfielders produced by England. They passed the ball, a lot. In Carrick's final season Boro ranked fifth in the league for possession having been eighth and third in the two proceeding years. Only two teams attempted more passes of 10 metres or fewer and they ranked in the same position for average number of passes per attacking sequence. They weren't the Championship's most sedate side but they weren't exactly hurrying up the pitch either.It's a similar story without the ball too. Only two teams allowed their opponents to complete a greater proportion of their passes than Boro's and they allowed the eighth most passes per defensive action (a measure of pressing intensity) in 2024-25. Broadly middle of the road defensively, they were strong in their duels but when they allowed opponents through struggled to stop good shots, a bit of a problem right the way through Carrick's tenure.That in possession style could be a tough match for the Premier League. After all, plenty of the hallmarks of Carrick's Championship side were similar to those implemented by Amorim in his early weeks at United. He too wanted to build play with short goal kicks, with his deeper players drawing the opposition onto him, finding a way through the press and unleashing forwards in transition. It never really worked and by his first full season the Portuguese had adapted to the top flight's new normal: balls into the channels, goal kicks up to the big man, runners right across the pitch.\nCBS Sports sources suggest that United are unlikely to do major business in the January transfer window so what Carrick has is what he will have to work with. That will be a challenge if he wants to create ball-playing sides. The Old Trafford engine room has long been held together by sticking plasters and good will and this summer must see the arrival of someone who can dictate tempo from midfield. Bruno Fernandes can do that but his greatest qualities are found in his more aggressive passes. Whether Carrick can trust him to play deep in a back four system will be an intriguing early question?If not Fernandes, it is not obvious who else. For all the excitement around what Amorim's sacking might mean for Kobbie Mainoo, Carrick has previously described the 20 year old as \"more of an attacker\" than a holding midfielder. Mainoo's great talents are in ball-carrying rather than passing. Again it looks like a gamble to play him alongside someone like Casemiro, who doesn't have the legs to cover if there are two or two and a half center backs behind him.In spite of Amorim's complaints about how much more would be needed for him to get his project up and running, this United already has the look of one that might suit a back three system. There are a lot of center backs, plenty of whom are pretty decent, and enough options to fill the spots for attack-minded wing backs or inside forwards.\nCarrick, however, knows that tactics are only part of life as a head coach, interim or otherwise. He has to set the tone at one of the biggest sporting organisations on the planet. At his first press conference, it didn't seem to be a role he was relishing. \"Sat in this chair in front of you lot is very different to the role in coaching,\" he joked. Carrick might not like it, but it will matter. Indeed, one of the few things Amorim could be said to have done at a very high level was to reset expectations at Old Trafford according to where United were not where they expect to be.Carrick too is not going to let supporters get carried away, stressing the priority as \"improvement,\" using that or its derivations seven times in response to a question of what the target was for his interim tenure. \"Improvement. I think certainly improvement and helping improve individuals. \"A big part of what I really enjoy is improving individuals and, in the end, I think if you improve the individuals, we create a better team. So, certainly working with the players and improving them with that, I think. And, listen, results, that's what it is. There's an element of performance, there's an element of improvement, and there's an element of doing what it takes to win in certain ways, in certain occasions.\n\"So, certainly, the higher up the league we finish, we want to keep pushing and finishing as high up as we possibly can, and we'll see where that takes us.\"Beyond that and a nebulous reference to Europe, there was not much to set expectations against. That is the way Carrick would like it. In his playing career he was not one for making headlines and it seems he won't be in his second spell in the Old Trafford dugout. Roy Keane had dragged his old feud with Carrick's wife Lisa back into the headlines this week, jibing that she would \"probably [be] doing the team talk\" at Manchester United. It is the sort of story that could run and run in a media ecosystem that evidently discombobulated Amorim.Not when Carrick is in charge. \"Honestly, it didn't bother me,\" he said of the pressure Keane might be applying. \"I understand there's plenty of opinions around and some are positive, some are not so much.\n\"There's a lot of opinions, a lot can be said. It is the way of the world, I'm not going to pay too much attention to most of that. I think it's not for me to do that.\"There was Carrick serving notice. If anyone had come to Carrington in search of some Ragnickian soundbites, a cutting assessment of where United really are a la Jose Mourinho, they were going to be disappointed. As best he can, Carrick will be taking the air out of Old Trafford. That is no bad thing.The sheer noise around Old Trafford for so long seemed to obscure one simple truth this season. United were alright. They were not zooming back towards title contention as their fans might expect, not least because ownership had set a target of glory in two years' time, but they were ticking along reasonably nicely. They might only need a coach who can convert a few draws into wins, give them a bit of a short term boost and then move on. If that is indeed the case, then Carrick should do just fine.\nHow to watch Manchester United vs. Manchester City, oddsDate: Saturday, Jan. 17 | Time: 7:30 a.m. ETLocation: Old Trafford -- Manchester, EnglandTV: USA Odds: Man U +283; Draw +310; Man City -120\n            ",

Las Vegas' defense was on the field for a whopping 77 plays. Bo Nix has played well against the NFL's softer defenses, and this matchup qualifies,\" SportsLine NFL handicapper Larry Hartstein said. \"Especially with the Raiders, on a short week, traveling to altitude. Geno Smith has Brock Bowers back, but he struggles when pressured. Now he has to deal with the league's top pass rush. I would lay anything less than 10.\" Back Denver at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Under 224.5 points in Suns vs. Clippers (-110)\"The Clippers have had an uneven start to the new season and now have some other concerns for tonight, specifically James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, both ruled out. The Clips could probably live without Harden, but not Kawhi, whose added dimensions are difficult to replace,\" SportsLine NBA handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Add Norman Powell's offseason departure to Miami and can see Ty Lue's short-term dilemma. We're hardly sure perimeter-oriented Phoenix takes advantage, and totals-wise, this one doesn't seem to have shootout written all over it, with the Suns hoping that G Jalen Green finally makes his debut tonight (we'll sse), while the Clips have performed somewhat erratically.  \" Back the Under at BetMGM Sportsbook now:UTSA money line vs. USF (+400)The model predicts that USF wins this game 59% of the time, but you're getting incredible value here with UTSA winning in 41% of simulations. That's more than double the implied win probability of 20% at this price. USF lost to Memphis to effectively end its chances of making the College Football Playoff and has had a bye week to stew in it. Meanwhile, UTSA has won four of six and routed Tulane 48-26 last week and Jeff Traylor's squad also beat Alex Golesh's 49-21 when they last played in 2023. Back UTSA at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant more NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Thursday.

The Broncos have struggled mightily against the Raiders, losing eight of their last 10 meetings with Las Vegas. However, SportsLine's advanced computer model isn't expecting that trend to continue on Thursday night, projecting the Broncos to win handily and making Denver -9.5 one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.SportsLine's advanced computer model has also identified value in college football and NBA games. The model likes the Suns to cover as 2.5-point favorites and projects UTSA to keep pace with South Florida and cover as 13.5-point underdogs. The Suns play the Clippers, who are without James Harden (personal) and Kawhi Leonard (ankle). Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times.

The junior was near flawless, completing 31 of 33 passes (93.9%) for 370 yards and four touchdowns in a 48-26 win over Tulane when playing on Thursday last week. McCown, the son of former NFL cornerback Josh McCown, has 10 touchdowns compared to two interceptions over his last four games, and he's averaging 210 passing yards per game on the season. Outside of its opening matchup against Texas A&M, which is currently ranked No. 3 in the nation, UTSA has covered a 13.5-point spread in six of seven games this season. South Florida is a quality team at 6-2 overall and 3-1 in the conference, but the model views this as too many points for a capable offense led by McCown. The model projects UTSA to cover in 63% of simulations. Back UTSA at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Broncos (-9.5) vs. Raiders (-110)Pete Carroll's return to an NFL sideline has been a tough one the majority of the season, as the Raiders are 2-6 in his first year as Las Vegas head coach, with four of those losses coming by double digits. The Raiders' last four results include a 31-0 loss to the Chiefs and a 40-6 loss to the Colts, and with the Broncos having a 7-2 record entering Thursday Night Football, they are approaching that elite AFC status of teams like the Chiefs and Colts. The Raiders are 29th in scoring (16.5 ppg) and 30th in total yards (283.3 per game), and they traded arguably their most talented wide receiver in Jacobi Meyers at the trade deadline. The Broncos have won six straight gam=ames, and the model expects that to continue convincingly, projecting Denver to cover the spread in 62% of simulations. Back the Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Suns (-2.5) vs. Clippers (-115)The Clippers will be without their two superstars on Thursday with James Harden (personal) and Kawhi Leonard (ankle) both out. Having one of them out is a significant loss for Los Angeles, but both being out is a situation the model doesn't project the Clippers will overcome. Devin Booker is averaging 31 points and seven assists as the clear alpha for the Suns this season, and he's coming off scoring 38 points against the Warriors on Tuesday. The Suns are home on Thursday, and they are 3-1 at home this season, with their only loss in Phoenix coming in a 114-113 final against the Grizzlies.

McIntosh and the rest of the athletic department will continue evaluating the program while committing to an increased level of investment. \"Chancellor [Jennifer] Mnookin and I are aligned on significantly elevating investment in our program to compete at highest level,\" McIntosh told ESPN. \"We are willing to make an investment in infrastructure and staff. As important, is our ability to retain and recruit players in a revenue share and NIL era.\"Fickell is 14-19 in three full seasons as Wisconsin's coach. He has not produced a winning record since 2023 and his Badgers have not won a Big Ten game since Oct. 19, 2024. They currently sit at 2-6 eight games into the 2025 campaign, including a 0-5 mark in conference play. Wisconsin's six losses have come by an average of 23.3 points per game. The Badgers have yet to score more than 14 points against a Power Four opponent and they have held just one power-conference team below 24 points this season. \nThis will likely mark a second-straight year without a bowl game for the Badgers, who had 22 consecutive postseason appearances from 2002-23. Wisconsin's losing record in 2024 also snapped its streak of 22-straight seasons finishing above .500. \"This season has caused us all to have to look from within,\" McIntosh said. \"Luke has had to do that. I've had to do that. He has a willingness to be better. So do I, and so does Wisconsin from an institutional perspective.\"Wisconsin's decision to retain Fickell is likely informed by -- in part, at least -- what has been a busy coaching carousel thus far. Were the Badgers to make a change, they would have to contend with a litany of powerhouse programs like Penn State, LSU, Florida and Auburn during the hiring process. \nFickell also touts a buyout that will sit around $25 million at season's end. \n            \n    ",

UFC CEO Dana White plans to rebook the match as soon as possible and provided a promising health update for Aspinall.The mixed martial arts world was vexed on Oct. 25 after a premature conclusion to UFC 321's main event. Gane looked sharp early against the UFC heavyweight champion, but an accidental double eyepoke left Aspinall unable to continue before Round 1 concluded. The fight was officially ruled a no-contest. \"I was devastated,\" White told \"The Jim Rome Show.\" \"When your main event is heating up and looks like  it'll be a really good fight, and it ends with an eye poke, that's  brutal. He's at home recovering. As soon as he's able to fight again,  we'll book the rematch.\"If there's a silver lining, it's that Gane is a more believable challenger the second time. His early success against Aspinall turned heads, and with no other standout contenders in the heavyweight division, there's arguably more intrigue than ever for their fight.\nWhite wouldn't commit to a timeline for the fight, but he gave a promising update on Aspinall's condition. According to White, Aspinall did not suffer a detached retina or any serious long-term eye damage.\"As far as we know, he doesn't have a detached retina, there's no damage  to the eye,\" White said. \"He should he'll up soon and we'll figure out when we can  make the fight again.\"Whatever the outcome of their rematch, the same problem persists at heavyweight. There are very few compelling challengers. It's particularly true if Aspinall wins, having beaten four of the current top five. The exception to that is Jailton Almeida (No. 5), who is coming off a lifeless loss to Alexander Volkov, where Almeida seemed lost.\nVolkov has the best case on paper. He's 5-1 in his last six, with the only blemish being a controversial split decision loss to Gane. Then there's Waldo Cortes-Acosta (No. 6), who ironically knocked out Aspinall's training partner Ante Delija last week after Delija poked him in the eye. The most high-profile option is former heavyweight and light heavyweight champion Jon Jones, but it's unlikely anyone will make the effort to secure it.When Jones was the heavyweight champion, he repeatedly denounced interim champion Aspinall, denying Aspinall his unification fight. Ultimately, Jones retired in June, vacating the title, only to unretire shortly after Aspinall graduated to undisputed champion. On Thursday, Jones confessed to renegging on a verbal agreement to fight Aspinall.\n\"I'm giving Dana his space. We had a verbal agreement that didn't go over well,\" Jones told the \"No Scripts.\". \"Nothing was finalized.  The way things went down, I was wrong. I wish that I could see him face-to-face and apologize to him.\"  Jones retired with the desire to fight light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira on the White House card. Both fighters are publicly campaigning for a non-title heavyweight fight, so it's unlikely Jones would agree to fight Aspinall. White has publicly stated there's a \"billion to one\" chance Jones competes at the White House after imploding the Aspinall negotiations. \nAspinall wants nothing to do with Jones after having two years of his prime mostly stalled by Jones' unwillingness to fight him.\n            ",

Hall went down in the first quarter of Saturday's SEC showdown, and was eventually ruled out.Hall has started in each of Georgia's first eight games, and recorded 12 tackles and two tackles for loss. The Jacksonville native was a five-star recruit who came to Athens as a member of the No. 2-ranked 2023 class. In 24 collegiate games played, he's recorded 26 tackles.Georgia's defense is allowing 309.4 total yards per game, which ranks No. 21 in the FBS and No. 2 in the SEC. This unit held the Gators to 2 of 11 on third downs without Hall, and just 281 yards of total offense.\nUp next for the Bulldogs is Mississippi State in Starkville on Saturday, with a historic streak on the line. Georgia has won 46 straight games vs. unranked teams, which is the longest active streak in the FBS. With a win this week, the Bulldogs will tie the second-longest win streak vs. unranked teams in the FBS over the last 30 years. Georgia has won five straight, and 14 out of the last 15 vs. Mississippi State. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Former NBA player and coach Damon Jones pleaded not guilty on two charges stemming from his alleged involvement in an illegal gambling scandal, per CBS News. Jones was then released on a $200,000 bond, and he is prohibited from gambling or making contact with organized crime as part of the bond terms.Jones is facing charges in two cases. One of them involves an allegation that he provided insider information to a co-conspirator, who then used that data to bet on NBA games. The second case involves Jones allegedly luring other athletes into rigged poker games organized by the mafia with Jones accused of taking a cut of the money as compensation for his role.In the first case, Jones allegedly sent a text to a co-conspirator on Feb. 9, 2023, in which he says, \"Get a big bet on Milwaukee before the information is out! [Player 3] is out tonight.\" As it happened, LeBron James missed the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Bucks that night.The other indictment accuses Jones, along with Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, of serving as a \"face card\" for rigged poker games set up by the mafia. Former players like Jones and Billups would lure in players, and the venue would feature X-ray tables, rigged shuffling machines, and glasses designed to see marked cards.\nMiami Heat player Terry Rozier was also caught up in this scandal, and he is accused of passing along insider information to help co-conspirators bet on NBA games. At this time, neither Billups nor Rozier have entered a plea. They are set to appear in court on Nov. 24.Billups, the coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, has been suspended while the legal process plays out. Tiago Splitter is serving as the interim in his place.Rozier has also been suspended without pay, but the NBPA is challenging it. In a statement to ESPN, the NBPA said a suspension without pay is \"counter to the presumption of innocence and inconsistent with the terms of our collective bargaining agreement.\"\nOne day before Jones entered his not guilty pleas, NBA officials met with congressional staffers to discuss the gambling scandals and the league's ties with sportsbooks, per the Associated Press.\n            ",

The Broncos are coming off yet another fourth-quarter comeback against the Houston Texans, a game in which they won, 18-15. The Raiders on the other hand fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars in overtime, 30-29.While the Broncos are currently sitting atop their division, their lead over the Los Angeles Chargers (6-3) and Kansas City Chiefs (5-4) is one and two games, respectively. Additionally, Denver still has to have both meetings with Kansas City and it hosts Los Angeles in the regular season finale so there's no opportunity for the Broncos to take their foot off the gas.Click here to bet Raiders vs. Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Despite the Raiders' loss on Sunday, Smith turned in one of his best performances of the year, as he threw for 284 yards, a season-high four touchdowns against only one interception. He clearly missed tight end Brock Bowers, as the young star caught 12 passes for 127 yards and three touchdowns in his return to the lineup after missing the last three games due to a knee injury. As for the Broncos, their second-year signal-caller Nix passed John Elway for the most wins (17) in a quarterback's first two seasons in Broncos history. He registered the seventh game-winning drive of his career this past week, and his fourth this season. The 7-2 start is Denver's best since 2015, when Peyton Manning led the Broncos to a Super Bowl victory. What will happen this year?Where to watch Raiders vs. Broncos liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 6 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, ColoradoStream: Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -9.5; O/U 42.5 (via FanDuel)Raiders vs. Broncos: Need to knowThe Broncos are streaking. The Broncos have now won six straight games, which is tied for the longest active streak in the NFL with the New England Patriots. Denver has also won nine straight home games, which marks the longest active streak in the league. Denver is dominating on defense and in the trenches. The Broncos defense leads the NFL in sacks per game (4.4), third-down percentage (28.2%) and red zone touchdown percentage (34.8%). Denver has recorded the most sacks (40) and is tied in allowing the fewest sacks (9) this season. Las Vegas is down a receiver. Vegas won't have wide receiver Jakobi Meyers in the lineup moving forward, as just before Tuesday's trade deadline the Raiders dealt him to the Jaguars for fourth- and sixth-round picks. The 28-year-old wideout caught 33 passes for 352 yards in seven games played this season. More pressure will be placed on leading receiver Tre Tucker, as well as rookies Dont'e Thornton Jr. and Jack Bech. History suggests Raiders are not-ready-for-prime-time players. The Raiders have lost seven straight road games in prime time, with their last win coming in 2017 against the Miami Dolphins on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Vegas has also scored fewer than 10 points in back-to-back prime-time games, and been out-scored 71-6 over the last two road games.Fourth-quarter kings: There's no denying that the Broncos offense has been Jekyll and Hyde for most of the season. It can look like one of the most anemic units in the league one moment, then drop 33 points in a quarter the next. The Broncos have four game-winning drives this season, which is tied for most in the NFL with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and own the league's best fourth-quarter point differential (+66) during this current six-game win streak. No team should feel safe with a lead in the fourth quarter against Denver -- no matter how many points it is. Raiders vs. Broncos prediction, pick\nThe Broncos have made a habit of playing close games against inferior opponents. They struggled with the Tennessee Titans in the season opener, defeated the lowly New York Jets by just two points and needed a historic comeback to beat the New York Giants. It wouldn't surprise me to see this game come down to the fourth quarter, but I'll take Denver to cover the spread as long as the number is under 10. Smith is 0-5 against the spread in prime time since the start of last season, while Nix is 3-1 straight up and against the spread in his career in prime time. Pick: Broncos -9.5, Over 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NWSL playoffs have arrived, and eight teams will step into a three-week journey where legacies are forged not only by star power but by the emergence of the unsung hero. Fans can watch the NWSL playoffs across CBS platforms, as the Washington Spirit vs. Racing Louisville FC face off for a spot in the semifinals (Saturday on CBS at 12:30 p.m. ET)While the spotlight throughout the season naturally shines on the league's leading scorers or veteran stalwarts, the postseason is a unique stage to showcase the relentless defenders, super-sub forwards, or underrated midfielders. It's the time of year when that quiet season of consistency can break through a playoff-saving tackle or a game-winning goal. Any team that has arrived at this point will say it's a total team effort, and if that's indeed the case, who are the unsung heroes across the rosters ready to seize the opportunity for NWSL playoff glory?Here's who to keep an eye on during the NWSL playoffs:QuarterfinalsFriday, Nov. 7Orlando Pride vs. Seattle Reign, 8 p.m. (Prime Video)Saturday, Nov. 8Washington Spirit vs. Racing Louisville, 12 p.m. (CBS, Paramount+)\nSunday, Nov. 9Kansas City Current vs. Gotham FC, 12:30 p.m. (ABC)Portland Thorns vs. San Diego Wave, 3 p.m. (ABC)SemifinalsMatches to take place during the weekend of Nov. 15 and 16Kansas City Current/Gotham FC vs. Orlando Pride/Seattle Reign, time TBAWashington Spirit/Racing Louisville vs. Portland Thorns/San Diego Wave, time TBAFinalSaturday, Nov. 22Teams TBD, 8 p.m. (CBS. Paramount+)Emma Sears (Racing Louisville FC)You might think a player scoring ten goals in a season is a star and not an unsung hero, and you're correct. Unless you're deeply tapped into women's soccer, you know Emma Sears, but many out there are just learning the name for the first time in 2025. Sears has rapidly become the leading goal scorer for Racing Louisville following an impressive rookie season in 2024, where she scored five goals, and her sophomore season of elevated attacking production has been crucial to their success.Her efforts haven't gone unnoticed by the U.S. women's national team, with more frequent call-ups this year by head coach Emma Hayes this year. Sears is stepping into the playoffs following a massive hat-trick performance against New Zealand last month.\n\"She has an instinct inside the box and a desire to score goals that we can't teach,\" Hayes said of Sears' recent USWNT start. \"To score a hat trick at the international level is no easy achievement. She is someone who always continues to impress.\"While a huge part of Louisville's identity is making games competitive and not so much ballooning scorelines, it's on par with what to expect come NWSL playoffs. It's frightening to think now that Racing has finally made the postseason that's long eluded them, that is a series tailor-made for how they operate this season. A squad that is peaking at the right time, fearless, with nothing to lose, and a winger who can score at any moment. \"I can feel the belief behind me on the field, and I think I'm really just leaning into that,\" Sears said during the playoff push. \n\"I try not to think too much and take what opportunities I can during the games ... in the second half of the season I've been presented with more opportunities in games than I really can remember in my career and just trying to kind of flow with that and not think about it too much.\"Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC)As Gotham FC steps into the playoffs as a No. 8 seed, it's not quite unfamiliar territory for them. When playoffs were a six-team format, the club ran the postseason to lift the NWSL Championship as the No. 6 seed, and they've since been league contenders. This year, for the group, it'll be about which rookie will step up.Sarah Schupansky is just one of several rookies whom Gotham has relied upon this year. Alongside Lily Reale, the duo could be rookie of the year finalists. Meanwhile, Khyah Harper, Ryan Campbell, Sofia Cook, Emerson Elgin, Tyler McCamey, Josefine Hasbo, and Kayla Duran are part of Gotham's deep roster. Through 23 matches, Schupansky leads the team in chances created (29) and assists (five).\nThe impressive play led to a new contract extension in September through 2027. Though her time on the pitch has dwindled in recent match weeks, the playoffs are a rejuvenator, and Schupansky's skills could be a difference maker on the road against Kansas City.Gia Corley (San Diego Wave FC)The 2025 regular season was going to be a year of transition, and San Diego Wave FC went ahead rode that storyline right into the playoffs. After a surge of international talent signed in the offseason from France internationals Kenza Dali and Perle Morroni to new head coach Jonas Eidevall, the group is back in the postseason after a one-year absence.One player who has gone under the radar, as Delphine Cascarino emerged as the most important player on the team and Dali composed had a career year, is another new arrival, Gia Corely. The 23-year-old midfielder was signed from TSG Hoffenheim with a proven track record, with 14 goals scored and 12 assists in 70 appearances in the Frauen Bundesliga. She needed little time to adjust to NWSL play and scored in her Wave FC debut, and has since shown off her creativity and vision. \nSam Meza (Seattle Riegn FC)Not sure anyone works harder within Seattle's five-back than midfielder Sam Meza. Her rapid ascension as a key midfielder for the Reign is anchored by her two-way play and relentless ball tracking. Only in her sophomore season in NWSL, her nose for the ball and staunch dominance in midfield areas are leading factors in Seattle's ability to stifle games. Meza leads the team in recoveries (157), duels (289), and leads all club midfielders in shot blocks (14). While her defensive work rate is relentless and standout, she can also contribute in attacking scenarios through her distribution. If Seattle's postseason journey is about its defensive shifts, Meza's instinctive play will be crucial for a deep playoff run.Haley McCutcheon (Orlando Pride)As the Orlando Pride begin their title defence in the 2025 NWSL Playoffs, they'll do so with the foundational piece of their midfield, Haley McCutcheon. Since joining the Pride in 2022, she's offered both consistency and leadership for the group and will be an essential piece in Orlando's midfield puzzle. \nShe's effective in and out of possession, leading the team in assists (four) and duels (230). Her clutch mentality is backed by her reliable performances, shutting down attacking sequences or generating offensive play. Orlando's recent form gives positive momentum, with a five-game unbeaten streak, and McCutcheon's ability to impact the game across the middle third is why.Reilyn Turner (Portland Thorns FC)While there were plenty of question marks around where the offensive production was going to come from for the Thorns with Sophia Wilson off on maternity leave, Reilyn Turner answered. The 23-year-old forward elevated her game in her second NWSL season and leads the Thorns forwards with five goals this year. She's got a poacher's mentality, and her tenacity makes her a constant threat to opposing defenders. Her extended work rate and commitment to counter pressing expand her impact on the game and show no fear in big moments. She's also a threat in the air and leads the roster in aerial duels (86) and won nearly 70% of her aerial challenges. Her offensive production will be a boost in the playoffs, and her positioning will open channels up for others. \nRosemonde Kouassi (Washington Spirit)In year two with the Washington Spirit, Ivory Coast international Rosemonde Kouassi has quickly become an integral piece of the squad's attack. The Spirit have had to get creative this season as they managed a carousel of varying injuries to significant players. Kousassi's ability to plug in and go offers the roster extra confidence in the final third. The 23-year-old attacker has four goals and four assists this season over 17 appearances, and offers a dynamic option in the final third as the Spirit rotates attackers to manage injury loads. She's effective on the ball and often successful in taking on defenders one-on-one. If the Spirit remain without Trinity Rodman due to an MCL sprain, they'll have confidence in the playoffs with Kouassi as an option.Izzy Rodriguez (Kansas City Current)After winning the 2025 NWSL Shield, the Kansas City Current turn their sights towards the 2025 NWSL Championship. They have a roster with multiple game-changing players, even without their Golden Boot winner, Temwa Chawinga, but fullback Izzy Rodriguez provides for all. The former 2022 fourth-round draft pick has slowly become a bona fide starter for the Current, and she can execute in nearly every facet of the game. \nA tenacious presence on the backline, she's able to ignite attacks from lower on the pitch. She leads the team in assists (six) and chances created (39) and is as effective on the defensive end of the ball as she is during offensive scenarios. Rodriguez has an added layer to her game with her accuracy on set pieces, and her deliveries into the box off corners or free kicks often create chaos and goals.\n            ",

Denver (7-2) is tied for the best record in the league and is riding a six-game win streak, which is also tied for the NFL's longest. The Broncos had a comeback victory at Houston in Week 9, defeating the Texans, 18-15, via a walk-off field goal. Meanwhile, the Raiders (2-6) suffered a defeat out of their bye on Sunday as they lost in overtime to Jacksonville, 30-29. The Raiders lead the all-time series, 73-56-2. Denver cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) and receiver Marvin Mims (concussion) have been ruled out. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Empower Field at Mile High in Denver. The Broncos swept the season series in 2024, after the Raiders had won each of the previous eight meetings. The Raiders are 7-3 ATS over the last 10 matchups. The latest Raiders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 9.5-point favorites, making it the biggest favorite of Week 10. The over/under for total points is 43.

Meanwhile, Denver hasn't lived up to being a heavy favorite this season, going just 1-3 against the spread when favored by at least a touchdown. The Broncos have also gone just 1-4 straight up over their last five Thursday games as short turnarounds haven't worked in their favor.Vegas does have several standouts who can make this game competitive, starting with Geno Smith, who is coming off a four-passing touchdown on Sunday. Three of those were caught by Brock Bowers, who had missed the three previous games. Rookie Ashton Jeanty is averaging 94.6 scrimmage yards over his last five games, with five total touchdowns over that stretch.

The lead the league in the most important of defensive metrics, with the top-ranked third-down defense, as well as the No. 1 redzone defense.

The Broncos' 40 sacks are the most in the league, and that puts them on pace for 76 on the season, which would break the NFL's single-season record of 72 sacks by the 1984 Chicago Bears.On offense, the Broncos are simply a different team at home, with TNF taking place in Denver. The team is averaging 31.3 points at home, compared to 20 points on the road, while the Raiders equally struggle much more when leaving Vegas.

    "body": "\n        The final month of the regular season is always filled with posturing from teams and conferences vying for College Football Playoff spots, and coaches already began standing up for their leagues in the hunt for postseason berths. Prior to the debut CFP Top 25 rankings reveal, it was Texas' Steve Sarkisian championing three-loss SEC teams as playoff candidates. And after the rankings were unveiled, Nebraska's Matt Rhule spoke in defense of the Big Ten.Rhule specifically pointed to the quartet of two-loss teams in his conference and vouched for them in their respective quests for CFP bids. If one of the squads in that bunch – No. 19 USC, No. 20 Iowa, No. 21 Michigan and No. 23 Washington -- got into the bracket, the Big Ten could have four teams represented in the race for the national championship.\"I think the Big Ten teams with two losses are underappreciated,\" Rhule said on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"I think Iowa's having a heck of a season. I think SC is having a heck of a season, and many more. Michigan is at 7-2. … I do think there are some really good teams in the Big Ten. We deserve four in.\"The CFP selection committee views each of the Big Ten's two-loss teams similarly and effectively grouped them into a tier in its first batch of rankings. The committee respects those squads as playoff contenders but, for the moment, has them on the outside looking in at the 12-team bracket. It also placed them behind two-loss teams from all of the other power conferences, sending a clear message that their résumés are weaker than some of their SEC, ACC and Big 12 counterparts'.Those modest rankings for the Trojans, Hawkeyes, Wolverines and Huskies make their paths to the playoff fairly clear; they will likely need to win out and finish the regular season at 10-2 in order to clinch a berth.\n\n    \n                                        \n    USC TrojansUSC and Iowa will sort themselves out because they go head-to-head on Nov. 15 in what will be a de facto playoff elimination game. From there, the road gets even trickier for the Trojans as they must also get past No. 9 Oregon and do so in Autzen Stadium. With victories over the Hawkeyes and Ducks, USC would likely be one of the most accomplished two-loss teams in the country. Of course, Lincoln Riley's crew must first take care of business Friday against Northwestern and finish things off on Nov. 29 with a rivalry win over UCLA.\n    \n                                        \n    Iowa HawkeyesThe rubber meets the road this week for Iowa, which hosts Oregon at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS. Kinnick Stadium already proved daunting for one playoff hopeful in No. 2 Indiana, which played its worst game of the year in a narrow 20-15 win over the Hawkeyes in September. If the Hawkeyes spring a trap for the Ducks, the only things standing between them and their first trip to the CFP would be tricky road games at USC and Nebraska and a home date with Michigan State. A splashy win over the Ducks may also give them margin for error down the line as a potential three-loss playoff hopeful.\n    \n                                        \n    Michigan WolverinesWith all due respect to Northwestern and Maryland, whom the Wolverines face in their next two outings, there is only one real résumé-building opportunity remaining on Michigan's schedule: the regular-season finale against No. 1 Ohio State. The Wolverines will be betting underdogs when their bitter rivals visit Ann Arbor, but if the last four years taught the college football world anything, it is to throw expectations out the window for The Game. Sherrone Moore seemingly has Ohio State's number, and this year he duels with Ryan Day's Buckeyes at home. A fifth-straight win in the series would be the cherry on top of a 10-2 season, which almost certainly gets Michigan into the field.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Washington HuskiesWashington might be the sneakiest CFP contender nobody is talking about. The Huskies' 3-2 conference record has them sitting in the middle of the pack on the Big Ten leaderboard, but in a few weeks' time, they could be much closer to the top. They project as comfortable favorites over Wisconsin, Purdue and UCLA, and if they scorch through that stretch, they will set up a monumental rivalry battle with Oregon on their home turf. It would be a de facto play-in game for Jedd Fisch, who could then become the third different coach to take Washington to the playoff.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Pete Carroll's first year in Las Vegas has been a total disappointment. The Raiders are sitting at 2-6, and now they're on the road on Thursday night for a Week 10 showdown with the Denver Broncos. If the divisional clash goes anything like the Raiders' last two road games, things could get ugly. In Week 6, Carroll's team traveled to Indianapolis and suffered a 40-6 blowout loss against the Colts -- their largest loss in four years. Two weeks later, the Chiefs handed Las Vegas their largest shutout loss since 2014 with a 31-0 result.The Raiders have lost two straight road games by at least 30 points, and if they lose by 30 or more in Denver, that will make it three straight, which is almost unheard of in the NFL.The last team to lose three straight road games by 30 points or more was the Buffalo Bills, who did it during a stretch that went from the end of the 1984 season into the 1985 season, according to CBS Sports Research. It's literally been 40 years since any team has struggled like that on the road, and the Raiders could match them on Thursday.The fact this game is being played in prime time probably isn't going to help things because the Raiders haven't won a road prime-time game in eight years (their last win came on Nov. 5, 2017). Since then, they've gone 0-7.\nTo make things even more difficult, the Raiders have to face the hottest team in the NFL. The Broncos will be heading into Thursday's game on a six-game winning streak, which is tied with the Patriots for the longest in the league. The Broncos have also won nine straight home games, which is the longest active streak in the NFL and Denver's longest home winning streak since 2015 when it won Super Bowl 50.If you think the Broncos have a chance to beat the Raiders by at least 30 points, oddsmakers like FanDuel Sportsbook have priced those odds accordingly: Denver -29.5 is priced at +1100 (a $10 bet wins $110).\nIf the Raiders want to cling to some sort of hope, the Broncos have lost four of their past Thursday night games, so an upset isn't impossible. The Raiders are 9.5-point underdogs, but they might have a chance in Denver -- and that's because they got their not-so-secret weapon back last week: tight end Brock Bowers. Bowers returned in Week 9 with a monster performance during which he caught 12 passes for 127 yards and three touchdowns in a 30-29 loss to Jacksonville. \nThe Raiders are a completely different offense when he's in the lineup: Las Vegas has averaged 21.2 points per game when he's on the field and 8.7 points in the three games he missed due to injury. That 21.2 average is big this week, because if the Raiders (2-6) can top 20 points against Denver, they'll have a fighting chance: The Broncos are 5-0 when they hold their opponent under 20 points, but just 2-2 when they surrender 20 points or more. \n            ",

They still have a chance to achieve their preseason goal of winning a title. Throughout this rollercoaster ride of a season, Manning's famous family watched the ups and downs alongside the rest of the country. While you'd think their experience with Peyton and Eli would made it easier to deal with the emotions of watching Arch on Saturdays, his grandparents Archie and Olivia told Kay Adams Arch proves for a more nerve-wracking experience.\"I think I'm more nervous for my grandson than I ever was for my boys,\" Olivia said. \"Or my husband [laughs].\" \n\"I don't know why -- it should really be no different to me,\" Archie added. \"I dealt with it when the boys played. I was a little superstitious at times. ... I hadn't been doin' that with Arch, I hadn't been to but one game, so I've been home. But it's hard. It's really hard. We pull for him so hard and they've had some protection problems this year and struggled in a few games, but we're proud of him and he's handled everything really well.\" It's probably gotten a bit easier of late as Arch and the Texas offense started to play better. Manning has thrown for over 300 yards in back-to-back games for the first time in his career, as Steve Sarkisian seems to be doing a better job putting his young quarterback in positions to succeed and getting into plays that are better suited for his current skillset. Manning's progress will be put to quite the test in the final three games of the regular season, as the Longhorns visit No. 5 Georgia after a bye week and then close the season by hosting No. 3 Texas A&M. If Manning can help lead Texas to upsets in those games, all the struggles early in the season will be forgotten and the hype train will rev back up. \nHis grandparents will be right alongside Texas fans in riding the rollercoaster that has been this Horns season and hoping it finishes with a flourish. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        'Thursday Night Football' gets back to a divisional matchup in NFL Week 10 as the Las Vegas Raiders will visit the Denver Broncos at 8:15 p.m. ET. Rookie running backs Ashton Jeanty and RJ Harvey could factor into an NFL SGP considering their early success thus far, while one of last year's top rookies in Brock Bowers will as well after hitting all of the Overs with his prop bets last week. Bowers posted a 12-127-3 stat line, catching three of Geno Smith's four touchdown passes. A Thursday Night Football SGP could also consider vets like Courtland Sutton and J.K. Dobbins as they face Vegas' No. 23 scoring defense.Meanwhile, Denver has an elite defense that is top five in both points allowed and yards allowed. The Broncos held Bowers to just four grabs for 38 yards when he last faced them, and the star TE has an NFL props bar of 69.5 yards and 6.5 receptions for Thursday. Knowing how Denver is defending tight ends this year would help inform you as to which side of this Thursday Night Football prop you should side with.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Cardinals wide receiver Zay Jones suffered a torn Achilles Sunday against the Seahawks when he turned to complain to an official about not getting a call in his favor. The injury will sideline him for the remainder of the season, coach Jonathan Gannon said Monday. Jones appeared to take a few steps after getting hurt, just before going down to the turf. Medical personnel helped him off the field, and the team ruled him out shortly thereafter.\nSeveral telltale signs of a torn Achilles were present: Jones looked down at the back of his leg as if someone had kicked him, and slow-motion replays showed a clear \"pop\" in his calf.The Cardinals were already down by 35 points in an eventual 44-22 loss when the Jones injury occurred, making the injury yet another brutal turn of events in what had already been a disastrous afternoon for Arizona.\n        \n            \n                NFL QB carousel already spinning: Kyler Murray's future, Jets' next move and more\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJones, 30, has dealt with several injuries throughout his NFL career, including multiple shoulder ailments, knee and hamstring issues and a concussion. This is his second season with Arizona; he has also spent time with the Bills (who drafted him in the second round in 2017), Raiders and Jaguars.\nThe Cardinals have dealt with several injuries this season; starting quarterback Kyler Murray (foot) has not played in over a month and was recently placed on IR. James Conner was lost for the season early in the year, and backup Trey Benson got injured shortly after that. Starting cornerbacks Will Johnson and Max Melton were also out against the Seahawks.\n            \n    ",

Burrow told Jay Glazer of FOX Sports that he expects to be back by Week 13, which means he's ahead of his original three-month timeline.      Burrow is rostered in 50 percent of leagues on CBS Sports, so Fantasy managers should add him now, where available, especially if you're headed for the playoffs. When healthy, Burrow is a top-five Fantasy quarterback in all leagues.      I would still roster Joe Flacco (74 percent) until Burrow is back, and Flacco should be considered a No. 1 quarterback in all leagues in Week 11 at Pittsburgh. In four starts with the Bengals, Flacco is averaging 30.4 Fantasy points, which is incredible.      In other injury news, Jaxson Dart (concussion), J.K. Dobbins (foot), Davante Adams (oblique), Garrett Wilson (knee), Oronde Gadsden II (knee), and Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) were all hurt in Week 10. We're keeping an eye on status reports for all of these guys prior to Week 11, but Fantasy managers should start trying to find replacement options now, just in case any of them are out.      We also have two teams on a bye with Indianapolis and New Orleans. This should be another busy week on the waiver wire.  Editor's note: For this waiver wire column, we are only looking at players rostered in less than 65 percent of CBS Sports leagues.  \n        Week 11 Waivers\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                \n                            \n                    Quarterbacks\n                \n                    \n            On a bye: Daniel Jones and Tyler Shough.      Injuries: Jaxson Dart (concussion), Geno Smith (quadriceps), Jayden Daniels (elbow), Brock Purdy (toe), Kyler Murray (foot), C.J. Stroud (concussion), Joe Burrow (toe), and Anthony Richardson (eye).      Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Joe Flacco (74 percent rostered) and Aaron Rodgers (71 percent). Flacco might only have two more starts with the Bengals, with Burrow hoping to return in Week 13. But in Week 11 at Pittsburgh, I like Flacco as a low-end No. 1 quarterback in all leagues, and he is averaging 30.4 Fantasy points in four starts with Cincinnati. ... Rodgers was bad at the Chargers with 8.4 Fantasy points, and he has combined for just 22.6 points in his past two outings against Los Angeles and Indianapolis. But in Week 11, Rodgers gets to face the Bengals, who are No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks. And he gets the Bears in Week 12, which is another favorable opponent, so Rodgers could be a useful starter for the next two games.      Drop candidates: Jayden Daniels (74 percent rostered), Trevor Lawrence (60 percent), Kyler Murray (50 percent), and Justin Fields (48 percent). Daniels was not placed on injured reserve, which means he can still return this season, but the earliest he would play is Week 13. Since there's no guarantee of his return -- and Washington should not rush him back at this point -- Fantasy managers can drop him for now. ... Lawrence had a rough game at Houston in Week 10 with 11.8 Fantasy points, and now he gets to face the Chargers in Week 11 and Arizona in Week 12, which are difficult matchups. We don't know when Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) will return, so Lawrence is only worth rostering in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues. ... Murray is on injured reserve, and the earliest he could play is Week 14. However, the Cardinals will likely stick with Jacoby Brissett for the rest of the season if healthy, so Murray is not worth rostering in the majority of leagues.

When healthy, he has top-five potential, and Joe Flacco has averaged 30.4 Fantasy points in four starts with the Bengals in Burrow's place. Fantasy managers in all leagues should stash Burrow now, especially if you're headed for the playoffs. Burrow's schedule upon return is at Baltimore in Week 13, at Buffalo in Week 14, vs. Baltimore in Week 15, at Miami in Week 16, and vs. Arizona in Week 17. Not the easiest of matchups, but when Burrow is healthy, it doesn't matter. He should be added for at least 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #7\n                                            \n                                            Age: 32\n                                                                        • Experience: 10 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        SF\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SF -2.5\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                23rd\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                14th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                33%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    1118\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    82\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    9\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    16.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Brissett lost two fumbles in a 44-22 loss to Seattle in Week 10, but he still had 258 passing yards and two touchdowns, along with 31 rushing yards. He's now scored at least 23.4 Fantasy points in four starts in a row for the injured Kyler Murray (foot), who was placed on injured reserve last week. Brissett is a great streaming option in Week 11 against the reeling 49ers, and then he gets to face Jacksonville in Week 12 and Tampa Bay in Week 13.

But in Week 11 in Madrid, Tagovailoa gets to face the Commanders, who are No. 4 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks. He's a good streaming option in that matchup, and then Tagovailoa gets to face New Orleans in Week 13, the Jets in Week 14, Pittsburgh in Week 15, Cincinnati in Week 16, and Tampa Bay in Week 17 after a bye in Week 12. It's an ideal schedule, and Tagovailoa could be a surprise Fantasy quarterback to close the year. He's worth adding for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        WAS\n                    \n                         \n                        Washington\n                    \n                                            • #8\n                                            \n                                            Age: 32\n                                                                        • Experience: 11 year\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        MIA\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    MIA -2.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                25th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                17th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                48%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    852\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    144\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    7\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                The Commanders are a mess right now, but that doesn't mean Mariota can't help Fantasy managers in need of a quarterback. He scored 22.7 Fantasy points against Detroit in Week 10, and he now has at least 20.2 points in three of four starts for Washington this season in place of Jayden Daniels (elbow). Mariota has a favorable matchup in Week 11 at Miami in Madrid, and he can be considered a low-end starter in all leagues. Mariota is worth adding for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SF\n                    \n                         \n                        San Francisco\n                    \n                                            • #13\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ARI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SF -2.5\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                5th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                64%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    586\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    21.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Purdy (toe) could return in Week 11 at Arizona, and we're hopeful he's back on the field soon. He's been out since Week 4 and has played just two games this season, although he's scored at least 20.8 Fantasy points in both outings. Mac Jones (22 percent rostered) has scored at least 22 Fantasy points in three of his past six starts in place of Purdy, and Jones can be a streamer once again if Purdy is out against the Cardinals. Purdy is worth adding in all leagues for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB, and Jones can be added for 1 percent.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LV\n                    \n                         \n                        Las Vegas\n                    \n                                            • #7\n                                            \n                                            Age: 35\n                                                                        • Experience: 13 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DAL -3.5\n                                    O/U 50.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                32nd\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                23rd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                21%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    1844\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    88\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    11\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    14\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Smith (quadriceps) was injured in Week 10 at Denver, so keep an eye on his status heading into Week 11 against Dallas. We hope he's healthy because this is a great matchup against the Cowboys, who are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks. Smith has been an up-and-down Fantasy quarterback this season, but he has scored at least 19.5 Fantasy points in three of six games with Brock Bowers. Smith is worth adding for 1 percent of your remaining FAB. If Smith is out, then look for Kenny Pickett (1 percent rostered) as an option in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues.

He's not my favorite streaming quarterback in Week 11, but the matchup is favorable, so consider adding McCarthy for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #10\n                                            \n                                            Age: 27\n                                                                        • Experience: 5 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        TEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    HOU -7.5\n                                    O/U 39.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                20th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                6%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    452\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                C.J. Stroud (concussion) missed Week 10 against Jacksonville and is still in the protocol Monday. We'll see what happens as Week 11 goes on, but Mills scored 31.7 Fantasy points against the Jaguars and now faces the Titans. If Mills starts again, he would be a streaming option in deeper leagues and a low-end starter in all Superflex and two-quarterback leagues. He's worth adding in those formats for at least 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

We would love it if Jameis Winston (1 percent rostered) got the chance to start, and he has more upside than Wilson. Interim coach Mike Kafka will make the call after Brian Daboll was fired Monday, so keep an eye on what develops. Wilson or Winston will only be worth using in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues for 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CLE\n                    \n                         \n                        Cleveland\n                    \n                                            • #12\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BAL -8.5\n                                    O/U 41.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                21st\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                5%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Dillon Gabriel is expected to remain the starter for the Browns in Week 11 against Baltimore, but he might be on the verge of getting benched in favor of Sanders. It's not a bad idea to stash Sanders now in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB. There might not be much upside for Sanders, but he could be useful in a desperate situation.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                \n                            \n                    Running Backs\n                \n                    \n            On a bye: Jonathan Taylor and Alvin Kamara.      Injuries: J.K. Dobbins (foot), Zonovan Knight (ankle), Terrell Jennings (knee), Chris Rodriguez (shoulder), Bucky Irving (shoulder), Rhamondre Stevenson (toe), Isiah Pacheco (knee), Samaje Perine (ankle), Omarion Hampton (ankle), Trey Benson (knee), Joe Mixon (foot), Braelon Allen (knee) and MarShawn Lloyd (hamstring).      Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Trey Benson (82 percent rostered), Isiah Pacheco (77 percent), and Tyjae Spears (70 percent). It was disappointing that Benson (knee) didn't return in Week 11 when first eligible to come off injured reserve, and hopefully he'll be back in Week 12. When healthy, he could be a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues. ... Pacheco (knee) missed Week 9 at Buffalo before a bye in Week 10, but he's expected back in Week 11 at Denver. He's been a disappointment so far this season, but maybe there's a chance he can close the year on a high note. He's not a bad stash candidate at the end of your bench. ... Spears went into his bye in Week 10 having scored at least nine Fantasy points in three of his past four games. He can be a potential flex option in all leagues, and he would be a borderline starter in all leagues if Tony Pollard ever missed any time.      Drop candidates: Nick Chubb (71 percent rostered), Zonovan Knight (65 percent), and Kenneth Gainwell (45 percent). Chubb played a season-low 10 snaps in Week 10 against Jacksonville. The Texans appear to be turning the backfield over to Woody Marks, and Chubb has minimal Fantasy value moving forward if he's in a reduced role. ... Knight (ankle) might not be able to play in Week 11 against San Francisco after getting hurt in Week 10 at Seattle. And he's been limited to a combined 11 PPR points in his past two games against the Cowboys and Seahawks. Benson could also return soon, and Emari Demercado appears to be the favored running back in Arizona for now. There's little reason to roster Knight in the majority of leagues heading into Week 11. ... Gainwell is worth holding if you want to handcuff Jaylen Warren, but Gainwell's role has diminished in the past four games with a combined 16.8 PPR points over that span. In Week 10 at the Chargers, Gainwell had no carries for the first time all year.  \nAdd in this order:       Week 11 Waiver Priority List\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #31\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        SF\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SF -2.5\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                21st\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                32nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                47%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    233\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    52\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    4.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Trey Benson (knee) remains on injured reserve, and Zonovan Knight (ankle) was injured in Week 10 at Seattle. Demercado could be the lead running back for the Cardinals against San Francisco in Week 11, which would make him a solid flex option in the majority of leagues. Michael Carter (11 percent rostered) would also get a bump in value if Benson and Knight are out, but Demercado has more upside. He had 14 carries for 79 yards and one catch for minus-1 yard in Week 9 at Dallas, and then he had four carries for 64 yards and three catches for 40 yards on four targets in Week 10 at Seattle. Demercado is worth adding for at least 10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #44\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BUF\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BUF -5.5\n                                    O/U 49.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                26th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                38th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                12%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    129\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    -4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    3.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                We don't know when Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) is going to return for Tampa Bay, but Tucker might be the Buccaneers running back to trust heading into Week 11 at Buffalo. He's run better than Rachaad White in the past two games against New Orleans and New England with 21 carries for 95 yards and a touchdown over that span, compared to 23 carries for 73 yards for White. Tucker is just a flex option at best, but he's worth adding in all leagues for 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

Tyrone Tracy Jr. had a solid game at Chicago in Week 10 with 14 carries for 71 yards and no catches on one target, but Singletary still finished with eight carries for 20 yards and three catches for 53 yards on three targets. We'll see who starts at quarterback for the Giants, but I like Singletary as a flex option at best against the Packers.

Kyren Williams remains the starter for the Rams, but they are rotating drives with him and Corum. Williams continues to be the more productive running back, but Corum can be a flex option in deeper leagues since he's scored at least 5.3 PPR points in three games in a row. And Corum is a potential lottery ticket in case Williams were to miss any time. Corum is worth adding for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATL\n                    \n                         \n                        Atlanta\n                    \n                                            • #25\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    ATL -3.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                16th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                45th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                62%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    270\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    7.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Allgeier continues to steal rushing touchdowns from Bijan Robinson, which is frustrating, but Allgeier scored a pair of one-yard touchdowns in Week 10 at Indianapolis in Berlin. He also added 11 carries for 57 yards and has now scored a touchdown in four of his past six games overall. Allgeier can be considered a flex option in deeper leagues in Week 11 against Carolina, and he's a lottery ticket if anything were to happen to Robinson this season. Allgeier is worth adding in all leagues for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SF\n                    \n                         \n                        San Francisco\n                    \n                                            • #3\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ARI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SF -2.5\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                20th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                49%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    238\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    15\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    4.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Robinson is starting to become a potential flex option on top of a lottery ticket with his work in the past two games in tandem with Christian McCaffrey. In his past two outings against the Giants and Rams, Robinson has 13 carries for 94 yards and two touchdowns, and one catch for 4 yards on one target. He scored at least 11.3 PPR points in each outing, and we'll see if the 49ers start to give him more work moving forward. And, if something were to happen to McCaffrey, Robinson would be a must-start Fantasy option in all leagues. He is worth adding for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                \n                            \n                    Wide Receivers\n                \n                    \n            On a bye: Michael Pittman, Alec Pierce, Josh Downs, and Chris Olave.      Injuries: Davante Adams (oblique), Garrett Wilson (knee), Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle), Terry McLaurin (quadriceps), Kayshon Boutte (hamstring), Chris Godwin (leg), Ricky Pearsall (knee), Matthew Golden (shoulder), Calvin Ridley (hamstring), Marvin Mims (concussion), Tory Horton (groin), Mike Evans (collarbone), Travis Hunter (knee), Jayden Reed (collarbone), Brandon Aiyuk (knee) and Jalen McMillan (neck).      Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Rashid Shaheed (82 percent rostered), Jakobi Meyers (82 percent), Alec Pierce (73 percent), Tez Johnson (72 percent), Tre Tucker (69 percent), and Jauan Jennings (69 percent). Shaheed only had one catch for 3 yards on one target in Week 10 against Arizona in his first game with Seattle, but Sam Darnold only attempted 12 passes. I'm still planning to stash Shaheed where available to see what develops, especially in a potential shootout with the Rams in Week 11. ... Meyers' debut with the Jaguars wasn't great with three catches for 41 yards on three targets in Week 10 at Houston, but he's still worth stashing to see what develops, especially if Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) remains out in Week 11 against the Chargers. ... Pierce is worth adding where available, even with the Colts on a bye in Week 11. He scored at least 17.5 PPR points in each of his past two games against Pittsburgh and Atlanta, and he has 20 targets over that span. He's become a go-to option for Daniel Jones, and Pierce should be considered a No. 3 Fantasy receiver when the Colts return to action in Week 12. ... Johnson only had five targets in Week 10 against New England, but he finished with four catches for 42 yards and two touchdowns. He's now scored at least 15.8 PPR points in two of his past three games, and Chris Godwin (leg) and Mike Evans (collarbone) aren't expected to play any time soon. Johnson should be considered a solid No. 3 Fantasy receiver heading into Week 11 at Buffalo. ... Tucker had a quiet outing in Week 10 at Denver with two catches for 28 yards on three targets in the first game without Meyers in Las Vegas, but Tucker should perform better moving forward, especially in Week 11 against Dallas. I want to stash Tucker in all leagues, and he could be a potential No. 3 Fantasy option against the Cowboys. ... Jennings is worth using as a borderline No. 2 receiver in the majority of leagues in Week 11 against Arizona after his performance in the past two games against the Giants and Rams. In those two outings, Jennings has combined for 10 catches for 112 yards and two touchdowns on 14 targets, and he scored at least 14.1 PPR points in each outing. We'll see what happens when Pearsall and Aiyuk are healthy, but that might not happen in Week 11. Jennings should be considered the No. 1 receiver for the 49ers until further notice.      Drop candidates: Ricky Pearsall (80 percent rostered), Chris Godwin (70 percent), and Kendrick Bourne (48 percent). Pearsall has been out since Week 4 and hasn't practiced for more than a month. We don't know when he's going to return, and it's safe to drop him at this point if you need the roster space. ... Godwin isn't expected to return until the end of November or early December, which means we might not see him until Week 13 or 14. Given the uncertainty of his status and his lack of production when healthy this season, it's safe to drop him in the majority of leagues. ... Bourne had one catch for 19 yards on one target in Week 10 against the Rams. He's now scored 7.4 PPR points or less in four games in a row, and he's not worth rostering in the majority of leagues.

But even if Russell Wilson is the starter, Slayton can still be considered a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. He has scored at least 11.2 PPR points in each of his past two games, and the Giants will likely be chasing points most weeks, especially with a suspect running game. After Week 11, Slayton also has some favorable upcoming games against Detroit in Week 12, Washington in Week 15, Minnesota in Week 16, and Las Vegas in Week 17. He is worth adding for at least 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        JAC\n                    \n                         \n                        Jacksonville\n                    \n                                            • #11\n                                            \n                                            Age: 23\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAC -3\n                                    O/U 44\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                1st\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                37th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                43%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    28\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    51\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    330\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                We'll see what happens with Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) in Week 11 against the Chargers after Thomas was out in Week 10 at Houston. And Jakobi Meyers should take on a bigger role in his second week with the Jaguars, especially while Travis Hunter (knee) is on injured reserve. But Washington has at least seven targets in three games in a row, and he scored at least 10.2 PPR points in all three of those outings. He can be considered a low-end No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues against the Chargers, and then he faces Tennessee in Week 13, Indianapolis in Week 14, the Jets in Week 15, and the Colts again in Week 17. Washington is worth adding for at least 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CLE\n                    \n                         \n                        Cleveland\n                    \n                                            • #3\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 6 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BAL -8.5\n                                    O/U 41.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                29th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                54%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    28\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    66\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    335\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    7.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Jeudy had his best game of the season in Week 10 at the Jets with six catches for 78 yards and a touchdown on 12 targets. He scored a season-high 19.8 PPR points, and maybe this game can jumpstart him for the rest of the year. I wouldn't have high expectations with Dillon Gabriel at quarterback, but maybe the Browns will switch the Shedeur Sanders soon. Prior to Week 10, Jeudy had scored 9.3 PPR points or less in seven games in a row. That said, there could be a quality finish ahead. He's worth adding for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #81\n                                            \n                                            Age: 22\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        TEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    HOU -7.5\n                                    O/U 39.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                24th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                16%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    19\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    29\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    201\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    6.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Higgins had a solid outing in Week 10 against Jacksonville with five catches for 42 yards and a touchdown on seven targets. He's now scored at least 13.4 PPR points in two of his past three games, and hopefully, he can finish the season strong. Keep in mind that in Week 10, it was Davis Mills at quarterback for the injured C.J. Stroud (concussion), and Mills attempted 45 passes. But Higgins gets a great matchup in Week 11 at Tennessee, so hopefully he'll stay hot. He's worth adding for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIA\n                    \n                         \n                        Miami\n                    \n                                            • #6\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 2 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        WAS\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    MIA -2.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                30th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                23%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    44\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    192\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    6.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                In deeper leagues, Washington might be worth a look as a No. 3 Fantasy receiver given the Dolphins matchup against the Commanders in Madrid. Washington has scored a touchdown in two of his past three games, and the Commanders are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. Washington could be a surprise Fantasy option in Week 11, and he's worth adding for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                \n                            \n                    Tight End\n                \n                    \n            On a bye: Tyler Warren and Juwan Johnson     Injuries: Oronde Gadsden II (knee), Dalton Kincaid (hamstring), Darren Waller (pectoral), Mike Gesicki (pectoral), and Brenton Strange (quadriceps).      Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Harold Fannin Jr. (73 percent rostered), Cade Otton (71 percent), and Theo Johnson (68 percent). Fannin only had four catches for 44 yards in Week 10 at the Jets, but he had seven targets. He now has at least seven targets in three of his past four games, and he should continue to be a focal point of Cleveland's offense. He's worth using as a low-end starter in all leagues against the Ravens in Week 12. ... Otton was awesome in Week 10 against New England with nine catches for 82 yards on 12 targets. He has now scored at least 10.1 PPR points in four of his past five games, including two games over that span with at least 13.5 PPR points. Otton should be considered a must-start Fantasy tight end as long as Mike Evans (collarbone) and Chris Godwin (leg) remain out. ... Johnson had a solid outing in Week 10 at Chicago with seven catches for 75 yards on eight targets, and he has now scored at least 10.7 PPR points in five of his past seven games, including two in a row. We'll see who starts at quarterback for the Giants in Week 11 against Green Bay, with Jaxson Dart (concussion) hurt, but Johnson should be considered a low-end starter in all leagues, even if it's Russell Wilson or Jameis Winston under center against the Packers.      Drop candidates: Hunter Henry (75 percent rostered), T.J. Hockenson (69 percent), and Evan Engram (54 percent). Henry had a miserable game in Week 10 at Tampa Bay with one catch for 9 yards on four targets. He's now scored 9.1 PPR points or less in six games in a row, with one touchdown over that span. Henry is not worth trusting in most formats in Week 11 against the Jets. ... Hockenson has played four games with J.J. McCarthy, and Hockenson has four targets or less in each outing. He's been held to 15 yards or less in each of those games, with one touchdown. There's little reason to trust Hockenson in the majority of leagues heading into Week 11 against Chicago if McCarthy is not going to give him more chances to succeed. ... Engram has combined for 3.2 PPR points in his past two games against Houston and Las Vegas with two catches for 12 yards on eight targets. He has scored 7.6 PPR points or less in three games in a row, and Engram is not worth trusting in most leagues in Week 11 against the Chiefs.  \nAdd in this order:  Week 11 Waiver Priority List\n

After the bye, Johnson has favorable matchups against Miami in Week 13, Tampa Bay in Week 14, Carolina in Week 15, and the Jets in Week 16. He could be a difference maker for Fantasy managers to close the year.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #84\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        MIN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    MIN -3\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                21st\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                15th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                64%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    29\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    289\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    7.7\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Loveland took a step back from his big game in Week 9 at Cincinnati when he scored 29.8 PPR points and scored just 9.5 PPR points in Week 10 against the Giants. That's not a huge surprise, but it was good to see Loveland still have four catches for 55 yards on four targets. He has a favorable upcoming schedule against Minnesota in Week 11, Pittsburgh in Week 12, Green Bay in Week 14, and the Packers again in Week 16, and Loveland could be a low-end starter in those matchups given his upside. He's worth adding in all leagues for at least 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CLE\n                    \n                         \n                        Cleveland\n                    \n                                            • #85\n                                            \n                                            Age: 29\n                                                                        • Experience: 9 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BAL -8.5\n                                    O/U 41.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                12th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                16th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                64%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    29\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    43\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    281\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    9.4\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Njoku only had two catches for 21 yards on two targets in Week 10 at the Jets, but he scored a touchdown. He now has three touchdowns in his past four games, and he should continue to produce like a low-end No. 1 Fantasy tight end in the majority of leagues if he's scoring touchdowns. That said, we'd love to see him get more targets, and he had at least five targets in his previous three games prior to Week 10. I'm confident that will happen, and Njoku is worth adding for at least 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        JAC\n                    \n                         \n                        Jacksonville\n                    \n                                            • #85\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAC -3\n                                    O/U 44\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                6th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                    \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                15%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    204\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    0\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Strange (quadriceps) is eligible to return in Week 11, and hopefully, he's healthy enough to play against the Chargers. Prior to getting hurt in Week 5 against Kansas City, Strange had scored at least 10.5 PPR points in two games in a row against the Texans and 49ers. Given the state of Jacksonville's receiving corps -- Travis Hunter (knee) is on injured reserve and Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) is hurt -- Strange could be a go-to weapon for Trevor Lawrence.

And Davante Adams (oblique) is banged up, which could help Higbee if Adams is forced to miss any time. Higbee also has two touchdowns in his past four games, and he's worth adding in deeper leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            \n            \n\n  \tDST streamers  Chiefs (45 percent

    "body": "\n        The Minnesota Vikings committed eight false start penalties in Sunday's 27-19 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, good for the most by a home team in the last 16 NFL seasons. It was a stunning lack of discipline that affected players across the offense, both on the offensive line and at the skill positions. Vikings running back Aaron Jones suggested there was something more nefarious at play than lapses in focus from his teammates.Jones said the Ravens' defense made calls and movements at the line of scrimmage designed to draw the Vikings into pre-snap penalties. He said they were also \"playing a little game there\" with snap counts.\"They're making move calls up front, so sometimes it sounds like it could be J.J. (McCarthy) saying 'hut,'\" Jones said after the loss. \"They're making move calls and you see them stem. So they're trying to get them to jump, as well.\"Jones, notably, was the only Vikings player to allege that the Ravens' defense was at least partially to blame for the infractions. Minnesota head coach Kevin O'Connell pushed back on the claim and directed the blame toward his offense.\nThe use of disconcerting signals, whether verbal or physical, is prohibited. It is punishable by a 15-yard penalty. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh denied that his team did anything outside of the rulebook.\"One of the players said that,\" Harbaugh said on Monday. \"I read five other players and the head coach said, 'no.' But it did catch my attention, yes. So I went back and I watched it. We didn't have a game plan for that. If we did, I would have been happy. But we're not going to do anything illegal. If you stem, you make a move call. You're allowed to say 'move.' You're not allowed to say 'set' or 'hut' or anything else or a cadence, which we never have done.\"But then I watched all of them, and none of them did we stem. Not one did we move. … They were doing a lot of on-two, trying to draw us offsides. And then they were doing some shifts where they could uncover man/zone and try to see what we were in. They jumped a few times when they were doing that to try to get to their alerts and their change of plays. So, like Coach O'Connell said, it wasn't anything we were doing.\"\nUnforced errors plagued the Vikings in the loss, as they committed 13 total penalties for 102 yards. Eight of the penalties and 40 of the yards came from false starts. Minnesota's offense also coughed up the ball three times, twice by way of interceptions and once with a fumble.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The work Jedd Fisch accomplished in his first two seasons at Washington, and his propensity to move from one job to another, made him a popular name on the 2025 college football coaching carousel. His alma mater, Florida, is in search of a new coach, which only adds to the speculation that he could bolt from Seattle early in his tenure. Fisch was vocal about his status with the Huskies amid the numerous ongoing coaching searches across the country.While he did not explicitly state his disinterest in other jobs, Fisch made it clear in a lengthy statement that he very much enjoys his position at Washington.\"Those lists are made by people that have no idea what's going on, honestly,\" Fisch said Monday of those speculating about his future. \"They don't know what's happening in our program. They have no idea how excited I am about the youth in our program. They have no idea how excited I am about the fact that we're playing six or seven true freshmen. No idea how excited I am about the fact that Demond Williams, I believe, has a chance over the next year or two years after this to be one of the all-time best quarterbacks that have come through this area.\"If Fisch were to leave Washington after just two seasons, Florida would be the obvious destination. Fisch graduated from Florida in 1998 and landed a job on Steve Spurrier's staff in 1999 as a graduate assistant, making his college coaching debut with the Gators. His ties to the university are deep and provide fuel to the intrigue of a potential return to the Sunshine State.\n\"I don't think that they would know how I enjoy coaching here, that we've spent a ton of money into building this program the way we want to build it, that I had a great hand in all the facilities,\" Fisch said. \"I was a big part of making the decisions on how we wanted to recreate this space to give our players an unbelievable opportunity to have a recovery room that they never had, working on making sure that they have the best nutrition they could possibly have, give them great new meeting rooms, new office spaces for our coaches.\"Beyond Florida, Fisch could be an attractive candidate for a number of the other open jobs across the nation. He has spent time in effectively every region of the country throughout his college and NFL coaching careers, and after resurrecting the Arizona program in short order and positioning Washington for College Football Playoff contention in Year 2, his limited track record as a head coach speaks for itself.\"I think, unfortunately, what happens is they just want to tie coaches to lists,\" Fisch said, \"and then we have to sit there and defend it rather than just be able to just tell our fans -- our players, our coaching staff, myself, my family, we love coaching at the University of Washington.\n\"The ridiculousness of people that want to claim that because my wife and daughters are living in Arizona, because I have a 16-year-old who's been in five different schools in the last eight years to finish her high school, has anything to do with my decision. Or the ridiculousness of just putting my name on a list just to do it. Not only does that affect recruiting, it affects our team, it affects our staff. My hope is that our players, our coaches, our families understand how much we love it at Washington.\"\n            ",

She is no longer in a boot but is still working toward full recovery. Betts, the No. 2 player of the 247Sports class of 2025 rankings, got injured during a scrimmage against UC Riverside on Oct. 19 and has yet to make her college debut. She has been doing individual work during practices, but has still not been cleared for contact. Betts and the training staff are taking her recovery day by day and haven't announced a specific timeline for her return.Despite not playing a game yet, the 6-foot-4 forward is expected to be an impactful part of the roster. Betts is the younger sister of UCLA star center Lauren Betts, but she brings her own skillset and talent. Sienna averaged 23 points and 16.5 rebounds per game during her senior year at Grandview High School in Colorado, and Close has talked about how her \"challenger\" personality will help make the team even more competitive.\nThe Bruins are fresh off their first-ever NCAA Tournament Final Four appearance, and the expectations remain high this season. The matchup against Oklahoma will be a good test for both teams because the Sooners are coming off of their first Sweet 16 appearance in over a decade. One of the biggest storylines of this game was supposed to be Betts playing against No. 1 freshman Aaliyah Chavez, but that encounter will have to wait a little longer. Five Bruins have averaged double figures in the first two games, led by Gabriela Jaquez and Lauren Betts. Meanwhile, Oklahoma has four double-digit scorers with leader Reagan Beers averaging 29 points per contest. There will be a lot of talent on the court, and the venue also makes this matchup stand out. The game will take place at Golden 1 Center, which will host the Sacramento Regional of the 2026 NCAA Tournament.\nNo. 3 UCLA vs. No. 6 Oklahoma is set for Monday at 10:30 p.m. ET on Fox Sports. \n            \n    ",

Video footage captured players from both teams exchanging punches and being thrown along the benches as coaching staff struggled to restore order.\"We're extremely disappointed by the events that transpired during halftime of the Bethune-Cookman at Grambling State football game,\" SWAC commissioner Dr. Charles McClelland said in a release. \"Acts of that nature have zero place in the Southwestern Athletic Conference and intercollegiate athletics.

However, specific names were not given. Additionally, fines of $25,000 and $40,000 were levied against Bethune-Cookman and Grambling State, respectively.\nGrambling State coach Mickey Joseph defended his players after the 31-23 win, suggesting that Bethune-Cookman's delayed exit from the locker room contributed to the escalation.\"That's the disrespect stuff,\" Joseph said, via KNOE-TV's Clay Witt. \"We're not going to tolerate disrespect here at Grambling. You won't disrespect us. We're going to meet disrespect with disrespect.\"On Monday, Joseph clarified in a prepared statement that his comments were not meant to condone violence.\nTexas State-Louisiana postgame scuffle results in 13 player suspensionsThe Sun Belt handed down several suspensions after a postgame confrontation following Louisiana's 42-39 win against Texas State. The conflict began during the final offensive plays and intensified as players and coaches gathered for postgame handshakes, ultimately spilling into the stadium tunnel.\nTexas State had six players suspended, including defensive end Tymere Jackson for two games.

I mean you get attacked and I don't know how you're supposed to respond.

Both schools will forfeit their remaining game, with opponents Bridgewater College and Roanoke College having the opportunity to play against each other to complete their season.\n\"While competition is at the heart of what we do, the integrity with which we compete defines who we are,\" ODAC commissioner Brad Bankston said in a release. \"The actions following Saturday's contest did not reflect those values, and this decision underscores our commitment to maintaining the standards our conference represents.

    "body": "\n        It's easy to see why some Washington Commanders fans are uneasy. A young, electric quarterback wins Offensive Rookie of the Year, energizes a franchise, then suffers a major injury against the Seattle Seahawks -- on nearly the same patch of grass where Robert Griffin III's career-altering moment unfolded more than a decade ago. But Griffin isn't buying the idea that history is repeating itself as it relates to Jayden Daniels.The parallels are striking -- the same stadium, the same opponent, even the same down and yard line, just on opposite ends of the field. Jayden Daniels' dislocated elbow in Week 9 brought back memories. Yet Griffin was quick to push back, calling the comparisons mere coincidence.\"Nope,\" Griffin said on his podcast. \"I am a positive thinker. I believe he will bounce back, as long as they give him the proper amount of time to fully heal. Everyone keeps mentioning me on social media, going into all these diatribes about how they're comparing my situation to Jayden Daniels, but they're really not even close to the same.\"Griffin, who won Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2012, suffered a series of right knee injuries that season, beginning with a sprained LCL after taking a direct hit from Baltimore Ravens lineman Haloti Ngata in Week 14. Though he missed only one game, the injury lingered into the postseason. In an NFC wild-card game against Seattle, Griffin's knee buckled on a bad snap, leaving him crumpled on the turf. The damage -- torn ACL and LCL ligaments requiring reconstructive surgery -- effectively marked the beginning of the end of one of the most promising rookie campaigns in league history.Daniels, by contrast, appears to have avoided that kind of long-term setback. The 24-year-old dislocated his left elbow in Washington's 38-14 loss to the Seahawks but escaped ligament damage and will not require surgery. The Commanders plan to re-evaluate him after their Week 12 bye rather than place him on injured reserve -- a scenario that amounts to the best-case outcome for a scary-looking injury.\nGriffin described Washington's environment as one of the biggest differences between his experience and that of Daniels.\"There's no infighting in this organization,\" Griffin said. \"The head coach and the owner aren't fighting about who they want the quarterback to be, how they want the offense to be run, who's supposed to be in charge.\"Under new owner Josh Harris, general manager Adam Peters and coach Dan Quinn, Washington's leadership structure is far more unified than during Griffin's time. The front office also built a veteran support system around Daniels -- including offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, receiver Terry McLaurin, tight end Zach Ertz and linebacker Bobby Wagner -- creating the kind of stability Griffin rarely enjoyed.\n\"I can understand the concern and the injury and how that makes Washington fans have PTSD about what happened in 2012 going into 2013,\" Griffin said. \"But Jayden Daniels' story is not like mine.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NWSL's great promise is its parity, a theory the Kansas City Current downright rejected as the runaway winners of the Shield, commanding a 21 point lead between first and second place at the conclusion of the regular season. The Current's surprise elimination by Gotham FC on Sunday, though, means it just might be anyone's game as the postseason reaches its penultimate stage, setting up for an intriguing final batch of games this season.At this point, the NWSL Championship just might be the Washington Spirit's to lose, partially by default as the highest seed left in the playoffs. It would not be hard to envision a single one of the semifinalists winning the whole thing, each of them heavyweights in their own right – the Orlando Pride, Gotham, the Portland Thorns and the Spirit are the last four NWSL champions. The quartet feel as evenly matched as it gets, though – none of the remaining teams enter the semifinals in perfect shape, but have demonstrated an ability to problem solve with the talented players that they have.Here's a look at where each team stands as they target a spot in the NWSL Championship on Nov. 22 at San Jose's PayPal Park.NWSL Playoffs semifinal scheduleAll times U.S./EasternSaturday, Nov. 15Washington Spirit vs. Portland Thorns, 12 p.m. (CBS, Paramount+)\nSunday, Nov. 16Orlando Pride vs. Gotham FC, 3 p.m. (ABC, ESPN+)4. Portland ThornsThe Portland Thorns have punched above their weight all season long, rising all the way to a third place finish and booking a berth in the playoff semifinals. They have reached these heights because of an overreliance on midfielder Sam Coffey, who has often made up for her team's defensive vulnerabilities during a career-best season. The Thorns may finally be peaking at the right time, though – Olivia Moultrie's run of eight goals and one assist in her last 11 games for club and country gives her side an attacking edge that they have missed at times this season.3. Orlando PrideThe Orlando Pride's end product has slowed since Barbra Banda sustained a season-ending hip injury in August, scoring just 11 goals in the 10 regular season games she missed down the stretch. The good news for the Pride, though, is that they are well-positioned to survive the issue – they won the NWSL Championship a year ago with a gritty 1-0 win over the Spirit, opting to absorb the opponent's pressure after taking an early lead. Reigning defender of the year Emily Sams remains a fixture in the back line, while Lizbeth Ovalle has settled in well and ranks inside the NWSL's top 10 for chances created since Banda's injury.2. Gotham FCIt has been an imperfect season for Gotham but in their 2-1 win over the Current in the quarterfinals, they found a response to the doubts they have faced in recent months. They have been overreliant on MVP candidate Esther Gonzalez, who has scored around 40% of the team's goals this season, but their depth paid off against the Current. Jaedyn Shaw has been a game-changer since her September arrival, showcasing her skill yet again with a goal on Sunday, while Katie Stengel proved to be a surprise hero with the last-gasp game winner in Kansas City. Like the Thorns, they may also have hit their stride at the right time – and could really challenge the Pride's stingy defense if Gonzalez is able to participate in the semifinals.\n1. Washington SpiritThe Spirit's playoff run has centered around Trinity Rodman's availability following an MCL sprain, her return potentially imminent if her recovery has gone as expected. Until Rodman's prognosis suggests otherwise, the Spirit are the team to beat, especially since she is buoyed by Gift Monday and Croix Bethune. Without Rodman, though, the Spirit are a very different team – they have just four wins in 12 matches without her and their goal difference swings from +13 when she is on the field to -3 when she is not.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With their season slipping away, Washington Commanders coach Dan Quinn has made a significant change. Quinn announced on Monday that he is taking over defensive play-calling duties from coordinator Joe Whitt. Quinn will call plays from the sideline, while Whitt will move up to the coach's booth. \"When something's not working, we shift from the question of why isn't it working to what do we need to do to get it right,\" Quinn said. \"Right now, that'll call for some change. I'll take over the role as the defensive coordinator and all that entails. Joe's been my right hand man for years and took the news like a pro he is.\"Quinn's announcement comes after a 44-22 loss to the Lions in which Detroit racked up 546 yards and did not punt all game. By virtue of Sunday's loss, the Commanders became the first team since the 2002 Cardinals to lose four straight games by at least 21 points. Furthermore, Washington is the only team on record (since 1963) to have consecutive games in which it did not produce a sack and allowed at least 8 yards per play.Frustration bubbled over several times, including when defensive lineman Daron Payne got ejected for punching Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown. On Monday, Payne received a one-game suspension for his \"act of unsportsmanlike conduct.\" \nOne year after going 12-5 and reaching the NFC Championship Game for the first time since the 1991 season, Washington is 3-7 and has lost five straight games. During that losing streak, the Commanders have been outscored 179-89 and rank among the worst teams in the NFL in several major categories.Commanders since Week 6NFL RankPoints allowed179LastYards per game allowed437th31stYards per play allowed7.231stDefensive three-and-out rate14%LastWhitt, 47, has served as the Cowboys' defensive backs coach/defensive pass game coordinator from 2021-23, when Quinn was the team's defensive coordinator. Whitt was able to produce a middling defense in 2024 thanks to a bevy of veterans, including second-team All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner, but the bottom fell out this season, and injuries played a significant role. Washington lost Deatrich Wide Jr. (quad) for the season in Week 2, put safety Will Harris (leg) on IR after a Week 3 injury and lost sacks leader Dorance Armstrong Jr. (knee) for the season in Week 7. In Week 9, Marshon Lattimore tore his ACL.Still, Washington had made significant investments across the defense, bringing in Wise, Javon Kinlaw, Von Miller, Eddie Goldman and Jacob Martin in free agency to boost the defensive front and adding Harris, Jonathan Jones and second-round rookie cornerback Trey Amos in secondary.\nBetween Weeks 9 and 10, the Commanders decided to move Whitt from the coaches box to the field, but the results ended up being even worse. The Lions' 546 yards were the most the Commanders have allowed in a game since 2019.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase and right-handed starter Luis L. Ortiz have been indicted on charges stemming from alleged gambling misconduct -- specifically manipulating bets on individual pitches. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced the charges on Sunday and unsealed the indictment at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn. Ortiz has already been arrested in Boston, while Clase is not in custody. The Department of Justice has charged the pair with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy. Ortiz made his first court appearance Monday and was released on $500,000 bond, according to The Athletic. He is restricted from traveling outside Boston, where he has a home, other than court appearances in New York or to meet his attorney in Cleveland. Ortiz was also ordered to surrender his passport.Clase's alleged actions date back to May of 2023, while Oritz's began in June of 2025. Furthermore, Clase's actions are alleged to have benefitted bettors by a sum of $700,000, while Ortiz's accrued to the benefit of co-conspiring gamblers by a sum of $60,000. Overall, bettors conspiring with the pair made at least $450,000 from betting platforms, prosecutors allege. Clase is alleged to have communicated with bettors via text messages during games. The pair could face up to 65 years in prison if convicted on all charges. The indictment reads: \n\"The charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment on the wire fraud conspiracy count, 20 years' imprisonment on the honest services wire fraud conspiracy count, five years' imprisonment on the conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery count, and 20 years' imprisonment on the money laundering conspiracy count.\"Clase, 27, was one of two Guardians pitchers placed on administrative leave over the summer while the league investigated potential misdoing. Ortiz was also placed on leave several weeks earlier. Both Clase and Ortiz had their leaves extended in late August through the rest of the 2025 regular season. \"MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the process,\" the league said in a statement to ESPN. \"We are aware of the indictment and today's arrest, and our investigation is ongoing.\"The Guardians said they will \"continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.\"\n        \n            \n                How can MLB address prop betting problem? Five possible solutions amid Guardians' gambling scandal\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAccording to the Department of Justice, both pitchers \"agreed in advance with their co-conspirators to throw specific types of pitches and speeds of pitches.\" Said co-conspirators then allegedly used that inside information to place bets.\n\"In some instances, the defendants received bribes and kickback payments ... in exchange for rigging pitches,\" prosecutors wrote.The indictment chronicles specific instances in which the pitchers are alleged to have manipulated outcomes in collaboration with bettors: On or around May 19, 2023: Bettors allegedly made roughly $27,000 on a Clase pitch that was faster than 94.95 mph.On or around June 3, 2023: Bettors allegedly made roughly $38,000 on a Clase pitch that was slower than 94.95 mph and called a ball.On or around June 7, 2023: Bettors allegedly made roughly $68,000 on a Clase pitch that was slower than 94.95 and called a ball.On or around April 12, 2025: Bettors allegedly won $15,000 on a Clase pitch that was slower than 98.45 mph and called a ball. The next day, Clase is alleged to have asked one of the co-conspiring bettors to who won money on the April 12 pitch to \"send some of it to DR,\" seemingly referring to Clase's home country of the Dominican Republic, \"for repairs at the country house.\" April 26, 2025: Bettors allegedly won approximately $11,000 on a Clase pitch that was clocked slower than 97.95 mph. May 11, 2025: Bettors allegedly won approximately $11,000 on a Clase pitch that was called a ball.May 13, 2025: Bettors allegedly won approximately $3,500 on a Clase pitch that was a ball and was slower than 99.45 mph. May 17, 2025: This is one of the games in which Clase is alleged to have used his cell phone to coordinate with one or more bettors during the game. Bettors on this date are alleged to have won roughly $10,000 on a Clase pitch that was clocked slower then 97.95 mph and called a ball.On or about May 20, 2025: Clase is alleged to have directed a co-conspiring bettor to communicate with an associate, who subsequently directed the bettor to send $2,000 to an individual in the Dominican Republic. On or about May 28, 2025: Bettors wagered roughly $4,000 that a specific pitch by Clase would be a ball. The pitch did indeed appear to be out of the strike zone, but the batter swung and missed for a strike. The indictment reads: \"Approximately 20 minutes after Bettor-I lost the wager on May 28, 2025, Bettor-I sent a text message to the defendant EMMANUEL CLASE DE LA CRUZ-a .gif image of a man hanging himself with toilet paper. Even though the Cleveland Guardians won the game, approximately 10 minutes later, CLASE responded to Bettor-I with a .gif image of a sad puppy dog face.\"Ortiz is alleged to have joined Clase's scheme in June of 2025. Some of Ortiz's specific actions highlighted by the debate include: \nOn or about June 15, 2025: Ortiz is alleged to have agreed to throw his first pitch of the second inning for a ball in exchange for $5,000 from Clase. This made approximately $26,000 for two co-conspiring bettors. On or about June 27, 2025: Ortiz agreed to throw his first pitch of the third inning for a ball in exchange for approximately $7,000. Bettors are alleged to have made about $37,000 off the pitch. Ortiz has denied all allegations against him and claimed he \"has never, and would never, improperly influence a game -- not for anyone and not for anything.\"\"Luis is and always has been a fierce competitor. He has always given his best effort in every inning of every game. Those who have played with him know this. And the government's investigation, including discussions with Luis' teammates, supports this as well,\" his lawyer told CBS Sports in a statement. \"...There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning. Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court. The government's case is weak and circumstantial. He will defend himself, and he will be prevail.\"Ortiz's lawyer also said that all payments and money transfers were \"for lawful activities.\"\n\"Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,\" the closer's attorney told CBS Sports in a statement. \"Emmanuel is innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.\"Clase, who did not pitch after July 26, appeared in 48 games prior to the deactivation. He had amassed a 3.23 ERA (130 ERA+) and a 3.92 strikeout-to-walk ratio. His contributions had been worth an estimated 0.7 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. Ortiz made 16 starts before his suspension, going 4-9 with a 4.36 ERA.\"Professional athletes, like Luis Leandro Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase de la Cruz hold a position of trust-not only with their teammates and their professional leagues, but with fans who believe in fair play,\" United States Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr. said in a statement. \n\"As alleged, the defendants sold that trust to gamblers by fixing pitches.  In doing so, the defendants deprived the Cleveland Guardians and Major League Baseball of their honest services.  They defrauded the online betting platforms where the bets were placed.  And they betrayed America's pastime.  Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.  Today's charges make clear that our Office will continue to vigorously prosecute those who corrupt sports through illegal means.\"As with all such proceedings, defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. The indictment comes just weeks after Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested as part of an NBA betting scandal. Rozier and his co-conspirators allegedly obtained insider information about games, including which players were healthy and active, and passed it along to bettors. More than $200,000 in bets were placed on Rozier's \"under\" line across multiple prop bets during a March 23, 2023, game in which he left after playing less than 10 minutes. Damon Jones, a former NBA player, was also indicted and accused of passing along inside information, including about LeBron James.\nWhile sports gambling has been legalized across the country, MLB (and other leagues) have rules that prohibit certain behavior. MLB, for example, does not allow players to gamble on diamond sports, even of other teams. In 2024, MLB banned former San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for life and suspended four other players -- Athletics righty Michael Kelly, Padres lefty Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies infielder José Rodriguez, and Arizona Diamondbacks lefty Andrew Saalfrank -- after they were discovered to have bet on baseball games not involving their teams.Back in May, commissioner Rob Manfred reinstated several of the most notorious gambling-related rule violaters in league history -- Pete Rose and several members of the 1919 Black Sox -- from MLB's permanently ineligible list on the grounds that the lifetime bans ended with the player's death. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Missouri State will petition the NCAA for a postseason waiver that would allow its football team to play in a bowl game this season, despite rules blocking first-year FBS programs, CBS Sports has learned.\"We know the history of what that looks like, and it's traditionally not been looked at favorably, but we will be petitioning, and we'll see where that goes,\" Missouri State athletics director Patrick Ransdell told CBS Sports on Monday. \"We'll let the chips fall where they fall.\"The Bears (6-3, 4-1 Conference USA) reached the six-win threshold for bowl eligibility in dramatic fashion Saturday, rallying past Liberty on Jacob Clark's 13-yard touchdown pass to Tristan Gardner with 27 seconds remaining. However, NCAA rules prohibit postseason participation for teams transitioning from the FCS to the FBS.Teams in transition are prohibited from postseason events for two years, including their final season in the FCS. The probationary period enables athletic departments to implement improvements and meet specific criteria to compete in the FBS, including expanding scholarship opportunities and enhancing facilities.\nRansdell believes the logic is \"antiquated\" and the rule should be changed.\"In today's world, you can reinvent your team in a matter of weeks. It's just something that's dated,\" he said. \"If we're really in the business for student-athletes and the betterment of the student-athlete experience, there's no reason we should be punishing the student-athletes who are working hard day in, day out and deprive them of a postseason opportunity when there's really no good reason to do that.\"Missouri State and Delaware both jumped from the FCS to the FBS this year and joined Conference USA. As part of the transition, both were required to skip the 2024 FCS playoffs.There is a secondary path to the postseason: if fewer than 82 teams reach bowl eligibility, the NCAA can pull transitioning programs into the bowl pool to fill open slots. Fifty-nine teams have already reached six wins heading into the final three weeks, and another 19 sit at five victories.\n\"A lot of our guys came back knowing the challenges because they believe in what we're doing, what coach (Ryan) Beard and his staff are preaching,\" Ransdell said. \"To be able to reward these guys with a post-season opportunity, I don't care if it's in Anchorage, Alaska. You throw the ball down, we'll play.\"In 2023, three programs transitioning to the FBS had their postseason waivers denied by the NCAA, including James Madison, which started 10-0 and climbed to No. 18 in the AP Top 25 poll. The Virginia Attorney General even threatened legal action.JMU and Jacksonville State were ultimately allowed to play in bowl games because of a lack of bowl-eligible teams. Missouri State could also receive a bowl invitation in December if fewer than 82 teams are eligible.\nMissouri State has not conducted discussions with lawmakers. \"We'll obviously keep our options open, but you would like to think that cooler heads prevail and you figure out a good solution that's good for everybody,\" Ransdell said. \"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\"Missouri State's revenue has doubled year over year during its first fall in the FBS, Ransdell said, and football attendance is expected to increase as much as 40% in the first year.\"This last year of transition and playing an FBS schedule is nothing short of exhilarating,\" Ransdell said. \"So to be able to go to a bowl game in Year 1 would be amazing and something that I really think would help springboard us into future years. It allows you to hopefully get some sense of consistency in a world where consistency is really, really hard.\"\nRansdell said the school will file the petition with the NCAA within one week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Happy men's international break to all who celebrate! Manchester City went into the break on a high with a statement-making win over Liverpool, while the UEFA Women's Champions League soaks up the spotlight midweek. I'm Pardeep Cattry with the latest to start a new week.📺 Footy fixAll times U.S./EasternTuesday, Nov. 11🇪🇺 UWCL: Roma vs. Valarenga, 12:45 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Network🇪🇺 UWCL: Real Madrid vs. Paris FC, 3 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo Network🇪🇺 UWCL: St. Polten vs. Chelsea, 3 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+🇪🇺 UWCL: OL Lyonnes vs. Wolfsburg, 3 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Network⚽ The Forward Line🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 A title contender bites the dustIt is definitely too early to anoint a Premier League champion, but 11 games in, it just might be time to ring the death knell on Liverpool's chances of going all the way. The Reds notched a 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday, completely outmatched by Pep Guardiola's side as first place slips further out of reach for Arne Slot's group.Liverpool's 1-0 win over Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League may have inspired some confidence that things are finally trending in the right direction for Slot's side, but on Sunday, their imperfections were once again clear to see. The manager went with an identical lineup and received an early boost as Giorgi Mamardashvili saved Erling Haaland's penalty, all while ruing Virgil van Dijk's disallowed goal in the first half and hyping up the fact that they limited City to just 0.81 expected goals outside of the spotkick. None of it erases the fact that the Reds took just one shot on target and had just 0.71 expected goals of their own to speak of. As James Benge observed at Etihad Stadium, Liverpool have done little to address the problems that have plagued them all season long.\nBenge: \"When they return [from the international break], they will do so to a team that has not addressed the issues that have been apparent since the Community Shield. This team cannot defend its flanks … The problem wasn't [Conor] Bradley. There are maybe a handful of fullbacks in world football who could have dealt with [Jeremy] Doku in his current form. Liverpool threw two at him, but Dominik Szoboszlai was no more effective a shield. On the rare occasions where [Mohamed] Salah did track back, you could see why Slot was so prepared to let him shade the defending last season.\"The defeat leaves them in eighth place, eight points adrift of the first-place spot they had such a firm grip on this time last season. City were also imperfect, but Haaland finally had a supporting cast join him on the scoresheet as Doku and Josko Gvardiol each bagged a goal of their own. Guardiola's side are now just four points behind Arsenal after 11 games, positioning themselves as the most likely title challenger as the race for top spot begins to take shape. Matchday 3  🔜\n                                                                    Paramount+\n                                                            🔗  Midfield Link Play🇫🇷🇩🇪 Lyon look to extend perfect UWCL startIt may still be early days in this season's edition of the UEFA Women's Champions League but heading into Matchday 3, a few teams have already begun to stake their claim as potential winners. Five teams enter this week's fixtures with two wins out of two, the list including a match of surprises like Wolfsburg, Manchester United and Real Madrid. They are joined by two heavyweights in Barcelona and OL Lyoness, the latter of which can extend that winning streak on Tuesday when they host Wolfsburg.Lyon, the record eight-time UEFA Women's Champions League winners, are the definition of a behemoth but have reinvented themselves to match the modern ambitions of the women's game. A handful of mainstays departed the club in recent years, but a selection of younger stars has replaced them – midfielders Melchie Dumonay and Lily Yohannes have stolen the show in their first wins of the European season, Dumonay doing so in a 2-1 win at reigning champions Arsenal on Matchday 1. It is appropriate, then, that their slogan of the season is \"New Story, Same Legend,\" especially so under new ownership and management. Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg, one of the team's mainstays during a period of transition, said in a recent interview that the newcomers have been welcome additions to a storied Lyon team, including new manager Jonatan Giraldez.\nHegerberg: \"He's a guy who is very intense in the way he wants to work. He's very competitive, and I find that very positive. I like competition. He's already doing his interviews in French, which shows commitment and leadership our team like Lyon. I hope we manage to work hard together, and do what he wants to develop as a team, because that's what we need moving forward. It's exciting. We have to build, stone by stone, piece by piece and make sure we achieve something.\"How quickly Giraldez can put all the new pieces together is the big question that faces Lyon this season, including in Tuesday's clash against Wolfsburg. Lyon will be heavily favored but this match will mark an important opportunity for Giraldez's side to create some distance between them and the other Champions League participants, with only the league phase's four teams guaranteed direct qualification for the quarterfinals.🔗  Top Stories🏆 \"We're not underdogs\": Gotham FC pulled off the first big upset of the NWSL playoffs, ousting No. 1 Kansas City Current in extra time to set up a semifinal meeting with the Orlando Pride.

Wolfsburg may still come out on the losing side despite their best efforts but goalkeeper Stina Johannes may have it in her to come up with a big performance that at least restricts Lyon's attacking might, especially since the French side are only off to a modest start up top with just five goals in two games so far this season in Europe.For more picks, predictions, expert tips and the latest betting news, don't miss out on CBSSports.com's betting home page.\n📺  What We're Watching\n                                                                    Paramount+\n                                                            What's on CBS Sports Golazo Network🥅 Scoreline (Daily): Scoreline is the newest place for fans to catch up on all the biggest news and results impacting global football, match highlights from the top soccer competitions and all the can't-miss goals from the day's action, starting Thursday and airing seven days a week.📺 How to watch: CBS Sports Golazo Network is a free 24/7 channel exclusively dedicated to offering unparalleled coverage of all the top soccer competitions worldwide.

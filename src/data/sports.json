    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays may not have won the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, but this postseason did see them win a pennant and embrace a rising young star: right-hander Trey Yesavage.It was Yesavage who helped secure a major victory in Game 5 by striking out a rookie World Series-record 12 batters across seven innings of one-run ball. In five starts in October, he amassed a 3.46 ERA and a 3.9 strikeout-to-walk ratio. He also made a relief appearance in Game 7, though Toronto would lose that one in extra innings. Overall, the Blue Jays went 4-2 in contests in which he appeared. Not bad for someone who only made his pro debut earlier this year, and whose full extent of big-league experience entering the postseason was limited to three September starts.The nature of sports, and baseball in particular, is that there's a tendency to respond to a brilliant accomplishment by a player or a team by wondering who will be the next to follow that path. You saw it with Randy Arozarena during the 2020 playoffs, and you'll absolutely see it with Yesavage.How do we know? Because we're doing it right here, right now by highlighting three first-round pitchers from the 2025 Draft who, at least on paper, could follow Yesavage's general arc: that is, making an outsized impact for a potential World Series challenger. We acknowledge up front that the odds are against any of these pitchers doing quite this well, and that you should view the hunt for the next Yesavage as a figurative one rather than a literal one. Now, let's have some fun while we're young.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Kade Anderson, LHP, Seattle MarinersAnderson entered the final week of the draft cycle in the running to go No. 1 overall. The Washington Nationals instead went with prep shortstop Eli Willits, and the Los Angeles Angels then picked right-hander Tyler Bremner in the biggest shock of the top five. That left Anderson to the Mariners, one of the savvier organizations at pitcher development. \nAnderson is a polished lefty with four quality pitches and the SEC stamp of approval from LSU. (He posted a 3.18 ERA and a 5.14 strikeout-to-walk ratio, marks far superior to the conference averages of 5.10 and 2.65.) The Mariners have shown they're willing to push their best young arms to the Show -- George Kirby and Logan Gilbert each had fewer than 30 minor-league starts before their MLB debuts -- and they should be in position to make another deep run into October following this year's appearance in the American League Championship Series.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Gage Wood, RHP, Philadelphia PhilliesWood remained on the board until the late stages of the first round not because of lackluster talent but because of durability concerns. Across three collegiate seasons at Arkansas, he tallied just over 100 innings. Nonetheless, the Phillies were willing to take the risk and you can understand why. \nWood has a fantastic arsenal fronted by a mid-90s fastball and two good breaking balls that he delivers from a low release height. He didn't strike out 46% of the batters he faced during his final year at school by accident. Dave Dombrowski too has a history of fast-tracking talented arms to the majors, and Wood's shaky injury history should only incentivize the Phillies to act with a greater sense of urgency here.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Kyson Witherspoon, RHP, Boston Red SoxWitherspoon had a tremendous platform season at Oklahoma, nearly doubling his strikeout-minus-walk percentage (from 14.1% to 25.9%) while leveraging a deep arsenal fronted by a mid-to-upper-90s fastball. Part of Yesavage's profile is the oddball release. Witherspoon's operation isn't similar in the slightest, but it's probably the funkiest of the three pitchers here, for whatever that's worth, and his abrupt arm stroke should help aid his deception. The Red Sox too have employed a liberal approach toward promoting their best pitchers. Payton Tolle made fewer than 20 minor-league starts before arriving in the majors, and Connelly Early was just over 40 before taking the mound in the American League Divisional Series.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As many as four new players may call LIV Golf home in 2026 after the league confirmed Monday that the top two players from the International Series and LIV Golf Promotions will qualify for the circuit next season. Both pathways had previously awarded one spot each, meaning the league's roster has the potential to increase to a total of 56 players.In 2025, LIV Golf fielded 54 players spread across 13 different teams. The two remaining players -- Chieh-Po Lee and Anthony Kim -- participated as individual wildcards as their performances did not count towards any of the teams. With the addition of two more players, the league would have a number sufficient to create another team and up the league to 14 squads.LIV Golf originally started with 12 teams before Jon Rahm was introduced in 2024, creating Legion XIII alongside Tyrrell Hatton, Caleb Surratt and Tom McKibbin, who just earned invitations into the Masters and The Open via his win at the Hong Kong Open.\"LIV Golf continues to expand pathways for players around the world to qualify into the first truly global golf league,\" LIV Golf CEO Scott O'Neil said in a statement. \"As fan interest in LIV Golf continues to increase and the opportunity to compete across the U.S., Asia Pacific, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East against some of the biggest names in golf grows, it's only natural that we broaden access for talented, ambitious players to earn their way into the league.\"Two events remain in the nine-tournament International Series, with former LIV Golf league member Scott Vincent and Miguel Tabuena occupying the top two spots. Wade Ormsby is a name who could usurp the top two in the rankings and has his fair share of experience on LIV Golf, including starts in Riyadh and Adelaide this season.\nMeanwhile, LIV Golf Promotions is scheduled for Jan. 8-11 at Black Diamond Ranch in Lecanto, Florida. The competition will feature four rounds of stroke play with a cut to the top 20 after 18 and 36 holes. These modifications come just months after the Official World Golf Rankings announced that LIV Golf had applied for OWGR points in late June. This is the second instance in which the league has applied for points, the first under the leadership of O'Neil.In 2023, LIV Golf's application for OWGR points was denied as the body cited issues regarding the league's format and the closed-shop nature of the circuit. \n\"The OWGR Board is committed to a thorough evaluation process of all applications, and LIV's application will be reviewed in accordance with OWGR's criteria to ensure fairness, integrity and consistency,\" Chairman of OWGR board of directors Trevor Immelman released in a statement at the time. \"We appreciate the interest of LIV Golf – and all Tours – in contributing to the global landscape of men's professional golf through OWGR. Further updates will be provided as the review progresses.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The ACC issued a public reprimand Sunday of Clemson coach Dabo Swinney following his criticism of officials in the 46-45 loss to Duke, and also hit the institution with a $10,000 fine as a result of the violation of league policy.Swinney admonished officials for calling defensive pass interference during Duke's go-ahead possession on fourth down. Asked if he had any comments on the ACC's decision during Sunday night's Clemson teleconference, Swinney reiterated his disdain for the call. \"No (comment), other than I just stand by what I said. I mean, it is what it is, you know,\" Swinney said. \"I mean, I think it's a ... We just have to agree to disagree. There's a lot of accountability for coaches and a lot of accountability for players, but I don't think there's much for refs. There should be some type of, especially a call like that. I mean, there should be some type of ability to challenge a call like that. \"It just was very, very frustrating. But, you know, again, as I said (Saturday) night, I don't blame that on the loss. I mean, that play could have won the game, and it would have been great for those guys who have overcome so much crap to win the game. I can't stand by what I said. We just had to agree to disagree.'\nSwinney said after he assumed officials would flag Duke for offensive pass interference after Darian Mensah's underthrown pass. Blue Devils receiver Que'Sean Brown collided with Clemson defensive back Avieon Terrell and appeared to break-up what could have been a game-sealing interception.\"I don't even know what to say about the last call,\" Swinney said following the game. \"You all saw it. Shouldn't have come down to that. We had plenty of opportunities to win the game, but that's one of the worst calls I've ever seen in a game ever in my entire coaching career. Ever. I don't really know what else to say.\"I don't wanna make that a deal because we should've won the game. We had plenty of opportunities to win the game. But you fight your butt off, you scratch and claw to get in a situation like that. Then you have a call like that. Man, that's just more salt in the wound.\"\nSwinney's comments were in direct violation of the ACC's Sportsmanship Policy, which states, \"public criticism of officials or public comments evaluating the officiating of particular contests is not in the best interest of intercollegiate athletics. Individuals associated with the athletics program are prohibited, therefore, from commenting while acting in an official capacity on officiating other than directly to the Conference office.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels will undergo MRI testing to determine the severity of a dislocated elbow injury to his left, non-throwing arm that he suffered Sunday during a 38-14 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, per CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. Daniels scrambled toward the sideline midway through the fourth quarter when Seahawks linebacker Drake Thomas took him down. Daniels rolled over on his side and used his left arm to brace his fall.Jones reports that Daniels is expected to be put on injured reserve. There is hope that Washington's franchise player will avoid injured reserve and not miss the rest of the season, per NFL Network.\"It was a gruesome, gruesome-looking injury, but at its face, going into the MRI, maybe not as bad as it could've been. It is, in fact, a dislocated left elbow,\" NFL Network reports. \"It's certainly going to knock Jayden Daniels out several weeks. My understandings is X-rays were negative, so that's a good sign -- no fracture. He's going to have an MRI [this week], maybe to give it a little more time and give it a cleaner read. There's a possibility this is not a season-ending injury for Jayden Daniels.\"Daniels' elbow bent inward in an awkward way before trainers came to his aid, helping him off the field. The Commanders trailed 38-7 before Daniels' injury, much of that coming via Sam Darnold's perfect first half, which included four touchdown passes.\n\"Obviously, I'm just gutted by it, I'm just bummed,\" Washington coach Dan Quinn said. \"We didn't have any read plays on it, and the one he was injured on is usually a run or a throw to the flat. It's not a scramble. It wasn't a designed read or play into that spot. If we run it 50 times, it's either a handoff or a throw 50 times.\"Daniels already missed time due to hamstring and knee issues. He started Sunday's game for the first time since last playing on Oct. 19 against the Dallas Cowboys.\nIn five starts this season, leading into the loss to the Seahawks, the NFL's reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year completed 61% of his passes for 1,031 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception. Daniels completed 16 of 22 throws against Seattle for 153 yards and an interception. He picked up 51 yards on the ground with a touchdown, his second rushing score of the season. The Commanders are now 3-6 overall, struggling to stay afloat in the NFC East.\n            ",

The unfortunate headline from this matchup was the gruesome left elbow injury star quarterback Jayden Daniels suffered, but he was not the only notable Commander to leave the game hurt.Monday morning brought more negative news for the Commanders, as NFL Media reported that wide receiver and kick returner Luke McCaffrey broke his collarbone, while the team fears starting cornerback Marshon Lattimore tore his ACL. He will have an MRI on Monday. It's possible Washington lost three starters to injury in Week 9.The significance of losing Daniels goes without saying for Washington. It's unknown if the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year will miss the remainder of the season, but anytime you have to exit the game wearing an air cast it's not good. Daniels missed 33% of Washington's games this season, and that number will now go up. His mother asked fans to stop \"manifesting\" Robert Griffin III on her son last month, but the irony Sunday night was tough to ignore. Washington's prospective franchise quarterback going down with a serious injury on his home field in prime time against Seattle. \nLattimore's injury also hits very hard for Washington. In nine games played this season, the four-time Pro Bowler recorded 27 tackles, seven passes defensed and one interception, which came in Week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs. Lattimore has not played particularly well this season, but the fact of the matter is he's one of the top cornerbacks for one of the worst secondaries in the NFL. Washington is worse without him. The Commanders allowed seven passing touchdowns in a four-quarter span from the second half of Week 8 to the first half of Week 9. Washington allowed Sam Darnold to complete 16 of 16 passes for 282 yards and four touchdowns just in the first half. Through Sunday, Washington's pass defense (253.6 passing yards allowed per game) ranks fourth-worst in the NFL.\nThe 3-6 Commanders are in third place in the NFC East. It's clear they are not going to build on the magical 2024 campaign which ended in the NFC Championship game. Right now, Washington is +2200 to make the playoffs over at FanDuel Sportsbook, and -10000 to miss the postseason. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris had some interesting things to say on Sunday after watching his team go down in a tight 24-23 loss to the New England Patriots. During his postgame press conference, Morris essentially accused the Patriots of cheating by implying that they illegally simulated the Falcons' snap count on a key drive that came late in the fourth quarter of the game. With 2:09 left to play, the Falcons were trailing 24-23 and sitting at New England's 48-yard line. On a second-and-10 play, center Ryan Neuzil sent a snap back to Michael Penix Jr. that the QB wasn't ready for. The Patriots quickly rushed Penix and the QB didn't want to take a sack, so he quickly got rid of the ball and he ended up getting called for intentional grounding, which is a 10-yard penalty with a loss of down. So Atlanta's second-and-10 turned into a third-and-20 from its own 42. According to Morris, the only reason the bad snap happened is because the Patriots confused his center by simulating Atlanta's snap count. \"They did a nice job, they simulated a snap,\" Morris said. \"The ball came early, it was snapped early. Within that snap, that was when we got the intentional grounding.\"\nSimulating a snap is illegal in the NFL and it's a strong accusation, so Morris was asked to clarify that he was in fact accusing the Patriots of doing that. \"They were clapping. Simulated our snap, got us to snap the ball,\" Morris said. \"That's why the ball was snapped early to [Penix], and he wasn't ready for the snap.\"If a defense is caught simulating a snap count, that's known as a \"disconcerting signal\" and it's illegal under NFL rules. If you get flagged for that in a game, it's a 15-yard penalty. If a flag had been thrown, the Falcons would have gotten a first-and-10 at New England's 33-yard line.\nSo did the clapping actually happen? You can judge for yourself by checking out a video of the play below. \nHere are the two biggest takeaways from the replay: The nine Patriots defenders closest to the line of scrimmage definitely did NOT clap. If there was a clap, it came from Patriots safety Jaylinn Hawkins. Starting at the five-second mark, it appears that he's looking at the Patriots' sideline trying to get someone's attention. It's hard to tell if he actually clapped his hands, but Neuzil did snap the ball just as Hawkins stopped moving his hands. Falcons reactionPenix was asked about the clapping after the game and although he couldn't say with 100% certainty that it actually happened, he did say that Neuzil definitely heard clapping. \"Supposedly they were clapping,\" Penix said. \"For us, whenever I'm clapping, that means I want the ball. I knew [Neuzil] said he heard them clapping, and he thought it was my clap, and he snapped the ball. I threw the ball in [Kyle Pitts'] direction. He had just released on a route. I thought I was going to be okay with the grounding part. Obviously that wasn't the case.\"\nSo Neuzil definitely heard someone clapping, but he didn't know exactly where the clapping was coming from. Patriots deny all wrongdoingIf Neuzil heard some clapping, you'd think someone else on the field would have heard it, but that's not the case on New England's side. Patriots defensive tackle Milton Williams doesn't believe that anyone on his team was clapping. \"Who was clapping? Did it look like I was clapping?\" Williams said, via MassLive.com. \"I'm going to go watch and see who was clapping. I didn't hear no clapping. I'm looking at the ball. The ball moves, I'm gone.\"\nIf it was Hawkins -- and that's a big if -- he was lined up 12 to 13 yards off the line of scrimmage so it seems like a few other people would have heard his claps if Neuzil did. During an interview on Monday with \"The Greg Hill Show\" on WEEI in Boston, Patriots coach Mike Vrabel denied that any clapping took place. \"I didn't see anything, is that fake? I don't know,\" Vrabel said before he started to clap himself. \"I didn't see anybody doing that.\"Vrabel was aware that the Falcons were using a clap as their snap signal, but he insisted that none of his players tried to simulate it at any point. \n\"I didn't see anybody do that, it's Clapgate,\" Vrabel said. With Morris making public accusations against the Patriots, the NFL will likely be looking into this and it will be very interesting to see what the league finds. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LANDOVER, Md. -- Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels dislocated his left elbow with less than 8 minutes remaining in Washington's Week 9 \"Sunday Night Football\" game at home against the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks led 38-8 at the time and ultimately prevailed 38-14, having dominated from the onset of the game.Daniels was scrambling to the right sideline when Seahawks linebacker Drake Thomas tackled him. As Daniels rolled over, he tried to use his non-throwing arm to steady himself; however, upon landing on the grass, his left elbow appeared to bend inwards at an unnatural angle.Commanders medical staffers rushed onto the field, bracing Daniels' left elbow and arm before the franchise's star signal caller walked off the field being steadied as he entered the tunnel.Daniels is set to undergo an MRI this week, with Washington ultimately expected to place their QB on injured reserve, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. However, there is hope the team's franchise player will avoid injured reserve and not miss the rest of the season, per NFL Network, as initial X-rays were negative.\n\"Obviously, I'm just gutted by it, I'm just bummed,\" Commanders coach Dan Quinn said. \"We didn't have any read plays on [the play call], and the one he was injured on is usually a run or a throw to the flat. It's not a scramble. It wasn't a designed read or play into that spot. If we run it 50 times, it's either a handoff or a throw 50 times.\"Sunday's injury is just the latest obstacle in a difficult sophomore season for Daniels, who missed two games with an ankle injury incurred in Week 2 against the Packers and sat out of Washington's Week 8 game with a hamstring injury suffered against the Cowboys in his prior game.The Commanders have been badly hampered by injuries all season. After a magical 12-5 campaign in 2024 that included Daniels winning Offensive Rookie of the Year, Washington ended Sunday night 3-6. Daniels was 16 of 22 for 153 yards with an interception; he also carried 10 times for 51 yards and a touchdown.\nMarcus Mariota, who started all three games Daniels previously missed this season, replaced Daniels and completed a touchdown drive. The Commanders are 1-2 with Mariotta starting this season.\n            ",

There were only six rookie starters who managed 2.0 WAR, per Baseball-Reference's Stathead tool, which was actually tied for the 19th-lowest mark of the past 25 seasons, with only 2001 producing fewer. By that standard, 2025 was actually a pretty historically poor year for rookie starting pitchers.But those of us who were paying attention know that isn't the whole story. Okay, sure, maybe there weren't many superstar pitchers who racked up huge numbers all season long. But there were plenty of contributors, and that grew more true down the stretch, when names like Cam Schlittler, Cade Horton, Luis Morales, Nolan McLean, Chase Burns, and Jacob Misiorowski emerged as really valuable Fantasy options – and that is by no means a complete list of interesting rookie pitchers. In fact, the most exciting of the rookies to debut in 2025 may have been someone who barely mattered for Fantasy: Blue Jays pitcher Trey Yesavage. Yesavage just didn't have the time to make an impact for Fantasy, as he was called up in mid-September, in time to make just three starts down the stretch. And yet, no rookie pitcher – heck, maybe no pitcher, period – has put their stamp on the 2025 season's highest leverage moments than Yesavage. And it culminated Wednesday night with one of the greatest starts by a rookie pitcher in World Series history.Facing the mighty Dodgers, Yesavage was utterly dominant. He struck out 12 over seven one-run innings, his second double-digit strikeout effort of this postseason. And he did it with the whole arsenal – including, shockingly, a dominant slider. We knew Yesavage's splitter was a devastating pitch with the way it tunneled off his four-seamer from that super-high arm slot and tumbled down and out of the strike zone, and he generated an impressive seven swinging strikes on 10 swings with it Wednesday. But the slider was, somehow, even better. He threw that pitch 43% of the time Wednesday and generated 14 whiffs on 29 swings, plus eight batted balls with just an 83.1 mph average exit velocity.\nAnd it's not a one-start fluke, either. Yesavage previously held the Dodgers to two runs over four innings with five strikeouts in Game 1 of the World Series, and he's up to 39 strikeouts and a 3.46 ERA in 26 innings so far in the postseason. That has included a start against a very good Yankees lineup plus a Mariners lineup away from Seattle – the Mariners had the second-best wOBA in baseball on the road this season, by the way. It's still a small sample size from Yesavage, but we've now seen 55 strikeouts to 17 walks in 40 innings of work from him in the majors, mostly against very tough competition. And he's doing it as a 21-year-old who, you may have heard, started the season at A ball. It would certainly be possible to overreact to that – don't rank him as a top-10 SP for 2026! – but the upside he's showing is obviously worth betting on. I was planning on doing my \"State of the SP Position\" piece today, and then I started writing about the rookies and second-year pitchers and realized these guys need the spotlight all for themselves. It's not just Yesavage, of course. There are at least five other pitchers from the 2025 rookie class – either guys who exhausted their rookie eligibility or who will still be rookies in 2026 despite debuting already, like Yesavage – who will be top-150 picks and could sneak into the top 100, and plenty more who are going to be drafted in most Fantasy leagues.\nSo, before we get to the full breakdown of the SP position next week, let's take a look at the 2025 pitching debuts (and top remaining prospects) you need to know for 2026:\nThe top second-year SPs to targetBefore we get to the specific players, one thing to note: For as much as there is to get excited about with the following 20 or so pitchers, none of them should be drafted with the expectation that they'll be capable of carrying your rotation. In the mock draft we did this week – which I'll be writing about more next week – I took Paul Skenes and Garrett Crochet to start my draft and then didn't even think about taking a third starting pitcher until the 10th or 11th round, when I was going to reach for Chase Burns as my No. 3. In an ideal world, that's how you'd treat the top tier of these second-year pitchers. As a high-upside No. 3 or 4 SP after you have guys who can stabilize your rotation. These should all be viewed as luxury picks. They are the pitchers you are hoping can take your rotation over the top, not guys you need to carry you. For as talented as they all are, the sample sizes are small across the board, and the risks inherent to any young pitcher are obvious. \nJust keep that in mind. Now, let's get excited: Chase Burns, Reds – Others might not have Burns at the top of this group, but I'm just such a big believer in him. HBe was one of just 13 pitchers in the majors to have at least four double-digit strikeout games in 2025, and he did it in a span of just five starts. His 5.24 ERA as a starter is a little off-putting, but his 2.47 FIP is more indicative of the upside here, as is his massive 37.8% strikeout rate. He missed a few weeks with an elbow injury but still got to 109.1 innings last season, so there's some runway for him to surpass 150 in 2026, and I think he could be a Hunter Greene/Spencer Strider-esque contributor at his peak. His home park won't provide much help, and homers could be an issue as a result, but I'm expecting something like a mid-3.00s ERA with one of the best strikeout rates in baseball from Burns. We could be talking about Burns as a top-five SP this time next year. Nolan McLean, Mets – A 2.06 ERA with 57 strikeouts in 48 innings of work as a rookie? That's what McLean managed last season after his promotion, and that was after he put up a 2.45 ERA in 113.2 innings in the minors, so there shouldn't be any workload concerns here. I don't think he's quite on Burns' level in terms of pure stuff (and he's certainly behind at least one other pitcher further down this list in that regard, too), but McLean has good enough stuff with a deep arsenal that he commanded well. The comp I've gone to most often with McLean is Logan Webb, another groundball with a deep arsenal, but McLean might have even more swing-and-miss potential. The Mets have a well-earned reputation for maximizing pitchers lately, and McLean might already be this team's ace. And, unlike most of the other pitchers here, there's no real injury history or innings limitation to worry about. He could give us 180 great innings in 2026, making him certainly the safest bet among this crop of first or second-year pitchers. Jacob Misiorowski, Brewers – Misiorowski took the league by storm early on, and in terms of pure stuff, nobody can match him. But he was a lot less effective after his electric first month and a half, though he did bounce back a bit in the postseason, notably only walking three over 12 innings in three starts. I think he might be the most volatile of these options, mostly because there is just a very limited track record of him being able to throw enough strikes. That's going to limit his efficiency, and I imagine the Brewers are still going to be pretty careful with his workload in 2026, which will lead to some frustratingly brief outings. The Jacob deGrom comps Misiorowski has earned aren't unreasonable, but he could be a frustrating pitcher to rely on if you draft him too high. Cam Schlittler, Yankees – I think Schlittler is the last of this tier, all of whom should probably be drafted around the 10th round in most 12-team leagues – and that includes the previously mentioned Yesavage. Schlittler was also the most effective of this group over the largest sample, which includes 14.1 innings of two-run ball in the postseason. Why is he last among this group? Well, I don't know if he has the go-to swing-and-miss secondary everyone else has, and his fastball's excellence seems dependent on his ability to sustain elite velocity – and seeing as he went from averaging 96.5 mph in Triple-A to 98.0 in the majors, that's an open question, in my eyes. I'll grant I might be being unfair there, but I just have slightly bigger questions about Schlittler than the rest of this group – though I do think I would rank him ahead of Yesavage, at least. Cade Horton, Cubs – Given Horton's 2.67 ERA over 118 innings as a rookie, I understand if some of you might be pounding the table for him to be included in that previous group. But he isn't on that level for me for a couple of reasons. For one thing, there's the injury track record – he threw just 34.1 innings in 2024 after dealing with multiple arm injuries, meaning he had an innings jump of more than 110 last season. For another … he just didn't earn that 2.67 ERA. Pick your favored ERA estimator, and they all agree he should have been at least a run worse. His xERA was 3.93, which I like to cite because it undercuts the argument that his lack of strikeouts didn't really matter because he generated a lot of weak contact – xERA takes into account quality of contact, and Horton's was about average. He's obviously young enough that he could take a step forward, but I think Horton needs to take a step forward to be anywhere near as effective as he was in 2024 again, and that's not a bet I want to make, especially given the injury history. He'll need to slip past 150th overall in a draft for me to really consider him. Logan Henderson, Brewers – Henderson's season came to an end with an elbow injury before he could return to the Brewers' rotation, but he was very effective both in the majors and in the minors. He got to 103 innings and should have a spot in the rotation on Opening Day, and has the potential to be a mid-3.00s ERA pitcher with very good WHIPs, a la a Bailey Ober type. I don't think there's nearly as much upside here with Henderson as the guys ahead of him, but there will also be a lot less hype, making him a viable late-round target. Luis Morales, Athletics – Morales was impressive down the stretch, putting up a 3.14 ERA in his 48.2 innings of work, but I wish I could get more excited about him. He throws hard and the stuff passes the eye test, but he was never really a dominant strikeout pitcher in the minors and he missed shockingly few bats as a rookie – as Nick Pollack at PitcherList.com notes, he had just a 7% swinging strike rate with his four-seamer and just a 9.5% rate overall, around what Zac Gallen and Brandon Pfaadt managed last season. There should be more strikeout upside here, but he needs to unlock it. However, his home park could lead to some untenable growing pains. Zebby Matthews, Twins – I like Zebby. His biggest flaw is an inability to limit hard contact, as his .430 expected wOBA on contact was the seventh worst among pitchers with at least 300 PA against in 2025. He does everything else pretty well, though, and quality of contact is one of those things that tends to fluctuate a lot from one season to the next. His slider is a very good pitch both in terms of missing barrels and bats, and his command is good enough that I think he can take a step forward with a few tweaks – he might benefit from strategically throwing to the edge (and even outside!) of the zone more often. Matthews is by no means a sure thing to improve, but he'll be on a lot of my teams as a bet that he can make the tweaks necessary. Top rookies to know for 2026These guys are ranked more or less in order of how likely it is they'll be on their team's Opening Day roster:Bubba Chandler, Pirates – Chandler stumbled in the second half and then was merely fine in his seven appearances in the majors, but it doesn't really seem like anyone has cooled on him. He'll be one of the more popular breakout picks in the game, though he'll need his breaking balls to play better as swing and miss pitches to truly live up to his upside. Andrew Painter, Phillies – 2025, did not go well for Painter, but it seems like a lot of prospect folks are going to give him the benefit of the doubt for his first season coming back from Tommy John surgery. He got through 118 innings without incident, which is the most important thing. But he didn't generate nearly as many swings and misses as expected and is giving me Jackson Jobe or Shane Baz vibes these days. He certainly no longer feels like the can't-miss guy he was promised to be. Which makes sense: He's a pitcher. Parker Messick, Guardians – Messick made it to the majors with a lot less hype than some other pitching prospects who debuted late, but he continued to do what he does at every level: Get outs. Messick gives me real Matthew Boyd vibes, and while I think it's unlikely he'll ever be the difference maker some of these other guys could be, I think he's got a very high floor for a young pitcher. Also: I'm a sucker for a lefty with a sick changeup, and Messick has one. I expect his 31.2% whiff rate with that pitch to tick up a bit in 2026, too. Trey Yesavage, Blue Jays – Yesavage locked his spot in the Blue Jays rotation on Opening Day up thanks to his postseason, which has seen him rack up 27 strikeouts in 19 innings. You don't often see righties described as funky or crafty, but I think that fits here, thanks to Yesavage's super-high release point and killer splitter. There aren't a lot of pitchers who look like Yesavage, and I think that plays to his benefit – hitters just aren't used to seeing this combo of pitches come from that arm slot. His lack of glove-side movement might become an issue with same-handed hitters – righties had an OPS nearly 200 points higher than lefties against Yesavage this season, including the minors – but that's a relatively minor concern, all told. And if he can use the slider like he did Wednesday in his brilliant World Series start against the Dodgers – where he generated a whopping 14 swings and misses with that pitch alone – then he might just be an ace. Brandon Sproat, Mets – Sproat was awful early in the season, but took a big step forward from July on. There was a bit of a velocity jump, and he spent much of the season tweaking his pitch mix, eventually landing on the mix that got him to the majors. He threw all six of his pitches at least 5% of the time against righties and threw five pitches at least 16% of the time to lefties, so it'll be a deep arsenal, though I'm not sure it'll necessarily be an overpowering one. Lance Brozdowski has comped Sproat to Brandon Pfaadt, and I can see it – which doesn't exactly excite me, to be honest. Robby Snelling, Marlins – Snelling saw his stuff tick up in 2026, but even for a lefty, that mostly only pushed him to the above-average side of average. He has thrived in the minors more on command than pure stuff, and if his velocity dips back to where it was in 2024, there's a lot less to be excited about here. But he probably has a pretty high floor and should at least be useful, though his team won't buoy his value much, unfortunately. Connelly Early, Red Sox – With 29 strikeouts in 19.1 innings to open his career, Early has to have done enough to pitch his way into the Red Sox's Opening Day rotation. I'm not sure he has the stuff to necessarily sustain the sky-high strikeout rate, though there's plenty to like in his varied and deep pitch mix from the left side. If he settles into the double-digit rounds in ADP, he'll be a fine pick, though I suspect there will be some drafters who are so enamored with his late-season success that they'll reach. Jonah Tong, Mets – Tong is going to be super controversial in drafts, and there will be some folks who are just completely out on him after he looked overmatched in his brief time in the majors. Honestly, I thought his bizarre delivery would help him take the league by storm in the first look, but his command just wasn't good enough for that. The vert-heavy fastball should pair well with his changeup, and it's not hard to envision a world where Tong out-pitches Trey Yesavage with a similar approach, though obviously Yesavage needs to be ranked ahead given how their first taste of the majors went. But I still like Tong plenty and expect to make him a priority late-round target in 2026 drafts if it looks like he's going to be on the Opening Day roster – no guarantee of that, of course. Payton Tolle, Red Sox – Tolle might have the single-best pitch of anyone on this list. He's massive at 6-foot-7 and generates huge extension with his delivery, which allows his mid-to-high-90s fastball from the left side to play up as a monster at the top of the zone. He generated a whiff on 29.2% of swings against it in the majors despite struggling overall, and that's a heck of a base to build an arsenal around. The rest of the arsenal was not nearly as impressive, especially against major-leaguers, and I'm not sure anything else here rates out above average. The Red Sox have a recent, but well-earned, reputation for developing young pitchers, and they'll surely spend the offseason working on the secondaries to try to find the right mix. He'll be another high-priority late-round target for me. Thomas White, Marlins – White is probably a pretty long shot to make the Opening Day rotation, but we should see him at some point this season after he reached Triple-A in 2025 while putting up a 2.31 ERA and 38.6% strikeout rate across three levels in the minors. His command needs to be tightened up, but the surface-level and advanced stats are in agreement that he should be a difference-making pitcher before long. Expect an early-Summer debut and a lot of excitement for White. Liam Doyle, Cardinals – There could be a similar path for Doyle that we saw with Chase Burns and Paul Skenes, two other pitchers who debuted less than a year after being drafted out of college. I don't think Doyle is on either's level as a prospect, but that's no knock on him, as Burns and Skenes have top-five SP upside, in my view. Doyle's arsenal starts with an excellent high-90s fastball from the left side, and his slider, sweeper, and splitter all generated above-average whiff rates in college. He slots in just ahead of Kade Anderson, one of the two pitchers drafted ahead of him, because the path to a rotation spot in St. Louis looks a lot more clear than the one in Seattle. Kade Anderson, Mariners – Anderson got up to 119 innings at LSU last season and racked up huge strikeout numbers with strong control, though the stuff isn't quite as impressive as it is with Doyle, who sits a few mph higher. But Anderson is in an organization that has maximized their top pitching prospects in recent years, and his big workload in 2025 means there should be fewer innings limitations than with most top prospects when he gets the call. If the Mariners do opt to trade Castillo this offseason, that could be a hint that they expect Anderson to move very quickly. Tyler Bremner, Angels – Bremner was actually taken ahead of Doyle and Anderson, but he wasn't nearly as dominant as either in college and doesn't tend to be viewed as the best prospect among them. Very Angels stuff, no? Of course, there's another very-Angels thing to highlight here, which is that they tend to be extremely aggressive with their promotions, so it wouldn't be especially surprising if he debuted before either of them. I just don't think there's the same upside with Bremner, who either needs his fastball to take a step forward or his breaking ball to become a more consistent weapon – right-handed pitchers whose best secondary is a changeup aren't a prospect archetype I tend to like to bet on without outlier skills. But his likely proximity to the majors makes him worth keeping on your radar for 2026. Jarlin Susana, Nationals – Susana could be the next Hunter Greene. He has that kind of stuff, including a slider that could be a plus-plus pitch and some of the absolute best fastball velocity in organized baseball. He's also struggled with his health, including a UCL sprain this summer, and walked 14% of hitters last season. It's a boom or bust kind of profile, but he might have as much strikeout upside as any pitcher in the minors and has already held his own at Double-A, so there's a real chance we see him at some point in 2026, if not early. Travis Sykora, Nationals – We've got a really limited sample size with Sykora, who has thrown just 130.1 innings since being drafted in the third round in 2023. But they've been pretty dominant innings, with a 2.14 ERA and 41.8% strikeout rate, and he even made a couple of starts at Double-A after overcoming hip and triceps injuries. There's some risk here, but he also might be only a couple of good months away from proving ready if he can stay on the mound and keep dominating. \n            \n    \n\n        \n\n    \n

    "body": "\n        NFC squads looking to crawl their way back into the postseason picture will meet in Week 9 of 'Monday Night Football' when the Dallas Cowboys host the Arizona Cardinals. Dallas (3-4-1) is undefeated at home but enters off a 44-24 defeat at Denver last Sunday. Arizona (2-5) has the NFL's longest losing streak at five games and fell to Green Bay, 27-23, in Week 7 before having a bye last week. Jacoby Brissett will remain the starting quarterback for Arizona in place of the still recovering Kyler Murray (foot), according to coach Jonathan Gannon. Though he won't start, Murray is questionable to be active as a backup.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Arizona has won seven of the last eight meetings between the teams, including three straight on the road. Dallas is the 3-point favorite in the latest Cardinals vs. Cowboys odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 53.5.

The Cards have won both three straight overall against the Cowboys as well as each of their last three trips to Dallas. Arizona's spread record has mirrored its outright record in these eight contests as the Cardinals have covered in seven of the eight. Despite a five-game losing streak this season, Arizona has covered in back-to-back contests, while Dallas is coming off both a straight-up and spread defeat.The Cardinals can take advantage of Dallas' porous defense on Monday as the Cowboys rank second-worst in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense. Dallas is dead last in third-down defense, which plays into Arizona's strength as the latter ranks fifth in third-down offense. Plus, having Brissett under center isn't much of a downgrade for the team as the journeyman has back-to-back games with two touchdown passes against a pair of one-loss teams in Green Bay and Indianapolis, so he should find success versus the Cowboys. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Cowboys can coverFew teams can match the offensive firepower of Dallas, which leads the NFL in passing offense, ranks second in points scored and is also second in total yards gained. Dak Prescott leads the league in QBR while running back, Javonte Williams, ranks among the top four in both rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. George Pickens is third in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, while No. 1 wideout, CeeDee Lamb, has 184 yards and a score in his two games since returning from injury.While Arizona coming off a bye would seemingly help its chances of winning, it may not help its chances of covering. The Cardinals have lost each of their last three games versus the spread after a bye, and they are 2-5 ATS with a rest advantage since 2022. Meanwhile, the Cowboys have a knack for rising to the occasion when an opponent has an advantageous schedule. Dallas is 6-2 ATS when at a rest disadvantage since the start of the 2022 season. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Cowboys vs. Cardinals picksFor Cardinals vs. Cowboys   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 56 combined points.

Phillips is a pending free agent, and this move from Miami comes three days after the franchise parted ways with general manager Chris Grier.Phillips has 25 tackles and three sacks in nine games for Miami.  He only played four games last season due to a torn ACL. Phillips managed 22 sacks over his first 2.5 seasons with the Dolphins prior to an Achilles tear against the Jets in November 2023. He returned to play those four games last season, but missed the rest of the year with a torn ACL. Coming off last season's Super Bowl victory, Philadelphia slipped in the pass-rush department with 16 sacks, which is tied for 24th in the NFL. Recently retired edge rusher Za'Darius Smith's 1.5 sacks are the fourth-most on the team and he last played for the Eagles in Week 6. General manager Howie Roseman made it a point to go after proven talent off the edge and Phillips fills a need for the Eagles. Roseman said in October that the Eagles keep roster enhancement at the forefront of franchise importance.\n\"I don't sit here, no matter what the year is, no matter what the time of the year is, and feel content with what we're doing,\" Roseman said. \"I'm the first one to admit we will make some mistakes. But I promise you we're going to keep shooting. We're going to do our best to put together the best team that we possibly can.\"The Eagles (6-2) lead the NFC East and play the Packers at Lambeau Field next Monday night before hosting the Lions in back-to-back prime-time matchups.\nThis is the Eagles' third trade in the last week after previously adding cornerbacks Jaire Alexander and Michael Carter.\n            \n    ",

Brock Purdy missed seven games due to a turf toe injury, leaving former first rounder Mac Jones leading the offense for the majority of the season.\"We're trying to ease Brock out there in the practice stuff, but anytime you're dealing with this turf toe, it's something that probably won't fully go away all year,\" Shanahan said. \"Regardless of when he comes back, he's going to always have to deal with it a little bit, especially with the people you talk to who have gone through turf toe.\"What could this mean for Jones? The former New England Patriots quarterback has a 67.2% completion rate, with 1,832 passing yards, 10 touchdowns and five interceptions. His five wins are more than he tallied in the last two seasons combined. In Sunday's win against the New York Giants, Jones went 19-of-24 with 235 yards and two touchdowns. Shanahan said Purdy's unclear status won't affect how Jones prepares. \n\"No, nothing changes Mac in that way,\" Shanahan said.The 49ers have a big divisional game against the Los Angeles Rams next week. While Jones has won the majority of his games this year, logic dictates they will go with their $265 million quarterback.Purdy suffered the injury in Week 1 and attempted a return in Week 4, but aggravated the injury and has been sidelined since. \nShanahan was hopeful that Purdy, who was limited in practice leading up to Week 9, could serve as the backup or emergency quarterback, but he was inactive.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome back to the NBA Hater Report: A breakdown of some of the players, teams and trends around the league that are drawing the ire of yours truly. If you're not a fellow pessimist, proceed with caution. Winless Pelicans need to trade ZionAs of Monday morning, New Orleans Pelicans are one of two winless NBA teams at 0-6. The other is the Brooklyn Nets, but the Nets want to be bad. The Pelicans, which is to say Joe Dumars, conducted their offseason operation in the bizarrely bold fashion of a team that expected to be good. First they traded Indiana's 2026 first-round pick, which is probably going to be a pretty high selection as the Pacers are currently 1-5, for the No. 23 overall pick in this year's draft, which they subsequently sent to the Hawks along with their own 2026 unprotected first-round pick to move up to No. 13, where they took Derik Queen, who played seven minutes on Sunday. Just for fun, they traded C.J. McCollum's expiring deal for two more years of Jordan Poole -- even though they drafted point guard Jeremiah Fears with the No. 8 overall pick and owe Dejounte Murray north of $90 million over the next three years. \nMake it make sense. There are only two rationales for trading your own unprotected pick in the following year's draft. One, you think you're going to be good this season, and as such, your pick next year won't be a high one. Which is to say, the Pelicans really believed they were going to be good. In this Western Conference. Or two, you think the player you are taking at the end of the lottery is so good that it's worth giving up what could literally be the No. 1 overall pick in what is a stacked 2026 draft class. In which case, you are playing Queen seven minutes? The Pelicans were down by 20 points basically from the second quarter on Sunday, and yet Queen didn't even get into the game until the 6:51 mark of the fourth. Again, make it make sense. If this guy is your next star, you can't even get him developmental minutes in a blowout? Meanwhile, your current star, Zion Williamson, who was all the rage coming into the season for the good shape he'd gotten himself into, is shooting 48% from the field -- a strikingly low mark for a guy who literally has not attempted one shot outside of 14 feet in non-garbage time all season, per Cleaning the Glass. \nThis thing is a mess. Every day that coach Willie Green isn't fired is a surprise. Problem is, the guy who would be doing the firing (Dumars) is probably -- or at least should be -- sitting on a scalding hot seat himself. The good news is that Williamson's career-low efficiency notwithstanding, the guy is on the court and in good shape and remains a clear force, meaning he might actually have something that at least approaches positive trade value. The Pelicans should be jumping on this opportunity to deal Williamson. Yes, it's scary to trade a guy who may become the consistent superstar somewhere else that he was supposed to be for you, but this thing in New Orleans is cooked. The vibe-check is showing no pulse. Sunday's loss was pathetic. This is a totally busted team. So get whatever you can for Zion, and Trey Murphy and Herb Jones while you're at it, and start moving forward with Queen and Fears. \nThey should've done that a long time ago. They should still have Indiana's 2026 pick plus their own to tank for. But they don't, and by clinging to this idea that the Zion project is actually going to suddenly pop only serves to set them back further. It's time to trade Zion and start cutting losses in New Orleans, assuming they can find a taker for at least a couple cents on the dollar. Ja Morant's disturbing shot dietMorant is shooting 15% from 3 (5 for 31) and just 40% overall to start the season. He's never been a good shooter, but for a minute it looked like he was trending toward at least average -- at least if you allowed him to walk into practice shots. That hasn't been the case for a while, nor has the idea that his consistent ability to get to the rim and finish with world-class force and athleticism adequately covers for what has become, without question, the single-worst defect a point guard can have in today's game. \nFor those of you unfamiliar with what these numbers mean, \"at-rim frequency\" represents the percentage of Morant's total shots that care coming, or in years past have come, from inside the restricted area (four feet). You can see that when Morant was in his \"this guy is a future MVP\" prime, basically half his attempts came at the rim, but that number has steadily declined to an even lower mark than the one charted in the above graph (it's actually at 25% now, per Cleaning the Glass).  \nMeanwhile, 37% of Morant's shots this season have come from either the long mid-range (between 15 feet and the 3-point line) or beyond the arc, per CTG, by far a cumulative career high. Which is to say, a terrible outside shooter is taking more outside shots than ever, a development in keeping with a half-decade trend that has unsurprisingly correlated with an across-the-board decline in everything from paint points to PER and on down the metrical line.  SeasonPoints per gamePaint points per gameFree throw ratePERWin Shares per 48Box Plus-Minus'21-22 \t\t\t\t27.4 \t\t\t\t16.6 \t\t\t\t35.3% \t\t\t\t24.4 \t\t\t\t.171 \t\t\t\t6.1 \t\t\t\t'22-23 \t\t\t\t26.2 \t\t\t\t14.4 \t\t\t\t40.9% \t\t\t\t23.3 \t\t\t\t.148 \t\t\t\t5.7 \t\t\t\t'23-24 \t\t\t\t25.1 \t\t\t\t13.8 \t\t\t\t37.6% \t\t\t\t20.6 \t\t\t\t.124 \t\t\t\t3.1 \t\t\t\t'24-25 \t\t\t\t23.2 \t\t\t\t11.4 \t\t\t\t35.9% \t\t\t\t19.3 \t\t\t\t.112 \t\t\t\t2.4 \t\t\t\t'25-26 \t\t\t\t20.8 \t\t\t\t11.3 \t\t\t\t33% \t\t\t\t17.5 \t\t\t\t.046 \t\t\t\t-2.7 \t\t\t\tThrow in all the on- and off-court drama (Morant was suspended by the Grizzlies for a game over the weekend), lack of meaningful defense, disinterest in running offensive schemes that don't suit his preferences even if they make the team better, and effort like this:\nIt's fair to wonder whether Morant has become more trouble that he's worth in Memphis. Warriors have no D without DraymondAfter a 4-1 start, the Warriors had a golden opportunity to really pile up some early season wins, which are going to matter a lot in the Western Conference playoff race come March and April, with a pair of games vs. undermanned teams in Milwaukee and Indiana. Instead, they lost to the Bucks without Giannis Antetokounmpo and the then-winless Pacers without Obi Toppin, Andrew Nembhard, Bennedict Mathurin or T.J. McConnell to all but erase all the momentum they had built to begin the year. You can't make much of numbers at this point in the season, but for what it's worth the Warriors' offense is sitting below league average and a troubling trend is developing on defense -- which is to say it falls apart when Draymond Green is off the floor. 2025-26 (per CTG)D-RTGPOINT DIFFERENTIALDraymond On Court106.2+12 / 100 possessionsDraymond Off Court126.0-11.5 / 100 possessionsLeague wide, those numbers would currently make the Warriors the No. 4 defense with Green and No. 29 without him, and that 23.5-point/per 100 swing that happens when he goes off the court is positively Jokic-esque. Green is to Golden State's defense what Steph Curry is the offense; that's not going to change. But they can't fall off this kind of cliff without him because he's 35 years old and cannot play huge minutes (he's at under 30 per game so far) in the regular season, especially not as undersized as he is positionally and the toll that takes on his body fighting every possession two weight classes up, if the Warriors want him to be healthy and energized for the postseason. \n            ",

But who is the point guard?Back in April, Pitino said it was North Carolina transfer Ian Jackson, specifically calling him St. John's \"next great point.\" But, after some practices and scrimmages, Pitino actually identified Stanford transfer Oziyah Sellers as the Red Storm's starting point guard, with Idaho State transfer Dylan Darling serving as his backup, meaning the player Pitino once called St. John's \"next great point\" is no longer expected to even play point at St. John's.If nothing else, it's unusual.Either way, the talent is still top-shelf at St. John's, and trusting a two-time national champion and Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame coach to figure it out doesn't seem like the worst idea in the world. So, again, St. John's remains No. 1, for better or worse.\nThe Red Storm open Monday against Quinnipiac.I did make a few final-day changes to the Top 25 And 1, just to adjust some things I wanted adjusted for when we look back on this later. But the 26 teams ranked here are the same 26 teams that have been ranked here since June. In total, there were 26 versions of the Top 25 And 1 this offseason.And now I'm back to updating it every morning!Yes, I'm doing that again. So make sure to follow along on X, and I'll have a fresh version of the Top 25 And 1 sent your way every morning through Selection Sunday. In the meantime, enjoy the first day of this season. Houston-Lehigh is on CBS Sports Network at 8 p.m. ET.

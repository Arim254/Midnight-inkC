While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Kyle Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Alex Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Framber Valdez, Ranger Suárez and Dylan Cease could frontline almost any rotation.Josh Naylor is headed back to Seattle in the winter's first major free-agency deal. He's re-signing with the Mariners on a five-year, $92.5 million deal. A record four players -- Brandon Woodruff (Brewers), Shota Imanaga (Cubs), Gleyber Torres (Tigers) and Trent Grisham (Yankees) -- accepted the qualifying offer and are returning to their respective teams for 2026.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J.

Now, in Week 13, those hopes are set to be realized, with the star quarterback expected to make his anticipated return against the rival Baltimore Ravens.In theory, Burrow's return couldn't come at a more perfect time. The Bengals are undeniably desperate, looking to avoid their fifth straight loss after dropping eight of nine contests since Burrow's exit, and yet the AFC North race is far from over. The Ravens are technically on top at 6-5, but their own signal-caller, Lamar Jackson, hardly looks himself. And the division's second-place squad, the Pittsburgh Steelers, are no firmer thanks to a streaky defense and banged-up Aaron Rodgers.Yet if the Bengals couldn't even win while Burrow's emergency fill-in, Joe Flacco, enjoyed big-play production earlier this year, should we really expect a different outcome for Cincinnati on Thursday night? Either way, the third and final matchup of this year's 2025 Thanksgiving slate is must-see material.Bet Ravens vs. Bengals at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Here's everything you need to know to catch Bengals-Ravens on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:\nWhere to watch Ravens vs. Bengals liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium (Baltimore)TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -7, O/U 51.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key questions\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            How ready is Joe Burrow, really? Coach Zac Taylor insists his quarterback is \"in good shape\" after a nine-game absence. It helps Burrow also got some practice reps in ahead of the Bengals' last game. Still, the Pro Bowler is returning earlier than initially expected from a severe turf toe injury, and we just saw in San Francisco, with Brock Purdy, what can happen when recovery timelines are rushed. Up against an improved Ravens defense on a short week, this profiles as a tall task for No. 9.Can the Bengals slow Derrick Henry? The Ravens' star running back has been much more erratic this year than last, but he's helped carry Baltimore's grind-it-out attack since Lamar Jackson's return from injury, including with three touchdowns over the last two weeks. After mustering just 3 yards per carry against the New York Jets, this could be just the matchup for him to find daylight, as the Bengals are surrendering 156 rushing yards per game, which is ranked 31st in the entire NFL.Can Ja'Marr Chase single-handedly outrace Baltimore's secondary? The Ravens were surprisingly docile on defense to open the year, but they've tightened up since mid-October, allowing 17 or more points just once during their five-game win streak. Chase is arguably the NFL's top playmaker out wide, especially when Burrow is feeding him downfield opportunities, but he's coming off a one-game suspension and will be without top running mate Tee Higgins, who's sidelined with a concussion.You can bet Ravens vs. Bengals at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:X factor to watch\nOnce a ball-hawking member of the Ravens' secondary, Stone is coming off his splashiest outing of the 2025 campaign in Cincinnati, logging a pick six against Drake Maye and the New England Patriots to help the Bengals flirt with an upset. Practicing against Lamar Jackson and Co. for his first four NFL seasons might give Stone at least some advantage going into this matchup. But Jackson's recent inefficiencies as a passer might be the best thing working in Stone's favor; let's say Lamar gets a little too impatient while seeking the big play for Baltimore, giving his old friend a chance to steal a possession for the Bengals.Prediction\nIt's true that even when Flacco was dealing as Burrow's replacement, the Bengals failed miserably in other facets, be it situational coaching or general defensive competence. But there might be something to the notion that Burrow's return will put a little extra pep in everyone's step. The Ravens' own scattershot offense is another reason to believe this could be a pristine night for Burrow and Chase to reestablish their home run connection and throw another wrench into an already messy AFC North tangle.That said, we hesitate to put too much trust into a Zac Taylor-led operation that's routinely struggled to look prepared, and Higgins' absence should allow Baltimore to really hone in on lessening Chase's impact. There's also the distinct possibility of Jackson rediscovering his own juice as a rusher, with the bruising Henry by his side, against such a porous run \"D\" in Cincy. We anticipate some holiday fireworks before the buzzer, but give us the home team to scrape one out on Thanksgiving night.\nPick: Ravens 26, Bengals 22 | Bengals +7, Under 51.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Kelly filed a lawsuit over the buyout situation to get the full $54 million he is owed, per his contract, but LSU claimed then-athletic director Scott Woodward didn't have the authority to fire Kelly and has yet to send him a formal letter of his firing. Now, Kelly's attorneys sent LSU a letter which claims the school dragging out the firing process has done him harm in terms of finding a new job, per ESPN. \"As you know, there is absolutely no basis to LSU's contrived positions that Coach Kelly was not terminated or that cause existed for such termination,\" the letter said. \"LSU's conduct, including its failure to confirm that Coach Kelly was terminated without cause and its unsupported allegations of misconduct on the part of Coach Kelly, has made it nearly impossible for Coach Kelly to secure other football-related employment. LSU's conduct continues to harm Coach Kelly, particularly during this critical hiring period.\"Kelly's buyout includes offset language for a new job. By sending this letter, Kelly is making a legal argument that he can't get into the market to fulfill his requirement to pursue the best possible job that could mitigate some of the buyout from LSU's side. \nLSU, which initially wanted to negotiate the buyout terms with Kelly, has been looking into whether they could fire Kelly for cause and not pay the buyout. Kelly's attorneys insisted the school missed the window to do so, but all of this seems headed for a contentious court battle unless both sides find common ground soon. \n            \n    ",

UMass has allowed at least 42 points in three straight games, as a key reason for the model to value the Over. The model is also backing the Los Angeles Lakers as a 5.5-point favorite to cover against the Los Angeles Clippers in NBA action, while also picking Maryland to cover as 13.5-point underdogs against Gonzaga at the Players Era Festival in college basketball. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight seasons.

The Minutemen have allowed at least 42 points in three straight games, nearly going Over this total even without accounting for their offense. The UMass offense certainly isn't great either, averaging 9.3 ppg this season, but the Minutemen's season averages put this game Over this total. Its offense has performed better lately, with at least 10 points in four of the last five games. Meanwhile, Bowling Green has scored at least 16 points in three of its last four games. The model projects the Over to hit in 68% of simulations.  Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Lakers (-5.5) vs. Clippers (-110)LeBron James and Luka Doncic share the floor for the third time this season, and the Lakers are coming off back-to-back wins over the Jazz with the tandem playing together. Los Angeles defeated the Jazz, 140-126, in its one home game and James' season debut after missing the first 14 games of the season with sciatica. Doncic has proven more than capable to spearhead the Lakers this season, with the team off to a 12-4 start and the superstar leading the NBA in scoring at 34.5 ppg this season. Meanwhile, the Clippers are off to a 5-12 start, and are 2-10 over their last 12 games. The model projects the Lakers to cover in 55% of simulations. Back the Lakers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Maryland (+13.5) vs. Gonzaga (-110)No. 12 Gonzaga defeated No. 8 Alabama, 95-85, yesterday in what was expected to be one of the best games of the entire Players Era Festival, so could Tuesday be a letdown spot with a short turnaround after a big win for Gonzaga? Maryland defeated UNLV, 74-67, last night, but a matchup against a top-ranked team is the reason a program like Maryland participates in these tournaments. Maryland is a consistent top program, finishing No. 9 in the nation last year in a 27-9 season and reaching the Sweet 16 before losing to eventual national champion Florida. Senior guard Pharrel Payne is averaging 18.6 ppg this season, and the model views Maryland as a team with too much talent and previous success to be an underdog by this many points.

With that being said, I'm looking at goals in this fixture. Bayern Munich currently have the best attack in all of Europe. They've played 18 matches across all competitions and have had over 2.5 goals in all 18. They've played four matches in UCL this season while out-scoring their opponents 14-3.Meanwhile, Arsenal are the standard for defense and in their four matches have outscored their opponents 11-0. They are yet to concede a goal in UCL play, but I believe that changes. Vincent Kompany doesn't know how to slow down or pivot. This team led by Harry Kane and Michael Olise will press for goals, and even while missing Luis Diaz, they'll be pressing. Meanwhile, Bayern's defense is susceptible to set pieces and Arsenal are the best set piece team on the planet.Big names missing and Michael OliseYou can't talk about this fixture without talking about the absentees. There are big names missing all over the pitch. Arsenal is expected to be missing Viktor Gyokeres, Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and their best defender Gabriel Magalhaes. Meanwhile, Bayern are still missing Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies and most noticeably, they'll be without Diaz, who was sent off with a red card against PSG on the last UCL matchday. With the dismissal of Diaz, a lot more pressure is going to fall on Harry Kane, Lennart Karl, and Michael Olise.I do think there will be goals for Bayern, especially with Arsenal missing Gabriel, and Olise will be the one I'm looking at to exploit these weaknesses. He has 12 goal contributions in his nine Bundesliga matches, and has three goal contributions already in UCL this season. While Harry Kane is double teamed, look towards Olise to make an impact.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas City Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco aims to return from his knee injury on Thanksgiving against the Dallas Cowboys, ESPN reports. Pacheco has been out since Week 8, when he got hurt in an eventual win over the Washington Commanders.Pacheco was the team's leading rusher at the time of the injury with 329 yards, and he had a season-high 58 yards against Washington before exiting. Since Pacheco's injury, Kareem Hunt received the lion's share of the work in the Kansas City backfield. In a Week 12 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, Hunt handled 30 carries for 104 yards and a touchdown. The 30 carries were a career high, and the 104 yards were a season high. Overall, the Chiefs' running backs recorded 117 rushing yards against the Colts, a season high.With Pacheco back in the fold, Hunt will likely see his carries reduced, though he should maintain his goal-line work; Hunt has seven rushing touchdowns this season compared to one for Pacheco.The Chiefs have had one of the more efficient (fifth in rushing success rate) but least explosive (31st in explosive run rate) rushing attacks this season. The Cowboys are allowing 4.6 yards per carry, the ninth-highest figure in the NFL, though they have been significantly better in that area over the last two weeks.\nPlayoff implications loom largeThursday's matchup is a pivotal game for both Kansas City (6-5) and Dallas (5-5-1). The Chiefs are the No. 10 seed in the AFC, and the Cowboys are the No. 10 seed in the NFC.The Chiefs are stuck at the back of a large group in the upper-middle tier of the AFC: Seven of the conference's 16 teams are either 7-4 or 6-5. Kansas City is third in its down division behind the 9-2 Denver Broncos and the 7-4 Los Angeles Chargers, and is down a head-to-head game against both. Furthermore, the Chiefs are just 3-4 in AFC games, costing them dearly in the wild card push. Even though this isn't a conference game, the Chiefs need to start stacking wins. Kansas City is 1-4 on the road.\nThe Cowboys, meanwhile, won two straight thanks to a much-improved defense boosted by trade deadline acquisitions Quinnen Williams and Logan Wilson. The Cowboys' 24-21 comeback win over the Philadelphia Eagles greatly increased their playoff odds, but Dallas is yet to win three straight games this season. Cowboys faithful will also have an eye on the earlier Thanksgiving game -- Green Bay Packers at Detroit Lions -- as both are ahead of Dallas in the NFC wild card race. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Duke star Cameron Boozer has been as good as advertised during the first three weeks of the 2025-26 season. The former five-star recruit and a projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft has Duke off to a 7-0 start. In four of those seven games, Boozer has posted a double-double.Boozer, who picked Duke over Miami (his other finalist), is on track to become the latest first-round pick coach Jon Scheyer has produced since taking over the program from legendary coach Mike Krzyzewski in 2022. Duke saw three players taken in the top 10 earlier this summer -- including CBS Sports' reigning National Player of the Year Cooper Flagg -- and Boozer is still in contention to possibly go No. 1. In Boozer's first test against Kansas at last week's Champions Classic, Boozer finished with 18 points, 11 rebounds and five assists in the 78-66 win.\"I still don't think he played incredible,\" Scheyer said after the win over Kansas. \"That's the thing that's really exciting.\"\nLet's jump into our rankings and get to our CBS Sports/USBWA Freshman of the Week for the 2025-26 college basketball season.  Freshman of the Week: Cameron Boozer, DukeWelcome back to the Frosh Watch, our weekly ranking of the ten most impressive freshmen in college basketball. For the 11th season in a row, CBS Sports has once again teamed up with the United States Basketball Writers Association and its Wayman Tisdale Freshman of the Year Award to present this every-Tuesday feature. Each week, we'll start by announcing the national Freshman of the Week honoree. The cycle for FOTW runs Tuesday-Monday.  In three games last week against Howard, Niagara and Kansas, Boozer posted a double-double in two of those games. He finished with 26 points, 12 rebounds and four assists in just 26 minutes against Howard, shooting an efficient 10 of 12 from the floor.\nBoozer is shooting 54.9% from the floor and 37% from the 3-point line on 3.9 attempts per night. Boozer is also doing an excellent job getting to the free-throw line and converting at the charity stripe. He is averaging almost seven free-throw attempts per game and is shooting 79.2% from the line.Previous Freshman of the Week winnersNov. 11: Koa Peat, ArizonaNov. 18: Mikel Brown Jr., Louisville Frosh Watch: Ranking top 10 freshmen \n    \n                                        \n    1. Cameron Boozer | F | Duke Stats: 21.1 PPG | 9.9 RPG | 4.0 APG For the first time this season, there is a new No. 1 in Frosh Watch. Boozer has been playing at an unbelievable level during the first few weeks of the season. He is a skilled player who uses his strength to his advantage. Boozer is also a good passer and can start fastbreaks with his playmaking ability. Duke just produced the National Player of the Year as a freshman last year. Could Boozer be next? It's early, but he is going to be a top contender for the award. Last week: 2\n\n    \n                                        \n    2. Darryn Peterson | G | Kansas Stats: 21.5 PPG | 3.5 RPG | 3.0 APG Peterson has missed his team's last three games with a hamstring injury, including the showdown against Duke in the Champions Classic. Peterson won't play this week in the Players Era Festival, and it's unclear when the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft will return to the lineup. Last week: 1\n\n    \n                                        \n     3. Caleb Wilson | F | North Carolina Stats: 20.6 PPG | 10.0 RPG | 2.6 APG Every time I watch Wilson play, I come away impressed. Despite being a five-star recruit and a highly touted NBA prospect, Wilson plays the game like he's a walk-on fighting for minutes. He hustles around the floor and makes winning plays almost every game. He is coming off his third double-double of the season (23 points and 12 rebounds) against Navy. Last week: 3\n\n    \n                                        \n    4. AJ Dybantsa | F | BYUStats: 19.8 PPG | 6.6 RPG | 2.2 APG In BYU's 98-70 win over Wisconsin, Dybansta finished with 18 points, six rebounds, and four assists. He was coming off the best performance of his young college career against UConn by scoring 25 points in a close loss. The next test for him and his team is a matchup against Miami later in the week. Last week: 4\n    \n                                        \n    5. Mikel Brown Jr. | G | LouisvilleStats: 19.3 PPG | 2.5 RPG | 6.8 APG Brown had an impressive performance last weekend against Cincinnati. He finished with 22 points, six assists and five rebounds in the 74-64 win. He scored 11 points in just 24 minutes against Eastern Michigan. Last week: 5\n\n    \n                                        \n    6. Nate Ament | F | Tennessee Stats: 18.8 PPG | 8.4 RPG | 3.2 APG Ament has been one of the top scorers in his class during the first few weeks of the season. After scoring a season-low 15 points against Tennessee State, Ament responded by dropping 20 points in an 85-60 win over Rutgers. He has scored at least 15 points in every game this season.  Last week: 6\n\n    \n                                        \n    7. Koa Peat | F | Arizona  Stats: 16.2 PPG | 6.6 RPG | 2.8 APG Peat had a strong showing in Arizona's first true road game of the season against UConn. Peat finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds, which marked the first double-double of his career. He also shot 7 of 14 from the floor. Last week: 7\n    \n                                        \n    8. Darius Acuff Jr. | G | Arkansas Stats: 16.8 PPG | 2.5 RPG | 4.3 APG Acuff logged just 22 minutes in a blowout win over Jackson State. He finished with 10 points and 10 assists after scoring at least 20 points in three of his first four games. The next test for him will come against Duke on Thanksgiving. Last week: 8\n\n    \n                                        \n    9. Ebuka Okorie | G | StanfordStats: 23.8 PPG | 4.0 RPG | 2.8 APG Okorie is tied for fifth among all Division I players in scoring (23.8) and has scored at least 17 points in every game. Okorie finished with 26 points and five assists in a win over Louisiana. Last week: 10\n    \n                                        \n    10.

    "body": "\n        STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- Even in Happy Valley, homecomings don't always deliver happy endings.  Matt Rhule returned last week to the town that shaped him, where he played high school and college football and once dreamed of leading Penn State. He reunited with friends and family, former teammates and coaches. He shook hands, posed for pictures and retold stories from the glory days. He even took Nebraska to his old stomping grounds, State College High, for a Saturday morning walkthrough, showing up 30 minutes early just to embrace familiar faces and watch his father, Dennis, reunite with players he once led as a ninth-grade coach. \"Matt just goes out of his way to make everybody feel included and really welcome,\" State College coach Matt Lintal said. It was shaping up to be the perfect Saturday, until it wasn't. A few hours later, Rhule led his Nebraska team into Beaver Stadium and the Cornhuskers suffered their worst loss of the season. \n\"Coming home,\" said Rhule, \"this is about as miserable as it gets.\" Penn State's 37-10 win will go down as a footnote in a lost season for the Nittany Lions, and perhaps even for Rhule, the man the school targeted to replace James Franklin in October -- only for the prodigal son to remain at Nebraska with a new, lucrative contract. Other than an opening possession that was stuffed twice near the goal line, the Huskers were listless in Happy Valley. Freshman quarterback TJ Lateef didn't appear flustered as many expected, but Penn State's defense clamped down on the Huskers' receivers, and running back Kaytron Allen delivered big run after big run on his way to breaking the school's career rushing record with a 160-yard, two-touchdown performance.  For Penn State, it was a reminder of what once was and could be again. Interim coach Terry Smith, donning a \"409\" pin honoring legendary former head coach Joe Paterno, was the star of the postgame celebration. Players held up \"Hire Terry Smith\" signs as athletics director Pat Kraft watched from midfield. Kraft did not respond to multiple interview requests from CBS Sports. \nRhule gave Smith his first opportunity as a college coach at Temple in 2013. Twelve years later, Smith is fighting to take over as the Nittany Lions' head coach. Smith had his formal interview for the job Monday. \"When you're the interim head coach, people have a tendency to rally around you,\" Rhule said. \"They certainly have rallied around him. He's a Penn Stater, he's a lifer. \"I'm proud of him. I gave him his first job. He's done a really nice job out there. I'm sure Penn State's a great place. They have fantastic talent and they played really well tonight.\" \nThat line – \"I'm sure Penn State's a great place.\" – lingered amid the ruckus of a fast-moving, fast-talking scrum with the media. The Penn State alum, a target to take over as head coach just one month ago, seemed more like a stranger in a strange land, disconnected from the past -- an outsider just passing through town. Did this game against his alma mater seem any different after declining Penn State's overtures? \"No,\" Rhule told CBS Sports as he walked to Nebraska's team bus. \"I love these guys, I wanted to be their coach, I've always wanted to be their coach. To come here and be out there with them, even though the result wasn't what we wanted, I'm always proud of them and happy to be with them.\" \nRhule's contract extension on Oct. 30 -- a move that pushed his buyout from $5 million to $15 million -- ended Penn State's pursuit. His deal carries a 90% guaranteed buyout through 2032 and will pay him $12.5 million annually in its final three years. \"Two things are very important to retaining a coach when they're the envy of someone else's eye,\" Nebraska athletics director Troy Dannen told CBS Sports. \"One is that you can put them in a position to be successful, because the salary is available almost anywhere, but can they win? Matt is in that position where he says, 'I can win in Nebraska. Not that I couldn't win at Penn State, but I can win at Nebraska.' \"And the other thing, frankly, is you just have to treat them well. You have to make wherever the job is, be home for them.\" \nBy all accounts, Rhule and his family have embraced Lincoln. He ended Nebraska's eight-year bowl drought a year ago and has them postseason-bound again. Turning away from his alma mater marks a subtle shift in his career arc: he's no longer the itinerant rebuilder who hopped from Temple to Baylor to the NFL in the span of four years. Penn State was smart to pursue. If there was ever a time to lure Rhule to Penn State, this cycle appeared to be the perfect window. Season four at Nebraska is coming, and the Huskers are betting big on stability. \"Matt's message to me was: 'I grew up there, I played there, it'll always be special to me, but Nebraska's home,'\" Dannen said. \nRhule snapped Nebraska's postseason drought with a Pinstripe Bowl win in 2024.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Yes, people change, but the memories remain. Rhule moved to State College from New York City as a high school junior, transitioning from quarterback to center, where he excelled and became fast friends with teammates, including Naveen Parmar, with whom he was also roommates at Penn State for four years. Even then, Rhule was a fast-talking orator and a whirlwind of activity.\"Let's put it this way,\" said Parmar, \"he didn't keep the cleanest room when we were roommates.\" Once cramped into a single room, Rhule made an offer to Parmar: \"I'll just live in the closet.\" \n\"He just threw his bed in there,\" Parmar laughed. \"Controlled chaos,\" Rhule said. \"My wife doesn't let me do that very much.\" These days, he has a lot more room to roam. Nebraska has poured $165 million into a new 315,000-square-foot football facility and expects to boost its revenue-sharing/NIL pool to roughly $25 million in 2026, sources told CBS Sports. The investment could make the upcoming Transfer Portal window, officially opening Jan. 2 (but active well before then), particularly intriguing. The program may be a generation removed from its 1990s dynasty, but for the first time years, Nebraska has momentum. \"Can we go back and win three national championships in four years? That may be the expectation for a fan base, but it's unreasonable to ask anybody to do that in this day and age because it hasn't happened in this day and age,\" Dannen said. \"But for Nebraska to get to its place among the national elite, it's a reasonable expectation, a reasonable belief. \n\"And if Matt didn't think it, he wouldn't have chosen to stay.\" After Penn State's win Saturday, the victory bell rang for nearly 30 straight minutes. The noise cut through Rhule's postgame press conference and through the nostalgia of a walk-on who once rang that bell himself. \"I can't,\" Rhule said mid-answer. \"There's a bell going off.\" The memory of Penn State remains, but now nostalgia is only noise, an interference in Rhule's way as he continues Nebraska's long climb back into the national picture. \"We're on to the next week,\" Rhule said. \"We've got no time -- no time, no time -- to worry about what just happened, as bad as it was.\" \n\n    \n                                        \n    If you want all of the latest Penn State coaching search news and info, there's no better place than Lions247.  It's the most trusted source for intel on the Nittany Lions and has the largest and most dedicated community of Penn State fans.

    "body": "\n        Some teams falling short of expectations are already being forced to begin offseason preparations. If the incumbent quarterback is not included in future plans, then the team must identify an alternative. The methods to acquire such a player, include the NFL Draft, trade and free agency. In some cases, the decision is made for the team, as there are many variables to consider. Looking back to last offseason, the Seahawks strategically traded away veteran Geno Smith and signed Sam Darnold; a move that has allowed them to become contenders in the NFC. The Vikings elected to empower J.J. McCarthy rather than re-sign Darnold, which has negatively altered the course of that franchise.As it stands, there are three quarterback prospects -- Alabama's Ty Simpson, Oregon's Dante Moore and Indiana's Fernando Mendoza -- among the top 15 overall in Mike Renner's prospect rankings.   Taking a snapshot of the league, as it stands following Week 12, I explore how teams should approach the offseason, in addition to the context of what they may do; the two are not always eye to eye. The picture will likely change as more information becomes available in the coming months.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona Cardinals: Draft  The Kyler Murray era in the desert is almost certainly over, but which replacements do the Cardinals have at their disposal? Ideally, they would draft a quarterback in the first round, but are currently slated to pick No. 9 overall and are not armed with the amount of draft capital that would leverage a team into dealing with them as opposed to the Browns or Jets. Arizona really needs three worthy quarterbacks to be available in the first round.If they do not find a quarterback to their liking, then signing or trading for a veteran are the most likely outcomes.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns: DraftThe Browns have a strong defense; most of which is locked in for the next few years. They are a few very important pieces, including quarterback, away from being a playoff contender. \nIt is clear that Dillon Gabriel is not the team's solution to the franchise quarterback question. He could be a backup and viable spot starter, but does not possess the necessary ceiling to execute the duties of the position at a high level. Shedeur Sanders is not without his flaws, but the team rallied around him in a way that had not been seen with Gabriel. Sanders will likely have the opportunity to state his case as the team's franchise quarterback over the remainder of the season, but it would take a lot for the Browns to remove their name from the quarterback market. The problem for them is that, if they win a few more games, they could be in a cost-prohibitive position in regards to trading up, which would cost them a chance to add at other positions of need, such as offensive tackle and wide receiver. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders: Stay putGeno Smith is not the answer in the long term. Leadership overlooked one of the league's worst rosters in an effort to expedite the rebuilding process with its 74-year-old head coach. The right decision for the Raiders would be to trade out if they are in position to take one of those quarterbacks in order to accumulate draft capital that could help rebuild each side of the ball. Outcomes with a rookie quarterback are not going to be any better until the supportive roles have improved. The Raiders need to take their medicine, eat their vegetables or whichever turn of phrase one wants to use. In doing so, perhaps, they are in a position to address the position in the 2027 draft class.Having said all of that, it would not be a surprise to see Las Vegas take its shot at a quarterback in this year's draft. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Rams: Stay putLos Angeles is essentially at Atlanta's mercy. How high will the Rams' pick from the Falcons climb? Yes, Los Angeles has two first-round picks, but so do the Jets and Browns. A team is not going to trade down from top three overall to middle of the first round if that is where Atlanta's pick ends up being; it is currently No. 11 overall with games against the Jets, Cardinals and Saints remaining. If the Rams go deep into the postseason and Matthew Stafford returns, it would not be surprising if the team continued pushing all of its chips to the middle of the table to make another run. If it plays out that way, Sean McVay would eventually turn to a reclamation project like Mac Jones or Will Levis to carry the torch.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins: Stay put*The asterisk is born out of necessity. If Miami fell into a position to draft a quarterback, there is a good chance the Dolphins would take that opportunity. However, having won three of their last four, with upcoming games against the Saints and Jets, the Dolphins would have to trade up the board to select one of the perceived top quarterbacks and other teams -- the Browns and Jets -- are more flush with draft capital to facilitate a deal. \nOdds of the AFC East franchise running it back with Tua Tagovailoa and Mike McDaniel next season are increasing. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Orleans Saints: DraftThe Saints are essentially conducting a live interview with second-round pick Tyler Shough over the next month-plus. He could still earn the franchise's faith and deter the Saints from taking a quarterback early in the 2026 NFL Draft. However, the most likely scenario, in my opinion, is Shough falling short of expectation and the franchise needing to use its first-round pick on a quarterback if one were available.New Orleans has an uninspiring roster, so trading up would not be recommended.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Jets: DraftThe Jets defense is obviously a shell of itself as a result of deadline deals involving defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and Sauce Gardner, but there are building blocks on this roster, particularly along the offensive line and Garrett Wilson. Given the assets they have accumulated, New York is likely to take a quarterback in the first round of the 2026 NFL Draft. However, it is impossible to shake the sheer volume of insider reports that the team could also look to trade for a veteran. \nEvery scenario, aside from trading for a top 10 NFL quarterback, is available. If they are in a position to draft a quarterback without trading all of its cache, that is the best decision, because it puts them on a sustainable long-term timeline.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh Steelers: Sign or trade for a veteranPittsburgh has been cycling through quarterbacks ever since Ben Roethlisberger brought an end to his professional career. Most franchises have a debilitating fear of not having a franchise quarterback, but Mike Tomlin has never once lamented the team's situation or tried to tank for a better draft position. The Steelers just make it work. As a result of the team's steady, modest performance, the Steelers will once again be out of range to draft one of the best quarterback prospects. Instead, they will either look to acquire a veteran via trade or free agency post-Aaron Rodgers. \nSome of the quarterbacks expected to get a second chance this offseason include Mac Jones and Trey Lance.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh. More draft coverage can be found at CBSSports.com, including the weekly mock drafts and a regularly available look at the eligible prospects. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With quality starting pitching increasingly hard to find these days, teams have turned to the bullpen for help. Relievers carry a much heavier workload now than they did even 10 years ago, that's for sure, but it's more than that. Teams are turning relievers -- good relievers -- into starting pitchers. The Rangers did this way back in the day with C.J. Wilson. More recently it has been done successfully with Garrett Crochet, Clay Holmes, Michael King, Zack Littell, Michael Lorenzen, Seth Lugo, and Jeffrey Springs. This is not an entirely new concept, of course. Teams have stretched relievers out in spring training for decades because why not? Spring training is the time to try new things and it's much easier to go from starter to reliever at the end of camp than the other way around. Those past reliever-to-starter conversions did not work often, but with teams being so good at pitch design now, the success rate has gone up. It helps that they're only asking these guys to go through the lineup twice and not pitch seven innings.\"Especially  with the expectation starters may not have to go three times through  the order, this may become more common,\" one executive told MLB.com in 2024. \"I also think as  teams have gotten better at optimizing pitch shapes, more teams will  try and tweak or add a third pitch that previously prevented a reliever  from starting.\"Last offseason, the Mets signed Holmes, a two-time All-Star closer, and turned him into a starter. It was a success -- Holmes threw 165 ⅔ innings with a 3.53 ERA -- although he did seem to run out of gas late in the season, which is understandable. The offseason before that, the Giants tried it with Jordan Hicks. That didn't go so well. The offseason before that, it was the Padres with Lugo, a smashing success and kicked this trend into overdrive.\nThe scarcity of starting pitching has driven this trend and so has economics. Starters make less than relievers, so if you can get a starter at a reliever's salary, you've come out ahead. Holmes signed a three-year contract worth $38 million, which is closer money. Established starters like Yusei Kikuchi and Luis Severino signed for nearly twice as much over the same number of years, and Holmes was as effective if not better. And if it didn't work, the Mets would've put Holmes right back in the bullpen.In the early days of the offseason, there are rumblings about teams looking at free-agent relievers for potential starting roles. They identify pitchers who have a strong foundation already in place and also areas they believe they can improve. That often means adding a new pitch (Holmes added a changeup with the Mets), though it could also be a delivery adjustment or a change in pitch mix. Here now are three free-agent relievers who could make the jump into the rotation in 2026.RHP Ryan Helsley\nFree-agent rank: No. 24 (fifth among relievers)History as a starter: Minimal. Helsley started in college and his first three years in the minors, but that was it. The Cardinals moved him to the bullpen in Triple-A in 2019, he made his MLB debut that April, and he never looked back. Helsley, now 31, has never started a game in the big leagues because he was too dominant in the late innings. There were persistent whispers about trying Helsley in the rotation during his time in St. Louis, but they never went through with it.\nHis arsenal: For all intents and purposes, Helsley is a four-seamer/slider pitcher who uses them at a near 50/50 split. He will mix in the occasional curveball and he toyed briefly with a cutter early in 2025, though that didn't stick. Go back to 2019-22 and Helsley would break out a sinker and a changeup now and then, but very rarely. We're talking only a handful per year. The feel for spin is there with the curveball. Otherwise, Helsley is a pretty classic four-seamer/slider reliever.What he needs: Well, for starters, Helsley and his next team have to figure out why his fastball, which still regularly touched triple digits, got blasted in 2025, particularly by right-handed batters. Opponents hit .422 with a .667 slugging percentage against the heater this summer, and the six homers Helsley allowed on the pitch are one more than he gave up on fastballs from 2022-24. It's pretty mystifying, really. Helsley's fastball had its usual velocity and movement in 2025, but the pitch got hit very hard.With Helsley, it's pretty clear what he needs to do to make a potential transition into the rotation work. He has to fix his fastball, first and foremost, and he must come up with a third pitch. It could be the curveball -- it's not uncommon to see a starter with two breaking balls and no changeup these days -- though I reckon the team that tries starting Helsley (if any team does) will look to expand his arsenal further. Can the cutter, changeup, and curveball all become feature pitches? What about a sinker?\nCan it work? I am skeptical about Helsley moving into the rotation because he's never been a great strike-thrower and there's a lot of effort in his delivery, two things that usually don't make for a reliable starter. He's never had much of an issue with lefties, but that was in a one-inning role. Going through a lineup even twice is a much different animal. If Helsley had a typical Helsley season in 2025 and we hadn't seen his high-octane fastball get squared up so often, maybe I'd be more optimistic.What I think doesn't matter though. Several teams, including the Tigers, have expressed interest in Helsley as a starting pitcher, according to The Athletic. Actual MLB teams think Helsley can start, or, more accurately, they're willing to give him a chance to start as long as the price is right. I will never say a pitcher absolutely cannot make the reliever to starter transition because modern pitcher development is so, so good. Helsley does strike me as a bit of a long shot though.RHP Brad Keller\nFree-agent rank: No. 35 (sixth among relievers)History as a starter: It is lengthy. In fact, 2025 was Keller's first season as a full-time reliever (he did make one start as an opener). Still only 30, Keller has made 20 starts in a season four times and he even has two Opening Day starts under his belt (2019 and 2021 with the Royals). Injuries and ineffectiveness had him working more of a swingman role from 2022-24, but Keller has been a starter in the big leagues. He knows the routine and what it takes to get through the long grind of a season in that role.\nHis arsenal: Even as a short reliever with the Cubs this past season, Keller used a starter's arsenal. He throws five distinct pitches and his usage is based on the batter's handedness. Righties saw two fastballs (four-seamer and sinker) and two sliders (sweeper and traditional slider). Lefties got the four-seamer and split-change, plus the occasional traditional slider. Keller threw all five pitches at least 10% of the time each. He pitched like a starter out of the bullpen and had immense success against righties and lefties.What he needs: The biggest thing is health. Keller already has the deep arsenal you want in a starter, as well as a history of throwing strikes and familiarity with the role. Earlier in his career, Keller sat 92-95 mph with his fastball and scraped 98 mph now and then. This past season, he sat 95-97 mph and topped out at 99 mph. The top-end velocity is about the same, but working shorter stints boosted his average velocity. Keller credited good health and mechanical adjustments in addition to the role change.Here's what Keller told FanGraphs about his successful 2025 season in September:\"It's being healthy, first and foremost,\" Keller said of his return  to form. \"I battled (thoracic outlet syndrome) for a couple years, and it really came to a head  two years ago. Ultimately, I had surgery, and I feel better now than I  have my entire career. I'm recovering better than I ever had. That along  with some tweaks I made mechanically have helped me max my velo.  Overall, I'm just a better pitcher. Stuff-wise, sequencing-wise, using  my pitches well. There was basically a revamp of everything.\"There is always room to tweak a pitcher's arsenal. In Keller's case, he's already working with five offerings, including pitches that are effective against hitters on either side of the plate. He has toyed with a curveball in the past, so maybe he tries to bring that back just to have another look, but it doesn't seem imperative. Keller has been an effective big-league starter in the past. This isn't some far-fetched idea. Really all Keller needs is good health and an opportunity.  Can it work? It's reasonable to expect Keller's velocity to dip working longer outings as a starter. That applies to every pitcher. Even if it goes back into the 92-95 mph range though, Keller has enough tools in his belt to remain effective. He has multiple fastballs and multiple breaking balls, and a split-change hybrid to boot. Not surprisingly, teams have shown interest in Keller as a starting pitcher, per the New York Post. The arsenal and past history suggests this reliever-to-starter conversion would have a real chance to work.\nRHP Luke Weaver\nFree-agent rank: No. 20 (third among relievers)History as a starter: Like Keller, Weaver has started most of his career. He's made 25 starts twice (2018 and 2023) and made 12 starts during the 60-game 2020 season. That's a full season's worth. Weaver, 32, did not start a single game in 2024 or 2025. Those are the only two years in his 10 big league seasons that he did not start a game, and even then the Yankees initially used him for multiple innings before Weaver settled into a one-inning, late-inning role. Bottom line, Weaver has started plenty. He's done it.His arsenal: As a reliever the last two years, Weaver threw 90% four-seamers and changeups, plus the occasional cutter. He went from the low-90s as a starter into the mid-90s as a reliever, and the Yankees tweaked his changeup last year, adding more action downward. It's an excellent changeup, one that neutralizes both lefties and righties, and is Weaver's go-to weapon. The fastball is more than a show-me pitch, but the changeup is the pitch Weaver leans on when he push comes to shove.What he needs: Weaver has never had a reliable, consistent breaking ball. Not even in college. He's tried different curveball and sliders over the years, sweepers, you name it. Weaver has pitched for six teams in his career and all six have tried to help him come up with a steady spinner. The next team could be the one that does it! Right now though, Weaver is a two-pitch guy, or maybe three pitches if you grade out the cutter generously. The changeup is excellent, but a good breaking ball feels like a must here.\nCan it work? Not surprisingly, Weaver is open to starting. \"The door is open. I am never going to  just say absolutely not,\" he told the New York Post in September. The fact Weaver, who's been in the league for a decade already, has been unable to come up with a reliable breaking ball makes me skeptical. That is especially true now, in an age in which teams almost literally cook up breaking balls in a lab. It's OK velocity, which equals less margin of error. Weaver appears to face an uphill battle to be a successful starter.\n            ",

One such debate has raged for weeks, ever since the first College Football Playoff Rankings of the season were released and Notre Dame, which lost its season opener at Miami 24-21, was ranked No. 10, eight spots ahead of No. 18 Miami, the team it lost to.Notre Dame has remained ahead of the Hurricanes every week since, though they've gotten closer. The Irish have only moved up to No. 9 while Miami was at No. 13 in last week's rankings. When the new rankings are released this week, Notre Dame will remain ahead.And you know what? They should be. Here's the problem with the debate. It only focuses on the head-to-head result between the two, but the CFP isn't ranking teams based on one result. They're ranking teams based on the entirety of their season, and guess what? Notre Dame has had a better season overall than Miami, even if we include the three-point loss at Miami in the first game of the season.This isn't the committee valuing Notre Dame's brand or trying to rig it for television ratings. If we were still using the BCS system, Notre Dame would be five spots ahead of Miami right now, too. If we look at power ratings, like mine and everybody else's, you'll find Notre Dame ahead of Miami.\nAnd for those who want to argue the strength of schedule, guess what? Whether you want to use FPI, Sagarin, or every other method, Notre Dame has a higher-rated SOS than Miami. Now, having said that, there's an entirely different discussion that needs to be had over SOS, but we don't have time for the entire thing. For now, just know that the difference between the No. 25 SOS and the No. 50 SOS isn't significant, and nobody measures SOS the same way. So try not to rely too heavily on it in any argument.Back to the matter at hand, none of this is to say the head-to-head result shouldn't matter, or that it won't. I guarantee you that if the final at-large bid comes down to Notre Dame and Miami, the committee will choose Miami over the Irish because of that result, as it should. But when it comes to looking at their seasons on the whole, we can't just look at one game.Oh, and by the way, the Irish are up to No. 4 in our power ratings this week, seven spots ahead of Miami.

Of course, Ohio State fans are well aware of how not simple beating Michigan has been for this team lately. It's kind of wild to think about how Ohio State hasn't played in a Big Ten Championship Game since the 2020 season, isn't it?

I'd been a bit skeptical of them all year, despite my own ratings loving them as much as they do, but they've put some of those doubts to rest lately. The fact that they've been able to play at a high level despite the injuries they're dealing with on offense is impressive. They do have one more difficult test left, though. Going on the road against Washington is not easy, and Dan Lanning is only 1-3 against the Huskies since arriving at Oregon.

Still, one of my favorite cliches when discussing college football teams is don't tell me who you've played, tell me how you've played. Notre Dame is playing extremely well. They are blowing the doors off teams, and have one of the most dynamic playmakers in the country with Jeremiyah Love. They have their two losses to Miami and Texas A&M, but if you were to poll every other potential CFP team about which one of those three they want to play the least right now, I bet Notre Dame receives the most votes.

These are the kinds of questions we're forced to seriously consider in this new age of the expanded playoff. I do not like it! Anyway, regardless of how you answer that question, the Dawgs need to beat Georgia Tech if they want to have a chance at that home game.

How does that happen? Well, first, Notre Dame jumped Alabama more than Alabama fell. As for why Georgia surpassed the Tide, when adjusting for the opponent they played, the Tide were worse against Eastern Illinois than Oklahoma. The margins are very thin between these teams, and Georgia's improved slightly while Alabama's worsened just enough to slip below the Dawgs.

What we don't know is how the committee would view the Red Raiders if they lose the Big 12 Championship. I still think they'd get in, so if you're a fan of a 10-2 team on the bubble, you should be rooting for the Red Raiders this week and next.

I'm an Illinois fan. I know how I felt looking at my own power ratings and others when I saw Illinois typically ranked outside the top 25 all year, despite the wins (the Wisconsin loss sucked, but was not an outright shock to me). How do you feel when you look at your undefeated Aggies, yet see them ranked as low as No. 8 here and even lower elsewhere? Does it make you nervous, or are you outright dismissive of the numbers? There are no wrong answers. I'm only checking your temperature.

They've lost to the two best teams they faced and shouldn't have been in that spot against the Wildcats. But I still think this team is good, and if I'm hosting a first-round playoff game, this is not an offense I'd be excited to welcome to town right now. Fortunately for those teams, the odds of Utah sneaking into the field are low.

Like you, I'd also like this to be over so we can move on. I also find it tacky for this to be going on when the Rebels still have a lot to play for. I mean, you finally break through and reach the playoffs (you're in, don't worry), and you have to deal with this crap? It sucks.

Just because I don't see a problem with Notre Dame being ranked ahead of you does not mean I don't respect this team! Believe me, as a neutral observer, there's nothing I'm rooting for harder than Miami getting into the field and having to play Georgia in the first round. That's the kind of storyline we dream of in this industry.

    "body": "\n        With Week 12 in the rearview mirror, we're now, officially, two-thirds of the way through the 2025 NFL season. Which means we are really heading into the stretch run, and that the picture of what matters and what doesn't is starting to become clearer with each passing week. And one of the things that is becoming clearer is that we have no idea who is going to win the Super Bowl, or who the true contenders even are. There appear to be a whole bunch of teams with a claim to contender status, but they all seemingly appear to have at least some flaws.We're here today to talk about those flaws, and to determine what, if anything, will hold the contenders back from actually hoisting the Lombardi Trophy come February. Over at DraftKings, there are 11 teams with odds of +1500 or better to win the Super Bowl. The next-closest team is at +4000, which is a pretty significant gap; so we'll call this group of 11 the true Super Bowl contenders, and then we'll examine what might prevent them from emerging as Super Bowl champs. \nTeamOddsRams+400Eagles+700Chiefs+950Seahawks+1000Colts +1000Lions+1200Broncos+1200Bills+1200Ravens+1200Patriots+1400Packers+1400\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Rams: Injuries and special teamsIt was pretty difficult to think of the possible Achilles' heel for the Rams, who have been absolutely rolling since losing two out of three games following their 2-0 start. The secondary would seem to be the major point of concern, but that group has been playing really well. Emmanuel Forbes and Cobie Durant look good. Quentin Lake is out but could come back. And the Kams (Curl and Kinchens) look solid at safety. But the Rams are built around a 37-year-old quarterback with back issues and a wide receiver who spends more time in the medical tent than anybody in the league, plus they already have Rob Havenstein and Tyler Higbee on injured reserve. Plus, we can't forget that this has been one of the worst special teams units in the league so far.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia Eagles: Inconsistent offenseWe've seen the Philadelphia defense hit a level that few other units in the league can reach. They got tagged by the Cowboys on Sunday, but they were fresh off humiliating the Packers and Lions in the two games before that. We know they have an incredibly high ceiling. Does the offense still have that same ceiling? The line hasn't been as good as in previous years. Saquon Barkley hasn't been as explosive as he was a year ago. (No surprise after his 450-plus touches.) And A.J. Brown has spent more time complaining about his role than actually getting the ball because the passing game has been out of sync seemingly all season. The Eagles have enough talent that they've been able to stack wins together anyway, but there are concerns here. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City Chiefs: Might not actually make playoffsThis one is awkward. Even after their seemingly season-saving win on Sunday over the Indianapolis Colts (more on them later), the Chiefs are still just 6-5 on the season. They're one game out of the wild card, and they are a combined 0-3 against the three teams that currently occupy the wild card spots. (The Chargers, Jaguars and Bills.) They have a chance to get even with L.A. in a few weeks' time and potentially use that game as a springboard down the stretch, but it's not like the schedule is easy the rest of the way. The Chiefs play the Cowboys, Texans, Chargers, Titans, Broncos and Raiders following that Cowboys game. There are two easy wins in there, but four potentially tough games, too. They can't afford to lose more than maybe two games.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seattle Seahawks: Playing from behindWe've really only seen one game so far this season where the Seahawks didn't play in a neutral or positive script for most of the game, and it didn't go well. Sam Darnold probably sees Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula in his sleep, given what's happened the last two times Darnold played against his unit. Seattle likes to be able to keep pass volume down and especially to avoid straight dropback passes when the defense knows the pass is coming. That's how the team is built. If you get a lead on the Seahawks, we've seen them become a totally different offense. Of course, the Seattle defense makes getting that lead in the first place very difficult. But if you can, then it becomes a much different game from there on out. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis Colts: QuarterbackDaniel Jones through the first eight games of the year: 71.2% completion rate, 8.5 yards per attempt, 13 touchdowns, three interceptions, nine sacks taken. Jones over the last three weeks: 64.5% completion rate, 7.3 yards per attempt, four touchdowns, four interceptions, 12 sacks taken. Shane Steichen has done an excellent job scheming Jones into position for success throughout this season, but he is still a quarterback who needs to be schemed into position for success; he's not going to elevate the players around him through his own excellence. In fact, it's the other way around. The offensive line and skill-position players need to lift Jones. It's really hard to win that way in the playoffs, no matter how good those other players are. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit Lions: Playing from behind, outdoor gamesLike the Seahawks, the Lions are not built to play from behind. Nobody is, really, but their specific style of offense, with all the under-center play-action and misdirection at times feels like it can crumble under the weight of having to become a straight dropback operation when down by multiple scores in the second half. Against the Giants, you can win. But against real teams? The Lions also likely won't have the benefit of home-field advantage for much of the playoffs, even if they win the NFC North (and they're still a game behind). The offense looks much different outdoors than it does on the fast track of Ford Field or against other domed opponents, so having to go outside for a playoff game in, say, Philly, could prove difficult. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Denver Broncos: Inconsistent offenseLike the Eagles, the Broncos have one of the NFL's best defenses -- a unit that can reach a higher ceiling than almost any in the league. That's especially true when Denver has Patrick Surtain II healthy so that the secondary can complement the pass rush. But good lord, does the offense go through stretches where it just looks totally inept, even in games that the Broncos eventually win. It always seems like they have to pull a rabbit out of their collective hats to find enough offense to come away with a victory. To their credit, they have actually done that quite often so far this season, with several fourth-quarter comebacks to their name. But that's a really hard way to live, especially when you don't have the advantage at quarterback.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo Bills: Defense, especially vs. the runThe Bills seemingly just can't stop offenses from running the ball down their throats. Buffalo has given up 100-plus rushing yards in nine of 11 games and 180-plus rushing yards in five of them. They haven't been quite as statistically vulnerable against the pass, but that's at least partially because opponents are clocking them to the tune of 5.3 yards per carry and a league-high 17 touchdowns on the ground. Why risk throwing the ball any more than you need to? The Bills are and have been dealing with injury issues along the defensive front, and that remains a concern going forward, because it's not like they're suddenly going to get a ton of reinforcements that turn them into an elite or even good unit against the run. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore Ravens: Lamar Jackson's hamstringJackson is back on the field, but he has not looked anything remotely like himself over the four weeks since he returned from the hamstring strain that kept him for Weeks 5 through 8. In four games, Jackson has completed 62% of his passes at 7.3 yards per attempt, with five touchdowns against two interceptions. He's taken nine sacks. But he has run just 25 times for only 71 yards. That is not the Lamar Jackson we know, folks. It's just not. He's healthy enough to play and so we have to judge him on that, but if he's going to look like this for the rest of the year, the Ravens are not going far in the playoffs even if they do manage to win the AFC North. They need his health to take a significant step forward so that he can do the things he does best. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New England Patriots: Offensive lineThe group up front for the Pats was already kind of hanging on by a threat, even before this past Sunday. Drake Maye has been sacked more than any quarterback in the NFL not named Cam Ward, and he's been pressured on nearly 39% of his dropbacks. Now, the entire left side of the offensive line might be out for a while after both Will Campbell and Jared Wilson got hurt against the Bengals. That should also hurt the Pats in the run game, where they are already averaging the fifth-fewest yards before contact per rush of any team in the league, per TruMedia. Maye is fantastic but he can't do everything by himself. He and the backs could be under siege for a few weeks while the line gets healthy, and even if it does, that might not be enough.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Green Bay Packers: Injuries on offenseGreen Bay has also tended to play down to the level of its competition this year, so that was in consideration for its potential Achilles' heel here, but we have to go with this instead. The Packers look like an entirely different offense without star tight end Tucker Kraft, who was their most explosive weapon in the passing game. Plus, Josh Jacobs has been dealing with multiple injuries throughout this season and simply has not looked the same as he did during his first year with the team. The offensive line has been shuffling thanks to injuries all year long. And Jayden Reed still isn't back from injured reserve. Reed's return should help, whenever it happens, but there might be too much wrong elsewhere for the Packers to overcome.\n            ",

The English side, after losing the opening away game against Bayern Munich, won twice against Benfica and Ajax before an away draw at Qarabag, currently sitting in 12th place with seven points. Barcelona followed a similar path, sitting in 11th place with seven points after beating Newcastle, losing to PSG, then producing a 6–1 win over Olympiacos and a 3–3 draw away to Club Brugge. Tuesday's match will also be the first time Lamine Yamal plays in England in an official match as he missed the away match against Newcastle due to his ongoing groin pain. He will face Estevao, Chelsea's top scorer in the Champions League this season with two goals, scoring in each of his first two starts in the competition. He could become the second youngest player to score in each of his first three Champions League starts.

    "body": "\n        As players were being introduced ahead of Unrivaled action on Sunday, three-time WNBA champion Breanna Stewart held up a sign that said \"Abolish ICE,\" when her name was called. Stewart's action comes in the wake of federal immigration officers killing a 37-year-old man, Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis on Saturday. Earlier this month, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good in Minneapolis, sparking protests across the city, and other across the country, calling for ICE to be abolished.After the game on Sunday, Stewart expanded on her decision to hold up the sign.\"Really all day yesterday, I was just disgusted from everything that you see on Instagram and in the news,\" Stewart said. \"Everyone here [at Unrivaled] is feeling that way, one way or another. We're so fueled by hate right now instead of love, so I wanted to have a simple message of 'Abolish ICE,' which means having policies to uplift families and communities instead of fueling fear and violence.\"Stewart also shared her personal connection to this specific issue, as her wife, Marta Xargay Casademont, is not a U.S. citizen as she's from Spain.\n\"It's scary,\" Stewart said. \"You see it on social media, you see it splitting up families and dissecting communities and kids are being involved. It's the worst in all ways. And to be married to Marta ... we're working to get her citizenship, and she is a legal permanent resident and all of that. But it seems like it doesn't matter. And I think that that's why these policies need to be put in place, that reform needs to happen, because it doesn't seem to be affecting the right people. It's not helping anybody.\"Unrivaled held a moment of silence before Saturday's games, with the public address announcer saying, \"Our thoughts and support are with everyone affected, and we send our deepest sympathies to those who have lost a loved one.\"While Stewart has made the most public statement on ICE and the recent tragedies happening in Minneapolis, she isn't the only member of Unrivaled or the WNBA to share the same sentiments. Minnesota native and 2025 No. 1 overall pick Paige Bueckers pledged to match the $50,000 she won in Unrivaled's free-throw challenge to donate to the Hopkins Strong Relief Fund, which aids with food security in Minnesota.\nWNBPA executive committee member Brianna Turner took to social media to share similar sentiments about ICE.\"My thoughts are constantly with the [Minnesota] residents who are suffering through a politically motivated ICE invasion,\" Turner wrote on social media. \"There is nothing positive about improperly trained federal agents profiling individuals & antagonizing communities. If it can happen there, it can happen anywhere.\"WNBA players are no stranger to speaking up on matters like these. In 2020, they were at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement amongst athletes. This has been no different.\n\"I think doing whatever you can to help your community [is important],\" Stewart said. \"Obviously, Minnesota is the place that everyone's seeing is in crisis, but it's happening in many more cities than just one, and knowing the right people to reach out to -- your local council person, your mayor, your governor -- and really advocating to change the policies and advocating for reform, knowing that it's not going to happen overnight.Stewart continued.\"But how many times do we have to see it happen over and over and over again and using our platform to make sure that we're trying to make a change and a difference and hopefully save a life.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL has officially tabbed veteran Shawn Smith to serve as the referee for Super Bowl LX, which will feature the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots facing off on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium. The 54-year-old Smith is finishing up his 11th season in the league. He started in the NFL as an umpire in 2015 before being promoted to referee in 2018. Smith has already worked one postseason game this year, and that came in the divisional round when he served as the referee for the Patriots' 28-16 win over the Texans. That was the only time this year that he served as a ref for New England. As for Seattle, he hasn't officiated a Seahawks' game since October 2024. Overall, Smith has been the ref for a total of 10 postseason games in his career, but this is the first time that he's been put in charge of the Super Bowl. All of his previous playoff experience has come in either the wild card round (five games), divisional round (three games) or conference title round (two games). This will mark just the second time over the past eight Super Bowls that the NFL has assigned a ref to the game who as never handled a Super Bowl before. The last time it happened came with Ron Torbert in Super Bowl LVI, which was a game that the Rams won over the Bengals. If you're wondering how the Seahawks and Patriots have fared with Smith, here's a look at their record with him over the past five years (stats via Pro Football Reference). \nSeahawks: 3-3 (0-0 in 2025)Patriots: 4-2 (1-0 in 2025)As we mentioned above, the Seahawks didn't see Smith a single time during the 2025 season. The last time he was assigned to a Seattle game came back in Week 6 of the 2024 season on a day where the Seahawks lost to the Giants, 29-20. One notable thing about Smith that fans will probably appreciate is that his crew averaged just 13.94 flags per game in 2025. Of the 17 officiating crews in the NFL, Smith's crew was one of six that averaged under 14 flags per game, according to NFLPenalties.com. Of course, Smith won't be working with his normal crew, so it's possible that number will be slightly different.Speaking of Smith's crew, the NFL assembles an all-star cast of the highest-graded officials of each postseason game, including the Super Bowl. The rest of Smith's crew for the game will be umpire Roy Ellison, down judge Dana McKenzie, line judge Julian Mapp, side judge Boris Cheek, field judge Jason Ledet, back judge Greg Steed and replay official Andrew Lambert.\nThis will be the fourth Super Bowl for both Ellison and Hall, so although Smith will be officiating his first Super Bowl, he'll certainly have some experienced help. Steed (third Super Bowl) and McKenzie (second Super Bowl) will also bring some big game experience to the crew.  \n            ",

There were plenty of surprises in this matchup, whether it was the 17 total points scored or how the weather went from beautiful to a nightmarish blizzard in the second half. It was actually a surprise that secured the game for the Patriots, as quarterback Drake Maye went rogue on a third-and-5 to move the chains and run out the clock late in the fourth quarter. According to The Boston Herald, Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels called an outside zone run for Rhamondre Stevenson on third down with 1:57 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Patriots held a three-point lead, and their defense was playing well -- holding Denver scoreless since the first quarter. Instead of handing the ball to Stevenson, Maye kept it and ran out to the left -- beating the Broncos defense for a first down. \"I hit my block, and all the defenders started running the other way,\" Patriots center Garrett Bradbury said. \"I'm like, 'What? Oh my God.'\"\nMaye told his teammates after the game that he debated telling them he was going to keep the ball. He decided against it. \n\"After the game, Drake's like, 'I debated telling you guys if I was gonna (keep) it or not. But I just decided not to,\" Bradbury said.Maye completed 10 of 21 passes for 86 yards on Sunday, becoming just the second quarterback since 1990 to win a conference championship game while throwing for under 100 yards, the other being Jimmy Garoppolo in 2019. However, Maye made an impact with his legs, rushing 10 times for 65 yards and the Patriots' lone touchdown of the game.\nThanks to Maye's gamble, the Patriots find themselves in the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019.\n            \n    ",

On Sunday, Feb. 8, the AFC champion New England Patriots will do battle with the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks for the right to raise the Lombardi Trophy.New England advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2018 season thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. The Patriots won a sloppy, snowy AFC title game over a Broncos team starting its backup quarterback, emerging with a 10-7 win thanks to several Denver miscues, some well-timed runs from Drake Maye and an electric performance from a defense that has stepped up in a big way during this playoff run.Seattle is headed back to the Super Bowl for the first time since making it in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks. They won a thrilling, back-and-forth NFC title game on the strength of a fantastic performance from Sam Darnold, who slayed some demons by throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the 31-27 victory.Which of these two teams will emerge victorious and hoist the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough. But in the meantime, here's a look at how you can actually watch the game.Where to watch Super Bowl 2026Date: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC | Stream: fubo (try for free)Halftime performer: Bad BunnyFollow: CBS Sports App\nFind all of our Super Bowl LX coverage at CBSSports.com right here.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Vanderbilt suffered its first loss of the season at the hands of South Carolina on Sunday afternoon, with the No. 2 Gamecocks dominating the No. 5 Commodores, 103-74.Vanderbilt came into the game 20-0, which was the best start in program history, and the Commodores were one of the last two undefeated teams remaining in women's college basketball. The only one still standing is No. 1 UConn, the reigning national champions.\"We have won 20 games,\" Vanderbilt coach Shea Ralph told reporters postgame. \"We're 20-1. The world is not ending. We are going to be fine.\"\nFive Gamecocks scored in double figures, led by Ta'Niya Latson and Tessa Johnson, who combined for 41 points. Mikayla Blakes led Vanderbilt's effort with 23 points, which marked her 16th 20+ point game of the season.\nSouth Carolina was bouncing back from a 94-82 overtime loss to Oklahoma earlier in the week. Dawn Staley's program has not lost back-to-back games since the 2018-19 season and Sunday's result helped the Gamecocks keep that streak going. They moved the ball well with 25 assists, more than double the 12 they had in the loss to the Sooners. The Gamecocks were able to speed up Vanderbilt, which helped them get 24 points off 16 turnovers in the first half. This put the Commodores in an unusual situation since they entered the game only averaging 12.5 turnovers per game. Vanderbilt finished the game with 20 turnovers that led to 32 South Carolina points.\nSouth Carolina held a 55-44 lead at the break, with 28 of those points coming from the paint. By the end of the night, the Gamecocks had won the battle in the paint 56-24. However, their shots were also working from elsewhere as they had 10 3-pointers, which is more than their 5.9 per game average this season.\nRalph said she was surprised by her team's poor defensive performance, which she described as an \"absolute disaster.\" Mental strength and staying locked in even when they are down is also something the coach wants to see from her team as they move forward.\"At points in the game it looked like we quit,\" she said. \"That can't be who we are.\"This was the Gamecocks' 5th win against a ranked opponent this season, while Vanderbilt has two. Both teams still have plenty of time to add more quality wins before March because the SEC is impressively deep with nine teams ranked in the AP Top 25 this week.\nUp next, South Carolina will hit the road to take on Auburn on Thursday. That same night, Vanderbilt will have a chance to bounce back with a road matchup against No. 18 Ole Miss.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The big markets and the contenders have all been getting their ducks in a row with Giannis Antetokounmpo trade speculation continuing to swirl out of Milwaukee. Will the Bucks' (currently injured) star force his way to the New York Knicks? Will a desperate, fading contender like the Warriors or Heat nudge their way into the proceedings? Will one of the younger, asset-rich Western Conference juggernauts like the Spurs or Rockets cast their lot with the two-time MVP?We still don't know yet. We don't even know if Antetokounmpo's most recent injury coupled with Milwaukee's downward spiral (the Bucks are 18-26 and outside of the play-in picture in the East with 10 days before the trade deadline) will lead to a trade before Feb 5. But there's something we can say with relative confidence. No matter how this shakes out, no matter where Antetokounmpo is playing after the deadline or next season, there is one team set to benefit from all of this chaos, and it's not one of the big markets or contenders trying to get Giannis himself. It's the team that gave Antetokounmpo a co-star three years ago: the Portland Trail Blazers.Why? Because there are no future draft picks more valuable to a rebuilding team than its own. The Bucks can't tank post-Antetokounmpo without controlling their own picks. Portland controls most of Milwaukee's outgoing draft assets, and according to Jake Fischer, the Trail Blazers are interested in using those picks to swoop into an Antetokounmpo deal and improve their team. That won't happen through actually acquiring Antetokounmpo. He doesn't appear to want to play in Portland. But the Blazers can get better by working as a third team to pull assets that the Blazers want off the team acquiring Giannis.Thanks to the 2023 Damian Lillard trade, the Blazers stand to benefit if the Bucks trade Giannis in 2026. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Let's lay out exactly what Portland is working with here. Milwaukee owes control of its next five first-round picks to other teams. Its 2026 pick is tied to the New Orleans Pelicans, with the better of those two selections headed to Atlanta. The Hawks will certainly benefit if Milwaukee jumps up in the lottery, but in all likelihood, both Atlanta and Milwaukee are winding up with valuable lottery picks. The Pelicans control the highest-upside outcomes for Milwaukee's 2027 pick, however, as it is once again tied to the Hawks. New Orleans gets the higher picks between the Pelicans and Bucks next season. Atlanta gets the lower one, provided the picks don't both land in the top four. The Pelicans won't dangle the more favorable of those two picks back to the Bucks after the debacle  that giving away an unprotected 2026 pick turned out to be, so it's unlikely any Antetokounmpo trade reverts Bucks draft control back to Milwaukee in the next two years.\nHowever, the Portland Trail Blazers largely control Milwaukee's first-round picks between 2028 and 2030 thanks to the 2023 Damian Lillard trade. We say \"largely\" because there are some caveats we need to cover. Let's go year-by-year here:In 2030, Portland has the right to swap first-round picks with Milwaukee. Very straightforward. No more information needed.In 2029, Portland will receive Milwaukee's unprotected first-round pick. However, it is also set to receive Boston's. Between Milwaukee's, Boston's and its own, Portland was initially set to have three 2029 first-round picks. However, in the Deni Avdija trade, they gave away the second-most favorable of the three. Therefore, while Portland couldn't guarantee Milwaukee its own pick back, it could still trade the Bucks the most favorable of those three picks. That would give the Bucks room to tank because Milwaukee would either keep its own high lottery pick or get a better one.In 2028, things are extremely complicated. Portland has the right to swap first-round picks with Milwaukee. However, it can't simply renounce its right to a swap in a trade because Washington also has the right to swap first-round picks with Milwaukee, with the caveat that it would receive the less favorable of Milwaukee's and Portland's picks (thanks to the Kyle Kuzma trade). This means that in order for Milwaukee to get control of its 2028 first-round pick back, Portland would have to trade the Bucks their own pick in full. This would give Milwaukee both its own pick and Portland's to work with, allowing the Bucks to keep the more favorable and send the less favorable to the Wizards. But there's yet another issue we have to address here, and that's the lottery-protected 2026 pick Portland owes Chicago. Why is that relevant? Because it remains lottery-protected in 2027 and 2028. Therefore, there's an unlikely but plausible scenario in which Portland misses the playoffs in 2026 and 2027 and then makes the playoffs in 2028. In that scenario, Portland wouldn't have a pick to swap with Milwaukee, meaning it would lose its swap rights entirely, allowing Washington the right to swap with Milwaukee unprotected. To avert this crisis scenario, Portland and Milwaukee would have to pay Chicago off to get control of that lottery-protected pick back. That's probably doable. It's a lottery-protected pick, after all, so it's not especially valuable. The Bulls would just have to be compensated in some other way.Got all that? Here's the short version: Portland could give Milwaukee control over its 2030 pick tomorrow, as well as functional control over its 2029 pick. There would be hoops to jump through in 2028, but it's doable if the parties involved are motivated enough. Basically, the Blazers couldn't give the Bucks the ability to tank in the next few years, but it could shorten the misery of its upcoming pick-less period.This makes the Trail Blazers a key potential facilitator in any possible Antetokounmpo trade. Any team interested in trading for him should be in touch with Portland about potentially getting the Bucks some of those picks back.\nFischer already offered one potential solution, citing longstanding Portland interest in Knicks forward Mikal Bridges. The Knicks are the one team Antetokounmpo is known to have expressed interest in, and the Bucks, presumably going young after Antetokounmpo, wouldn't have much reason to keep Bridges. That creates a straightforward three-team alignment: New York gets Antetokounmpo, Portland gets Bridges, Milwaukee gets a bunch of other stuff from the Knicks or a possible fourth team along with some of its own picks back from Portland. Some version of this scenario could play out with any other interested parties. If Miami's in the mix, maybe Portland could swoop in and try to nab promising young big man Kel'El Ware.\nPortland wouldn't even necessarily need to focus on players. Say Golden State is in the mix for Antetokounmpo. It might just benefit Portland to diversify its portfolio of future draft assets. Say the Warriors offer the Bucks full control over their next seven drafts: four picks, three swaps. Could the Blazers turn around and offer the Bucks one of their own picks back in exchange for two years of Golden State control? Probably, yeah, at least depending on which years they target.The obvious question here becomes... if Milwaukee's picks are so valuable, why would Portland give them up? It's a valid concern. Milwaukee's picks have quite a bit of upside in the post-Antetokounmpo era. But they are uniquely valuable to Milwaukee, specifically, because they are the picks Milwaukee controls. To the Blazers, they're something of a mystery box. They could assume Milwaukee will be bad in 2028, 2029 and 2030, and they might be right. Or, they might wind up in the situation Houston is currently eyeing in Phoenix. The Rockets have draft control over the Suns in 2027 and 2029. Over the summer, those picks looked like some of the best in all of basketball. Now, the Suns are a possible playoff team. Building a true championship contender is hard. Building a competitive team? Not so much. Trading away some of Milwaukee's draft control would be a hedge against the Bucks being at least competent later in the decade. We've got a long way to go until 2030, after all.\nThe Rockets are instructive here in another regard. When the Nets traded Bridges to the Knicks, they traded for control of their own picks in 2025 and 2026 in the process. There was a hidden genius in that trade that may only really become clear in a year. Houston also controlled Brooklyn's pick in 2027. By giving the Nets control of their 2025 and 2026 picks back, the Rockets gave the Nets incentive to be bad in 2025 and 2026. In the process, they reasoned it would be more difficult for Brooklyn to get good in time for 2027. By giving away some of their Brooklyn picks, they strengthened the one that remained. Portland could aim to do something similar with Milwaukee: give the Bucks a reason to be bad during the broad period in which it controls their drafts, but retain control over at least one of those picks in order to benefit.Portland has shown no appetite for an extended tank. The Blazers haven't picked higher than No. 7 since trading Lillard to Milwaukee in 2023, and they hit the fast-forward button last offseason when they traded for Jrue Holiday. Portland wants to get competitive quickly. The Blazers are already a .500 team, and their approach to roster-building suggests that if they can take advantage of this drama in Milwaukee to add talent now, they're going to do so. We may not know where Antetokounmpo himself is going to wind up, nor do we know when a trade could happen, but when the inevitable deal does come, it seems like there's a good chance the Portland Trail Blazers will somehow be involved and benefitting from Milwaukee's downfall.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The bad weather in Denver appeared to have thrown off a key field goal attempt for the Broncos on Sunday, and it might have cost them the game.During New England's 10-7 win, Broncos kicker Wil Lutz missed two field goals, with the most critical coming in the fourth quarter. With just under five minutes left to play, the Broncos were facing a fourth-and-5 from New England's 28-yard line, so Sean Payton sent Lutz out for a 45-yard attempt.The kick missed after it was blocked by New England's Leonard Taylor. According to Lutz, Broncos holder Jeremy Crawshaw may have lined up a yard closer to the line of scrimmage than he should have.\"Unfortunately, you couldn't see the lines on the field and honestly, I think we were … we might have been a yard short on the snap,\" Lutz said via Denver Sports. \"Can't see the lines on the field and we had to kind of estimate, and a guy comes through, and it was blocked.\"With the snow making it difficult to see, Crawshaw essentially had to estimate his spot, and he ended up a yard off.\nAs you can see above, Taylor was only able to get his fingertips on the ball, so if Crawshaw had lined up another yard back, Lutz's kick likely would have had enough height to clear Taylor's hand. In the NFL, the holder is usually lined up about eight yards behind the line of scrimmage, but Crawshaw was only seven yards back.Lutz missed two field goals on what was a disastrous day for kickers. New England's Andy Borregales also missed two attempts. The four combined misses were the most in a conference title game since 1983, when San Francisco and Washington combined to miss six kicks in the NFC Championship.Besides the 45-yarder, Lutz also missed a 54-yard attempt in the first half before the weather turned. He was reliable for the Broncos this year, hitting 28 of 32 field goals, but he has a history of struggling in the playoffs. Over his career, Lutz has made just 68.2% of his postseason field goal attempts (15 of 22).\nIf the fourth-quarter kick hadn't been blocked, there's a good chance the game would have gone to overtime, because neither team moved the ball much in the second half. And if it had reached overtime, every field goal attempt would have been an adventure in those conditions. Instead, Lutz's kick was denied, and the Patriots are now headed to the Super Bowl for the 12th time in franchise history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Philip Rivers' brief emergence in the Buffalo Bills' head coaching search came to an abrupt end. Rivers withdrew his name from consideration, ending what was shaping up to be one of the more unexpected late developments of the NFL coaching cycle, according to NFL Network.The former NFL quarterback generated buzz after interviewing with Buffalo for its vacant head coaching job last Friday, a position that opened following the firing of Sean McDermott after the Bills' divisional round loss. For Rivers, the interview marked his first known step toward an NFL head coaching role, following an unconventional post-playing path that included a late-season return to the field with the Indianapolis Colts in December and his current role as a high school coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic.Rivers' candidacy drew attention less because of his résumé and more because of what he represents. A longtime NFL quarterback, he brought the perspective of a player who spent nearly two decades inside NFL offenses. Buffalo is widely believed to be prioritizing an offensive-minded coach to guide quarterback Josh Allen, and with the 2024 NFL MVP reportedly involved in the interview process, Rivers' ability to speak quarterback-to-quarterback was viewed as a natural connection point.That background is built on a long playing career. Rivers spent 16 seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers after being drafted by the franchise in 2004, becoming one of the most consistent quarterbacks of his generation and a fixture near the top of the league's passing statistics year after year. He later played one season with the Indianapolis Colts in 2020 before retiring, stepping away from the NFL for five years and being named a semifinalist for the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class in November.\nThat retirement ended unexpectedly late in the 2025 season, when Rivers returned to the Colts in December after injuries hit their quarterback room. In three starts, he threw for 544 yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions, as the Colts went 0-3 in those games.With Rivers now out of the picture, Buffalo's search turns back to those coaches with established NFL play-calling experience. Other coaches who have been linked to the Bills' head coaching job include former Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady, former New York Giants coach Brian Daboll and Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski.Rivers' withdrawal doesn't appear to signal the end of his interest in coaching at the professional level, but it does suggest that this opening -- and this moment -- wasn't the right fit.\nRivers focused on family since his initial retirement, coaching at his son Gunner's high school in Alabama. Gunner, a four-star recruit in the Class of 2027 and ranked as the No. 5 quarterback nationally by 247Sports, gives Rivers the opportunity to mentor him and stay closely involved in the lives of his other nine children.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Motor sports have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years, which has brought mainstream sports fans to F1 betting and NASCAR betting through pop culture. We'll take a look at how sportsbooks operate when it comes to motor sports, how bettors can wager on racing events and go over some of the best strategies and tips when it comes to racing betting.Finding the best sportsbook promos for motor sports bettingHere's a look at some of the promotions going on at top sportsbooks for fans interested in getting into motors ports betting.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsFirst Bet Matched up to $250 as a Bonus Bet, Win or LoseCBSSPORTS250BMBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanaticsBet and Get Up To $2,000 in Bet Insurance FanCashCBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 are all offering \"bet and get\" promotions where users get bonus bets after wagering $5 or more. FanDuel and DraftKings require a user's first bet to win, while bet365 provides bonus bets regardless of the outcome of the qualifying bet.BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook are also giving out bonus bets, but in a different way. BetMGM covers a user's first bet up to $1,500 with bonus bets if that first bet loses, but users must wager at least $1,500 to be eligible for the full amount. Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook offers a first bet match up to $250 as a bonus bet, win or lose. The first bet must have minimum -500 odds. Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook that consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingNetflix's \"Drive to Survive,\" NASCAR's Chicago Street Race and big-budget films like Ford v. Ferrari and F1: The Movie have brought a new audience to racing, and that means more action when it comes to racing betting. Arguably the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Hamilton finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there are season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks which correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track, which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed, and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The confetti has fallen at the AFC Championship Game in Denver and the NFC Championship Game in Seattle, and we now have our Super Bowl LX matchup: the AFC's second-seeded New England Patriots against the NFC's top-seeded Seattle Seahawks.When the two teams take the field at Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8, it will mark the first Super Bowl in NFL history in which both starting quarterbacks (the Patriots' Drake Maye and the Seahawks' Sam Darnold) and both head coaches (the Patriots' Mike Vrabel and the Seahawks' Mike Macdonald) are in either their first or second season with their respective teams, per CBS Sports Research.Maye versus Darnold will also be just the third Super Bowl matchup in the past 40 years in which both quarterbacks entered the season with no playoff wins, joining the 1999 season's Kurt Warner vs. Steve McNair and the 2021 season's Matthew Stafford vs. Joe Burrow.The Patriots franchise returned for its NFL-record 12th Super Bowl appearance as the first team to reach the big game after a 13-plus loss season. (New England went 4-13 in 2024.) The Seahawks broke through for their fourth Super Bowl appearance and first since Super Bowl XLIX against the Patriots in 2014.\nNew England made it rain in free agency, signing wide receiver Stefon Diggs, cornerback Carlton Davis, defensive lineman Milton Williams and edge rusher Harold Landry, while also drafting offensive lineman Will Campbell fourth overall. Those moves helped lift the Patriots back to the Super Bowl six seasons after Tom Brady's departure to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Seattle also reshaped its roster, swapping out Geno Smith for Sam Darnold at quarterback, elevating Jaxon Smith-Njigba to the WR1 spot after trading DK Metcalf to the Pittsburgh Steelers, and signing Pro Bowl edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence and former Super Bowl MVP wide receiver Cooper Kupp in free agency. The changes helped the Seahawks reach Super Bowl heights once again.So what will happen in Super Bowl LX between the Patriots and Seahawks? Enjoy an early breakdown and prediction to kick off your two-week wait for the big game.\nWhere to watch Super Bowl 2026Date: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -4.5, O/U 46.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)The old adage that \"defense wins championships\" doesn't always ring true, but it certainly has in the 2025 NFL season. Seattle finished with the league's No. 1 scoring defense in the regular season (17.2 points per game), while New England wasn't far behind, allowing 18.8 points per game, the fourth-fewest in the NFL.New England played a bend-but-don't-break style with the NFL's eighth-best total defense, allowing just 295.2 yards per game. Seattle's unit was led by both a top-10 pass rush (47 sacks, tied for the seventh-most) and a top-10 coverage group (77.9 passer rating allowed, fourth-best).Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald's defense could pose a litany of problems for Maye, the Patriots' 2025 second-team All-Pro quarterback, particularly when it comes to pass protection. Maye became the first quarterback ever to be sacked at least five times in three games in a single postseason, taking exactly five sacks in each AFC playoff game. \nHaving a leaky offensive line could doom him against 2025 second-team All-Pro defensive tackle Leonard Williams, Pro Bowl edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence, 2025 second-team All-Pro linebacker Ernest Jones and 2025 second-team All-Pro cornerback Devon Witherspoon. Patriots left tackle Will Campbell, the fourth overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, has endured plenty of rookie struggles in these playoffs. His three sacks allowed and nine quarterback pressures allowed are both the most in the NFL this postseason.Darnold led the league in turnovers with 20 in the regular season, but like Patriots archnemesis Eli Manning in 2007, he's found another level in the playoffs. Darnold has played turnover-free football through Seattle's divisional round and NFC title game wins, throwing for 470 total yards and four touchdowns while completing 69.8% of his passes (37 of 53).Now, he has a shot to complete a Manning-like path with a victory over the Patriots in the Super Bowl. Smith-Njigba, who led the NFL with 1,793 receiving yards in 2025, is clearly Seattle's go-to target, but he'll have a worthy adversary in Patriots Pro Bowl cornerback Christian Gonzalez in Super Bowl LX.\nEarly Super Bowl 2026 prediction\nMaye and the Patriots winning three consecutive playoff games despite him absorbing five sacks in each one is a historic anomaly. Maye joined Tony Eason (1986) and Craig Krenzel (2004) as the only quarterbacks since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to win three straight games while taking five or more sacks in each, per CBS Sports Research.In Eason's case, his three-game streak of luck -- also with the Patriots -- came to an end with a 31-7 regular-season loss to the Cincinnati Bengals after he took six sacks in Week 14 of the 1986 season. As for Krenzel, a 41-10 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 11 of the 2004 season followed his three-game run, and he took four sacks that day.Maye overcoming that level of poor pass protection for a fourth straight game to emerge victorious would be a historic first, and that just won't happen against the Seahawks' No. 1 scoring defense. Seattle wins Super Bowl LX by multiple possessions.\nEarly pick: Seahawks 27, Patriots 13 | Seahawks -4.5, Under 46.5    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos' season ended just short of reaching Super Bowl LX after falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. This was the latest gut punch for a franchise that limped into this conference title matchup. The high of winning a divisional round thriller against the Buffalo Bills in overtime was almost instantly shattered once word got out that Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury. That thrust backup Jarrett Stidham into the limelight, and while the veteran had his moments, he couldn't get his team to pull off what would've been a miraculous upset. Now, Sean Payton's club is looking into the abyss of the offseason and on the precipice of doing a postmortem of the 2025 season. By most accounts, it was a wildly successful campaign, owning a 14-3 record over the regular season, which was good enough for an NFC West title and the No. 1 seed. As they look to begin preparing for the 2026 season, let's highlight what's on the horizon for the organization. Bo Nix's recovery takes center stage\nNix suffered a broken right ankle in the final moments of that overtime win against the Bills. The second-year quarterback has already undergone surgery to repair the ankle, with the procedure done this week. The early prognosis was that Nix is expected to be sidelined for 12 weeks. If he stays on that recovery timeline, Nix should only miss a small amount of OTAs (if any) and certainly be on track to participate during mandatory minicamp later this spring. That gives Nix plenty of time to get into form before Denver opens up training camp, so this injury is not debilitating enough that it'll bleed into 2026. Does the coaching staff lose key figures?Payton has been able to bring the Broncos back to relevance, but that success may soon result in key figures on his coaching staff being poached. With Denver now eliminated, teams looking for a head coach can now hold in-person interviews with Broncos staffers, including defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and offensive pass game coordinator Davis Webb. Both Joseph and Webb have been popular candidates this hiring cycle, and it would not be shocking to see one or both coaches depart in short order. \nWebb has interest from the Las Vegas Raiders and Buffalo Bills, and neither of those destinations has filled their vacancy to this point. Webb also interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens, but the franchise recently hired former Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter. While Payton calls the offensive plays, having someone of Webb's acumen departing is hardly ideal for a still-developing offense under Nix. As for Joseph, he has been requested by a large contingent of teams. While some of those organizations have since filled their roles, the Raiders and Arizona Cardinals are two clubs that have expressed interest in Joseph and are still on the hunt for a new coach. Joseph's potential exit could prove to be the biggest X factor of Denver's offseason. A big piece as to why the Broncos made it to the AFC Championship was due to Joseph orchestrating arguably the best defense in the NFL. Denver was fourth in the NFL in scoring and first in the NFL in sacks (including postseason). If Joseph leaves, there's the risk that the unit takes a slight step back. \nBolstering offense around NixA couple of the areas the Broncos should look to address this offseason come on the offensive side of the ball. Specifically, they need to continue surrounding Nix with talent at the skill positions. This season, the Broncos ranked 28th in the NFL in yards per reception from the wide receiver and tight end positions combined. Courtland Sutton was able to lead the team with 1,017 yards receiving, but Denver did struggle to find a top secondary pass-catching option, volleying from Troy Franklin to Pat Bryant to Marvin Mims at receiver. They also never truly got Evan Engram off the ground as Payton's \"Joker\" at the tight end spot. \nMoreover, Denver need to bolster the backfield. The rushing attack cratered after J.K. Dobbins went down with a foot injury in Week 10. Rookie RJ Harvey averaged just 3.7 yards per carry on the year. Their inability to run the football effectively came back to bite them in the AFC Championship, where they averaged just 3.3 yards per rush as a team. With a backup quarterback under center and snowy conditions late in the contest, a capable ground attack could've helped them pull off the upset. Instead, that deficiency helped be their undoing. With Dobbins looking at free agency this offseason, along with a shaky injury history, Denver would be wise to add a back in some capacity this offseason. Offseason assets, free agentsNotable free agents:DL John Franklin-MyersLB Alex SingletonRB J.K. DobbinsS P.J. LockeJa'Quan McMillan (restricted)The Broncos are projected to have roughly $35.4 million in available salary cap space, which is the 12th highest in the NFL.  As for the NFL Draft, Denver has five picks inside the first four rounds, including their own first-round pick.\n            ",

That was the case this season for the Washington Commanders, who went from the doorstep of the Super Bowl to having the seventh overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft by virtue of their 5-12 record in 2025. Washington certainly wasn't hoping for that decline, and neither are the 12 teams whose seasons ended during the this year's postseason in 2026. While no one plans to have a down year, it's inevitable that at least a few teams each season will succumb to injuries, close calls, late-game collapses, etc. For teams like the Bears, it may come down to the ball simply taking a few unfavorable bounces after a season where things largely went their way. Conversely, there are those teams that -- somehow, someway -- find themselves in the playoffs year after year while keeping their Super Bowl window ajar. Lately, that team in the AFC has been the Bills, while the NFC's 49ers have made the playoffs four out of the last five years. Which losing playoff teams have the best shot at getting to next year's Super Bowl? See for yourself, as we've ranked each team from worst to first. \n** -- 2025 playoff teams\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    12. Carolina Panthers 2025 Record: 8-9 (1st in NFC South) 2026 opponents: Buccaneers, Falcons, Saints, Lions, **Bears, Ravens, Bengals, **Seahawks, **Broncos, Vikings, **Packers, **Steelers, Browns, **Eagles One of the NFL's feel-good stories in 2025, it's safe to say that the Panthers will be hard-pressed to have similar success in 2026. For staters, they'll face a significantly tougher schedule next year that includes a half-dozen teams that made the playoffs a year ago. Carolina's success next year will largely depend on whether or not Bryce Young can take another leap this offseason. The Panthers could aid Young's development by getting him a wideout who can complement Tetairoa McMillan, whose 1,014 receiving yards last season was 620 more than Carolina's next leading receiver, Jalen Coker. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    11. Pittsburgh Steelers 2025 Record: 10-7 (1st in AFC North) 2026 opponents: Ravens, Bengals, Browns, Falcons, **Panthers, **Broncos, **Texans, Colts, **Jaguars, **Patriots, Saints, **Eagles, Buccaneers, Titans The Steelers never had a losing season under Mike Tomlin, but that might change under new head coach Mike McCarthy. By virtue of winning the AFC North, the Steelers will face six teams that made the playoffs in 2025. They'll also face two of the NFL's hottest teams at the end of the 2025 regular season in Atlanta and New Orleans. \nOnce again, quarterback will be Pittsburgh's biggest question mark heading into the offseason. If Aaron Rodgers comes back, that'll give the Steelers a puncher's chance at making the playoffs. But even in that scenario, it doesn't look very promising for Pittsburgh as the North (assuming Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow are healthy) should be a much tougher division in 2026. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Green Bay Packers 2025 record: 9-7-1 (2nd in NFC North) 2026 opponents: **Bears, Lions, Vikings, Falcons, **Bills, **Panthers, Dolphins, **Texans, Cowboys, **Patriots, Saints, Jets, Buccaneers, **Rams Like Pittsburgh, Green Bay will have to face two emerging teams in Atlanta and New Orleans. Their 2026 schedule also includes games against six playoff teams. While they did make the playoffs, 2025 was a disappointing season for the Packers that led to questions about Matt LaFleur's future before he was given a contract extension. Green Bay started 9-3-1 before Micah Parsons' season-ending injury sent the season in a tailspin. The Packers then lost defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and have replaced him with former Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Houston Texans2025 record: 12-5 (2nd AFC South)2026 opponents: Colts, **Jaguars, Titans, Ravens, Bengals, **Bills, Cowboys, Giants, Browns, **Steelers, **Chargers, **Eagles, Commanders, **Packers After an 0-3 start, the Texans rallied to finish the regular season with a 12-5 record. They then crushed the Steelers in the playoffs -- the franchise's first road playoff win -- before running out of steam against the Patriots in the divisional round. The Texans' defense was elite last season, but C.J. Stroud's struggles in the playoffs led to Houston's season ending in the divisional round for a third straight year. It's very possible that the Texans will miss the playoffs altogether in 2026 unless Houston gets more consistent play from Stroud. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Los Angeles Chargers 2025 record: 11-6 (2nd in AFC West)2026 opponents: **Broncos, Chiefs, Raiders, **Bills, Dolphins, Ravens, **Seahawks, **Rams, Buccaneers, Browns, **Packers, Vikings, **Steelers After a 3-0 start, injuries started to take their toll on the Chargers, who ended the 2025 season with three straight losses that dropped their record against fellow playoff foes to 3-3. \nThe Chargers have replaced Greg Roman with Mike McDaniel, who will be Justin Herbert's fifth different offensive coordinator since the Chargers drafted him in 2020. McDaniel will now be tasked with helping Herbert win his first playoff game. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Chicago Bears 2025 record: 11-6 (1st in NFC North)2026 opponents: Lions, **Packers, Vikings, Buccaneers, **Eagles, **Jaguars, Jets, **Patriots, Saints, **Bills, Dolphins, Falcons, **Panthers, **Seahawks There are several reasons why Bears fans might need to brace themselves for a letdown in 2026, starting with the fact that their team will face a whopping seven teams that made the playoffs a year ago. Chicago won eight one-possession games in 2025 that was largely the byproduct of Caleb Williams' uncanny play in the clutch and a defense that led the league in turnovers forced. Those strengths largely overshadowed Williams dreadful 58.1% completion percentage Chicago's defense finishing 23rd in the league in points allowed. \nIn 2026, the Bears will need more consistent play from Williams and better overall play from their defense if they are going to avoid becoming next year's version of this year's Washington Commanders. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Jacksonville Jaguars 2025 record: 13-4 (1st in AFC South)2026 opponents: **Texans, Colts, Titans, Browns, **Steelers, **Eagles, Commanders, **Patriots, Ravens, Bengals, Cowboys, Giants, **Bears, **Broncos Jacksonville is one of the few playoff teams that on paper will have an easier schedule in 2026. The Jaguars will face six teams that made the playoff this season after playing eight playoff teams this season. A big challenge for the Jaguars will be the sheer fact that Liam Coen and his team won't sneak up on anyone after being one of the NFL's biggest surprises this year. The Jaguars would help their cause this offseason by bolstering a defense that was just 21st in the league against the pass and 27th in sacks. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Buffalo Bills2025 record: 12-5 (2nd in AFC East)2026 opponents: Dolphins, **Patriots, Jets, Chiefs, **Chargers, **Bears, Lions, Ravens, **Broncos, **Packers, Raiders, Vikings, **Texans, **Rams Before Bills Mafia floods my inbox, I'd like to mention that I think Buffalo will can make a Super Bowl run in 2026. It's just anything but a sure thing. Buffalo will have a new coach after the surprising firing of Sean McDermott despite his glittering record that includes a 72-27 mark since 2020. Adding to odds of Buffalo missing the playoffs for the first time since 2018 is the fact that it will face seven teams that made the playoffs this year and will also face two teams (the Vikings and Lions) that went 9-8. As the Chiefs experienced this season with Patrick Mahomes, all it takes is an injury to a franchise quarterback for your season go off the rails. It goes without saying that an injury to Josh Allen would be catastrophic for a Bills team that puts a lot on his plate. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Philadelphia Eagles 2025 record: 11-6 (1st in NFC East)2026 opponents: Cowboys, Giants, Commanders, Cardinals, **Panthers, **Bears, **Texans, Colts, **Jaguars, **Rams, **Steelers, **49ers, **Seahawks, Titans Philadelphia went to the Super Bowl in 2022, had an off year in 2023, and then won its second Super Bowl in 2024. If history repeats itself, the Eagles should bounce back in 2026 after having a down 2025 season that ended with a home playoff loss to the 49ers. While they have an impressive group of skill players and a defense that finished fifth in scoring in points allowed in 2025, the Eagles will have to have more harmony on offense next season if they are going to overcome a brutal schedule that includes seven teams that made the playoffs in 2025. The Eagles will also more than likely have to deal with a more competitive division. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. San Francisco 49ers 2025 record: 12-5 (3rd in NFC West)2026 opponents: Cardinals, **Rams, **Seahawks, **Broncos, **Eagles, Raiders, Commanders, Vikings, Dolphins, Cowboys, Chiefs, **Chargers, Giants, Falcons The 49ers have a talented roster and one of the league's best coaches in Kyle Shanahan. Health, however, has continued to allude them to the point that the team's brass is going to look into the viral substation conspiracy this offseason in an effort to avoid another injury-riddled season. Health and the fact that they play in one of the NFL's toughest divisions may be the 49ers' two biggest roadblocks in 2026. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Denver Broncos2025 record: 14-3 (1st in AFC West)2026 opponents: **Chargers, Chiefs, Raiders, **Bills, Dolphins, **Rams, **Seahawks, **Jaguars, **Patriots, **Panthers, Jets, **49ers, Cardinals, **Steelers No disrespect to the newly-minted AFC champion Patriots, but the Broncos may have been a Bo Nix injury away from getting to big game after coming up just short on Sunday. With Nix, Denver went 15-3 (including the playoffs) while boasting the league's third-ranked scoring defense. The Broncos have the team to make another deep playoff run, but it's worth noting that they'll face a brutal schedule that includes eight teams that made the playoffs in 2025. The Broncos will need to play well in the regular season if they are going to get back to the playoffs. Denver would increase its odds this offseason by making some upgrades at its skill positions, specifically at running back given J.K. Dobbins' injury history and R.J. Harvey making a bigger impact at receiver during his rookie season. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams 2025 record: 12-5 (2nd in NFC West)2026 opponents: **Seahawks, **49ers, Cardinals, Cowboys, Giants, **Packers, Chiefs, **Chargers, **Bills, **Eagles, Commanders, Buccaneers, Raiders, **Broncos The Rams came up short in Seattle, but there's a lot of reasons to feel good about next season if you're a Los Angeles fan. Los Angeles led the NFL in scoring this season, was 10th in points allowed, and has one of the game's best coaches in Sean McVay. The Rams are surely hoping to retain both of their top assistants -- defensive coordinator Chris Shula and offensive coordinator Nate Scheelhaase -- with the Raiders, Bills, Browns and Cardinals still looking for head coaches. Outside of a challenging schedule, age may be one of the things to monitor next season if you're a Rams fan, specifically when it comes to Matthew Stafford, who turns 38 next month. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Carter Bahns with you on a rather snowy Monday across several pockets of the country -- especially here in New England, where we have well beyond a foot of powder on the ground. This weekend's winter weather gave us all a perfect excuse to stay inside and watch sports, and those of you who did saw the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks punch their tickets to Super Bowl 60. You also watched three remarkable freshman performances on the college basketball hardwood and the start of the UFC on Paramount+ era.If you got outside to enjoy better weather, missed some of the biggest stories of the weekend or want to take a deeper dive into the happenings in the sports world, then you've come to the right place.Let's discuss.🏆 Five things to know MondaySuper Bowl 60 will feature the Patriots and Seahawks. New England punched its Super Bowl ticket with a gritty 10-7 victory over the Broncos in a game that featured near blizzard conditions. Seattle clinched its spot in the final game of the season with a thrilling 31-27 triumph over their NFC West-rival Rams. Stars carried their teams in the both championship games as Drake Maye put the Patriots' win on ice by calling his own number on a play that secured the win and Jaxon Smith-Njigba went nuclear for the Seahawks with 10 catches for 153 yards and a touchdown. The Super Bowl is set for Sunday, Feb. 8 at 6:30 p.m. ET.The Steelers hired Mike McCarthy. The Super Bowl 45 winner will be back in the league after taking the 2025 season off. Pittsburgh native McCarthy joins the Steelers as just their fourth coach since 1969. The fanbase may not be overly thrilled about the hire, but Bill Cowher gave his stamp of approval because of McCarthy's offensive acumen and ties to the city. The biggest lingering question is whether Aaron Rodgers will re-sign with the Steelers to play for his former coach.Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ja Morant and Jonathan Kuminga all sustained injuries ahead of the NBA trade deadline. Antetokounmpo will undergo an MRI on his right calf and said he expects to miss four to six weeks, which would sideline him through the Feb. 5 trade deadline. The injury came after trade talks reportedly intensified and could mean that the \"Greek Freak\" has already played his last game with the Bucks. Meanwhile, Morant sprained his elbow and will be re-evaluated in three weeks, which also sets him up to reach the deadline while sidelined. The problem for the Grizzlies? Morant's trade market is reportedly quiet. Interest in Kuminga is also questionable, and he twisted an ankle and suffered a minor knee hyperextension late last week.The College Football Playoff will remain at 12 teams … for now. No expansion awaits on the immediate horizon as the CFP will maintain its present format in 2026. The Big Ten (which prefers a 24-team playoff) and the SEC (which wants a 16-team field) could not reach an agreement by the Friday deadline to vote on expansion. Their stalemate is unlikely to last forever given that both, in the end, desire a larger bracket, but we will see at least one more 12-team playoff before the next round of format tweaks.Numerous NBA and college basketball games were postponed. The two biggest non-sports stories of the weekend made impacts on the NBA and college basketball schedules. Winter Storm Fern forced the postponement of two NBA games (Nuggets at Grizzlies and Mavericks at Bucks) and led a handful of college teams to push games back multiple days or play them earlier than scheduled. On a more somber note, the NBA also postponed the Timberwolves' game against the Warriors after federal agents shot and killed an ICU nurse in Minneapolis. WNBA star Breanna Stewart protested after the shooting -- the second fatal one in that city this month -- holding up a sign that read \"Abolish ICE\" at an Unrivaled game.🤼 Do not miss this: Justin Gaethje won the interim lightweight title in UFC's Paramount+ debut\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The UFC on Paramount+ era opened with an instant classic as Justin Gaethje defeated Paddy Pimblett to secure his second stint as interim lightweight champion.

    "body": "\n        Championship Sunday began with four teams, but only two remain with tickets punched to Super Bowl LX. It'll be the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks who will battle for the right to hoist the Lombardi Trophy at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, in a couple of weeks.This Super Bowl matchup came together after another chaotic chapter in these NFL playoffs. In the AFC Championship, New England leaned on Drake Maye's legs and a stout defense to outlast the Jarrett Stidham-led Denver Broncos in a game that turned into a snowy affair at Mile High.As for Seattle, the Seahawks reached the Super Bowl after trading haymakers with the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship, where Sam Darnold and Matthew Stafford each threw for over 300 yards and three touchdowns.With Championship Sunday in the books, storylines from both conference title games will begin pouring out as we break down what just unfolded. Below, we're going to highlight some of the major takeaways from these two playoff showdowns and determine which should be taken at face value -- and which are mere overreactions.\nDrake Maye and the Patriots silenced the schedule skepticsOverreaction vs. reality: Overreaction\nThe Patriots are back in the Super Bowl after outlasting some remarkably tough defenses along the way. In fact, Drake Maye became the first quarterback ever to win three playoff games against top-five total defenses (yards allowed) in a single postseason. That puts a sizable hole in the argument from skeptics who have cited an easy schedule as a major reason for New England's success.Does it silence those doubters entirely? Probably not. While Maye and the Patriots offense have managed to outlast several elite units, New England's path also included facing Justin Herbert behind an injured offensive line, C.J. Stroud, who threw four interceptions in the divisional round, and Jarrett Stidham, a backup pressed into action after Bo Nix got hurt.Those circumstances may still leave some questioning just how good the Patriots really are, even though they are now one win away from a championship.\nJarrett Stidham was who we thought he wasOverreaction vs. reality: Reality\nFor a moment, it looked like Stidham was going to follow in the footsteps of Nick Foles and drive a dagger into the heart of the Patriots. After an opening three-and-out, he uncorked a 52-yard pass to Marvin Mims to get Denver inside the New England 10-yard line, then connected with Courtland Sutton for a 6-yard touchdown to take an early 7-0 lead.All the momentum was on Denver's side at that point, and the backup quarterback seemed to be rising to the occasion. But then things came crashing back down to earth.The Broncos went scoreless the rest of the game, and Stidham wasn't nearly as effective as he was on that lone touchdown drive. On that possession, he completed two of his four pass attempts for 58 yards and a touchdown. Outside of it, he went 15 of 27 for just 75 yards.\nHe also had two turnovers that proved to be the nail in Denver's coffin. The first came on a fumble on a backward pass that gave the Patriots possession at the Broncos' 12-yard line.\nTrying to tie the game or take the lead with just over two minutes left in regulation, Stidham threw an interception to Christian Gonzalez on an underthrown ball to Mims. \nComing into this game, there was growing optimism that Stidham would be able to keep things afloat, but that ultimately didn't come to fruition. \nAFC Championship was the bronze medal gameOverreaction vs. reality: Overreaction It's hard to watch the AFC Championship and the NFC Championship and not feel like one conference was a tier above the other. New England was able to come away with a win over Denver to advance to the Super Bowl, but it was by the skin of its teeth, even with the Broncos starting their backup quarterback.Meanwhile, both the Rams and Seahawks looked like championship heavyweights in their slugfest. I wouldn't fault you if your first impression after watching both games was that whoever came out of the NFC would end up winning Super Bowl LX, rendering the AFC Championship a bronze medal game of sorts.While that may be the knee-jerk reaction, it isn't the reality. Seattle does have the betting edge over New England in the early Super Bowl lines, but the Seahawks are only favored by 3.5. That's hardly a number that suggests one conference is heads and shoulders above the other.\nAnd as we've seen time and time again, you can't count out any team that reaches the Super Bowl, so New England shouldn't be viewed as a sacrificial lamb to the NFC champions.\nSean Payton lost Denver the AFC ChampionshipOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionOne of the monumental decisions of the AFC Championship came in the early minutes of the second quarter. Already holding a 7-0 lead, the Broncos were threatening to score after moving the ball to the New England 14-yard line.Faced with a fourth-and-1, Sean Payton elected to keep his offense on the field, and that decision blew up in his face. On the critical down, Stidham was immediately pressured, nearly threw an interception and turned the ball over on downs.\nPayton noted afterward that he kept his offense on the field because he believed his team had the momentum to convert, but it proved costly, particularly with Denver losing by a field goal. Going up 10-0 in a game that saw just 17 total points scored would have been the more prudent move.Still, while it loomed large in a 10-7 loss to New England, it wasn't the sole reason the Broncos came up short.Denver had multiple opportunities to draw even after that turnover on downs, but couldn't execute. On the following drive, Stidham fumbled the football, and the Patriots responded with a touchdown drive to tie the game at seven.\nLater in the contest, Will Lutz missed a 54-yard field goal and had a 45-yard attempt blocked, either of which would've tied the game at 10. So, while passing up the points in that spot will likely be a main talking point, other factors were working against Denver as well.Sam Darnold outdueled Matthew StaffordOverreaction vs. reality: Reality\nFolks have routinely looked at Darnold sideways and questioned whether this late-career resurgence would translate to postseason success. With each game, there's been a thought in the back of people's minds that he'll turn into a pumpkin, like he did with Minnesota in Week 18 and in the first round of the playoffs last year.However, that hasn't happened in his first season with Seattle. In fact, Darnold just outplayed Stafford, the favorite to win NFL MVP, in the NFC Championship Game.\nOn the surface, their numbers were nearly identical.Darnold: 25 of 36, 346 yards passing, 3 TDs, 127.8 passer ratingStafford: 22 of 35, 374 yards passing, 3 TDs, 127.6 passer ratingHowever, Darnold was far superior in key situations, particularly on third down. Stafford failed to complete any of his six pass attempts on third down in the loss. Meanwhile, Darnold completed 6 of 9 on third down for 102 yards and a touchdown.\nIf Darnold can keep that efficiency going, he'll have a great shot at completing his redemption arc with a Super Bowl title.Rams' special teams were their downfallOverreaction vs. reality: RealityAn Achilles heel for the Rams this season has been their special teams unit. Miscues on that side of the ball put them behind the eight-ball throughout the year, and it reared its head again in this playoff loss to Seattle.\nTheir deficiencies were put on full display on a Seahawks punt after the opening possession of the third quarter. Returner Xavier Smith fell backward trying to field the ball, muffed the punt, and Seattle recovered at the Rams 17-yard line.\nOne play later, Darnold connected with Jake Bobo on a touchdown to put L.A. in a 24-13 hole.\nHad the Rams played mistake-free on special teams, we could be talking about them heading to the Super Bowl instead of their season coming to a close.Sean McVay ended the season in a slumpOverreaction vs. reality: RealitySean McVay is widely regarded as one of the best coaches in the NFL, and that remains the case. Still, the Rams head coach did end the season in a relative slump.In the divisional round win over Chicago, McVay made a number of head-scratching decisions late, but it ultimately didn't burn L.A. as the team advanced. In the NFC Championship, however, those curious late-game calls persisted and did contribute to the loss.One of the puzzling decisions came when Los Angeles faced a fourth-and-4 at the Seattle 6-yard line. McVay decided to keep his offense on the field, even though a field goal would've cut the Seahawks' lead to one point with 4:54 remaining in regulation.The Rams were unable to convert and turned the ball over on downs, keeping the deficit at four points.\nOn the ensuing Seattle possession, Cooper Kupp appeared to come up short on a third-down catch, but the officials moved the chains with a first-down ruling. McVay did not challenge the spot, instead calling a timeout after the play.He should've simply challenged the ruling, which may have gone in his favor, and potentially retained his timeout to keep L.A. within range. Instead, the timeout was used, the challenge flag stayed in his pocket, and Seattle moved one step closer to victory.\nOverall, it wasn't a banner final two playoff games for McVay.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first weekend of 2026 saw most college basketball teams play their first or second conference game of the season. While No. 6 Duke survived a scare against Florida State during a 91-87 win on the road, other blue bloods weren't as fortunate.    Kentucky dropped to 9-5 on the season and began SEC play with a 89-74 loss to No. 14 Alabama on the road. Last year, the Wildcats opened conference play with a statement win over (eventual) national champion Florida in one of the best games of the season. The Wildcats were riding a four-game win streak before falling to the Crimson Tide.     In the Big 12, No. 17 Kansas saw star freshman Darryn Peterson return to the lineup against UCF. However, Peterson logged just five minutes in the second half and his team was on the wrong side of an 81-75 loss to the Knights. Almost two years ago to the day the Knights upset the Jayhawks in their first conference win as a member of the Big 12.    No. 12 North Carolina has been playing like one of the best teams in college basketball lately, but fell flat in its first conference loss to SMU. The 97-83 setback to the Mustangs snapped a seven-game winning streak dating back to a win over Kentucky in the ACC/SEC Challenge.     \nHere's how the AP Top 25 fared Saturday followed by our selected winners and losers.1Arizona at UtahWon 97-78Recap2Michigan Did not play3Iowa State Did not play4UConnDid not play5Purdueat WisconsinWon 89-73Recap6Dukeat Florida StateWon 91-87Recap7GonzagaDid not play8Houstonat CincinnatiWon 67-60Recap9Michigan StateDid not play10BYUat Kansas StateWon 83-73Recap11Vanderbiltat South CarolinaWon 83-71Recap12North Carolinaat SMULost 97-83Tar Heels' defense collapses13NebraskaDid not play14Alabamavs. KentuckyWon 89-74Tide exposes UK's many problems15Texas Techvs. Oklahoma StateWon 102-80Recap16LouisvilleDid not play17Kansasat UCFLost 81-75Knights pull off upset18Arkansasvs. No. 19 TennesseeWon 86-75Acuff shines in his SEC debut19Tennesseeat No. 18 ArkansasLost 86-75Recap20Illinoisat Penn StateWon 73-65Recap21Virginiaat North Carolina StateWon 76-61Recap22Floridaat MissouriLost 76-74Recap23Georgiavs. AuburnWon 104-100 OTRecap24USCDid not play25Iowavs. UCLAWon 74-61Recap\n    \n                                        \n    Loser: Another slow start dooms Kentucky vs. Alabama  Slow starts sunk Kentucky in early-season losses to Louisville, Michigan State, North Carolina and Gonzaga. And a slow start Saturday (surprise!) at Alabama to open its SEC slate – in which it trailed by as many as 21 points in the first half (!!) – again doomed the Wildcats in an 89-74 defeat.     It was a major step back for Kentucky after it closed out the 2025 calendar year with four consecutive wins and seemed to be trending up, with two of those wins coming against St. John's and Indiana. The Wildcats simply never found their groove in this one, and despite a late push, the game's result was never in doubt.     \nTroubling for UK (in addition to the loss, which is not all that troubling in a vacuum) is the way in which it succumbed to the Tide. It lost the rebounding battle to a Bama team that has been soft on the boards much of the season and let Bama assert itself in precisely the way it wanted to: by letting Labaron Philon and Aden Holloway dictate the terms and pick them apart from 3-point range. That's top-of-the-scouting-report priorities Kentucky should've had a better plan for. Instead it's back to the drawing board after a humbling defeat. -- Kyle Boone   \n    \n                                        \n       Winner: Baylor's December free agent makes debut   Sure, Baylor (10-3) lost 69-63 at TCU, but James Nnaji, the newest player on the Bears' roster, pretty clearly had a very good day on a personal level. He made history, for starters. He'll forever be referenced and remembered as the first former NBA Draft pick to play in men's college basketball. Leading up to the game, Scott Drew speculated Nnaji might only play a few minutes in his debut. He overshot the target. Nnaji was playable enough to stay on the court for 16:17 out of 40 minutes of a fairly competitive game that saw Baylor chasing throughout.   Nnaji finished with five points, four rebounds, one assist, two turnovers and four fouls. He's rough around the edges, but that was the expectation; Saturday was Nnaji's first five-on-five action since the summer. He had a back issue that kept him out of competition, and all things considered, he was a plus on the floor. For Drew and Baylor, which only had eight healthy players, the depth was a welcomed update to the team's reinforcements. We'll see how he adapts in the weeks ahead. Whether Nnaji's addition to the roster is worth even one additional win is far from a certainty.     \n\n    \n                                        \n       Winner: Stirtz puts on show in Iowa's win vs. UCLA   Iowa matched its best start to a season since 2020-21 with a 74-61 home victory over UCLA on Saturday to improve to 12-2 overall. The Hawkeyes were stingy defensively in limiting UCLA to 3-of-14 shooting from 3-point range, and their star, Bennett Stirtz, was stupendous on the other end of the floor. He finished with a game-high 27 points and five assists and was 8-of-10 shooting from the field and a perfect 7 for 7 from the free-throw line. -- Boone   \n    \n                                        \n       Winner: BYU, Dybantsa stay hot with 10th straight win   Momentum from nonconference play rolled into conference play for BYU on Saturday as it opened Big 12 action with an 83-73 road win over Kansas State. The Cougars controlled the game throughout with freshman star AJ Dybantsa doing AJ Dybantsa things. He finished with 24 points, eight boards and three assists. -- Boone   \n\n    \n                                        \n       Winner: Smith becomes Big Ten's all-time assists leader   Purdue star Braden Smith set the record for the most all-time career assists among Big Ten players Saturday with 12 dimes in an 89-73 win over Wisconsin to put him at 893. Smith broke the record of 890 previously held by Michigan State star Cassius Winston, and he did so in a game in which he also added 14 points and four boards. -- Boone   \n\n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Arkansas' Acuff shines in SEC debut     Arkansas freshman Darius Acuff turned in a memorable SEC debut, scoring a career-high 29 points to lead the No. 18 Razorbacks to an 86-75 win over No. 19 Tennessee. Acuff produced Arkansas' first seven points, scored a big bucket just before halftime and then popped off for 19 in the second half. In the process, he thoroughly outplayed Tennessee's Nate Ament, who was the only SEC freshman to finish ahead of Acuff in the final 247Sports recruiting rankings.     Acuff has yet to score fewer than 16 points against a high-major opponent and is looking like an early contender for SEC Player of the Year. A year ago, the Razorbacks had to grapple with unmet expectations and injuries surrounding freshman guard Boogie Fland. This time, coach John Calipari appears to have hit the lottery. -- David Cobb    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Loser: Peterson returns, but Kansas falls to UCF    The good news: Kansas star freshman Darryn Peterson is back. The bad? Kansas was on the wrong side of an upset loss to UCF. Peterson looked incredible in the first half against the Knights and scored 23 points before halftime. However, Peterson logged just five total minutes in the second half and scored just three points. Peterson subbed out around the 10-minute mark and did not return for the rest of the game. The ceiling of Kansas' roster without Peterson is significantly lower. -- Cameron Salerno    \n\n        \n            \n                UCF upsets No. 17 Kansas in return of Jayhawks star freshman Darrryn Peterson from hamstring injury\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Loser: UNC defense collapses in ugly road loss to SMU    North Carolina entered the weekend with the second-best defense among ACC programs, allowing 96.6 points per 100 possessions, per KenPom data. It left the day searching for answers in an area it has otherwise been brilliant in after surrendering a season-high 97 points in a 97-83 defeat to SMU.    SMU converted 1.426 points per possession in the win – a stunning 142.6 points per 100 possession pace – and found little resistance in its third consecutive outing of 97 or more points. The Mustangs finished 14 of 27 from 3-point range, had 23 assists to only seven turnovers and never trailed in the second half. -- Boone    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Texas Tech is flying high offensively    With premier perimeter marksmen Chance McMillian (43.3% on 5.3 attempts) and Kerwin Walton (39.6% on 4.3 attempts) departing from a team that ranked in the top 50 nationally in made 3-pointers per game (10) and percentage (36.7%), Tech needed some hired guns. It found them in the form of UNC Greensboro transfer Donovan Atwell, freshman Jaylen Petty and Santa Clara transfer Tyeree Bryan. The trio combined to go 12 of 23 from deep in a 102-80 win over Oklahoma State.     \nThe Red Raiders tied a season-high with 17 made 3-pointers against the Cowboys as four TTU players drilled 3+ treys apiece. When you surround an interior star like JT Toppin with that type of shooting, you get an elite offensive team. That's what Texas Tech (11-3, 1-0 Big 12) is on their way to becoming after an uneven start to the season. Toppin led the way with 23 points and 14 rebounds, which left Oklahoma State with no choice but to pick its poison defensively. -- Cobb    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Loser: Pitt veers toward rock bottom    An 80-46 win over Penn State on Dec. 21 sent Pitt into Christmas on a high note after a rocky start that included home losses to Quinnipiac and Hofstra. But any hope of the Panthers maintaining that momentum dissipated in a 73-68 loss to Clemson on Saturday. The Panthers are now (7-8, 0-2 ACC) and careening toward irrelevance once again.    This program won 20+ games in consecutive seasons back in 2023 and 2024, finishing 26-14 in the ACC during that span under eighth-year coach Jeff Capel. The Panthers even reached the second round of the 2023 NCAA Tournament and signed a strong freshman class that year, which featured top-100 guards Bub Carrington and Jaland Lowe. But Carrington turned out to be a one-and-done star, and Lowe transferred to Kentucky after last season. With more talent heading out than coming in, this struggle was all-too predictable. -- Cobb    \n\n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Villanova might be second best in Big East    UConn is the king of the Big East for now, but Villanova looks solidified to be No. 2 after improving to 3-0 in the league with an 85-67 road win over Butler. Balance is everything for Kevin Willard's group. All five starters (Academe Lewis, Matt Hodge, Bryce Lindsay, Tyler Perkins and Duke Brennan) cracked double figures. With lone losses to BYU (very good!) and Michigan (confirmed amazing!), Villanova looks primed to rise above St. John's, Seton Hall and the rest to be UConn's stiffest challenger.  -- Trotter    \n    \n                                        \n        Loser: NC State's 3-point defense goes MIA vs. UVa   NC State's 3-point defense had been flirting with disaster for large chunks of time this season, and Saturday turned out to be judgment day. Entering the day, the Wolfpack had allowed 9.5 unguarded catch-and-shoot 3s per game. That ranked 291st nationally. Virginia capitalized on those clean looks from the jump. Sam Lewis and Malik Thomas combined for seven triples in the first half alone of UVA's runaway 76-61 victory over NC State. Virginia totaled 13 triples and improved to 12-2 overall and 1-1 in ACC play. -- Trotter    \n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Georgia off to historically great start    On a day in which defense was optional (but, largely, nonexistent) it should come as no surprise that No. 23 Georgia – which has the highest-scoring offense in college basketball – came through down the stretch by relying on its offense in a 104-100 overtime win over Auburn.    \nThe Bulldogs outscored the Tigers 12-8 in the extra period, which included two made 3-pointers and two made free throws in the final 110 seconds to seal the win. UGA finished the day 11 of 29 from 3-point range and 25 of 35 from the free-throw line.    The win moved UGA to 13-1 on the season, marking its second-best start in program history and best start to a season since 1931.  -- Boone    \n    \n                                        \n        Winner: Providence rallies to stun St. John's    Stefan Vaaks erupted for 15 of his 16 points in the second half to spark Providence to a potentially season-turning win over St. John's. The once-slumping Friars trailed 15-3 before they could blink and at one point trailed by as many as 13 points. They had to survive an unbelievable 33-point, 15-rebound Zuby Ejiofor performance. And yet, Providence surged off the mat to erase a 10-point deficit in the final seven minutes of regulation. -- Isaac Trotter    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It all comes down to this. We've reached the final weekend of the 2025 regular season, and Week 18 is poised to bring plenty of chaos as we cross the finish line. Entering the weekend, four division titles were still up for grabs, along with the No. 1 seeds in the AFC and NFC. In the NFC, the No. 1 seed was decided Saturday night when the Seattle Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 49ers in San Francisco. With the win, Seattle clinched the NFC West and a first-round bye as the conference's top seed. The 49ers will be either the No. 5 or No. 6 seed, depending on whether the Los Angeles Rams win or lose on Sunday.In the AFC, the Broncos have the inside track at claiming home-field advantage and the first-round bye that comes with the top seed. All they need to do is take down the Chargers (who'll be resting Justin Herbert), and they'll clinch that position. However, if the AFC West champions slip up, that would open the door for either the Patriots or Jaguars to leap up. In that scenario, the Patriots would get the top seed with a win over the Dolphins, while the Jags would need both Denver and New England to lose to jump up, on top of defeating the Titans at home. \nBeyond the top seeds, the AFC North will be determined on \"Sunday Night Football\" between the Ravens and Steelers. The winner of that game will claim the division and be the No. 4 seed in the conference, while the other will be eliminated from playoff contention. As we close the book on the 2025 regular season and put the postseason into clearer focus, let's take a look at the current playoff picture. \n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture for Week 18: All remaining seeds, clinching paths and wild card matchups\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAFC standingsz-Denver Broncos (13-3)z-New England Patriots (13-3)x-Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)x-Houston Texans (11-5)x-Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)x-Buffalo Bills (11-5)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1.

New England Patriots (13-3)Remaining schedule: vs. DolphinsThe Patriots had already clinched a playoff berth in Week 16, and are now AFC East champions thanks to the events of Week 17. They did their part earlier on Sunday by blowing out the Jets, and then the Eagles fended off the Bills to lock up the division. New England is also still alive for the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3.

They are likely to rest players in Week 18 and prepare for a road opener. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. JetsThe Bills' defeat at the hands of the Eagles in Week 17 officially eliminated them from winning the AFC East and has dropped them to the No. 7 seed. The Bills have already clinched a playoff berth, so it'll be interesting to see if they opt for rest over seed positioning in Week 18. \nIn the huntThe Ravens (8-8), with Lamar Jackson sidelined, kept their playoff hopes alive with an impressive road win against the Packers in Green Bay. Then, on Sunday, they had their prayers answered with the Browns upsetting Pittsburgh. That sets up a winner-take-all matchup in the AFC North against the Steelers in Week 18. The loser will be eliminated from playoff contention. NFC standingsz-Seattle Seahawks (14-3)z-Chicago Bears (11-5)z-Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9)x-San Francisco 49ers (12-5)x-Los Angeles Rams (11-5)x-Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (14-3)Remaining schedule: at 49ersWith Mike Macdonald, Sam Darnold and a ferocious defense leading the way, the NFC playoffs will go through Seattle. The Seahawks earned that right by suffocating the 49ers on Saturday night to not only win the NFC West, but also claim the conference's No. 1 seed and the first-round bye that comes with it.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. LionsThe Bears nearly pulled off yet another comeback against the 49ers, but came up just short. Even with the loss in Week 17, Chicago currently sits as the No. 2 seed in the conference thanks to the head-to-head tiebreaker they own over Philly. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. CommandersPhiladelphia punched its playoff ticket in Week 16 with a commanding victory over the Commanders. The defending Super Bowl champions became the first team to win back-to-back NFC East crowns since 2004. After outlasting the Bills in Week 17, the Eagles are merely fighting for seeding in the regular-season finale\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9)The Buccaneers (8-9) experienced a dramatic fall from grace in the second half of the season, entering Week 18 having lost seven of their past nine games. But thanks to a 16-14 win over the Panthers on Saturday night, Tampa Bay's playoff hopes remain alive.Now, the Buccaneers need the Saints (6-10) to defeat the Falcons (7-9). That's because Carolina would own the tiebreaker if the division ends in a three-way tie at 8-9.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. San Francisco 49ers (12-5)Remaining schedule: vs. SeahawksEntering Week 17, the 49ers had a chance to play five straight home games to end the season, with the Super Bowl set to be played at Levi's Stadium. That will no longer be the case after Saturday night's deflating X-X loss to the Seahawks.Instead of winning the NFC West and earning a first-round bye as the conference's top seed, the 49ers will be playing on wild card weekend. If the Rams lose to the Cardinals, they will remain the No. 5 seed. If the Rams win, the 49ers will drop to the No. 6 spot.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Rams (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. CardinalsThe Rams are in the playoffs, but cannot climb to the No. 1 seed or win the NFC West. They'll be a wild card entry. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)Remaining schedule: at VikingsGreen Bay, minus Jordan Love, fell to Derrick Henry and the Ravens on Saturday night. The loss ended any hopes of winning the NFC North title and locked Green Bay into the NFC's No. 7 seed.In the huntThe Panthers (8-9) had two paths to winning the NFC South entering Week 18.The first was simple: Beat the Buccaneers on Saturday night. Welp, they failed to do that, suffering a 16-14 defeat in Tampa Bay.Now they must rely on the Falcons to beat the Saints on Sunday. That outcome would create a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9, a scenario in which Carolina would hold the tiebreaker.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dabo Swinney has tapped a veteran colleague to fix Clemson's issues on offense, bringing back former OC and quarterbacks coach Chad Morris to call plays in 2026, according to Tiger Illustrated. Clemson247 also confirmed the news. This comes a week after Clemson parted ways with Garrett Riley after three seasons. The 2025 campaign fell well short of expectations as the Tigers were preseason top-five team before finishing with the program's worst record in more than a decade.Before a Pinstripe Bowl loss to Penn State ended the season at 7-6 overall, Swinney promised to make coaching staff changes. Clemson took a massive step back under Riley after quarterback Cade Klubnik went from preseason Heisman candidate to a mid-level option in the ACC. His touchdown total was cut in half from his junior to senior seasons.Clemson's 28.7 points per game entering the postseason and its number of explosive plays were the program's lowest production numbers since 2021, leading to speculation about Riley's future and where Swinney wanted to continue with his scheme moving forward.\nMorris worked as a Clemson offensive analyst during the 2023 season before spending 2024 as Texas State's wide receiver coach and passing game coordinator. After a successful previous run as the Tigers' OC from 2011-14, Morris coached three seasons at SMU and two at Arkansas, compiling an 18-40 record.He returned to his strengths as an offensive guru at Auburn in 2020 under Gus Malzahn, but that season went south on the Plains and he was back in the Texas prep coaching ranks the following year.Clemson's offense under MorrisMorris brought a tempo-drive scheme to Clemson for the first time in 2011 after the Tigers finished 6-7 during Swinney's second full season as coach. Over the next four years, Clemson went 42-11 overall with record-setting production offensively, led by quarterback Tajh Boyd, who developed as an All-ACC passer under Morris.\nThe hiring of Morris just as the solo transfer portal window opened on Friday means the Tigers will have to quickly assess their biggest needs offensively, specifically at quarterback and the skill positions. Clemson is reportedly in the mix for Michigan State signal caller Aidan Chiles and previously met with ex-Florida quarterback D.J. Lagway.Morris brings a quarterback-friendly and rollout-heavy scheme to Death Valley that has worked before and is more akin to current, spread-based systems around the ACC. It is similar to Malzahn's scheme at Florida State with a RPO-based approach. His son, Chandler Morris, transferred to Virginia ahead of the 2025 season and went 11-3 for the ACC runner-ups under former Clemson OC Tony Elliott.Morris recently petitioned the NCAA for another year of eligibility, citing his 2022 season at TCU.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Getting back to playing soccer after the winter break can lead to some strange results, but Barcelona avoided dropping points in a 2-0 derby win against Espanyol. Hansi Flick's team struggled to hit the targets in the first half, giving their rivals hope that they'd be able to get all three points, but that was dashed in the second half with Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski finding the back of the net in the second half of play.Due to LaLiga having a winter break, Barcelona's last match was on Dec. 21, and while the time off did give the players the opportunity to reset, it also meant that there was plenty of rust to shake off in a bad match to do it in. The Derbi Barceloni has seen the two sides meet 219 times, and while Barcelona have won 129 of those meetings, Espanyol are a side on the rise, pushing for a Champions League place in the league.Barcelona keeper Joan Garcia also felt the heat after crossing rivalry lines to become the starting keeper for Barca in the summer. He was booed heavily and called a rat by fans, but wouldn't let that stop him from making six saves during the match en route to a clean sheet for Barcelona.In the first half, Espanyol were unlucky not to score, and they held Barcelona to only one shot on target before Flick made an important change at the half, introducing Fermin Lopez for Marcus Rashford. Fermin Lopez ended up assisting both of Barcelona's goals to help keep their title charge going.\nWhile Real Madrid still have a match to play on Sunday against Real Betis, Barcelona have opened a seven-point lead atop LaLiga while winning their last eight matches in all competitions. Even their defensive issues have been better since Garcia's return to the lineup, keeping clean sheets in three consecutive matches league matches and four straight games overall. That defensive improvement is what will be important in holding off Real Madrid. Xabi Alonso taking over Real Madrid ahead of this season was supposed to increase pressure in the title race, but as Barcelona's gap atop LaLiga widens both in points and goal difference, where Barcelona have a goal difference of 33 compared to Real Madrid's 20, it feels like the league is becoming Barcelona's to lose. That success is something that will still need to translate into the Champions League, where Barcelona are among the contenders to win the entire thing. Their high line has caused issues at times, but when Garcia is making saves like the ones that he pulled off against his former club, it won't matter how many defenders Barcelona have up the pitch. \nNext up, Barca will have their first shot at silverware this season, taking on Athletic Club in the Supercopa de España semifinal on Wednesday, Jan. 7.\n            ",

The deal is for four years and $60 million, according to the New York Post. Okamoto, 29, has spent the first 11 years of his professional career with Tokyo's Yomiuri Giants in Nippon Professional Baseball, the top league in Japan. Okamoto's posting window was set to close at 5 p.m. ET Sunday afternoon. In NPB, Okamoto was a six-time All-Star and led his league in home runs three times. Last season was injury-shortened. In his 69 games, he hit .327/.416/.598 with 15 home runs and 49 RBI. He has six 30+ home run seasons with a career high of 41 in 2023. He's a career .274/.355/.501 hitter in NPB. Coming off the heels of their first AL pennant since 1993, the Blue Jays have been aggressive this offseason. They added starting pitchers Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce in addition to reliever Tyler Rogers. Okamoto is their first major signing on the position player side. \nIf the Jays indeed intend to keep Okamoto at third base, this move could close the door on free agent Bo Bichette, though it's far from a certainty. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is obviously at first base, Okamoto slots at third and that leaves Andrés Giménez for shortstop with Ernie Clement at second. Addison Barger can also play third base. Then again, it's possible the Jays still bring Bichette back to play shortstop and put Giménez in a backup middle infielder role. The Blue Jays have also been mentioned as suitors for free agent outfielder Kyle Tucker. If George Springer sticks at designated hitter, the outfield options are Nathan Lukas, Daulton Varsho, Anthony Santander, Barger and Davis Schneider. Schneider can also handle second base. What stands out more than anything is that the Blue Jays have plenty of depth and versatility. This puts them in a position where if they decide to spring for Bichette and/or Tucker, it's a nice help for the ballclub, but by no means is either player out of necessity. \nFor now, slot Okamoto as the Blue Jays' everyday third baseman and figure that he bats somewhere 5-7 in the order. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        North Carolina's defensive collapse Saturday in a 97-83 loss on the road vs. SMU was bad. No no, let me rephrase that: North Carolina's defensive collapse Saturday on the road vs. SMU in a 97-83 loss was catastrophically, historically horrific.  The Tar Heels allowed the Mustangs to post a 71.7% effective field goal percentage while finishing with a 139.9 defensive rating. Both marks, according to the KenPom.com database that includes game data all the way back to 1997 (!!), are second-worst in a single game for an historically proud UNC program.  The 71.7% effective goal percentage is the sixth-highest percentage a major conference team has finished with this season in a game when facing another major conference opponent, per CBB Reference data.  UNC coach Hubert Davis postgame did not have immediate answers about how to fix the troubles that ailed his team on D in the loss. But he did have an answer about what happened Saturday, which more or less came down to two words: Boopie Miller. \nSMU's Miller sliced and diced UNC's defense to the tune of 27 points and 12 assists and controlled the game throughout. He scored or assisted on 57 SMU points. Davis said Miller with the ball was dangerous as a shooter, but he was just as lethal when UNC tried to take the ball out of his hands. It was a catch-22 for the Tar Heels defense -- and either way Boopie was bopping his team to buckets. \n\"They were able to get anywhere that they wanted to offensively,\" Davis said. \"Boopie was in control of the ball, whether it was one-on-one, ball screen action. His patience, being able to get to his spots, being able to distribute … from an offensive standpoint, we tried to get the ball out of his hands, but he still was able to get the ball to his teammates at the right spot to do something with it. He played a terrific game.\" Miller's 12 assists tied a career-high and his 27 points are the third-highest in a single-game in his career, which began in 2022. He finished 10 of 13 shooting. And worse: UNC's defense was so brutal that it wasn't the only career day for an SMU player. Mustangs forward Corey Washington also set a career-high with five made 3s in the win on seven attempts. He finished with 23 points, which set a new career-high in points for him vs. major conference opponents.  \nDavis said SMU's athleticism, length and physicality \"affected [us].\" He also said Boopie controlling the game the way he did was tough to contend against. But he minced no words about the real problem Saturday. \"We shot 48% from the field,\" Davis said, implying that such efficiency on offense is usually a strong-enough number to get a win. \"But it's the defensive end. You're not going to win hardly any games at all if a team shoots 60%.\" \"It always starts and ends with us with defense, rebounding and taking care of the basketball,\" he added. \"And defensively we just didn't play the way we needed to to beat a team here on the road.\"\n No stopping them now The 97 points scored by SMU on Saturday are the sixth most points allowed by UNC since the 2010-11 season. DateOpponentFinal ScoreResultNov. 27, 2022Alabama103-101 (4OT)LossDec. 17, 2016Kentucky103-100LossFeb. 8, 2020Duke98-96 (OT)LossJan. 22, 2022Wake Forest98-76LossDec. 18, 2021Kentucky98-69Loss\t\t\t\tJan. 3, 2026\t\t\t\tSMU\t\t\t\t97-83\t\t\t\tLossMarch 29, 2019Auburn97-80LossOver the last five seasons in ACC regular season play, 25 teams have shot 60% or better from the field vs. a conference opponent. Only one of those teams went on to win. The evidence is clear: When a team gets that hot, or when your defense is that bad, you have to be nearly flawless to win.  This was an eye-opener for UNC and for Davis. They are not good enough to overcome defensive incompetence. That's the bad, and obvious, news. The good news is that UNC has largely been fine on that end and it has the potential to improve. After Saturday, though, virtually anything would qualify as improvement after what SMU's offense did to it. \n\"Again, it goes back to defense,\" Davis said. \"For us to be the best team we can possibly become, we have to be a good defensive team. SMU shot 60% from the field. That's not going to get it done.\" \n            ",

During Atlanta's current three-game winning streak, Cousins has thrown for six touchdowns and just one interception and taking just two sacks.Shough, meanwhile, has shown encouraging flashes since becoming the Saints' starter in Week 9. During New Orleans' current four-game winning streak, Shough has thrown for four touchdowns (and run for two more) and just one interception. He has completed over 71% of his passes during that span, and he has gone over 300 yards passing in each of his last two games.However, the biggest importance in this game might not have anything to do with either team. Thanks to a long list of tiebreakers, after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Carolina Panthers on Saturday night, the Falcons could still save Carolina's playoff hopes by winning this game. The Saints would do the same for the Buccaneers with a win.\nLong story short, if the Buccaneers win Saturday night, they still need the Saints to win come Sunday. Any other combination, and the Panthers will head to the playoffs as NFC South champs.Here's how to watch Atlanta-New Orleans, along with betting odds, top things to know and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Falcons vs. Saints liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, GeorgiaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Falcons -3, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)Falcons vs. Saints: Need to knowBijan Robinson chasing history. Even in a disappointing season in Atlanta, Robinson has distinguished himself as arguably the best player in the NFL, bar none. Robinson had 229 yards from scrimmage in the Falcons' 27-24 upset win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 17 and is now up to 2,255 on the season. With another 100 yards from scrimmage, he'd move into the top 10 for a single season. With another 200 yards from scrimmage, he'd move into second. The all-time record is 2,509, set by Chris Johnson in 2009. Robinson would need 255 yards from scrimmage to pass that. Regardless, it has been a magnificent season.Cousins, Shough trying to prove themselves. With Penix recovering from a torn ACL, there's a chance Cousins heads into the offseason as the Falcons' potential starter to open 2026. There's also a chance, however, that the Falcons get out of the Cousins contract. Cousins is due a $10 million roster bonus on March 17, 2026. Whether it's in Atlanta or elsewhere, though, Cousins, assuming he wants to keep playing, will want to put more positive play on display. Shough, meanwhile, has impressed as a second-round rookie, so much so that the Saints could continue to build around him, rather than try to replace him this offseason.Rams also have a vested rooting interest. As outlined above, there's a chance the Panthers and the Buccaneers are watching this one very closely. The Rams won't be watching it as closely, but they will still be impacted by it. The Falcons' 2026 first-round pick belongs to Los Angeles. The more Falcons losses, the better for the Rams; the pick could still end up in the top 10.Falcons vs. Saints pick, prediction\nBoth of these teams have played some surprisingly inspired football down the stretch of seasons in which they've long been eliminated from the playoffs. The difference here, between two clubs already with one eye on the offseason ahead, will be Robinson. He totaled 107 yards from scrimmage in the first meeting, a 24-10 Falcons win, as ATL's defense sacked Shough five times.

It only took 10 minutes for Andoni Iraola's Cherries to go ahead in the match, but keeping the lead has been where Bournemouth's issues have come in. It only took six minutes for the Gunners to level the match with yet another goal from a set piece via Gabriel.It was Arsenal's 12th goal via a set piece, joint top of the league with Leeds United. Even with the league's growing emphasis on set pieces, no one has been able to keep up with the Gunners, as 30 percent of their goals have come from set pieces. But that wasn't all that Arsenal would need to dig out the win.Declan Rice's return from a knee injury went a long way as the English midfielder produced a brace. It was a lovely first-time finish from outside the box to put Arsenal ahead for good in the 54th minute of play, and he almost replicated it for his second in the 70th minute. The cutbacks from attackers knowing that someone would be in the box show how orchestrated Arsenal have become under Mikel Arteta.\nThis team have grown together, and they're looking to accomplish something that hasn't happened since 2004 and lead Arsenal to a Premier League title. Even when they aren't at their best, they've been able to do enough to stay ahead of the opposition, as even that third goal proved to be important when Eli Junior Kroupi pulled a goal back for the Cherries. It was far from a vintage performance with Bouremouth producing an xG of 1.34 to Arsenal's 1.17, but the difference was in the finishing.To win the title, these are exactly the kind of matches that Arsenal need to find a way to get points from and behind Rice's leadership, they're more than on the right track. Arsenal are in full control of their destiny, even if they drop points facing Manchester City when the two meet in April.\nNow past the midway point of the season, there's still plenty that needs to happen for the Gunners to break their curse of finishing as runners-up in the league, which ahs happened now in three consecutive seasons, but they're on the right track. The matches won't be slowing down anytime soon, with Arsenal hosting Liverpool on Thursday in what will be yet another test for Arteta's men.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        North Texas quarterback transfer Drew Mestemaker has committed to Oklahoma State, a source tells CBS Sports' Chris Hummer, giving the Cowboys a proven and highly coveted passer as he follows new coach Eric Morris to Stillwater from Denton.Mestemaker arrives at Oklahoma State after one of the most productive quarterback seasons in the country. In his first full year as a starter, he led the FBS in passing yards (4,379) and passing touchdowns (34), anchoring a North Texas offense that ranked among the nation's best in both yardage (512.4 yards per game) and scoring (45.1 points per game).That breakout campaign quickly elevated Mestemaker's profile in the transfer portal. He currently ranks as the No. 3 overall transfer of this cycle and the No. 3 quarterback, according to 247Sports. With three years of eligibility remaining, he offers Oklahoma State both immediate production and long-term upside at the position.Oklahoma State represents a natural destination, as Morris was Mestemaker's coach at North Texas and played a central role in his development. The established relationship should ease the transition as the Cowboys implement a new offensive system. Mestemaker will also reunite with offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Sean Brophy, who previously coached him at North Texas as well.\nMestemaker entered the transfer portal shortly after closing the season with a win in the New Mexico Bowl, a fitting ending to a year that solidified his rise from unknown walk-on to national standout. He helped guide North Texas through a dominant season that included its first double-digit win campaign (12) in program history and a trip to the American Conference Championship Game.His path to this point has been anything but conventional. Mestemaker did not start at quarterback during his preps career at Vandegrift High School in Austin, Texas, instead playing defensive back. He joined North Texas as an unheralded walk-on in 2024 and spent much of his first year developing behind the scenes. His first opportunity came in the postseason, when he earned his first career start in the First Responder Bowl after a roster change at the position. Despite the loss, his near-450 yards of total offense and three touchdowns immediately changed the perception of his potential.\nThat momentum carried into the following season. Mestemaker opened the year with an efficient and explosive performance and never relinquished control of the offense.For Oklahoma State, the timing of the commitment is significant. The Cowboys' quarterback room underwent heavy turnover following the season, with Zane Flores and Hauss Hejney both entering the transfer portal. Mestemaker steps into that void with experience in a system tied closely to Morris' offensive philosophy. Oklahoma State had the third-worst scoring offense (14.2 points per game) in the FBS this season -- a dramatic drop from the high-powered attacks those in Stillwater were accustomed to under Mike Gundy, who was fired three games into the season.Mestemaker's move could be just the beginning of a pipeline from North Texas to Oklahoma State, with the Cowboys in the mix for Mean Green running back Caleb Hawkins -- the No. 2 running back in the transfer portal -- and other key playmakers from the program.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss might lose most of its LSU-bound coaches to former coach Lane Kiffin this week, but it will keep at least one critical piece of the offensive staff in place as the Rebels prepare for the semifinals of the College Football Playoff.Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. is in Oxford and will continue leading the Rebels' offensive unit through at least this week's semifinals game, head coach Pete Golding confirmed Saturday. Weis Jr. is set to take over as LSU's OC whenever the time comes. Several position coaches, however, are expected to remain at LSU after coaching the Rebels to a thrilling 39-34 victory against Georgia in the quarterfinals on New Year's Day, sources told CBS Sports.Running backs coach Kevin Smith will not return to Oxford this week, 247Sports' Chase Parham first reported Saturday. Tight ends coach Joe Cox, receivers coach George McDonald, analyst Dan Stevens (quarterbacks) and graduate assistant Sawyer Jordan (slot receivers) are also in flux and are not expected as of Saturday to return to Ole Miss, sources told CBS Sports. They remained in Baton Rouge, helping with recruiting visitors after the transfer portal opened Friday.\nGolding, who was elevated from defensive coordinator to head coach when Kiffin bolted for LSU, did not confirm the status of the position coaches, but said he has been in \"constant\" communication with LSU and Kiffin about the staffing situation. Kiffin echoed those words in a statement to ESPN on Friday.\"They have every opportunity like they have up to this point to be able to make that decision,\" Golding said Saturday. \"So, week in and week out, I don't dictate whether they do that or not because they're not employed by me. Up to this point, that is how it's been and that's my expectation.\"Questions about Ole Miss' staff have lingered over the program since Kiffin left the program to take over at LSU on Dec. 1. He hired eight staffers from Ole Miss to his LSU staff. However, many remained in Oxford through the first two rounds of the playoff -- a 41-10 win against Tulane and the aforementioned thriller against Georgia.\nComplicating matters is the football calendar. The transfer portal opened Jan. 1 and will remain open until Jan. 16, and both schools were expected to host players for visits this weekend.FBS programs are allowed an unlimited number of staffers after previously only allowing 11 on-field coaches, which has alleviated much of the workload, Golding said.\"We've got a lot of coaches here,\" Golding said. \"That's the one thing about Division I football. This building is filled with guys that have been elite coaches everywhere they've been. Once they eliminated the rule to where there's not 10 coaches, as long as they're employed here, you can have a million coaches that can instruct on the field. So at every college across the country, a lot of guys that you all don't know by name are actually the ones instructing and teaching players, and so we have an elite staff here that's been together for a long time that knows the ins and the outs.\"\nGolding said he wasn't sure when he'd receive clarity on the staffing situation. Ole Miss departs for the Fiesta Bowl on Tuesday. Kickoff is slated for Thursday at 7:30 p.m. ET.\"It's grown people making decisions, so I have no idea,\" he said. \"So we're gonna go out there and spot the ball. We've got plenty enough people in this building that showed up this morning. We'll be just fine.\"LSU did not immediately respond to CBS Sports' request for comment.\n            ",

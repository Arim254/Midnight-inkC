    "body": "\n        All eyes will be on Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game. It's an unlikely matchup after the Patriots came into the season off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and hadn't been to the NFL playoffs since the 2021 season. Seattle hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2022 season, but made huge strides in the second season under head coach Mike Macdonald and quarterback Sam Darnold, a free-agent acquisition.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Seattle as the 4.5-point favorite, with the over/under at 45.5 points. The Seahawks are -230 money line favorites (risk $230 to win $100), while the Patriots are +190 underdogs. Darnold is the +120 favorite to win Big Game MVP, with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye second at +240. SportsLine's NFL experts teamed up to give exact score projections for the Big Game, and while they're unanimously backing the Seahawks to win, their score predictions lead to some different spread and total picks. \nThe team of NFL betting experts includes R.J. White, who is SportsLine's all-time No. 1 NFL spread expert and Larry Hartstein, who enters the game on a 43-33 run on NFL ATS picks (+596). Other NFL betting experts featured include Alex 'PropStarz' Selesnick, who is on a 62-44 (+916) roll on NFL player props and Jeff Hochman, who is 83-66-3 (plus +1217) over the past four NFL seasons.Now, SportsLine's NFL experts have analyzed the NFL odds and locked in their final score predictions for Seahawks vs. Patriots. Patriots vs. Seahawks score predictionsR.J. White Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 19, Patriots 16\"The last four Big Games have seen both teams get to 20 points, but I think there's a chance touchdowns will be hard to come by in this game. The Seahawks defense is elite, allowing just two touchdowns in the six games since Week 12 where they haven't faced the Rams. The Patriots defense has risen to that level in the postseason thanks to getting key players back in the front seven as well as playcaller Zak Kuhr putting on a masterclass each week. There's no denying the talent on these offenses, but I see two defensive units that will be tough to crack in the red zone and a lot of kicking points in this game.\" New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and target the Patriots +4.5: \nLarry Hartstein Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\"It's been four months since a team not named the Rams excelled offensively versus Seattle's No. 1 defense. Unless Drake Maye runs wild, I have a hard time seeing the Patriots getting to 20 points. New England's defense is stout too, with a front that shuts down the run and Christian Gonzalez patrolling the back end. But Seattle has better weapons, led by the unstoppable Jaxon-Smith Njigba. He, Rashid Shaheed and Cooper Kupp will make enough plays to complete the Sam Darnold redemption story.\" You can bet Seahawks (-4.5) at DraftKings:\nJeff HochmanBig Game score prediction: Seahawks 27, Patriots 20\"Seattle's edge in Net Yards Per Play (+1.4 vs. +1.0) is even more impressive considering they played the fourth-toughest schedule, while New England had the league's easiest. Since 2000, just four teams have captured the title with a negative sack differential, while teams with a +20 or higher sack differential -- such as Seattle -- have won six times. The Patriots' sack differential of -13 is the lowest ever for a championship team in this span. After monitoring both teams all season, Seattle appears superior in every phase: offense, defense and special teams.\" You can go Over on the total (45.5) at DraftKings:\nAlex 'PropStarz' Selesnick Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 19\"This looks like a game where both offenses could find it difficult to score touchdowns. New Englands defense has been dominant through the playoffs and features the type of scheme and personnel that could potentially give Sam Darnold fits coupled with limiting Seattle's run game. I also expect Mike McDonald's defense to make life really difficult on Drake Maye who has not been same player that was a bonafide MVP candidate through the entirety of the regular season. I think this is ultimately a low scoring game decided by 4 points or less. The Seahawks have been very fortunate in high leverage situations and I do expect some major regression in the turnover department, however that may not come to fruition until next season. Seattle feels like a team of destiny.\" You can pick Under (45.5) the total at DraftKings:\nHow to get more Patriots vs. Seahawks picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Patriots 10,000 times and revealed its picks. See who wins and covers the spread here, all from the model that's on a 53-37 roll on top-rated NFL picks. \n            ",

North Carolina has dropped three games against conference opponents and nearly blew a 32-point lead against Syracuse on Monday. The Blue Devils are led by one of the best freshmen in college basketball, as Cameron Boozer ranks second nationally with 23.3 points per game.

The Bulls added Jaden Ivey from the Pistons and Anfernee Simons from the Celtics, giving them more firepower to keep pace with Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets. Jokic had 30 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists against the Knicks on Wednesday. The Nuggets have gone Over in five straight games, and these teams have gone Over in five straight head-to-head meetings.

They have feasted on the bottom of the Big Ten, inflating their defensive stats,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"When faced with a Tier-1 offense (like Michigan's), their defense cracked. Illinois presents an even more potent offensive challenge than Michigan. Close Game Separation Metrics heavily favor Illinois. In tight games, Illinois has consistently executed in the half-court, whereas Michigan State has suffered from subpar backcourt play from everyone not named Jeremy Fears Jr. Illinois has validated these numbers away from home. Their Strength of Schedule adjusted performance includes road wins at Purdue and Nebraska—two of the toughest environments in the Big Ten. I like the road team in this spot.\" Back Illinois at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Saturday.

In the main event, Mario Bautista and Vinicius Oliveira will clash in a bantamweight fight.Bautista has been in a series of high-profile fights, winning a narrow decision over Jose Aldo, defeating Patchy Mix and then coming up short in a pivotal bout with Umar Nurmagomedov. Against Nurmagomedov, Bautista nearly found a stoppage, locking in a deep leg lock before ultimately losing on all three official scorecards.In Oliveira, Bautista is facing a man looking for those same opportunities. A wild striker, Oliveira feels like he's being ducked by the best of the best at 135 pounds and a win could force those fights to come to fruition.Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC Fight Night LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n            \n    \n        The 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, will run from Friday, Feb. 6 through Sunday, Feb. 22. Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

Gore spent parts of eight seasons in Major League Baseball. While he logged just 85 total plate appearances in those eight seasons with the Royals, Cubs, Dodgers, and Mets, his elite speed and base-running smarts made him a bench weapon in three different postseasons. For his career, Gore batted .216/.310/.270 with 43 stolen bases in 52 attempts and time spent at all three outfield positions. In the playoffs, Gore played in 11 games, each time as a pinch-runner. While he batted just twice in postseason play, he also stole five bases in six attempts and scored three runs. One of those runs came in Game 2 of the 2014 World Series, a series that the Royals eventually lost to the Giants in seven games. The next year, Gore earned a World Series ring as a member of those same Royals, the team that originally drafted him with a 20th-round selection in 2011. Gore was also a member of the Dodgers in 2020 and, for a time, on their playoff roster, but he did not appear in a playoff game during Los Angeles' run to the title in that COVID-abbreviated season. As well, Gore appeared in a playoff game for the Braves in 2021, when they went on to win the World Series. \nA Georgia native, Gore attended college in Panama City, Florida. According to MLB.com, Gore is survived by his wife and three children, who live in Panama City. At the time of his passing, Gore was working as a baseball trainer and also coaching his son's youth team. \n            \n    ",

After trailing by as many as 13 points in the second half, No. 14 North Carolina rallied down the stretch to secure a dramatic 71-68 win over No. 4 Duke after star guard Seth Trimble knocked down a 3-pointer before the buzzer sounded. But the drama was hardly over.After Trimble hit his shot, the clock showed nothing but zeros and North Carolina fans stormed the court. Following a video review, it was determined there was time remaining on the clock (0.4 seconds) for Duke. That meant all the fans had to be cleared off the court before they stormed it again when the game was (officially) final.In the midst of the court storm(s), Duke coach Jon Scheyer described the situation as a \"scary ending\" while saying that members of his staff got \"punched in the face.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Anatomy of a comeback: How UNC overcame its largest deficit in 25 years vs. Duke to stun Blue Devils\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"It's hard to talk about the game when I was most concerned for the safety of our players,\" Scheyer said in his postgame press conference. \"I don't wanna make it about that because Carolina, they played a great game to win. And that's a heartbreaking loss for our team. I got staff members that got punched in the face. My family, pushing people away trying to not get trampled. That's not what this game is about. ... That was a scary ending.\"\nNorth Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham apologized after the game for the court storming and confirmed at least one person was injured.\"Rivalry games are tremendous,\" Cunningham said. \"Court stormings are absolutely fabulous. It's really tough. I feel for our event staff. When they rushed the court, a number of people got knocked over. But then we had to clear the court again. So, when we normally have something like just rushing the court when the game is over we do have a line by the benches to get people off safely. Again, I apologize to (Scheyer), his family and obviously if someone got injured, that's really disappointing.\"\nThis weekend wasn't the first time Duke has been on the wrong side of a court storming. In 2024, former Duke star Kyle Filipowski injured his knee after Wake Forest fans rushed to the center of the floor following an upset win. \n            \n    ",

I'm looking forward to getting things worked out so George can be a Cowboy [for] a long time.\"Pickens was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft. After three productive seasons in Pittsburgh, he was traded to Dallas.\nThis past season, Pickens had the best year of his career, catching 93 passes for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns as the Cowboys went 7-9-1 and missed the playoffs. He was selected for the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career.Pickens' counterpart, fellow elite receiver CeeDee Lamb recently said that he would have no problem should Pickens end up with a larger contract than his own.\n\"I don't care about that, I just want my man to get what he deserves,\" Lamb said during Super Bowl radio row. \"As for me, I know I'm good. I'm fine. Me and my family, we're straight, and I just want to compete at the highest level and I want to compete for a ring. \"The money will come if you play good, so just play good and let everything else take care of itself.

    "body": "\n        Coming into the season, Liverpool hosting Manchester City at home was one of the matches that was circled on the fixture list. Expected to be a fight for the title, it's still a significant match, just not in the way that either manager would've expected it to be. Manchester City are in second place in the league but an astonishing nine points behind Arsenal for first place. It's already a pipe dream for Pep Guardiola's men to come back and win the title, but if they don't win this game and the gap grows beyond nine points in the coming weeks, it's all but over.How to watch Liverpool vs. Manchester City, oddsDate: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 11:30 a.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool, England Live stream: PeacockOdds: Liverpool +125; Draw +270; Mancehster City +190For Arne Slot's Liverpool, things are equally critical. The Reds are in sixth place, four points off the pace of Chelsea with a game in hand. At risk of missing the Champions League next season, pressure is building by the day. Liverpool's form has improved in some ways, but it hasn't led to wins, with just one victory in their last five league matches. They only have one loss in that span as well, but draws won't be good enough with Chelsea and Manchester United surging ahead of them. All eyes will be on Florian Wirtz and Erling Haaland, who are also two players going in different directions. Wirtz is playing some of his best soccer in a Liverpool shirt with a goal and an assist in his last match, a 4-1 victory over Newcastle United, while Haaland is riding a scoring slump. A player who has been compared to a cyborg due to how automatic finding the back of the net is for the Norwegian, it's easy to miss that he has only scored once in his last five Premier League matches.\nIt has become quite a pronounced slump as the chart below shows, with his shot quality, expected goals per 90 minutes, and every significant attacking stat has dropped off.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            It's hard to explain exactly why as well. In Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden, there's no lack of quality service into the box, but minutes could be catching up to Haaland. He has played over 2,700 minutes across all competitions as he's the first, second, and third best option to put the ball in the back of the net for City. With 27 goals and five assists in all competitions, he has done that quite well, but it also makes this current slump even more pronounced. Only two of those goals and one assist have come in 2026, showing just how hot his start to the season was.\nBut Manchester City can't afford slumps from him. Even with Antoine Semenyo fitting into the attack well, Haaland is the one who will determine the fortunes of this squad. Liverpool will do everything that they can to make the slump continue, but this is where the chess match between Slot and Guardiola will be critical, as no one will want to lose this match. But will either win it and potentially kickstart a second half run?\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Jungle serenaded Charles Bediako with \"G League dropout\" amid his ongoing eligibility case, but it was former Auburn guard Aden Holloway who helped Bediako and the Crimson Tide notch the last laugh in Saturday's Iron Bowl of Basketball. Alabama knocked off Auburn 96-92 behind nine straight points from Holloway in the final three minutes. Holloway, who jumped into enemy lines when he transferred from Auburn to Alabama ahead of the 2023-24 season, delivered the dagger with a four-point play right in front of Auburn's raucous student section.The road team has now won each of the past three iterations of the Iron Bowl of Basketball. For Alabama, it's a coming-of-age caliber of victory for a team that has not played 40 good minutes just once in the past month or so with injuries eliminating any ounce of lineup continuity and the Bediako debacle looming over each day.Bediako was in court Friday for his lawsuit against the NCAA, but since Tuscaloosa Circuit Court Judge Daniel Pruet didn't deliver a ruling, he was allowed to suit up for Alabama for at least one more day. The 7-footer came off the bench and delivered 12 points and three boards in 22 minutes, just over 24 hours after listening to the NCAA lawyers argue for him to be barred from college basketball.\n\"If we're being intellectually honest, it's about money,\" NCAA lawyer Taylor Askew argued in Friday's hearing as a rebuttal to Bediako's representatives' claim that his client would lose out on basketball and educational opportunities if Bediako's temporary injunction for the rest of the year was not approved.\nAlabama's March Madness upside is certainly lower without Bediako, because Saturday showed what the Tide is capable of if they can keep Bediako in the lineup and start to gel.Future NBA lead guard Labaron Philon delivered a brilliant 25-point, six-assist, five-rebound showing. Future NBA wing Amari Allen was awesome, burying three triples and finishing with 17 points. Add in a former professional center in Bediako, and Alabama has three pros at three different positions. Oh, and Holloway. Oh, and Houston Mallette is one of many Alabama snipers who can have a big day as well. He canned two massive triples at the end of the first half to help erase Auburn's 10-point advantage.The Jungle gave Alabama its best growl, but Alabama's showing spoke volumes.\n\"They were pretty quiet when we left today,\" Crimson Tide coach Nate Oats said. \n            ",

Club America were able to secure a victory over the Honduran side Olimpia, but with five Liga MX sides in action during the week, only two left their matches with victories. Their competition this weekend, Monterrey are one of those sides who struggled and hope to get back on trackHere's what to know about a huge game in this Liga MX season:How to watch Club America vs. Monterrey, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 7 | Time: 10:10 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes -- Mexico City, MexicoLive stream: CBS Sports Golazo Network Odds: Club America -116; Draw +260; Monterrey +310Drawing against Guatemalan club Xelaju MC in the Champions Cup, the lack of German Berterame in the Monterrey lineup was a stark difference in their attack. Crosses from Luca Orellano and Lucas Ocampos weren't met by anyone in the middle as the Mexican striker's departure for Inter Miami showed. His replacement has already been signed in Uros Djurdjevic. While he wasn't available for Champions Cup play, there is a chance that the Montenegrin striker could make his debut for the club while facing America in a tough matchup.Joining from Atlas, Djurdjevic was able to perform despite being on a struggling team, and he'll now need to bring his goals to the high-pressure environment that is the Monterrey attack. Looking at the chart below, there was a point at which he was overperforming his expected goals. Djurdjevic has been a forward who puts away the chances that are provided to him, which is just what Monterrey need at this moment.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            America have only allowed two goals in their four league matches played so far during the Clausura portion of the season, so chances will be hard to come by for Monterrey, but if they want to return to the top as Mexican champions, winning games like this one will be critical. They'll need to take care of business while balancing multiple games in a week, but when America have    the same issue, they're on an even playing field for what should be an excellent match in Mexico City.Liga MX scores and schedule All times Eastern.Friday, Feb. 6\nTigres UNAL 5, Santos Laguna 1Necaxa 4, Atletico San Luis 1Club Tijuana 0, Santos Laguna 0Mazaltán 1, Chivas Guadalajara 2Saturday, Feb. 7Querétaro vs. Club León, 6 p.m.Toluca vs. Cruz Azul, 6 p.m.Atlas vs. Pumas UNAM, 8:05 p.m.Pachuca vs. Juárez, 8:06 p.m.Club America vs. Monterrey, 10:10 p.m. (CBS Sports Golazo Network)\n            \n    ",

Anthony, who is averaging 8.9 points and 1.6 rebounds during the 2025-26 season, has appeared in 23 games (two starts) and has been the Orange's leading scorer off the bench.Despite that, Anthony didn't play in the key ACC matchup against the Cavaliers. The reason why? It was the decision of Syracuse coach Adrian Autry, who stated that the reason Anthony didn't play was not due to an injury.\"It was my decision,\" Autry said. \"This is a physical team, experienced team and it was just my decision. Nothing else. No injuries or anything like that. No narratives about any of this stuff. Again, I made a decision that was my decision today.\"\nAnthony not playing for the first time this season comes days after he logged just 16 minutes against North Carolina earlier this week. In that game against the Tar Heels during an 87-77 loss, Anthony scored 10 points, which was the fourth-most on the team behind Donnie Freeman, Naithan George and J.J. Starling. Syracuse trailed by as many as 32 points before cutting the deficit to six in the final minute.The elder Anthony likely isn't going to be to happy wit the latest development after he appeared to voice his frustration after his alma mater lost to UNC earlier this week. He commented \"SMFH\" on a post from the official Syracuse basketball account on Instagram after the Orange lost to UNC 87-77 on Monday.\nSyracuse sits at 13-11 overall (4-7 ACC) after the loss to Virginia. The Orange are tracking to miss the NCAA Tournament for the fifth consecutive season.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Jeremy Fears Jr. made history but didn't make any new friends in Big Ten country Saturday. The Michigan State point guard etched himself in Spartan lore with a 26-point, 15-assist showing to help No. 10 MSU outlast No. 5 Illinois 85-82 in an overtime thriller.For a program that has housed legendary point guards like Magic and Cleaves and Cassius and Valentine, it's Fears who will stand alone as the first Michigan State player ever to notch multiple 15-dime games. He did it in the last two weeks.The same 14-day span where Fears has turned into a legitimate All-American contender and one of college basketball's biggest villains after numerous acts that span between reckless, shady and downright dirty. \n        \n            \n                College basketball scores, winners and losers: North Carolina, Kentucky, Alabama rally to win rivalry games\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFears attempted to trip Michigan star Yaxel Lendeborg on Jan. 30 in a move that Wolverines coach Dusty May dubbed intentional. He kicked Minnesota's Langston Reynolds in the groin in Michigan State's 76-73 loss in a move that earned him a technical, a tongue-lashing from Tom Izzo and a warning that he might not even start against Illinois. \nBut on gameday, Fears was back in the starting five and involved in another controversy. Fears drew 14 fouls, but it was a play that didn't earn a whistle that had Illinois' bench riled up. Fears appeared to trip Illini big man David Mirkovic on a runout in the open floor, but after review, it was not upgraded to a flagrant foul.\"There was nothing on the trip, they looked at it,\" Illinois coach Brad Underwood said in the postgame press conference. \"It's always going to be a judgmental thing. He stops. It's what he does. But yeah, he was terrific. We didn't do a very good job of squaring him up. He plays with great speed and pace. I was disappointed in the fact that we fouled him that much. He's not a very good shooter, and we wanted him to have to shoot the ball in even if it was a layup. He's crafty, he's smart and did a nice job tonight.\"\nThis saga feels far from over, but one thing is clear: Fears' debt to his team has been repaid.\nHis actions against Minnesota objectively cost his team the game, but the Spartans don't beat the big, bad Illini without him. \"To be honest, it was kind of rough,\" Fears told Fox in a postgame, on-court interview. \"That's not my character. That's not who I am. I want to be able to help my team. I wasn't able to help my team in the last few games. I wanted to help my team get the win today. No matter what.\"Fears scored 22 of his 26 after halftime, including a remarkable 11 points in overtime. Illinois battled brilliantly in the Breslin Center until the very last second, showing it has what it takes to be heard from in the chase for a Big Ten Championship and a Final Four, but it could not defend without fouling in the final moments. For Fears, drawing fouls is an art of sorts, even if it drives the opposition into a tizzy (or to another swig from the bottle). \nFears told CBS Sports at Big Ten Media Days that he studies the rulebook intently, trying to understand and/or uncover any tricks of the trade that will get him to the free throw line. He shot 13 more free throws in Saturday's victory, bringing his season total to a whopping 148. It's the fifth time this season that Fears has double-digit attempts from the charity stripe, and no Big Ten player is drawing more fouls per 40 minutes than Fears (7.2), according to KenPom.com\"This team has confidence in each other; we've played bad, we got controversy, distractions,\" Izzo said. \"The best way to stick ahead is avoid dirtbags and distractions.\"Let the bobbing and weaving begin even more because the microscope on Fears isn't going away.\nSomewhere, in another life, Fears just toed the free-throw line yet again.Cash.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons are barreling toward another quarterback reset, and this one may finally bring clarity -- not just for the future of the position, but for Kirk Cousins' next act as well. According to ESPN, the Falcons are expected to release Cousins before the start of the new league year in March, a move that would allow the veteran quarterback to choose his next destination -- or decide whether he wants one at all -- while reopening the quarterback picture in Atlanta.That uncertainty looms especially large for Michael Penix Jr., the 2024 first-round pick who is recovering from a torn left ACL suffered in November. With a new front office and coaching staff now in place, Atlanta has yet to commit to Penix as its long-term starter, making Cousins' contractual situation one of the first dominoes to reportedly fall in defining the position's future.Atlanta recently restructured Cousins' contract in a way that made a breakup feel inevitable. His 2026 base salary was slashed from $35 million to $2.1 million, with the remaining $32.9 million pushed into 2027. That 2027 salary balloons to $67.9 million and becomes fully guaranteed if Cousins is still on the roster when the league year begins in mid-March. The Falcons, not surprisingly, are expected to avoid that scenario.Releasing Cousins gives Atlanta financial flexibility and gives Cousins something he has long valued: control. Few quarterbacks have navigated free agency better than the 37-year-old, who has consistently landed fully guaranteed deals. Whether that market still exists is an open question, but Cousins is expected to be open to continuing his playing career, while also weighing television opportunities -- including a postseason appearance on NFL on CBS -- and even retirement.\nOn the field, Cousins' stint in Atlanta was uneven but not ineffective. He completed 61% of his passes for 1,721 yards with 10 touchdowns and five interceptions this past season, going 5-3 in his starts. In 2024, Cousins opened the year as Atlanta's starter and made 14 starts before eventually ceding the job to Penix.That instability carried into 2025, when Penix started nine games before his season-ending knee injury forced Cousins back into the lineup. The Falcons went 3-6 with Penix under center, a split that only added to the questions facing the new regime.Those questions intensified after the Falcons fired coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot following a second straight 8-9 season. Atlanta hired Kevin Stefanski as coach and Ian Cunningham as general manager under new president of football Matt Ryan, who spent 14 seasons with the franchise and led it to a Super Bowl LI appearance. \nPenix has said he expects to be ready for the 2026 season opener, but Ryan has been careful not to anoint him the starter.\"Neither of us are the head coach of the football team, so we can't answer your question on that,\" Ryan said earlier this week while introducing general manager Ian Cunningham. \"But I think all of us are going to get together. Ian's been a part of it for, I guess, three days, and has had a lot on his plate during that time. I think as we start to get into this process and dive deeper into the roster, how it currently stands, where it's going in the future, I think those are conversations that'll be a part of it.\"Cousins' release would formally reopen the quarterback door in Atlanta. For Penix, it means opportunity paired with uncertainty. For Cousins, it means freedom. And for the Falcons, it underscores how unresolved the most important position on the roster remains, even as one expensive chapter appears ready to close.\n            ",

    "body": "\nIt is hard to deny the advantages that Manchester City carry into the second leg of the EFL Cup semifinals – a two-goal lead is a healthy cushion to take into Wednesday's match against Newcastle United, and playing at home can't hurt. City, though, have more than clichés about 2-0 leads to worry about with a cup final within touching distance. Few things seem to be going right for Pep Guardiola's side these days, victory on Wednesday no sure thing for a team that was once the definition of utter dominance.The skid that essentially began with a weeks-long losing streak in the fall of 2024 has not exactly dissipated in the year-plus since, despite City's attempts to change things up. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent on transfer fees and some stylistic changes from Guardiola have not stopped the bleeding just yet, victories slipping out of reach in surprising ways. Sunday's 2-2 draw at Tottenham Hotspur, a game in which they boasted a 2-0 lead at halftime, leaves them with just four wins in their last 10 and a wide range of questions as to why this keeps happening, questions Guardiola does not exactly have answers to.The weirdest thing about City's slump is that it is hard to explain at times, in part because the reimagining of the squad makes sense in a lot of ways. A handful of the players they have signed in the last year address genuine issues like Marc Guehi, the ex-Crystal Palace defender who should help shore up a vulnerable defense. The headlining acts of City's refreshed roster, though, are in attack – summer addition Rayan Cherki and January signing Antonie Semenyo, each of whom have quickly become dependable during an unexpected rough patch.How to watch Manchester City vs. Newcastle United, oddsDate: Wednesday, Feb. 4 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Etihad Stadium -- Manchester, EnglandLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Manchester City -135; Draw +285; Newcastle United +310City are still the Premier League's best attacking side but their offense is overly reliant on Erling Haaland, who runs hot and cold like many strikers do. He still has 20 goals in the league but has just two across all competitions in his last 11, It is not exactly down to a lack of productivity on City's part – the team's expected goals per game average has slipped during Haaland's cold streak to 1.6, but only slightly from their overall season average of 1.8, and they score at roughly the same frequency they always have. Haaland himself, though, is more absent than he was at the start of the season – he has averaged 0.4 expected goals per game in his last 11, down from his season average of 0.7.Cherki and Semenyo have done their best to fill in the gaps, alongside academy product Phil Foden and another summer signing in Tijjani Reijnders. The quartet have jointly scored 29 goals across all competitions – just two more as a group than Haaland on his own, a reminder that an overreliance on a player of his caliber sometimes papers over the cracks. Cherki, Reijnders and Semenyo have picked up the slack during Haaland's cold streak. France international Cherki has quickly become the star of City's show with five goals and three assists in the team's last 11 games, filling in as a dependable goalscorer when Haaland cannot and ensuring his first season with City is off to a strong start despite being sidelined with an injury at the beginning of the season. Semenyo, too, has hit the ground running since joining last month with four goals and one assist to start his City tenure.\"I think it stems from the players,\" Semenyo told CBS Sports Golazo Network's Morning Footy this week. \"The players made me feel very comfortable. They helped me make it feel easier for myself and then you've obviously got the coaches, as well. They're guiding me every day, giving me little tips on improving my game and obviously getting used to the system but it's been very, very easy. Everyone's made it very easy for me to settle in and you have to learn on the go. I mean, I've had to do that practically all my life – my football career, I should say so it's not anything new to me.\"That includes Haaland, even if he joked upon Semenyo's arrival that the ex-Bournemouth player was \"coming for my golden boot.\" The newcomer said his new teammate has been very welcoming, even as a sense of friendly competition begins to define their relationship.\"He's made me feel so comfortable,\" Semenyo said. \"He's a loud character in the changing room, very vocal but he's made me feel the most comfortable, I should say, from day one. Before that clip even came out, he was just saying, 'It's great to have you here' … [We'll] compete for top goalscorer as well so it's nice, friendly competition but I'm glad he's my teammate.\"Even as things go sideways for City in the Premier League, Semenyo is quickly proving his worth while he and Cherki add much-needed dimension to an attack that is sometimes one-note when Haaland does all the work. It is not exactly a foolproof strategy to survive Haaland's slump – they have gone goalless twice in their last 11, their 2-0 loss to Manchester United the most clear example of the Norway international's oversized presence in City's attack.The pair, though, ensure City have a chance in most of their outings, with or without Haaland. Defensive resilience – or a lack thereof – is emerging as the next major area of improvement for Guardiola's side, Guehi merely one step in addressing an issue exacerbated by a batch of injuries. Newcastle will like their chances against a vulnerable City, who are undoubtedly in a funk but in Semenyo and Cherki have the type the players to snap out of this run, at least in the short term.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tuesday afternoon gave us our first stunner of the 2026 NBA trade deadline in the Jaren Jackson Jr. deal, and now, we have yet another blockbuster. Darius Garland is headed for the Los Angeles Clippers along with a second-round pick. James Harden is joining the Cleveland Cavaliers. It is one of the most surprising trade the NBA has given us since, well, last February, when the Dallas Mavericks sent Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers in the dead of night for Anthony Davis in a move so controversial it eventually got their general manager fired.Just by virtue of the ages of the principle figures here, this trade will almost certainly be compared to that one. Part of what made the Dončić trade so unusual was that the Mavericks gave up a 25-year-old for a 31-year-old. Well, the age-gap here is even bigger. Harden is 36. Garland is 26.So... is this deal as bad for Cleveland as that one was for Dallas? Or did the Cavaliers have more justifiable reasons for making their point guard swap? Let's grade the deal below:\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Cavaliers: COn first glance, this trade makes no sense for Cleveland. Rarely does it ever make sense to trade a 26-year-old for a 36-year-old. Garland is a homegrown All-Star who was critical to Cleveland's 64-win season a year ago. The more you look at it, though, the more Cleveland's logic starts to come into focus.\nThe Cavaliers have now had Garland in the building for seven years. They've seen him play 70 games just once, last season, which was ultimately ruined by a toe injury. That same toe injury lingered into this year. Garland has not played since Jan. 14, and while he had picked things up in the weeks before then, his season overall had been a mess. It is entirely possible that Cleveland simply looked at Garland and decided he was unlikely to remain healthy moving forward.That was a significant problem for them in financial terms. They're a second-apron team as is. Jarrett Allen gets more expensive on an extension next season. Donovan Mitchell will presumably re-sign on a supermax deal in the summer of 2027, and Evan Mobley got a Rose Rule max after winning Defensive Player of the Year last season. They simply were not equipped to continue paying Garland max money. He has two years left on his original max contract after this one, and he is eligible for an extension this offseason.Cleveland could have waited things out. Maybe Garland would have stayed healthy in the playoffs. Maybe he would have been amenable to a pay cut. But we live in a world in which Trae Young just got cap dumped and Ja Morant is almost untradeable. The landscape just isn't kind for small guards right now. The Cavaliers seemingly didn't want to risk getting stuck with a max contract they didn't want. Perhaps they could have gotten draft picks for Garland elsewhere, but that probably would have meant taking back bad money. With so much invested in winning this season, that wasn't tenable.\nSo instead, they took a player who will probably make them better this season. For all of his foibles, James Harden is durable. He's been a better player than Garland this season, and he'll take a significant burden off of Donovan Mitchell's shoulders to create every shot. Big men thrive next to Harden. Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley are about to get some of the easiest shots of their life. Harden is bigger than Garland, so while he may not be a star defender, he's easier to hide in the context of an overall scheme. And, most importantly, he's cheaper. They make roughly the same money this season, but Harden only has next year left on his deal, and it's only partially guaranteed for $13.3 million. Just given his age, he's not going to command the sort of long-term money Garland would. Cleveland can now go for it this year and next and then reset its books in the summer of 2027, when Harden expires and Mitchell's new deal begins.So, yes, in a perfect world, you really shouldn't trade a 26-year-old for a 36-year-old. Under the narrow circumstances that Cleveland found itself in, it's defensible. The Cavaliers simply couldn't score when Mitchell went to the bench. Now they can. They haven't been able to rely on Garland to stay healthy. Harden tends to stay healthy. They're holding their nose and hoping Harden doesn't have another of his playoff collapses, but all things considered, they probably made this year's team better and they got out of a contract they seemed to want no part of paying. Confusing as it looks on paper, it makes enough sense to take the plunge. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Clippers: AAll of those risks that the Cavaliers wanted to avoid with Garland apply to the Clippers. He might not be able to stay healthy. He might be overpaid on his contract. As a league, we might be moving away from small guards as centerpieces of championship teams. But this is an enormously simple calculation. The Clippers entered this week as a Play-In team with the NBA's oldest roster and no control over their next four first-round picks. Their future was hopeless. It was just a matter of when Harden and Kawhi Leonard finally broke down.\nGarland is not the salvation the other Los Angeles team got when it was handed Luka Dončić on a silver platter, but the principle is similar. The Lakers were old and going nowhere. Getting Dončić at least gave them direction, an early-prime player to build around as it figured out how to pivot from the last era into the next one. The Clippers badly needed something like that. Garland is their chance at it, and not only did they acquire him, they managed to get a draft pick in the process. That would have felt unthinkable earlier in the season. It wasn't long ago when we assumed the price for Garland might be, say, a Trey Murphy-esque wing, or a package of several first-round picks. The Clippers got him for an older player who wasn't long for their team anyway.The financial risks to the Clippers are far lighter than they were to the Cavaliers. Los Angeles doesn't have a Mobley or a Mitchell to pay. In fact, Garland is now one of only two players on the roster with a guaranteed contract in the summer of 2027 along with Ivica Zubac, their 28-year-old center. Neither player is equipped to be the best player on a contender, but both would be valuable supporting pieces for whoever that player turns out to be. Los Angeles is fertile recruiting ground. The Clippers will have all of the financial flexibility they need to rebuild their roster. And as time passes -- assuming the Aspiration investigation doesn't lead to a severe punishment -- they'll start to regain access to future draft picks to trade. Eventually, the plan will presumably be to either sign a star to play next to Garland and Zubac or use their draft picks to trade for that player. That might not have been possible without Garland. You typically need some young talent in place to convince stars to play for you.\nSo it might not be the obvious home run the Lakers got in Dončić, but it's about as straightforward a win as the Clippers could have reasonably hoped for. They have a future now, or at least a blueprint to build one. If it goes belly up, so what? The time in which Harden and Leonard could have led them to a championship had long passed. Whether they waived his partially guaranteed contract this summer or let his contract expire fully in 2027, the Clippers weren't keeping much longer anyway. Turning him into someone who might be a cornerstone is an absolute no-brainer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If you didn't have access to a calendar, you might've accidentally mistaken the madness that occurred on Tuesday in the NBA as the trade deadline. It all started when the Memphis Grizzlies made a stunning trade that saw star big man Jaren Jackson Jr. go to the Utah Jazz in a package centered around three first-round picks. Later in the day, the Los Angeles Clippers traded James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Darius Garland, swapping star guards in one of the more surprising trades in NBA deadline history. In between all that, Boston added a big man, the Timberwolves dumped Mike Conley's contract and the Pistons sold on former top-five pick Jaden Ivey. And so began the madness, two days before Thursday's official trade deadline (3 p.m. ET). Last year saw one of the most chaotic trade deadlines in league history. Among the players dealt last season before the deadline were Luka Dončić, Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler. This year won't have a Luke stunner, but the name power is creeping up there -- headlined, of course, by Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who appears to have decided he is ready for a change of scenery. \nIf the Bucks indeed deal the two-time NBA MVP, will it be to the Miami Heat, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves, or perhaps even a surprise suitor? In short, this year's deadline will revolve around Antetokounmpo.\n        \n            \n                Jaren Jackson Jr. trade grades: Why Grizzlies earn slightly better mark than Jazz\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMore moves are certain to roll in before fans and teams need to set their (trade machines) pencils down until the summer. Here are five storylines to keep an eye on heading into Thursday.Does Giannis get traded?Antetokounmpo is the player dictating the deadline and what happens because how often is a multi-time league MVP available for trade? The Bucks and Antetokounmpo have been dancing around a potential breakup for what seems like years now. If it doesn't happen this week, it appears inevitable that this partnership is heading toward a divorce.\nSo, if the Bucks trade him, where is he going? According to multiple reports, the most likely suitors are the Heat, Timberwolves and Warriors, although the New York Knicks have been mentioned multiple times since last summer. If you want to read about what a potential trade might look like with any of those teams, my colleague Sam Quinn has you covered with mock trades.\n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo mock trades: How Knicks, Warriors, more could entice Bucks with wild multi-team deals\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf the Warriors do trade for Antetokounmpo, it would likely mean parting ways with either Draymond Green or Jimmy Butler. ESPN reported on Tuesday that Greenhas been involved in \"active trade conversation\" ahead of Thursday's trade deadline. Green has been with the Warriors for 14 seasons and is the second-longest-tenured player behind Stephen Curry. A Curry/Antetokounmpo pairing would be enticing for basketball fans. If it's Minnesota, it's likely a duo of Anthony Edwards/Antetokounmpo. If it's Miami, that means the Heat would have their frontcourt solidified with Antetokounmpo and Bam Adebayo.We'll find out soon if the Bucks are actually ready to break up with Antetokounmpo. \nWhat's next for the Warriors?If the Warriors don't win the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes, what's next? Golden State is flirting with being in the play-in this spring. The Warriors sit at 27-23 -- good enough for No. 8 in the Western Conference -- ahead of the trade deadline. The Warriors are 3.0 games behind the Lakers for the No. 6 spot in the West.Golden State's season was altered earlier this month when Butler suffered a torn ACL. Without him, the Warriors don't have a bona fide star next to Curry. The reality of the situation is Curry continues to play at an elite level nightly, but without true help it will go down as a lost season. \n        \n            \n                Once-in-a-lifetime pairing: Stephen Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo would be a match made in basketball heaven\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe name talked about on this roster as much as anyone (outside of Curry) has been Jonathan Kuminga. The 23-year-old forward signed a two-year deal last summer to return to the franchise after an intense negotiation that came with him being a restricted free agent. As Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. said last month, \"there needs to be demand on the market\" for a trade to happen.\nOne of the only teams that has maintained strong interest in Kuminga is the Sacramento Kings. If Kuminga is on the roster after Thursday, get ready for more rumors and talk in the coming months. Kuminga has a club option for the 2026-27 season for $24.3 million.Grizzlies firesale?The Grizzlies roster that lost in the first round of the 2023 NBA Playoffs to the Lakers as the No. 2 seed in the West looks drastically different than it does now. Dillon Brooks is now a member of the Phoenix Suns and has been a key piece in turning things around this season. Desmond Bane was traded to the Orlando Magic last offseason and went for an incredible haul of draft picks. Jackson was traded to Utah just over 48 hours before the deadline for a package centered around first-round picks.The name to know ahead of the deadline is Ja Morant. The Grizzlies' star point guard could be the next player from that core to depart as Memphis takes the next step toward a full-on rebuild. One suitor for Morant's service could be the Kings. Sacramento has been mentioned as one of the few teams that could get in the \"Morant business\" before the deadline, The Athletic reported on Tuesday.\n\n        \n            \n                Grizzlies trade Jaren Jackson Jr. and others to Jazz for four players, three first-round picks, per reports\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMorant, 26, is averaging 19.5 points, 8.1 assists and 3.3 rebounds in 20 games for Memphis this season. Morant hasn't played since Jan. 21 after suffering a sprained UCL in his left elbow in a loss to the Atlanta Hawks. At the time, Memphis announced that Morant would be re-evaluated in three weeks, which ruled him out until after the NBA trade deadline.If Morant is traded, all eyes will be on the lottery in May. If the season ended today, Memphis would have the ninth-best odds to land No. 1.Who else could be a seller at the deadline?Though we just mentioned them as possible destinations for Morant or Kuminga, the Kings also profile as potential sellers. They have the worst record in the NBA and that's with a veteran-heavy roster headlined by Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Malik Monk and LaVine. Might any of those players get dealt between now and Thursday? W\nThe problem working against Sacramento is the size of all those contracts. Sabonis has two more years on his contract after this season. DeRozan is set to make $25.7 million during the 2026-27 campaign, although only $10 million of that is guaranteed. LaVine has a player option worth nearly $50 million that seems likely to get picked up this summer.\n        \n            \n                Five NBA trade deadline bold predictions: Knicks make a blockbuster, Cavs shake things up, big names stay put\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe most notable reported suitor for Sabonis has been the Raptors. The name that has been widely reported as one who could head back Sacramento's way in a potential deal is RJ Barrett, who has history with current Sacramento general manager Scott Perry. When Perry was the general manager of the Knicks, he drafted Barrett with the No. 3 overall pick in the NBA Draft. The obstacle in a potential deal is that the Raptors would likely need to ship out either Jakob Poeltl or Immanuel Quickley, who have long-term deals well past this season.Buckle up. The fun's just getting started. \n            ",

Bet it at bet365 here:Over 224.5 in Pistons vs. Nuggets\nTwo of the league's top offenses are meeting on Tuesday night, as Denver ranks third in points per game (119.9) and Detroit ranks eighth (117.3). The Nuggets have not been nearly as impressive defensively, ranked 16th in the NBA in points allowed per game (115.7). They have star Nikola Jokic back from an injury, providing their offense with a massive boost. SportsLine's model has Jokic scoring 25 points on Tuesday, helping the Over cash in 60% of simulations. Back the Over at bet365 here:Over 223.5 in Celtics vs. Mavericks Boston has gone Under the total in five straight games, which has led to a low total for this matchup.

Dallas has allowed at least 115 points in seven straight home games, and the model expects that trend to continue Tuesday. Ultimately, these teams combine for 231 points as the Over hits 60% of the time. Back the Over at bet365 here:Under 6.5 in Devils vs. Blue JacketsThe Blue Jackets are aiming for their sixth straight win, and they have allowed three goals or fewer in four of their last five wins. They are facing a New Jersey team that has lost three of its last four games and has been held to three goals or fewer in eight of its last nine games. The Devils have gone Under in six of those games, and they have cashed the Under in five of their last six home games. Additionally, these teams have gone Under in five of their last seven head-to-head meetings, so the model has the Under hitting in 69% of simulations. Back the Under at bet365 here:\nLooking for more betting picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Tuesday.

    "body": "\n        One of the top events on the PGA Tour tees off on Thursday as the 2026 WM Phoenix Open unfolds at TPC Scottsdale (Stadium Course). Known for its raucous crowds, the WM Phoenix Open usually draws a great field, and this year is no exception. Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Hideki Matsuyama are among the players teeing it up. They'll be joined by Brooks Koepka, who is playing his second event since rejoining the PGA Tour last week at the Farmers Insurance Open.The latest 2026 WM Phoenix Open odds list Scheffler as the +220 favorite (risk $100 to win $220), followed by Schauffele at +1700. Si Woo Kim, Hideki Matsuyama and Cameron Young are all at +2500, with Viktor Hovland, Sam Burns and Ben Griffin all at +3000. Brooks Koepka is +4500 in his second PGA event since returning to the tour. Before locking in any 2026 WM Phoenix Open picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. \nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 WM Phoenix Open field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. \n2026 WM Phoenix Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Si Woo Kim, who is one of the favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to fade this week. The 30-year-old is off to a fast start this season, finishing T11 at the Sony Open, T6 at The American Express and T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open. This event has been a real struggle for him, however, as he's missed three of thee past five WM Phoenix Open cuts and hasn't finished better than 50th since 2022. See who else to fade here. Another surprise: The model is extremely high on Ben Griffin this week.

Leonard was added to the player pool in order to satisfy the necessary number of players for the league's USA vs. World format.The new format will consist of three teams of eight players: two teams made up of American players, with one \"World\" team of the league's international talent. Of the 24 original All-Stars selected, there were only 15 American players, as Karl-Anthony Towns will play for the World team. Adding Leonard now brings the total to 15 American players.The players who will compete on each team will be revealed Tuesday night ahead of the Dallas Mavericks vs. Boston Celtics game.This marks another overhaul of the All-Star Game format. The league has toyed with different versions of the event, with last year marking the first turn at a round-robin tournament. The tournament style will remain the same this year, with three games being played to decide a winner of the weekend's events. However, how the matchups will be determined has yet to be announced.\nLeonard was considered one of the biggest snubs when All-Star announcements were made, as he's having his best season since his first year in L.A. He's averaging a career high 27.6 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.6 assists and is leading the league in steals at 2.1 a game. He's also been fairly durable this season, having played in 73% of the Clippers' games this season. That's a major bounce back from a season ago where he only appeared in 37 games, which he's set to match that total with the next appearance he makes.\n            \n    ",

Almabayev is scheduled to fight former two-time UFC flyweight champion Brandon Moreno on Feb. 28 in Mexico City. There is no official word yet on what that means for the fight.On Tuesday, Almabayev posted a photo of his right arm in a cast. \"The situation is like this, I got an arm injury two days before our  flight,\" Almabayev wrote, according to Google Translate. \"I don't want to talk about the injury… no  matter how much you [try], I can't change it.\" \n\nThe fight is scheduled to be Almabayev's second UFC main event. Against Moreno, he is scheduled to face one of Mexico's top MMA stars at Arena CDMX in Mexico City. Almabayev (23-3) has won six of seven fights in the promotion. The Kazakh fighter's lone UFC loss was against top contender Manel Kape in Almabyaev's first UFC main event. A win over a former champion like Moreno would do wonders for his potential to fight for the flyweight title.\nMoreno, 32, is 2-2 since 2024 after dropping the flyweight title to Alexandre Pantoja by split decision. He's looking to bounce back from a TKO loss to Tatsuro Taira in December.\n            \n    ",

Kennedy claimed the incident was sparked by him calling Metcalf by his full name. On Shannon Sharpe's \"Nightcap\" podcast, Chad Johnson claimed Kennedy used racial slurs in talking about Metcalf and his mother. \nThat report was picked up by numerous outlets, and Kennedy's attorneys claim the result was \"branding Kennedy as a racist on a national scale and subjecting him to death threats, hate mail, and severe damage to his business reputation.\" Kennedy held a press conference in December to deny those accusations and called on Metcalf to \"correct the record\" and publicly confirm he didn't use racist language. Metcalf declined to speak about the incident after his reinstatement following his suspension. \n\"Defendants have failed to issue any public retractions or corrections acknowledging that Plaintiff Kennedy never used racial slurs or hate speech,\" according to the lawsuit. \"Defendant Metcalf, despite being the alleged source of the false and reckless statements, has refused to issue any public statement clarifying that Plaintiff Kennedy did not use racial slurs, thereby perpetuating the defamatory statements.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        February 3 is a significant date for the New England Patriots. It was on this day in 2002 that the organization hoisted its first Lombardi Trophy and launched a two-decade dynasty that put the NFL in a chokehold, adding five more Lombardis to the trophy case along the way.Fast forward 24 years, and here they are again, back in the Super Bowl with a chance to add another title to the organization's résumé. This latest run to the big game, however, isn't led by the likes of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, as those other championship teams were. Instead, it's an entirely new cast of characters with different talents and backgrounds, but the goal remains the same: to become Super Bowl champions.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Ranking every Patriots and Seahawks starter ahead of NFL championship devoid of star power\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDrake Maye wasn't even alive when the franchise won that first Super Bowl, but his team shares plenty of similarities with that championship club of yesteryear, which feels especially noteworthy on this anniversary as the Patriots prepare for another Super Bowl berth.\nThe most glaring similarity, outside of the same logo on the side of their helmets, is, of course, the presence of Mike Vrabel. The former linebacker first arrived in Foxborough in 2001 as a free agent and is now back with the organization in 2025, serving in his first year as head coach.But let's dive a little deeper with Vrabel. He's reaching the Super Bowl in his seventh season overall as a head coach and with his second team. You know who did the same thing back in 2001? Bill Belichick. Moreover, both coaches quickly elevated their organizations, each entering the year with at least 60-1 odds or longer to win the Super Bowl (60-1 in 2001 and 80-1 in 2025).The similarities extend to the roster, too, as both teams were led by second-year quarterbacks. After being the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Maye has surged into an MVP candidate in Year 2 and has the Patriots in Super Bowl LX. Back in 2001, a second-year quarterback by the name of Tom Brady stepped in following an injury to Drew Bledsoe, helped lead New England to Super Bowl XXXVI and began writing his place in NFL history as the greatest of all-time.\nHere are even more nuggets that make these two versions of the Patriots look like mirror images of one another.Stats2001 Patriots2025 PatriotsW-L11-514-3PPG rankSixthSecondOpp PPG rankSixthFourthSecond-year QBTom BradyDrake MayeSeventh-year HCBill BelichickMike VrabelStrength of schedule rankFourth-easiestEasiestBoth teams ranked in the NFL's top 10 in points per game and points per game allowed, and each faced one of the five easiest schedules in the league. Heck, they even played in snowy playoff games -- the infamous \"Tuck Rule\" contest came in a blizzard at Foxboro Stadium against the Las Vegas Raiders in the divisional round, and this year brought a second-half whiteout at Mile High against the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game.Of course, there's one major difference between the 2001 Patriots and the current rendition of New England. That team won it all, and the jury is still out on how the final chapter of this 2025 squad will unfold.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Clippers have struck an NBA trade deadline blockbuster. The two sides have agreed to a deal that sends Darius Garland and a second-round pick to the Clippers in exchange for James Harden, according ESPN. It's one of the more surprising trades in recent deadline history given the age difference between the two players. Garland, just 26, is 10 years Harden's junior. Cleveland, coming off of a 64-win season and still in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff race, seemingly didn't need to make a shakeup this significant. Yet the Cavaliers made the deadline stunner in hopes of enhancing their 2026 title chances.There are two likely motivations for this trade on Cleveland's end. The first is durability. Garland has dealt with a toe injury dating back to last postseason. He missed time early in the season, came back and struggled, slowly worked his way back into form, but aggravated the injury and has now been out since Jan. 14. He dealt with a variety of injuries earlier in his career, including a torn meniscus when he was in college.The second motivator is likely financial. Harden and Garland make almost identical salaries this season, but Harden's contract is only partially guaranteed for next season, and given his age, he is unlikely to be a long-term fixture on their books. Garland has two more expensive seasons left on his contract, and he is set to become eligible for a contract extension this offseason. Given the league-wide move away from small guards and Garland's injury history, it's possible that the Cavaliers have simply decided they were ready to move on Garland, but without wanting to sacrifice their chance at competing this season, Cleveland instead turned to an older star guard to pair with Donovan Mitchell.\n        \n            \n                James Harden-Darius Garland trade grades: Clippers clearly come out ahead of Cavaliers in All-Star swap\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHarden has unquestionably been the better of the two players this season, averaging over 25 points and eight assists for the Clippers as he kept them afloat early in the season. He has not scored especially efficiently this season, but he is still an elite generator of team offense. The Clippers scored 118.9 points per 100 possessions with Harden on the floor this season, which is the equivalent to the No. 3 offense in the NBA over the full season., They fell off of a cliff without him.While Harden has defensive vulnerabilities like Garland, he does have two key areas of utility. First, he's a good deal bigger than Garland. Harden is a bulky 6-foot-5 whereas Garland is a skinny 6-foot-1. Harden has used that strength to hold his own against bigger players in the past. He also has very quick hands, which he's used to deflect passes and generate turnovers quite well throughout his career. Cleveland's point guard slot was always going to be a defensive issue, but the Cavaliers recently turned De'Andre Hunter into Dennis Schröder and Keon Ellis, beefing up that perimeter defense perhaps in anticipation of this sort of move.\nThe Clippers end of this deal is more obvious. They just turned a 36-year-old star point guard into a 26-year-old star point guard. The Clippers, built around Harden and the 34-year-old Kawhi Leonard, were the oldest team in the NBA entering this season. The ongoing investigation into Leonard's dealings with Aspiration could alter his time with the Clippers in the near future, so the team badly needed to figure out some sort of new, long-term direction. Garland is a start on that front, and with their books basically clean after the season, they shouldn't have much of an issue paying him for the long haul and putting a team around him and cornerstone big man Ivica Zubac.As a value proposition, this trade is going to raise some eyebrows. Typically, a team trading a young, recent All-Star expects to receive a haul of draft picks back in return. But recent history seems to be pointing in the other direction, especially when it comes to small guards. Trae Young was just traded, essentially, for a salary cap dump with the Washington Wizards. The Memphis Grizzlies have struggled to generate a substantial trade market for Ja Morant. Had Cleveland moved a year or two earlier on Garland, this trade would probably look different.Instead, the Cavaliers may be realizing that they cannot do much better than an older, slightly more productive and durable replacement. Even despite Harden's history of playoff disappointments, the Cavaliers may ultimately decide that he gives them a better chance at winning it all this season than Garland does, so they're considering moving their talented yet injury-prone star now rather than risking the even worse offers players like Young and Morant seemed to generate later.\nIt's an enormous and unconventional risk, one that has a chance to completely revitalize the Clippers in the coming years. But if Harden can overcome his own history to give Cleveland the sort of reliable production in the playoffs that he's been giving the Clippers in the regular season, it might be what it takes to get the Cavaliers back to the Finals.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Gabriel Bonfim and Randy Brown took very different paths to their first UFC Fight Night main event. Bonfim is a relatively new addition to the UFC roster; meanwhile, Brown celebrates a decade with the promotion in January. They collide on Saturday night at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.Bonfim (18-1) is defending his ranking, but arguably has more to prove than his opponent. Bonfim became a top 15 welterweight off a controversial decision win over longtime contender Stephen \"Wonderboy\" Thompson. Two years ago, nearly to the day, he was knocked out by Nicolas Dalby. A close decision win over Brown, an unranked fighter approaching 10 years with the promotion, won't do him much good. Bonfim needs a standout performance.\"If I let Brown control the distance and keep the fight standing, he has an advantage, that's his game. But not with me,\" Bonfim told CBS Sports through a Portuguese interpreter. \" I'm very comfortable exchanging punches. I know he's afraid and weary of my ground game.\"\n        \n            \n                Jon Jones rips Tom Aspinall's skills after UFC 321: 'His wrestling and jiu-jitsu are incredibly overrated'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown (20-6) is determined to make the most of his first main event. He's a promising contender, but every time he builds steam, his momentum gets cut short by guys like Belal Muhammad, Jack Della Maddalena and Vicente Luque. But all that experience has given him a level head. Brown is coming off a KO win over Dalby, the only person to beat Bonfim, but he isn't putting much stock in it. Brown knows exactly what Bonfim did wrong, but he can't guarantee he'll make those mistakes again. \n\"I know exactly what he lost that fight and what happened. I can't assume he's in that same place. He was pushed, overwhelmed, got tired, and was stopped...\" Brown told CBS Sports. \"I can't bank on him making those same mistakes. For all I know, he's in the best shape of his life, and when he shows up he'll be ready to do 10 rounds.\" There isn't a lot to write home about on the undercard. Ricky Simon vs. Raoni Barcelos is solid matchmaking. Neither fighter is currently ranked, but they're veteran fighters who've mixed it up with the best. Simon notably holds a controversial win over reigning UFC bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili and has fought former WEC champ Urijah Faber. Barcelos mixed it up with title challenger Umar Nurmagomedov in recent years.Rising flyweights are set for the co-main event when Joseph Morales takes on Matt Schnell. Morales is fresh off winning The Ultimate Fighter 33 in August with a submission of Alibi Idiris in August. He had a previous run with UFC in 2017 and 2018 before three years of inactivity. He posted a 1-2 record in that time, including a TKO loss to former champion Deiveson Figueiredo. Schnell, meanwhile, has been a fixture since 2016 where he's posted a 7-7, 1 NC record. He ended a three-fight losing skid in April with a decision win over Jimmy Flick.\nBelow is the rest of the fight card for Saturday, with the latest odds before we get to a prediction and pick on the main event. UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavorite Underdog Weight classGabriel Bonfim -190Randy Brown +160Welterweight  Joseph Morales -420  Matt Schnell +330  FlyweightUros Medic -150  Muslim Salikhov +125  WelterweightIsmael Bonfim -195Chris Padilla +165  LightweightRicky Simon -180Raoni Barcelos +150BantamweightMarco Tulio -185  Christian Leroy Duncan +155  Middleweight UFC Fight Night viewing information Date: Nov. 8 | Start time: 7 p.m. ET (main card) Location: UFC Apex -- Las Vegas TV channel: ESPN+ Prediction Gabriel Bonfim vs. Randy Brown: Don't let Bonfim's ranking fool you; he has something to prove. Many believe \"Wonderboy\" beat Bonfim. Dalby knocked him out. They were Bonfim's two most experienced opponents. Brown is another such veteran, having faced world-class competition for over a decade. He's fully capable of exploiting whatever holes Bonfim gives him, especially should he wilt over five rounds. Skill-wise, I lean towards Bonfim. He has fantastic submissions, judicious wrestling, and responsible striking defense. Thompson outstruck Bonfim in totality, but their significant strike outputs were almost identical. \nLast year, Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos took down Brown four times. The year before that, Della Maddalena submitted Brown -- one of only two submission wins in the champ's 20-fight pro career. There are conditions we should acknowledge in those two fights: Brown still beat Dos Santos, and Della Maddalena locked in the rear-naked choke off a knockdown. The fight benefits Brown the longer it goes. Ultimately, Bonfim shines more where Brown struggles. The inverse isn't quite as true. I'll take Bonfim, hesitantly, by submission. Bonfim via SUB2\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The clock is ticking on College Football Playoff decision-makers as they discuss potential expansion for the 2026 postseason, and with a Dec. 1 deadline quickly approaching, the stakeholders may not reach an agreement to restructure the bracket. Mississippi State president Mark Keenum said Friday that he is \"not real optimistic\" the conference commissioners will agree upon an expansion plan.Among the primary holdups in CFP expansion talks is the lack of a consensus on how many automatic bids should be included in a larger field. While the Big Ten has long been a proponent of dishing out numerous guaranteed spots -- with most going to Big Ten and SEC teams -- other conferences have been wary of the idea. In fact, Keenum said that the SEC would prefer to do away with automatic bids altogether.\"I'm not a big fan of automatic qualifiers,\" Keenum said on \"The Paul Finebaum Show.\" \"I think the best teams ought to play in our nation's national tournament to determine who our national champion in college football is going to be, and not have automatic bids. That's the position of the Southeastern Conference presidents, chancellors, our commissioner and probably most of the conferences that are part of CFP.\"The Big Ten and SEC hold the most power in constructing future playoff models, and it is in their best interests to adopt formats that reward as many spots as possible to their member schools. They have conflicting opinions, though, on how to achieve that goal.\nOn one hand, the Big Ten seeks to guarantee a base number of bids by conference and backfill the bracket with at-large selections. On the other hand, the SEC appears willing to eliminate a guaranteed floor and instead swing for the fences, thus potentially sending more teams to the postseason with at-large bids than it would with a predetermined number of automatic berths.Specifically, the Big Ten favors a 16-team playoff with four automatic qualifiers reserved for each of the two most powerful conferences while SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said his league is open to various expansion formats including 5+7, 5+9 or 5+11 models -- all of which cap guaranteed spots to one per conference. Sankey also made clear that his personal preference is to remove automatic bids altogether.\"We're still negotiating,\" Keenum said. \"We have to make a decision before the end of this month if we're going to expand to 16 next year. We've got just a few more weeks. I'll be honest, I'm not real optimistic that we'll get to that, but we'll keep working on it.\"\nIf the commissioners cannot reach an agreement by Dec. 1 on how a 16-team bracket would be structured, the CFP will remain in its present state for 2026. This season is the second of the 12-team era and the first with a straight-seeding model, which awards first-round byes to the four highest-ranked teams regardless of conference championship status.\n            ",

The last eight of those games have come with Bear Bachmeier under center as he's the first true freshman quarterback to begin his career 8-0 since Trevor Lawrence at Clemson 2018. He's dangerous with both his arm and his legs as he has a passing and rushing touchdown in four straight games, which is tied for the longest active streak in FBS.The Cougars lead the Big 12 in turnover margin (+10) this season and have at least one takeaway in an astounding 22 consecutive games. Thus, a team likes Texas Tech plays right into BYU's hands as the Red Raiders have at least one giveaway in seven straight games, including multiple turnovers in each of their last two contests. Texas Tech also has a disastrous history versus AP Top 10 teams like BYU, which is No. 8 in the AP Poll. TTU is on a 16-game losing streak versus top 10 teams and is allowing 51.1 ppg during this streak. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why Texas Tech can coverThe Red Raiders are 8-1 versus the line this season, as no team has more spread victories than Texas Tech. Coach Joey McGuire can make the case that he has the best offense in all of FBS, considering TTU's statistical rankings. His team ranks third in scoring offense, has the fourth most offensive touchdowns and ranks fifth in total yards per game. The Red Raiders have scored at least 42 points in every home game in 2025, averaging 51.6 points at Jones AT&T Stadium.The exploits of the offense somewhat overshadow what Texas Tech's defense does to opponents. The Red Raiders rank fifth in the nation by allowing 13.2 points per game, which makes TTU and Indiana the only teams to rank in the top five in both scoring offense and scoring defense. Leading the brigade on defense is senior linebacker David Bailey, who leads the nation with 11.5 sacks and ranks second with 14 tackles for loss. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make BYU vs. Texas Tech picksSportsLine's model has simulated Texas Tech vs. BYU 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 61 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The Lone Star State will take center stage for many with Week 11 college football picks as the two ranked matchups on the slate involving Texas teams. There's Texas Tech vs. BYU in the Big 12, which has the ninth-ranked Red Raiders favored by 10.5 points over the No. 8 Cougars, per the latest college football odds. Then over in the SEC, Texas A&M vs. Missouri sees the No. 3 Aggies as 7-point favorites over 19th-ranked Mizzou. BYU and Texas A&M are two of the last four undefeated teams entering Week 11. There are, however, several other intriguing matchups to place Week 11 college football bets on.No. 4 Alabama vs. LSU (+10.5) is a classic rivalry as the Tigers play their first game in the post-Brian Kelly era. Auburn also moved on from its coach, Hugh Freeze, and it is a 6.5-point underdog to No. 15 Vanderbilt. Not to be overlooked, Notre Dame vs. Navy (+27.5) will see the teams play for the 98th time, and that game has one of the largest Week 11 college football spreads. Before locking in any Week 11 college football picks on those games or others, be sure to see the latest Week 11 college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times and has returned over $2,200 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated college basketball picks over the past three seasons.

OSU's 12-game win streak is the longest in the nation, and the defense has been utterly dominant in 2025. The Buckeyes' 6.9 points allowed are the fewest by any Big Ten team through the first eight games of a season in the last 40 years. Meanwhile, Purdue ranks 109th (out of 136 FBS teams) in scoring, as the Boilermakers have lost seven straight games. With Ryan Day boasting a 53-1 record versus unranked opponents -- including a +32.6 margin of victory -- the model has Ohio State covering well over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Clemson (-1.5, 56.5) covers versus Florida State in a 7 p.m. ET Saturday kickoff well over 50% of the time. The season hasn't gone according to plan for either team, but the Tigers are 2-2 ATS over their last four, while FSU is just 1-4 ATS over its last five. The Clemson defense has the ability to make Florida State one dimensional, as the Tigers have kept three of their last four opponents to 85 or fewer rushing yards. That could be a major issue for the Seminoles, especially considering QB Thomas Castellanos' road struggles. His team has outright lost in each of his last five away starts, and he has just a lone touchdown pass, versus two picks, on the road this year. The Under is projected to hit almost 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 11The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 11, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a Big Ten underdog outright winning. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which Big Ten favorite goes down?

This year, the team added former BYU standout QB, Jake Retzlaff, who is among the best dual threats in the sport. He is one of six FBS quarterbacks with 1,500 passing yards and 500 rushing yards, and he has seven total touchdowns over his last three games.The Green Wave also have an improving run defense which could make Memphis one dimensional on offense. Tulane has kept each of its last four opponents to under 3.9 yards per rush, thanks to a pair of disruptive defensive linemen. Santana Hopper and Harvey Dyson III have combined for 10.5 tackles for loss over this four-game stretch as the pair of transfers are making huge impacts in their first years in New Orleans. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why Memphis can coverNo team in all of college football has more spread victories than the Tigers this year, who are 8-1 versus the line. That includes a 4-0 ATS mark at home as the team is 10-1-1 against the line dating back to last season. The Tigers also get to face a Tulane team which hasn't measured up when stepping up in class to face AP-ranked opponents. The Green Wave are 2-9 ATS on the road versus ranked teams over the last decade, and that includes three straight spread losses and straight-up defeats in these types of games.On the field, Memphis' 30 rushing touchdowns are tied for the most in FBS as four different Tigers have at least six rushing scores. If Lewis can go, he'll give Memphis a big boost. He leads the American with a 69.1% completion rate, and he's also averaging over 60 rushing yards per contest. Ryan Silverfield's crew also dominates when it comes to the all-important turnover stat as Memphis is riding a 13-game streak in which it has not lost the turnover battle. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Memphis vs. Tulane picksSportsLine's model has simulated Tulane vs. Memphis 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 62 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Wisconsin is kicking the can down the road.Wisconsin AD Chris McIntosh ended all speculation Thursday, going on-record that football coach Luke Fickell would return for 2026. That was always the expectation, even if some fans hoped that a new loss every week would lead McIntosh to change his mind and become the latest athletic director to swallow a large buyout so he could go spend even more money on a new coaching staff.Fickell's buyout was around $25 million, and anybody with an understanding of life in Madison these days understood how unlikely Wisconsin was to spend it. McIntosh indirectly told you again while discussing the future plans for Wisconsin under Fickell.\"Chancellor [Jennifer] Mnookin and I are aligned on significantly elevating investment in our program to compete at highest level,\" McIntosh told ESPN. \"We are willing to make an investment in infrastructure and staff. As important, is our ability to retain and recruit players in a revenue share and NIL era.\"Any time somebody tells you they're going to significantly elevate the investment in the program, that means there's a lot of elevating that needs to be done. Simply put, Wisconsin hasn't been playing on the same financial field as the rest of its Big Ten brethren -- it participates in the rev-sharing that gives about $13 million to its football program, but it is clear its NIL offerings are lacking. It's a huge reason why Fickell has been so unsuccessful to this point, while other Big Ten programs, which were much further behind Wisconsin with on-the-field results when Fickell was hired, have been able to take such giant leaps forward.\n\n        \n            \n                Armed with Mark Cuban donations and Curt Cignetti's brash approach, Indiana sets up for sustained success\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIndiana and Illinois have seen the investment in their football programs significantly elevated already. That investment is a big reason why (hiring the right coach is the other big one) the Hoosiers are No. 2 in the country and on the verge of a second-straight playoff appearance, while Illinois is in position to win at least nine games in consecutive seasons for the first time in program history.As they've risen, Wisconsin has fallen. All of which seemed highly unlikely when the Fickell hire was announced. It was a move that was heralded by nearly everyone, including me, but Fickell is 14-19 at Wisconsin and 8-15 in Big Ten play. Fickell has been foiled by a lack of resources comparatively, as well as bad luck (injuries) and bad decisions (RIP Dairy Raid experiment).\nThe problem with the decision to bring Fickell back in 2026 is not about Fickell himself, though. He's still the same coach who led Cincinnati to the College Football Playoff as a Group of Five school. Wisconsin's schedule, which has been one of the most difficult in the country this year, will be far easier next season (though that should not be taken as it'll be easy, because they still have to play Notre Dame to start the season). No, the problem is money can't fix everything. At least, not the way Wisconsin needs it to. It's one thing to say you'll have an investment; it's another to actually have it. How much money will Chris McIntosh be able to raise for a program when everybody he's asking knows the situation both he and Fickell find themselves in? The simple truth is, unless Wisconsin suddenly churns out a bunch of wins next season, there's a high likelihood neither Fickell nor McIntosh sees the end of the 2026 season, let alone 2027.It's a lot easier to ask for money when there's hope to sell.Just look at the way one of Wisconsin's most prominent former players spoke about the program this week. On Wednesday's episode of The Pat McAfee Show, J.J. Watt didn't sound like a man who's very interested in throwing good money after bad.\nFor the sake of argument, though, let's say McIntosh is able to raise a significant amount of funds this offseason. Now, Wisconsin has a bunch of money it wants to fire at the transfer portal to overhaul the roster.Well, it's going to have to pay a premium on that talent, because like J.J. Watt, you and I know Fickell will be in one of the hottest seats in the country going into next season. So if there's a quarterback available in the portal, how much will Wisconsin have to pay to convince that player to come to Madison in that situation?\n        \n            \n                Meet the candidates -- 88 of them: The only list you need for college football's wildest coaching carousel\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRemember, Wisconsin won't be the only Big Ten team looking for a QB in the portal this winter. Odds are, Indiana and Illinois will be sniffing around, too. Maybe Penn State's new coach brings a QB with him, or maybe the Nittany Lions are also fishing in the same waters.\nWhich option looks more attractive to you? An Indiana team coming off two playoff appearances, or a Wisconsin team where the coach you're signing up to play for could be fired by mid-October?The simple truth is, if Wisconsin had the kind of money available to pull off a Texas Tech and overhaul the program in one offseason, it would've paid the $25 million buyout to start over. But it doesn't, so it didn't.Wisconsin may be serious about putting more money into its football program, but it's far more likely to be another coach who reaps the benefits of that money than Luke Fickell.\n            ",

UCF hammered Wester Virginia 45-13 at home and also beat North Carolina 34-9, covering comfortably as 6.5-point favorites in both games to establish the Acrisure Bounce House as a hostile environment. Now the model says that the Knights cover in 53% of simulations. Back UCF at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Over 52.5 points in USC vs. Northwestern (-105)Northwestern has shown improvement in David Braun's second season and the defense is formidable, as the Wildcats allow 16.8 points and 304.1 yards per game. However, the USC offense ranks eighth in the nation in scoring (39.8 ppg) and first in total offense (505.8 ypg). In their only other matchup against an elite offense, the Wildcats gave up 34 points to Oregon and we could easily see USC put up close to 40 on their own. The model predicts that the Over hits in 59% of simulations. Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Memphis -3.5 vs. Tulane (-110)Memphis wasn't ranked by the College Football Playoff committee but the Tigers were announced as the top Group of Six team and have the inside track on a CFP bid.

The model has Memphis covering in 62% of simulations. Back Memphis at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant Week 10 NFL picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Friday.

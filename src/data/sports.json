    "body": "\n        Alabama circuit judge Daniel Pruet ruled in favor of the NCAA and against 23-year-old Alabama center Charles Bediako on Monday in an eligibility case that sparked widespread conversation and criticism across college athletics in recent weeks. The decision figures to be a major one for the stability of college basketball, perhaps even for college sports. In quashing the temporary restraining order (TRO) Bediako had been playing under for the past five games, Pruet agreed with the NCAA's arguments that Bediako was in violation of longstanding eligibility rules pertaining to college players, the NBA Draft and the deadline wall that separates college hoops from the NBA. That TRO was only initially granted after a different Tuscaloosa judge, who soon thereafter was found to be an active donor to Alabama's athletic department, went on to recuse himself from the case after his situation was publicly disclosed.The case went to the courtroom because the NCAA's clearinghouse initially denied Bediako's request for eligibility in January, and reasonably so. NCAA legal counsel argued last week that Bediako was breaking longstanding precedent by having played in college previously (2021-23), then left for the NBA, knowing full well what the rules were upon staying in the NBA Draft process. There is a thorough process of information-gathering and vetting and the messaging is crystal clear: If you play college and stay in the draft process after the late-spring deadline, you give up your NCAA eligibility. The issue was so threatening to fundamental eligibility regulations, SEC commissioner Greg Sankey went so far as to write a sworn affidavit in opposition to one of his member schools — a letter that surely had an impact on the outcome. \n\n        \n            \n                Charles Bediako denied injunction against NCAA eligibility rules as Alabama return ends after five games\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn light of the decision, questions still remain. Here's a quick primer on where things stand and where Alabama (and Bediako) go from here.What happens to Alabama now?The Tide will move on and try to win without Bediako who, to be sure, is/was good enough to be a real factor in the SEC: he averaged 10.0 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks in his recent five game return . But he's played his last game in college and he'll make a return to the G League, where he most recently played just a few weeks ago for the Motor City Cruise. With Bediako's fate known, he and Alabama (which wasn't technically part of the court case) have no further recourse. Alabama and Bediako lost their initial waiver request against the NCAA in January. We're two-thirds of the way into the season and Bediako only had this remaining semester on his eligibility clock anyway. There won't be an appeal or anything else at the legal level. This part of the story is done.\nWill the NCAA count the games with Bediako on the roster?Barring a stunner down the road, yes.In terms of, will those three games be officially vacated at a later date? It seems unlikely.The order explicitly prevented the NCAA from punishing Alabama as the TRO was in effect. The language in that first ruling stated the NCAA was \"further restrained from threatening, imposing, attempting to impose, suggesting, or implying any penalties or sanctions on Mr. Bediako or the University of Alabama or its coaches or other student-athletes as a result of Mr. Bediako's participation in Division I athletics.\"Now, does that sentence above no longer stand to scrutiny, since the TRO was retroactively wiped out? I wouldn't expect the NCAA to pursue anything too heavily, but what remains unknown is how members of the NCAA Tournament selection committee will or will not choose to evaluate and/or judge Alabama for its Bediako gambit. This case rubbed a lot of people in college athletics the wrong way. While the NCAA is unlikely to officially sanction Alabama after the fact, the selection committee could have some interesting conversations behind closed doors next month when it comes time to seed the teams.\n\n        \n            \n                Alabama, Charles Bediako get last laugh in comeback win vs. Auburn thanks to Crimson Tide's 'G League dropout'\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhy is this different from Baylor getting Nnaji eligible after he was drafted?A natural question but there are three distinctions between Bediako's case and James Nnaji's.1. Nnaji was cleared to play by the NCAA. 2. He was cleared because he never played college basketball prior to enrolling at Baylor in December 20253. Because he never played college basketball AND because he never signed an NBA contract, he was granted eligibility on a technicality\nThat technicality still has a lot of people unsatisfied with who does and does not qualify for college basketball.  Bediako's challenge to the NCAA's rule brought about a profound problem. If players are able to freely come and go from the NBA and G League ranks at nearly any time on the calendar, then roster stability would be under constant threat and outbound high school players would also see their opportunities tangibly affected.What's Alabama's outlook heading into March?Among top 25-level schools this season, the Tide rank near the top of the most inconsistent teams out there. At 16-7, Alabama owns nice wins over St. John's on the road, Illinois in Chicago, a drubbing of Kentucky in Tuscaloosa and a defeat over Auburn on the road last Saturday. There've also been defeats at home to Texas and blowout losses against Florida and Arizona. \nThe problem for Bama now? Bediako offered relief for a thinning frontcourt in Tuscaloosa. Seven-footer Noah Williamson is hurt and 6-10 backup big Keitenn Bristow has missed 12 games this season. Taylor Bol Bowen, a 6-11 junior, has also been banged up this year. And just last weekend, in Alabama's win over Auburn, 6-11 starter Aiden Sherrell suffered a knee injury\nThe lack of frontcourt presence and prominence is the biggest factor that's prevented Alabama from being a top-10 team this season. Projected NBA Draft lottery pick Labaron Philon and sophomore combo guard Aden Holloway comprise the fastest guard duo in college basketball, but Alabama's injuries have been an issue the entire season. What does Alabama coach Nate Oats have to say?As covered by Mike Rodak of 247Sports, Oats said he was \"obviously super disappointed\" on his radio show Monday night. \n\"I didn't think it ever should have gotten to court,\" Oats said. \"I thought the NCAA should have made him eligible based on over a hundred current college basketball players -- former professionals, most of them over in Europe. Some in the G League. Guys being drafted. Rights owned by NBA teams, as in James Nnaji being eligible to play.\"I thought it was kind of a no-brainer with the NCAA. Then I didn't think it would be much of an issue. The NCAA hasn't really changed much without courts forcing them to change. I thought the courts would see in the inconsistencies in the rulings and agree with Charles' attorneys. To me, the NCAA's point of why Charles shouldn't be eligible was all these rules that they have, but they're not applying those rules to all these other players they've made eligible. To me, it was very disappointing in the whole case. Disappointing for Charles.\"...Disappointed in the ruling. Disappointed in the system -- both the NCAA, the courts, the whole thing, just with all the inconsistencies with who's eligible and who's not. It just seems like the European international players are being given preferential treatment over the Americans. It moreso happened today. Hopefully, at some point, somebody is going to win a ruling like this. It wasn't here today. At some point somebody will win one and change the system. Because that's how it has to get changed in the NCAA. They don't make changes on their own, typically.\"\nOats neglected to acknowledge the crux of the case, which is that Bediako was the only former college player to play, leave, and try to sue his way to returning. He has a point that there are former overseas pros who have been granted eligibility by the NCAA — by the truckload — in recent years. That's another huge issue, and one that needs serious reconstruction and more stringent bylaws soon.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first PGA Signature Event of the season arrives this week as the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am unfolds at the iconic Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, Calif. Rory McIlroy won this event in 2025, and he's set to make his season debut this week after skipping the first four tournaments. McIlroy is +1400 in the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds from FanDuel Sportsbook, trailing only favorite Scottie Scheffler (+300).Other Pebble Beach contenders include Tommy Fleetwood (+2200) and Justin Rose, Si Woo Kim and Xander Schauffele all at +2500. The players who went to a playoff at the WM Phoenix Open -- Hideki Matsuyama and Chris Gotterup -- are both close behind at +3000.

He's a golfer to avoid in Pebble Beach bets.

The hope is for Curry to return for Golden State's first game after the break.Curry, 37, has not played since Jan. 30. He has missed the Warriors' last three games and will sit Monday against the Memphis Grizzlies and Wednesday against the San Antonio Spurs.Curry was one of five All-Star \"starters\" selected from the Western Conference, though the format this season isn't East vs. West but rather a three-team event that features two U.S. teams and one \"World\" team. He is in the midst of another terrific season, averaging 27.2 points -- his best since 2022-23 -- while shooting 47% from the floor, 39% from 3 and 93% on free throws. He leads the NBA in 3-pointers per game (4.0) and free throw percentage.\nCurry has had to do considerable lifting for a Warriors team that recently lost Jimmy Butler to a torn ACL. Golden State is 28-25 entering Monday night's game, eighth in the West.Curry is the second All-Star to have to drop out of the game due to injury. Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdominal strain) is out; Houston Rockets center Alperen Şengün is replacing him for the \"World\" team. Furthermore, commissioner Adam Silver added Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard to the All-Star Game in order to fill out the Team USA rosters with eight players apiece, though now another replacement player is needed for Curry.\nIt's likely that a third injured All-Star -- the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo -- will not participate, either. As such, the World team currently has nine players, including Antetokounmpo.\n            \n    ",

The pending free agent made a post on Instagram Monday night, saying \"The time for me to find a new home has come.\"\"Cleveland, first off I love you. These 9 years have been a beautiful journey. I'm am so grateful for all the memories we shared together. Thank you to The Haslams, Andrew Berry and the whole browns organization for everything!! All my teammates I shared the battle with I'm so grateful for you guys. The time for me to find a new home has come and all I can think of is just the gratefulness in my heart. The city of Cleveland will forever be home.\"\n\nNjoku played out the four-year, $56.75 million extension he signed back in 2022. He is coming off one of the worst seasons of his career, as Njoku caught 33 passes for 293 yards and four touchdowns in 12 games played. The 29-year-old pass-catcher has crossed 600 yards receiving in three of his nine seasons, and made the Pro Bowl in 2023 after a career year in which he caught 81 passes for 882 yards and six touchdowns. Njoku's 384 career receptions rank third in Browns franchise history, his 4,062 yards receiving rank 12th and his 34 receiving touchdowns rank sixth. Njoku took a backseat to rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. in 2025, who caught 72 passes for 731 yards and six touchdowns. Those 72 receptions were the seventh-most recorded by a rookie tight end in NFL history, and Fannin's 731 yards receiving ranked fourth among all rookies.\nNjoku is CBS Sports' No. 41-ranked free agent this offseason. Injuries have cost Njoku at least five games in each of the last two seasons, but he is still a reliable pass-catcher that can serve as a quarterback's security blanket.\n            \n    ",

The victory, which was Pitino's 904th, leaves him behind only Jim Boeheim (1,116) and Mike Krzyzewski (1,202) on the NCAA's list for most victories by a Division I men's basketball coach.  The tally of 904 includes 123 victories that were officially vacated by the NCAA.Pitino's landmark win came against his son, Richard Pitino, who is in his first season as Xavier's coach, and it didn't come easily. Tre Carroll scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half to keep the Musketeers (12-12, 4-9 Big East) in it. Zuby Ejiofor led the way for St. John's (19-5, 12-1) with 25 points, including six in overtime.It marked Pitino's second close victory over his son in less than three weeks after St. John's beat Xavier 88-83 on the road. That win marked the 900th of Pitino's career.\nPitino, 73, had four straight seasons of 27+ victories at Louisville vacated by the NCAA in 2017 after an NCAA investigation found that he failed to monitor his program amid a scandal that rocked the Cardinals program.Amid a tumultuous and scandal-ridden end to his Louisville tenure, Pitino left college basketball to coach in Greece before returning at Iona in 2020. Now in his third season at St. John's, Pitino is poised to continue adding to his total number of career victories.\nThe only active coach within 50 victories of Pitino's tally is Arkansas' John Calipari, who ranks No. 6 on the all-time wins list with 894 victories. That total also included victories ordered vacated by the NCAA.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders announced Monday they hired Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as coach. The deal had reportedly been in the works for more than a week but could not become official until after Super Bowl 60. With Kubiak's quest for a championship now complete, his tenure in Las Vegas is underway.Kubiak, 38, directed one of the NFL's top offenses with Sam Darnold at the helm. Prior to his lone year in Seattle, Kubiak was the New Orleans Saints' offensive coordinator in 2024, and before that, he worked as the San Francisco 49ers' pass game coordinator under Kyle Shanahan. He also worked under his own father, Gary Kubiak, as well as Kevin Stefanski with the Minnesota Vikings. Several aspects of his father's offense as well as the Shanahan and Stefanski offenses are seen in his offenses. Seattle ranked second this season in under-center rate and seventh in play-action dropback rate. The Seahawks led the NFL in yards per attempt on play action passes, too.Overall, the Seahawks' offense was eighth in points per game and yards per game, sixth in yards per play and second in net yards per pass attempt. Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (NFL-leading 1,793 receiving yards) both made the Pro Bowl.With Klint in line to become coach, he and Gary Kubiak will be the 10th father-son head-coaching duo in NFL history, joining ...Brian and Marty SchottenheimerKyle and Mike ShanahanBrian and Bill CallahanDave and Don ShulaRex and Buddy RyanWade and Bum PhillipsMike and Dick NolanJim Mora Jr. and Jim MoraJohn and Jim FasselSan Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak -- Klint's brother -- also received some head-coaching interest this hiring cycle.\nKlint Kubiak, who also interviewed with the Arizona Cardinals, will have his work cut out for him in Las Vegas. The Raiders come off a dismal 3-14 campaign under Pete Carroll, who got fired after one season. On the bright side, the Raiders own the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft and are widely expected to select Heisman Trophy- and national championship-winning Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza. The Raiders have several holes to fill, though, and the offensive line will be the biggest question mark. Pro Football Focus graded Las Vegas as the 28th-best pass-blocking unit and the 30th-best run-blocking unit.There is some young talent, though, led by tight end Brock Bowers and running Ashton Jeanty. Bowers caught 112 passes for 1,194 yards as a rookie in 2024 before an injury-impacted 2024. Jeanty, meanwhile, finished with 1,321 yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns even with underwhelming surroundings. He recorded 188 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns in Week 16 against the Houston Texans, one of the league's premier defenses.\nOn defense, one of Kubiak's first tasks will be dealing with the Maxx Crosby situation. Crosby was shelved for the season late due to a knee injury, a decision with which Crosby vehemently disagreed and left him pondering his future. Kubiak could aim to bring some Seattle defensive coaches with him to Las Vegas as he builds his staff.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Celtics announced on Monday that star forward Jayson Tatum was being assigned to the Maine Celtics, their G League affiliate, for the day to participate in portions of their practice in Boston. Tatum will be recalled to the NBA club after completing that practice, which represents another step forward in his rehab from a ruptured Achilles suffered last year in the playoffs. Tatum has been getting some individual on-court work in at the Celtics training facility, but moving to team drills is a significant step in the rehab process. That he's already to group activity on the court prior to the NBA All-Star break will only fuel speculation that the six-time All-Star forward could potentially return before the end of the 2025-26 season. Tatum stated prior to the season that he wouldn't rule out playing this year, but recently noted that his focus is on making sure he gets this rehab process right the first time and doesn't return too early and cause any setbacks. When Tatum got hurt, the general consensus was that the 2025-26 season would be a lost one for Boston. They were aggressive in tearing down the roster and moving some key pieces from the team that won a title two years ago, trading the likes of Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis and let Al Horford walk in free agency. \nDespite making moves to shed salary and get under the tax at the trade deadline, the Celtics are tied for second in the Eastern Conference with the New York Knicks at 34-19. Jaylen Brown has played at an All-NBA level, players that were once viewed as depth pieces have stepped into key roles and Joe Mazzulla has gotten full buy-in from this team to keep them not only in the playoff hunt, but near the top of the conference. As a result of that success, the potential for Tatum to return to the floor this season feels more real than ever. Part of the reason most wrote off Tatum possibly playing at all this season was there figured to be little reward to outweigh the risk of coming back too soon, given Boston was projected as a play-in team prior to the season. With the East appearing wide open and the Celtics seeming set to have homecourt in at least the first round of the playoffs, Tatum returning could turn this Boston team into a legitimate title contender.That will certainly factor into the thinking of whether he returns to action this year, but Tatum and the Celtics will keep their main focus on his long-term health. They'll see how his body reacts to doing more on-court work and practicing with the G League team over the coming months. At some point they will want to make an official determination on his immediate future this season, and one would guess the Celtics would want Tatum to be able to play some regular season minutes rather than jumping straight in to the intensity of the playoffs. \nFor now, he'll get some work in with the G League roster and keep trying to check off all the necessary boxes before that decision gets made. Given his rehab timeline thus far, a return this season remains a legitimate possibility, which would make the playoff race in the East even more intriguing. \n            ",

Not tonight, however, as we suspect there is little chance the Red Storm (nine wins in a row) suddenly goes flat against Papa Rick Pitino's son Richard and his Xavier, which already took a good shot at the Johnnies in Cincinnati two weeks ago and put a scare into Papa in an 88-83 St John's escape,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The Musketeers, however, have absorbed a couple of heavy losses since and been outclassed multiple times on the Big East trail, and dealing with the Storm's excellent balance, near 85 ppg offense, and productive frontliners Zuby Ejifor and Bryce Hopkins looms difficult.\" Back St. John's to cover at DraftKings here:Heat (-7.5) vs. Jazz (-112)The Heat are coming off a 132-101 victory over the Wizards on Saturday, and similar to Washington, Utah isn't exactly playing the most inspiring basketball in a 16-37 season. The Jazz are 2-12 over their last 14 games, with eight of those losses coming by double digits. Meanwhile, five of the Heat's last six wins have come by double digits. Although the Heat are just 6-5 over their last 11 games, it's hard to picture them losing straight up to the Jazz, and given the way their wins have gone recently, the model likes their chances of a win by a wider margin. Bam Adebayo had 22 points and eight rebounds on Saturday, as one of seven Heat players to finish with at least 10 points. The model projects the Heat to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Heat to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (+6.5) vs. Thunder (-105)The Thunder have struggled without SGA, while the Lakers have continued to win without Luka Doncic over the start of their current absences. The Thunder are 1-2 with SGA sidelined with his current foot injury, while the Lakers rallied from trailing when Doncic exited on Thursday with a hamstring injury to defeat the 76ers. Then, the Lakers defeated the Warriors on Saturday. Austin Reaves had 35 points on Thursday, and he's averaging 26.1 points per game this season. LeBron James continues to showcase his greatness, including posting 20 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists on Saturday with Doncic out. James has scored at least 20 points in four of his last five games. The Lakers host OKC on Monday, and they are 14-8 in Los Angeles this season. The model projects the Lakers to compete with the NBA-leading Thunder, who are missing SGA, with the Lakers covering in 63% of simulations. Back the Lakers to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball picks on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        What could have been a miraculous comeback story at the Olympics ended in heartbreak for Lindsey Vonn, who was airlifted to a hospital after a devastating crash in the women's downhill final on Sunday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games. Vonn announced after undergoing surgery that she sustained a complex tibia fracture during the catastrophic run and that she will have to undergo multiple more procedures to repair her broken leg.Vonn had already fought through a torn ACL -- which she sustained in a training accident just one week ahead of the Olympics -- and would have been the greatest recovery stories in all of sports had she gotten to the medal podium while racing on a bad knee. Instead, her competitive career may be over for good.In the wake of her agonizing incident on the mountain in Italy, Vonn released a statement via social media:\"Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would. It wasn't a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\"I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash. My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever.\"Unfortunately, I sustained a complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly.\"While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets. Standing in the starting gate yesterday was an incredible feeling that I will never forget. Knowing I stood there having a chance to win was a victory in and of itself. I also knew that racing was a risk. It always was and always will be an incredibly dangerous sport.\"And similar to ski racing, we take risks in life. We dream. We love. We jump. And sometimes we fall. Sometimes our hearts are broken. Sometimes we don't achieve the dreams we know we could have. But that is the also the beauty of life; we can try.\"I tried. I dreamt. I jumped.\"I hope if you take away anything from my journey it's that you all have the courage to dare greatly. Life is too short not to take chances on yourself. Because the only failure in life is not trying.\"I believe in you, just as you believed in me.\"Injuries, unfortunately, largely defined Vonn's career. She will always be heralded as one of the greatest skiers of all time, but her battles with knee issues and other ailments are more than just a footnote on her remarkable résumé. The most recent torn ligament and broken bone may spell the end of an unforgettable two-plus decades as one of the faces of the sport.Olympic skiing figures defend Vonn for competing on torn ACLThe consensus from the Olympic skiing community is clear: Don't blame Vonn for pushing the limits, and don't think that her crash was a result of her torn ACL.Leaders of international skiing bodies and some of Vonn's fellow competitors set the record straight that Sunday's crash was entirely unrelated to her preexisting injury.\"Totally incorrect,\" Vonn's teammate Keely Cashman said, via the Associated Press. \"People that don't know ski racing don't really understand what happened yesterday. She hooked her arm on the gate, which twisted her around. She was going probably 70 miles an hour, and so that twists your body around. That has nothing to do with her ACL, nothing to with her knee. I think a lot of people are ridiculing that, and a lot people don't [know] what's going on.\"International Ski and Snowboard Federation president Johan Eliasch called Vonn \"incredibly unlucky\" and said the incident was a \"one in 1,000\" situation.The downhill is alpine skiing's fastest and most dangerous event. A myriad of things could go wrong on any given run, often with dramatic consequences. A fully intact ACL would have done nothing to prevent Vonn from tumbling down the mountain after clipping the gate on that fateful jump.Vonn's dramatic exit from the downhill final precipitated a wave of hindsight-aided reactions from fans and pundits. The American skiing legend should have played it safe and backed out of the competition the moment she tore her ACL, some argued. But those most experienced in the sport emphasized that Vonn was able to train at a high caliber despite the injury, and they noted that she consulted with qualified trainers and coaches before making the decision to race.\"This decision was really hers and her team to take,\" International Olympic Committee sports director Pierre Ducrey said. \"She made the decision and unfortunately it led to the injury, but I think it's really the way that the decision gets made for every athlete that participates to the downhill.\"Vonn's competitive future in question after latest injuriesThat Vonn elected to compete in such a dangerous and demanding event at less than full strength may have led some to question her sanity, others commended the three-time Olympic medalist for her courage and commitment to the sport. The latter argument only solidifies her legacy as an all-time great. But with health being such a large part of her competitive story at this point in her career, it is reasonable to wonder just how much more Vonn has left in the tank.\nIf it were up to her father, Vonn would hang up her ski boots for good at the end of this Olympic run.\"She's 41 years old and this is the end of her career,\" Vonn's father, Alan Kildow, said to the Associated Press. \"There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.\"Vonn retired from competition in February 2019 after the World Championships, citing her already lengthy injury history. She announced nearly six years later that she was coming out of retirement, and with the goal of qualifying for the 2026 Winter Olympics, she returned to the slopes in December 2024. Two months ago, Vonn became the oldest downhill skiing World Cup winner at 41.\nIf this is the end of the road for Vonn in her professional endeavors, it will be a bitter exit from the sport for a fervent competitor.\"She's a very strong individual,\" Kildow said. \"She knows physical pain and she understands the circumstances that she finds herself in. And she's able to handle it. Better than I expected. She's a very, very strong person. And so I think she's handling it real well.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mornings for golf fans frequently consist of brewing a pot of coffee, flipping on PGA Tour coverage and answering emails with one eye on the golf in the background. Dew still rests on fairways as perfectly manicured golf courses, ideal weather and birdsong flood living rooms and in-home offices. Fans' appetites are whetted by coverage of rookies before marquee groupings finally make their way to the first tee.For some, that routine has been altered this year, largely due to Patrick Reed.The 2018 Masters champion has entered the winner's circle in two of his last three DP World Tour starts with wins at the Dubai Desert Classic and Qatar Masters sandwiching a playoff loss at the Bahrain Championship. Reed has ascended to No. 1 in the Race to Dubai, all but assuring him a full-time PGA Tour card for the 2027 season; those are offered to every golfer who finishes inside the top 10 of the season-long race, not otherwise exempt.Reed's point total has already reached 2,260 through four tournaments. Last season, Jordan Smith claimed the final PGA Tour card through the Race to Dubai with just 2,203 points. The year prior, Tom McKibbin did the same with 1,897 points (though he ultimately decided to play for LIV Golf instead).Reed will climb the priority rankings for the 2027 season after banking on using a past champions' exemption to play some PGA Tour events after deciding not to re-sign with LIV Golf. That will no longer be necessary as the American has jumped to No. 17 in the Official World Golf Rankings ahead of names like Collin Morikawa, Ludvig Åberg, Cameron Young and Matt Fitzpatrick.\nAs it goes with runs of form like this, fans now want to watch Reed on the biggest stage (PGA Tour), wondering why he's not already back on the circuit. A Returning Player Program got conjured out of thin air to bring Brooks Koepka back to the PGA Tour, but Reed does not come close to meeting those marks based on his past success.But you know what? That's OK. After all, what Reed is doing ... that's rare ... and you can follow his journey just the same.Reed's travel itinerary for the last four weeks featured Dubai (twice), Bahrain and Qatar. The ultimate grinder did just that through the Middle East. Next up are Africa and Asia before the schedule settles into its European stretch.\nThe 35-year-old could become the second American to ever win the Race to Dubai (Collin Morikawa, 2021, playing 10 tournaments) and first to do it while participating in a full-time DP World Tour schedule. Not since Tommy Fleetwood in 2017 has a Race to Dubai champion played more than 20 DP World Tour events.Reed could become a thorn in Rory McIlroy's side again as the five-time major champion looks to win his fifth straight Race to Dubai and tie Colin Montgomerie for the most all-time with eight. McIlroy averaged 5,755 points in his run of four straight season-long crowns; Reed is roughly 40% of the way there.Remember their rivalry? The Ryder Cup singles match in 2016 with the hooting, hollering, shushing and finger waving? Reed throwing a tee at McIlroy on the range in Dubai a few seasons back? That has the potential to be rekindled. Those two could share meaningful tee times on a stage that is not a major championship.\nIt would be great if this was happening on the PGA Tour, but all it will take is a shift in your morning schedule to watch Reed accumulate point after point and trophy after trophy on golf courses of which you may not be familiar, against players whose names you may not be able to pronounce.Take the time to watch a man going about it his own way, making his way back through the only way he knows how. In the process, Patrick Reed might even win you over, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a potential landmark ruling for the future of college sports, a judge denied Alabama basketball player Charles Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules, according to court documents obtained by AL.com. Bediako, who returned to the Crimson Tide after signing an NBA contract and playing in the G League, will no longer be permitted to play college basketball under NCAA bylaws.Bediako became the first former pro to return to college when he received a temporary restraining order against the NCAA in January. That order prohibited the NCAA from enforcing its eligibility rules on the 7-footer and paved the way for him to play in five games for the Crimson Tide, across which he averaged 10 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.The temporary restraining order was always a stopgap solution to get Bediako on the floor. His ultimate goal was to receive an injunction which would effectively clear him to play the rest of the season. Bediako and his counsel were back in court last Friday for the injunction hearing, and after deliberating on the matter over the weekend, judge Daniel Pruet ruled in the NCAA's favor and denied the injunction.\"Common sense won a round today,\" NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"The court saw this for what it is: an attempt by professionals to pivot back to college and crowd out the next generation of students. College sports are for students, not for people who already walked away to go pro and now want to hit the 'undo' button at the expense of a teenager's dream.\n\"While we're glad the court upheld the rules our members actually want, one win doesn't fix the national mess of state laws. It's time for Congress to stop watching from the sidelines and help us provide some actual stability.\"Bediako's return to college basketball drew the ire of many throughout the sport, and it even prompted SEC commissioner Greg Sankey to sign an affidavit against his cause. Days before the injunction hearing, Sankey asked the judge to uphold the eligibility rules \"which are essential to the integrity of college sports, to the educational mission they serve, and to the opportunities they provide for current and future student-athletes.\"This case delivered numerous twists, including an extension of Bediako's temporary restraining order, the recusal of a judge who was an Alabama booster and the postponement of the injunction hearing. All the while, Bediako was on the floor for the Crimson Tide for the first time since the 2023 NCAA Tournament.\n\"We are disappointed in today's court ruling, denying the injunction for Charles Bediako,\" the University of Alabama said in a statement. \"While we understand the concern around competitive and developmental implications of former professional athletes participating in college, it is important to acknowledge reality.\"The NCAA has granted eligibility to over 100 current men's basketball players with prior professional experience in the G League or overseas. Granting eligibility to some former professionals, and not to others, is what creates the havoc we are currently in and why consistency from decision-makers is so desperately needed.\"The NCAA does routinely grant eligibility waivers to athletes with professional experience -- namely those who played for G League Ignite before its fold in 2024 and those who come to the United States from overseas -- but only if they have not yet played American college basketball. The association strictly prohibits players like Bediako from leaving for the NBA or another pro league and then returning for a second stint of college basketball.\nBediako ruling could impact other ongoing eligibility casesWhile Bediako was the first professional player to return to college, he is not the only athlete seeking additional eligibility through the court system. His denial of an injunction could have ramifications for those other cases.All of these arguments exist on the basis that the NCAA's four-year eligibility limit unfairly restricts athletes' abilities to earn compensation for their name, image and likeness. Bediako sought to utilize the years he forwent when he declared for the NBA Draft. Others, like Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar and Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, argue that the seasons they spent in junior college should not count toward their four-year eligibility clocks.Both Aguilar and Chambliss went to state courts to seek another year with their respective football programs. Now that there exists legal precedent in one of these cases, the judges presiding over their respective cases could cite the Bediako ruling in decisions to rule against their injunctive relief. The quarterbacks' cases are different enough, however, that such an outcome is no guarantee.\n            ",

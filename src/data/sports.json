The Lakers lost in Cleveland on Wednesday to move to 3-2 on the trip and 28-18 on the season. Washington, meanwhile, is 12-34 overall, but has won two straight and has covered in five of its past six. Luka Doncic (ankle) and Austin Reaves (calf) are both questionable for the Lakers.

    "body": "\n        The College Sports Commission is currently investigating LSU for potential unreported NIL deals in violation of rules governing player compensation, per an email obtained by The Athletic. In that email sent on Jan. 15 to LSU athletic director Verge Ausberry, the CSC's head of investigations, Katie B. Medearis, informed the school that they were investigating whether they \"failed to report one or more third-party Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals,\" and requested a phone call with Ausberry or the LSU compliance staff. While the timing suggested it could be related to LSU's active transfer portal activity in football, where Lane Kiffin and the Tigers put together the No. 1 class in the country, NOLA.com reports the investigation is not related to the football program. This is the first known investigation by the CSC, which was formulated by the power conferences last year to govern revenue sharing and verify NIL deals under the new rules set by the House settlement in 2024. \nThe CSC issued a brief statement to The Athletic, confirming they have reached out to multiple schools regarding investigations.\"As previously indicated, the CSC has reached out to several schools to inform them of investigations into unreported NIL deals,\" a CSC spokesperson said. \"We will not comment further at this time.\"The specifics of the CSC's investigation into LSU are unknown, as nothing in their email to LSU detailed what players, sports or deals may be under scrutiny. \nThere remains a question of how much teams will cooperate with CSC investigations, and LSU figures to be the first -- and biggest -- test case for the commission. Their first task will be finding firm evidence to confirm any unreported NIL deals, but what the college sports world will really be looking at is what punishment they're able to levy if they do. LSU released a statement to NOLA.com stating they expected the investigation to be resolved quickly. \"We have been in regular communication with the CSC since the organization's formation and appreciate their ongoing collaboration and guidance,\" LSU spokesperson Zach Greenwell said in a statement. \"We anticipate this specific inquiry will be resolved shortly. We will not comment further on regulatory matters.\"\n            ",

And if you need any evidence of that, just look at how rapidly the salary cap has increased over the last decade. Ahead of the 2026 season, the salary cap will break $300 million for the first time, NFL Network reported Friday, as the league's financial explosion continues.The NFL has informed its clubs that the 2026 salary cap will land anywhere between $301.2 million and $305.7 million next season. That will be an increase of more than $20 million from one season to the next, and that hasn't been unusual in recent years. The cap has increased nearly $100 million since 2022, when it was set at $208.2 million.Going back over a decade, the NFL salary cap has risen exponentially with the only period of contraction coming during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the cap dipped from $198.2 million to $182.5 million, but the numbers have ballooned in each subsequent season.\nYou can thank the NFL's lucrative TV rights deals with its broadcast partners for these huge upticks, this trend doesn't seem like it'll stop anytime soon. This increase should only help teams who are up against a cap crunch, and it will provide more ammo to teams who already are loading up the money cannon in anticipation of free agency.\nPerhaps no one is happier about seeing the salary cap cross the $300 million mark than this year's crop of pending free agents, headlined by players like George Pickens and Trey Hendrickson who are set to command massive paydays.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic is set to return to the lineup on Friday against the Los Angeles Clippers after missing the last month with a hyperextended left knee, ESPN's Shams Charania reports. Jokić, listed as questionable on the team's injury report, has been out since suffering the injury against the Miami Heat on Dec. 29.Jokić, who was initially ruled out for at least four weeks, sat out 16 games in all -- the most he's ever missed in a season in his career. With Jokić sidelined, the Nuggets managed to go 10-6 and currently have a 32-16 record, good for third place in the Western Conference. A three-time MVP, Jokić will be eligible for NBA awards and All-NBA honors provided he reaches the 65-game threshold. He's played in 32 games this year and the Nuggets have 34 regular-season games remaining -- giving Jokić a thin margin to reach his 65th game. Jokić is also expected to suit up for Sunday's showdown against the Oklahoma City Thunder, the defending NBA champions. Jokić is averaging 29.6 points, 12.2 rebounds and 11.0 assists per game. He leads the NBA with 16 triple-doubles. He has the second-best odds to win MVP (+550) at FanDuel, behind Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, a heavy favorite at -340.\nNBA MVP outlook with Jokić backWith Jokić returning to the lineup against the Clippers, he will still be in the mix to earn All-NBA and MVP honors. While Gilgeous-Alexander is the clear betting favorite entering the weekend, Jokić can make things interesting down the stretch. However, if Jokić misses two more games the rest of the season, he would be ineligible for those awards.Gilgeous-Alexander has missed just two of OKC's 49 games this season. Los Angeles Lakers star Luka Dončić, who is third in MVP odds (+1700) behind Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokić, has appeared in 38 of the Lakers' 46 games this season. Further down the odds board are Cade Cunningham (+2700) and Jaylen Brown (+5000) with Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Maxey all listed at +25000 at FanDuel. \nDenver gets a boost at the perfect timeThe news of Jokić's return comes at an ideal time for the Nuggets, who have dealt with an array of injuries throughout the season. On Thursday, the Nuggets announced that forward Aaron Gordon will miss at least the next month with a right hamstring strain. Gordon will be re-evaluated in four to six weeks, which sets him up to potentially return in March, just ahead of the regular season's home stretch.\n        \n            \n                Aaron Gordon injury: Nuggets forward (hamstring) facing another extended absence in latest blow for Denver\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Nuggets have kept the ship afloat with several deep reserves seeing significant action -- but reinforcements appear to be coming.Denver coach David Adelman said this week that he hopes Jokić, Christian Braun and Cameron Johnson will all return before the All-Star break. Braun (ankle), who recently signed a five-year extension, has played in just 14 games this season. Johnson, who was acquired in the offseason in a deal centered around Michael Porter Jr., has played in just 28 games. Gordon has appeared in 23 games, while Jokić has played 32. The Nuggets face the Clippers, Thunder, Detroit Pistons and New York Knicks before the All-Star break.\nOne of the reasons Denver has managed to stay at the top of the standings is the play of star guard Jamal Murray, who is averaging career bests in points (25.9), assists (7.3) and rebounds (4.3). Additionally, Peyton Watson, a first-round pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, is in the midst of a breakout season. Watson is averaging 14.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.9 assists. Watson has started 35 games this season (45 appearances) after starting just 24 games during his first three years in the NBA.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It is planned that the Seattle Seahawks will go up for sale after competing in Super LX against the New England Patriots, according to ESPN; however, a spokesman representing the ownership of the franchise refuted those claims on Friday.\"We don't comment on rumors or speculation, and the team is not for sale,\" the spokesman said. \"We've already said that will change at some point per Paul's wishes, but I have no news to share. Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.\"The Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers have been owned by the estate of Paul G. Allen since the former owner of both franchises died of cancer in 2018. His sister, Jody, has controlled the teams in the years since his death.The Trail Blazers are in the midst of being sold as Allen's sister, in August 2025, reached an agreement to sell the team to Carolina Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon from Allen's estate. Closing date and sale terms were not disclosed at the time, though ESPN reported that the Blazers were worth an estimated $4 billion.\nIf the Seahawks are indeed put for sale after the NFL's championship game, it would mark the first time in the Super Bowl era that the entirety of a team that played in the title game would be up for sale shortly after its conclusion.A sale could reach between $7 billion and $8 billion, per ESPN, which received that estimate from an executive with another franchise. That would set a new NFL record. The Washington Commanders currently hold the mark after going for over $6 billion to the Josh Harris-led group in 2023.Some of the largest team sales in North American sports have come during the 2020s. Harris and company broke the record that was set in 2022 when the Walton-Penner group purchased the Denver Broncos for $4.65 billion. Mat Ishbia, the CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage, purchased the Phoenix Suns and the Phoenix Mercury for $4 billion.\nThis past summer, the Los Angeles Lakers were sold for a reported price tag of $10 billion, the largest sale in NBA and North American sports history. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 rookie class is phenomenal – if you play in IDP leagues.       Defenses dominated the week's Senior Bowl practices, leaving offensive highlights fairly sparing by comparison. It meant for an underwhelming week, which may very well be par for the course in a draft cycle where people across the league believe that there is far more talent on defense than on offense, especially among skill-position players.       Last year there were 17 rookies taken within the first 12 rounds of redraft leagues according to CBS Sports Average Draft Position. Of the 17, five averaged a selection within the first six rounds.       Expect those numbers to slide a little bit with the 2026 class. Simply put, the talent pool isn't as deep, and it would be criminal to try and sell you on this year's rookie class as if it were as rich as last year's.       That being said, there were some skill-position players who differentiated themselves through the Senior Bowl practices. Don't think of them as rising to the point where they'll be first-rounders, but rather rising above the average-level prospects. They'll have a chance to be good for Fantasy if they can find the right spot – which is always the case but especially important this year given the lack of high-level talent.      \nHere's a look at the players who stood out during the week – strictly based on what I saw this week and not taking into account anything they or anyone else did during the college season.              Quarterbacks      Cole Payton, North Dakota State: I thought Payton was the most accurate and anticipatory thrower all week who also made a handful of off-schedule plays. Not until the third practice did he start showing some flaws in his passing, and even then he still made some quality throws. He was known just as much for his rushing as his passing playing at the FCS level but really let his arm do the talking this week. That's a good thing since both factors can eventually make him a potential Fantasy option when and if he gets the chance to play.       \nTaylen Green, Arkansas: Green is tall, lanky and lean with a big arm and real good mobility. As project-QBs go he's great, but he doesn't have the consistency needed to be an NFL starter anytime soon. A team will draft him for his traits and put him on a pathway to be a starter in a year or so if he improves. Fantasy managers can hope for such a thing because if he does then his aggressive throwing and rushing combo will yield some nice stats.       \n      Running backs      Mike Washington Jr., Arkansas: It was Washington's acceleration that separated him from the rest of a decent running back group. That quick speed will translate to the pro game, and his thicker-than-most frame will create problems for defenses that can't wrap him up at first contact. Washington's receiving skills were also on display throughout the week and even his pass protection wasn't bad (he told CBS Sports he was working on it for the combine). If there was a RB in Mobile who had a chance to be a three-down player at some point before the end of next season, it would be Washington.       \nKaytron Allen, Penn State: I like Allen for his one-cut downhill running style and good speed. He can run with physicality, and he's not a finished product in pass protection but he's not bad at all. I wouldn't be surprised if he began his career getting around eight touches per game.       \n      Wide receivers      Malachi Fields, Notre Dame: Tall and rangy with good footwork, Fields could compete for maybe a 50% route participation rate right away. His ball tracking skills were great and he had this nuance in his technique to know just how to separate from coverage at just the right time to make a catch. He won't win a lot of races with pure speed but that's to be expected from someone as big as he is.       \nJosh Cameron, Baylor: Cameron might have been the most versatile receiver at the Senior Bowl. He had the speed to blow past coverage, the quick feet to change directions and separate by a yard or two at will, the eyeballs to track downfield throws properly, the ability to adjust his body to off-target throws and the hands to reel them in. Built in the mold of A.J. Brown and Anquan Boldin, Cameron has the traits teams look for when they need a real good complementary receiver, but he might have just enough to become a No. 1 someday.       \nCaleb Douglas, Texas Tech: A little leaner than most would want from a 6-foot-3 receiver, but that lack of weight is what gives him a little more speed compared to other big men. I thought he had some real good hands and flashed some explosiveness in his breaks at times.       \nTyren Montgomery, John Carroll: Not the biggest guy and certainly not the most experienced receiver considering he played in Division III, but Montgomery put himself on the radar with a solid week's worth of work. The top trait was his footwork, be it off the snap or at the top of his route to get himself open. He had the speed and route discipline to beat FBS-level cornerbacks on several occasions. And Montgomery still has more room to grow – he's only been playing football for two years!     \n     Tight ends     Tanner Koziol, Houston: This is the only tight end who flashed over multiple practices. He leaped high for a pass in the back corner of the end zone and otherwise was that sweet combination of sure-handed and physical. You won't see big-time speed, but his size and hands make him a differentiator compared to the rest of the class.       \nNate Boerkircher, Texas A&M: Great size, good technique and really good concentration was always a part of his game at school, but it took the Senior Bowl for him to show it often enough in practice and prove he can be a good receiving threat.     \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Former UCLA star Amari Bailey, who appeared in 10 NBA games with the Charlotte Hornets, has hired a lawyer to petition the NCAA with the hopes of returning to college basketball on one more season of eligibility, according to ESPN. The 21-year-old Bailey spent one season with the Bruins before declaring for the 2023 NBA Draft. \"Right now I'd be a senior in college,\" Bailey told ESPN. \"I'm not trying to be 27 years old playing college athletics. No shade to the guys that do; that's their journey. But I went to go play professionally and learned a lot, went through a lot. So like, why not me?\"  Bailey was selected by the Hornets in the second round of the draft and logged 10 games as a rookie on a two-way contract. In that span, he averaged 2.3 points on 33.3% shooting from the field. He signed with the Brooklyn Nets in September 2024 and eventually joined the Long Island Nets of the NBA's G League. Bailey most recently spent time with the Iowa Wolves, the G League affiliate of the Minnesota Timberwolves. \nNo basketball player has ever returned to college after playing in an NBA game. \"The NCAA has not and will not grant eligibility to any players who have signed an NBA contract,\" NCAA senior vice president of external affairs Tim Buckley told ESPN. \"Congress can strengthen NCAA rules so professional athletes cannot sue their way back to competing against college students.\"  Bailey's case will be the latest test of NCAA eligibility as several former players seek a return to the collegiate level. Alabama's Charles Bediako was recently allowed to return to the Crimson Tide after spending three years with various G League teams. \nBediako initially played at Alabama from 2021-23 before declaring for the 2023 NBA Draft, where he went undrafted. He has since appeared in games with the Austin Spurs, Grand Rapids Gold and Motor City Cruise. A key point in Bediako's argument for eligibility is that he is within the NCAA's five-year window for eligibility. The clock started when he enrolled at Alabama as a freshman in the 2021-22 season, and the 2025-26 season marks Year 5 on his clock. Bediako's representation argues that, since Bediako never appeared in an actual NBA game, he should be allowed to return for a fifth year of eligibility. Bediako has already appeared in two games for Alabama this season. He played 25 minutes and scored 13 points in a loss to Tennessee and appeared for 18 minutes with 14 points in a win against Missouri.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers have officially signed coach Matt LaFleur to a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Friday. Terms were not disclosed. The extension comes after reports that LaFleur's future in Green Bay was uncertain following a 31-27 wild-card loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFL Playoffs.The Packers also announced multi-year contract extensions for general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of football operations Russ Ball. Gutekunst joined the Packers in 1999 and worked his way up to general manager in 2018. Ball has 38 years of NFL experience, including the last 19 with the Packers. \"We are excited to extend our commitment to Brian, Matt and Russ as the leaders of our football operations. Their steadfast dedication, passion and collaboration have remained constant in our drive to compete at the highest level,\" Packers president and CEO Ed Policy said. \"While we are all disappointed with the way this season ended, we remain aligned in purpose and have spent considerable time over the past weeks collaborating on a path forward. I am exceedingly confident we have the right people to achieve our goal. The entire Packers organization looks forward to supporting every effort to bring our community and fans another championship that they very much deserve.\"LaFleur is 76-40-1 in Green Bay with six postseason appearances in seven years -- with a 3-6 overall record in the playoffs. The coach said after the loss in Chicago that he wanted to remain with the Packers. Green Bay conceded an 18-point lead in the second half despite four touchdown passes from franchise quarterback Jordan Love.LaFleur was adamant that he wanted to remain with the Packers. \n\"Of course [I want to return]. This is one of one,\" LaFleur said. \"I love this place. I love the people. As much as you guys drive me nuts sometimes, I love you guys. I love our players, the locker room, everybody in our organization. I mean, this is a unique place. The community has been outstanding.\"Love gave LaFleur his seal of approval after the Packers' ill-fated fourth quarter against the Bears, who scored 25 points in the final frame to win.\"Yeah, I definitely think Matt should be the head coach. I've got a lot of love for Matt. I think he does a great job. And that's it,\" Love said.\nLaFleur is currently the Packers' fourth-winningest coach with 76 victories, trailing only Vince Lombardi (89), Mike McCarthy (125) and Curly Lambeau (209). His 76 regular-season wins are tied for the second-most by a coach in his first seven seasons in NFL history, along with Hall of Famer Paul Brown.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Minnesota Vikings fired general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah on Friday, just eight months after signing him to a multi-year contract extension.\"Following our annual end-of-season organizational meetings over the last several weeks and after careful consideration, we have decided it is in the best interest of the team to move forward with new leadership of our football operations,\" co-owners Mark and Zygi Wilf said in a statement. \"These decisions are never easy. We are grateful for Kwesi's contributions and commitment to the organization over the past four years and wish him and his family the best in the future.\"Executive Vice President of Football Operations Rob Brzezinski will oversee the Vikings' front-office operations through the 2026 NFL Draft, after which the team will begin its search for a new general manager.\"Rob brings tremendous credibility and experience, understands our roster and has the ability to build consensus and rely on the expertise of our personnel and coaches,\" the Wilfs said. \"Building a team that can contend for championships drives us every day, and we look forward to bringing our fans the success they so deserve.\"\nThe move came as a shock around the NFL, as the Vikings signed Adofo-Mensah to an extension in May after Minnesota's 14-3 campaign in 2024. The Vikings took a step back in 2025, going 9-8 and missing the playoffs after opting not to re-sign Sam Darnold. Minnesota instead chose to move forward with 2024 first-round quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who had injury problems and struggled, as many young quarterbacks do, when he was healthy. Darnold, meanwhile, has led the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl LX, where they are the favorites to hoist the Lombardi Trophy against the New England Patriots. Why the Vikings fired Adofo-MensahIn the four years with Adofo-Mensah as general manager, the Vikings went 43-25 with a pair of playoff appearances. His work in building the 2024 team was widely praised, but his draft record and the Vikings' cap sheet spelled trouble going into 2026. \nIn four drafts with Adofo-Mensah at the helm, the Vikings struggled to acquire the impact players they hoped for. His five first-round picks in that span -- Lewis Cine, Jordan Addison, McCarthy, Dallas Turner and Donovan Jackson -- have produced mixed results. Cine was cut after two seasons, Jackson anchored an underwhelming offensive line this year, and Addison has struggled to stay on the field because of injuries and off-field issues. Turner emerged as a bright spot with eight sacks, but the biggest issue for Adofo-Mensah was going all-in on McCarthy.The Vikings traded up to take McCarthy in the 2024 draft, giving up a pair of mid-round picks to jump from No. 11 to No. 10 overall. The plan was always for Darnold to serve as a bridge to McCarthy -- who missed his rookie season with a knee injury -- but when he led Minnesota to a 14-3 record, the Vikings had to give the decision serious thought.\nThey ultimately stuck with the plan and turned things over to McCarthy, who struggled in 10 games this season. He completed 57.6% of his passes for 1,632 yards, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in his first year as a starter. While the Vikings went 6-4 with McCarthy under center, much of their success hinged on an elite (and expensive) defense.That's what made choosing McCarthy over Darnold so controversial. The Vikings had a defense ready to contend now, but even the most optimistic view of McCarthy involved a young quarterback with considerable talent who would need time to reach his potential. That put the offense and defense on different timelines, and the result was a 9-8 season.Now Minnesota enters 2026 with a cluttered cap sheet, nearly $49 million over the limit, per Over the Cap. Only the Kansas City Chiefs face a more dire cap situation, and the next Vikings GM will have a tall order in figuring out how best to proceed. Whoever takes over will be tasked with getting Minnesota back into the hunt in the highly competitive NFC North, where the Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers all have playoff aspirations for 2026. And they'll have to do it without many clear avenues to upgrade the roster and likely needing to shed money.\nThe McCarthy decision now facing Minnesota's next GM\nA new regime in Minnesota could mean changes at quarterback sooner rather than later. We'll find out exactly how much belief coach Kevin O'Connell has in McCarthy, as Adofo-Mensah was clearly a strong believer in the young quarterback. A new GM, however, won't have the same ties to him.As such, one of the first major evaluations for whoever steps into the general manager role will be whether they view McCarthy as the franchise quarterback of the future.Given the Vikings' cap situation, it wouldn't be surprising if McCarthy gets another year to show what he can do. Minnesota likely won't be in the market for a high-priced free agent, and this year's draft class isn't highly regarded beyond Fernando Mendoza, who is the favorite to go No. 1 to the Raiders. Without a clear path to a replacement, a new Vikings GM may opt for an evaluation year with McCarthy.\nThe 2026 season was always going to be important for McCarthy's development, but with a new general manager in place who didn't draft him, it will be even more critical. He won't just need to show growth -- he'll need to take a major leap into becoming a quality starter if he wants to keep the job long-term.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There continues to be uncertainty around Cleveland Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz and what his next step might be.Schwartz was strongly considered to be the Browns' next head coach before the franchise opted to instead hire Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken. There was hope that he would stay on as Monken's defensive coordinator (he is under contract with the Browns through 2026), but sources told CBS Sports that Schwartz wants out of Cleveland. As CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones said when Monken was hired, the Browns know Schwartz well enough to know he would not be \"filled with glee\" to be passed over for the job, which he had hoped would be his first head coaching gig since 2013 with the Detroit Lions. \nDespite a 5-12 record, Cleveland finished fourth in the NFL in total defense this season, giving up just 283.6 yards per game. That included Myles Garrett's single-season league record 23 sacks as the featured threat within a feared pass rush. The Browns managed 53 total sacks -- third-highest in the league -- and allowed 167.2 yards passing per game, second-best in the AFC behind the Buffalo Bills. Schwartz is of interest to the San Francisco 49ers for their defensive coordinator opening after Robert Saleh left for Tennessee. Additionally, some sources who know Schwartz believe it's possible he could return to the Philadelphia Eagles if Vic Fangio retires. \nIf Schwartz does not end up in San Francisco, one of the other names to keep an eye on is former Atlanta Falcons head coach Raheem Morris. Prior to going to Atlanta, Morris won a Super Bowl as the Los Angeles Rams' defensive coordinator. Updates on remaining head coach vacancies — Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak remains the popular name for the Las Vegas Raiders' opening. Kubiak has helped guide the Seattle Seahawks to this year's Super Bowl with an offense that ranked in the top 10 in total yards, passing yards and points per game this season. The son of former NFL head coach Gary Kubiak, the 38-year old Klint is in a good position to land his first head coaching opportunity this cycle. Among the others still involved with the Las Vegas opening is Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero. Prior to working in Carolina, Evero was a long-time Rams assistant and a defensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos. \n— In Arizona, the most popular name among industry sources continues to be Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur. The younger brother of Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur, Mike has already met with Cardinals' brass for an in-person visit. The 38-year old has been with the Rams since 2023. Coordinator movement— Denver Broncos quarterbacks coach Davis Webb has been a hot name this head coaching cycle, but the current belief is he'll remain in Denver. Nothing is official but sources believe there is a good chance he'll be promoted to offensive coordinator to replace Joe Lombardi. The Broncos fired Lombardi two days after they were eliminated in the AFC Championship. — Industry sources view former Carolina Panthers and Indianapolis Colts head coach Frank Reich as the current favorite to become the next New York Jets offensive coordinator. Reich spent last season as a one-year interim coach for Stanford. Reich was last an offensive coordinator back in 2017 with the Philadelphia Eagles. If hired, Reich would replace Tanner Engstrand, who lasted only a year on Aaron Glenn's Jets staff. The Jets already also made a change at the defensive coordinator position, hiring former Miami Dolphins assistant Brian Duker to replace Steve Wilks. \n— The Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills both have interest in Denver Broncos pass game coordinator Jim Leonhard for their defensive coordinator openings. He was previously also in the mix and interviewed for the Los Angeles Charges defensive coordinator that ultimately went to Chris O'Leary. — LSU offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. has gotten a good amount of NFL interest this cycle, but he's not the only college name to pop up. Multiple NFL teams showed interest in Indiana defensive coordinator Bryant Haines for defensive coordinator jobs, though he is staying in Bloomington. Haines, one of the nation's highest-paid college assistant coaches, is fresh off winning a national championship and led the way for a unit that ranked second nationally in scoring defense. \n        \n            \n                Curt Cignetti's eye for coaching talent built college football's best staff. Here's how.\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe 40-year old Haines will be a hot name for college head coaching and NFL coordinator opportunities moving forward.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Minnesota Vikings have turned the front office on its head, firing general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah on Friday. It's a rather remarkable turn of events, considering that this comes mere months after he inked an extension with the franchise. On the flip side, it's not as shocking when looking at Minnesota's recent misses both in free agency and at the NFL Draft. Most notably, the Vikings appear to have botched their quarterback situation entirely, which is enough to get anyone axed.With Adofo-Mensah now out the door, it stands to wonder where the organization will go from here at that central position, specifically as it relates to starter J.J. McCarthy. Adofo-Mensah traded up to select McCarthy out of Michigan with the No. 10 overall pick at the 2024 NFL Draft, and then let Sam Darnold depart the following offseason (despite a 14-3 record as the starter during the 2024 regular season) to install him as QB1. In 2025, McCarthy went 6-4 as the starter and struggled mightily over those 10 starts (missed seven games due to injury). By stark contrast, Darnold maintained his superb play, and Adofo-Mensah's firing comes in the shadow of Darnold leading the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl LX. \nBelow, we'll dive into what this firing may mean for the future of McCarthy in Minnesota.\nThe clock is ticking for McCarthy to prove himselfIn the aftermath of Adofo-Mensah's firing, Vikings owner Mark Wilf said that he expects to conduct \"a thorough search\" for a new general manager after the 2026 NFL Draft. In the meantime, executive vice president of football operations Rob Brzezinski will lead the team effectively as an interim GM through the draft. This is important from McCarthy's perspective on a couple of different fronts. On the one hand, a new general manager is on the way, one who is not tied to McCarthy in any fashion, which could make it easier for them to cut ties with the young quarterback in some form or fashion. On the other hand, that GM will not arrive until after the draft, which means they will not be there in free agency either. With Minnesota well over the salary cap at the moment (-$48.9 million) and picking No. 18 overall in what is slated to be a thin quarterback draft class, there are not a lot of clear avenues for an outright replacement at the given moment. \nThat sets up McCarthy with a make-or-break season in 2026, which could essentially be looked at as an audition for the incoming general manager before he begins putting a bigger stamp on the roster beginning in 2027. If he continues to look like the quarterback we saw for the balance of last season, his days as Minnesota's QB1 will be done in short order. J.J. McCarthy's 2025 seasonStatsNFL RankCompletion percentage58%LastTD-INT11-12LastPasser rating72.6LastIt is worth noting, however, that McCarthy did start to come around over his final four games from a production standpoint, leading the Vikings to a 4-0 record over that stretch with a passer rating of 100.4J.J.

While Rob Brzezinski was with the organization when McCarthy was drafted, we don't know if he has the same belief/affinity for him as Adofo-Mensah did. If he doesn't, the door could be open for a departure, especially during an offseason where the QB market isn't robust, both at the NFL Draft and in free agency. For instance, Fernando Mendoza is the prize of their year's draft, but the Indiana quarterback is earmarked for the Las Vegas Raiders, who hold the No. 1 overall pick. With Oregon's Dante Moore elected to stay in college and forgo the draft, the pool is shallow for QB-needy teams. McCarthy, who just turned 23, could provide rebuilding teams with youth at the position, and if they believe they can tap into his potential, could look to make a move. Some teams that could make sense in that regard are: \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins It's a foregone conclusion that the Dolphins will move on from Tua Tagovaila in some capacity this offseason, following his in-season benching in 2025. On top of that, there's a new regime at Miami Gardens with GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and head coach Jeff Hafley coming over from Green Bay. Sitting with the No. 11 overall pick, they are out of range for any blue-chip quarterback prospect and are in a similar salary cap bind as the Vikings (currently $30.3 million over), so they'd need to bring in a cheap option like McCarthy, who is on his rookie deal. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsSimilar to Miami, the Cardinals are in a situation with their veteran quarterback, Kyler Murray, which seems like it will result in a departure this offseason, creating a need at the position. Arizona is still currently looking for a head coach, but the franchise is looking down the barrel of a rebuild that'll likely take a few seasons. They own the No. 3 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft, but as we noted, there may be no viable quarterback sitting there when they are on the clock and could be better served using that selection for other needs. McCarthy could give them a lottery ticket that could spike the turnaround if he can put it all together, especially with weapons like Trey McBride, Marvin Harrison Jr., and Michael Wilson at his disposal. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York JetsNew York tried to revitalize Justin Fields last season, and it blew up in their face, so they may not be too keen on kicking the can with another first-round talent. That said, they may not have a bunch of options. The Jets were burned the most by Dante Moore staying in school, because they sit with the No. 2 overall pick this spring, which meant they would've either been able to select him or Mendoza to fill their need under center. Maybe they take a swing at Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson with the No. 16 overall pick, but there's also the possibility of them simply addressing other needs with those two first-rounders and opting for a different route at quarterback. They could roll the dice with McCarthy via trade, and if it doesn't work out will be in a 2027 NFL Draft pool that is slated to be much deeper at quarterback.  Potential QBs targets for MinnesotaAs we noted, the Vikings are currently tangled in knots with the salary cap. Even when they get their books in order and are cap compliant, they likely won't be able to swing for anything major. That said, some interesting options could be on the table. \nJones played well enough for the 49ers last season that he likely earned himself another nod at being a team's franchise quarterback. Filling in for the injured Brock Purdy for eight games, Jones led the Niners to a 5-3 record and had a 97.4 passer rating over that stretch. One of the biggest issues with McCarthy thus far has been his inability to get Minnesota's top weapons -- like Justin Jefferson -- regularly involved. They wouldn't have nearly as much of an issue in that regard with someone like Jones. The former first-rounder only has a $3.9 million cap hit next season and a base salary of $2.8 million, making him extremely affordable for a team like the Vikings in 2026. That said, San Francisco likely won't give him up for nothing, and he'll likely look for an extension upon any trade to make him the starter, which is something to note. \nGiven the way Atlanta restructured Cousins' contract at the end of the 2025 regular season, he'll almost certainly be released at some point this offseason. That creates a lane for the Vikings to reunite with their former quarterback and do so within their ability from a salary cap perspective. Entering his age-38 season in 2026, Cousins is not a long-term answer for the Vikings, but one that could keep them competitive as they search for a developmental signal-caller over the next few drafts in the event they do move off of McCarthy. Filling in for the injured Michael Penix Jr. last season, Cousins was capable, owning a 5-5 record as the starter that included a 4-0 run over the final month. \nWillis is likely to have plenty of suitors this offseason as the Packers quarterback is slated to hit free agency. If Minnesota could make it work financially, this could be the best option of the bunch, especially if Willis continues to flash as he did in relief with Green Bay this season. The 26-year-old started just one game for the Packers due to an injury to Jordan Love, but did impress over his short showing. Willis came in under duress after Love's injury and completed 9-of-11 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown in an overtime loss to the Bears in Chicago. The following week, he started and completed 85.7% of his passes (18-of-21) for 288 yards, a touchdown, and added two rushing touchdowns, albeit in a loss to Baltimore. There was enough there where offensive-minded coaches like Kevin O'Connell could look at Willis and see untapped potential. \n            ",

One of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a pick on Michigan vs. Michigan State to feature in Friday best bets at bet365.Friday also features a nine-game NBA slate, and the SportsLine proven computer model has picked out a pair of NBA best bets, backing the Toronto Raptors to upset the Orlando Magic (-2.5) at +105 odds and the Denver Nuggets to cover as 2.5-point underdogs against the Los Angeles Clippers. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons.

Bet it at bet365 here:Raptors (+105) to defeat the Magic\nThe Raptors had their four-game winning streak snapped in a 119-92 loss to the Knicks on Wednesday, but the Knicks are one of the favorites to win the Eastern Conference and are tied for the second-best record in the conference, so that's certainly not a bad loss. The game before, the Raptors defeated the Thunder, 103-101, on the road, proving they have the talent to knock off any team in the league. A recent win in Oklahoma City means a trip to Orlando shouldn't intimidate the Raptors, who are 29-20 this season. The Magic (24-22) are coming off a 133-124 win over the Heat on Wednesday, but they lost four straight before that contest. The Raptors have won four straight games against Orlando, including a 107-106 win in December. The model projects Toronto win in 64% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Raptors at bet365 here:Michigan State (+2.5) vs. Michigan (-110)\"Both of these teams enter their first of two regular season rivalry showdowns coming off sweaty mid-week wins, with Michigan snatching victory from Nebraska and Sparty having to roar back from a potential upset spot against Rutgers,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"But while Michigan State might have been caught in a lookahead spot, I think Michigan's close win is more in line with its recent form. The Wolverines have failed to cover in each of their last seven games, and there are some matchup points that will allow Michigan State to negate some of what has made Michigan so excellent this season. Plus, Tom Izzo at home as an underdog in a rivalry game? I'll take those points all day.\" Back Michigan State at bet365 here:Nuggets (+2.5) vs. Clippers (-115)The Nuggets play the second half of a back-to-back following a 107-103 victory over the Nets, which could signal multiple players sitting out Friday given the amount of injuries currently facing Denver. However, the Nuggets retain homecourt advantage for Friday, and they are 13-9 in Denver this season. The Clippers aren't at full health either, including Kawhi Leonard (knee) as questionable. The Clippers are on a roll, winning nine of their last 10 games, but six of those wins came against losing teams. Even with Denver's injury situation, which has featured Nikola Jokic (knee) out for weeks, only the Thunder and Pistons have more wins than the Nuggets this season. Denver enters at 32-16 and the Clippers are 22-24. The model projects the Nuggets to cover in 59% of simulations. Back the Nuggets at bet365 here:\nLooking for NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Friday.

    "body": "\n        CBS Sports is assessing the NFL's financial landscape through awards for the 13th straight year now that the Super Bowl LX matchup is set. These awards differ from traditional NFL honors because they take an economic perspective, emphasizing 2025 veteran acquisitions.Players acquired via trades or free agency can have a tremendous impact on an NFL team's fortunes. These awards do not consider rookies because their salaries are dictated by draft position and the rookie wage scale. The same applies to players who sign restricted free agent tenders, since the NFL's Collective Bargaining Agreement sets those amounts. A runner-up is named when warranted.Most Valuable Acquisition\nThe Seahawks pivoted to Sam Darnold after contract extension talks with Geno Smith stalled prior to his trade to the Las Vegas Raiders in March. Darnold signed a team-friendly three-year, $100.5 million contract in free agency that averages $33.5 million per year and can reach $115.5 million through incentives. If Smith had been willing to accept a Darnold-type deal, he would still be Seattle's quarterback.The contract was structured to give the Seahawks a small window to get out after this season if Darnold didn't play well. Of the $27.5 million he's scheduled to make in 2026, $17.5 million is guaranteed for injury and becomes fully guaranteed five days after Super Bowl LX on Feb. 13. If Seattle parts ways with him in 2026, it would carry $25.6 million in dead money -- a salary cap charge for a player no longer on the roster -- while Darnold would collect $37.5 million for one year.\nA quick exit isn't a consideration for the Seahawks after they advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 years. Darnold showed his 2024 Pro Bowl season wasn't just a product of Minnesota Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell's offensive brilliance. He earned another Pro Bowl nod, and Seattle secured the top seed in the NFC with a 14-3 record.Darnold completed 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, posting a 99.1 passer rating. He is reshaping his reputation for \"choking\" in big games. Darnold went 25 of 36 (69.4%) for 356 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions for a 127.8 passer rating in Seattle's 31-27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game.Runner-up: Micah Parsons, EDGE, PackersLeast Valuable Acquisition\nThe Raiders dealt a 2025 third-round pick to the Seahawks for Geno Smith in March. They acquired Smith to provide the quarterback stability the franchise had lacked, with six different players starting at the position since releasing Derek Carr following the 2022 season. \nShortly after the trade, Smith received a two-year, $75 million contract extension that averages $37.5 million per year and includes $50.5 million in guarantees, with $42.5 million fully guaranteed at signing. Incentives and salary escalators can push the deal's value as high as $84 million.The trade reunited Smith with Pete Carroll, whom the Raiders hired as head coach last January. Carroll coached Smith during the first five years of his six-year run in Seattle.Smith didn't resemble the player who won the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year award in 2022 this season. He led the league with 19 interceptions, and his 84.7 passer rating ranked 30th in the NFL. The Raiders went 2-13 in the 15 games Smith started.\nThe Raiders fired Carroll after finishing 3-14, one more loss than in 2024. The team is expected to select Indiana University Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza to replace Smith after securing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.Runner-up: Justin Fields, QB, JetsOffensive Signing of the Year\nThe 49ers' decision to give Mac Jones a two-year, $8.41 million contract worth a maximum of $12.91 million through incentives to back up Brock Purdy was viewed as little more than a blip on the NFL radar when he signed last March. Jones proved far more valuable than expected, keeping San Francisco afloat during the eight games Purdy missed with a turf toe injury.The 49ers won five of the eight games Jones started. He completed 69.6% of his passes (201 of 289) for 2,151 yards with 13 touchdowns and six interceptions, posting a 97.4 passer rating over that stretch.\nRunner-up: Sam Darnold, QB, Seahawks\n        \n            \n                Five potential NFL trades that could go down during Super Bowl week: Will Mac Jones be the next QB revival?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDefensive Signing of the Year\nConventional wisdom suggested Micah Parsons would become the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback at some point before the regular season started. Most expected that deal to come from the Dallas Cowboys. Instead, a bitter contract dispute with owner Jerry Jones led to Parsons being traded to the Green Bay Packers at the end of August for a 2026 first-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick and defensive tackle Kenny Clark.As part of the trade, Parsons received a four-year, $186 million contract extension with $136.007 million in overall guarantees, including $123.107 million fully guaranteed at signing. His $46.5 million per year and $123.107 million fully guaranteed at signing are non-quarterback records.Parsons recorded 12.5 sacks in 14 games before tearing the ACL in his left knee. According to NFL Next Gen Stats, he led the league with 83 quarterback pressures (combined sacks, quarterback hits and quarterback hurries) through 15 weeks when he got hurt. Parsons generated 37.9% of Green Bay's pressures and 29.9% of its sacks. Only Cleveland Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett accounted for a larger share of his team's pressures (43.4%) and sacks (27.2%). Parsons earned first-team All-Pro honors and is a finalist for the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year award.\nThe Packers didn't win another game after Parsons went down. They allowed 20.1 points per game with him and 27.5 after his ACL tear over the final four games, including a wild card playoff loss to the Chicago Bears. The attention Parsons drew with double teams and offensive line slides on passing downs also created opportunities for teammates. Green Bay averaged 2.4 sacks per game with Parsons and just one per game without him.Biggest Steal\nThe Bears had no idea Nahshon Wright would play such a prominent role on their defense when they quickly signed him to a one-year deal at his $1.1 million league minimum after the Vikings released him in April. He spent the 2024 season on Minnesota's practice squad after the Vikings acquired him that preseason from the Cowboys for cornerback Andrew Booth.Wright seized an opportunity created by multiple injuries at cornerback and put together a breakout season. He earned NFC Defensive Player of the Month honors for November and led the NFL with eight takeaways (five interceptions and three fumble recoveries).\nLate in the season, Wright said he would like to remain in Chicago. The Bears already have significant financial commitments at cornerback, though. Jaylon Johnson is in the second year of the four-year, $76 million deal he signed in 2024 that averages $19 million per year. Kyler Gordon signed a three-year, $40 million extension in April that averages $13,333,333 per year.Best Use of a Contract Year\nGeorge Pickens had worn out his welcome with the Pittsburgh Steelers because of his attitude and immaturity despite his immense talent. The Steelers trading the equivalent of a second-round pick to the Seahawks for wide receiver DK Metcalf in March -- and giving him a four-year extension averaging nearly $33 million per year -- spoke volumes about their frustrations with Pickens.The calculated risk the Cowboys took by trading a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick to the Steelers for Pickens and a 2027 sixth-round pick last May paid big dividends. Pickens posted career highs with 93 receptions, 1,429 receiving yards and nine touchdowns while averaging 15.4 yards per catch. The 2022 second-round pick ranked in the NFL's top 10 in each of those categories this season. He earned a Pro Bowl nod and second-team All-NFL honors for the first time in his career.\nAbsent a new deal before early March, Pickens will receive the franchise tag. The deadline for teams to use the franchise or transition tag is March 3 at 4 p.m. ET.The 2026 non-exclusive franchise tag for wide receivers projects to 9.016% of the 2026 salary cap, up from 8.581% in 2025. If the 2026 cap is set at $300 million -- a 7.45% increase over 2025's $279.2 million figure — the wide receiver tag should come in at $27.047 million.Patience could work in Pickens' favor. His best deal could come from letting Nico Collins and Puka Nacua, who will be in contract years in 2026, further define the wide receiver market, provided their respective deals with the Houston Texans and Rams are done before the July 15 deadline for franchise players to sign long term. Seahawks wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba could also factor into the equation, as the 2023 first-round pick is now eligible for an extension.\nRunners-up: Devin Lloyd, LB, Jaguars and Kyle Pitts, TE, Falcons\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: George Pickens, Breece Hall and others cashing in during contract years\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWorst Use of a Contract Year\nCam Robinson signed a one-year, $12 million contract worth a maximum of $14.5 million through incentives as part of the Texans' wholesale offensive line overhaul. The assumption was he would replace Laremy Tunsil, who was traded to the Washington Commanders in March, at left tackle.However, a minor left knee injury during training camp opened the door for 2025 second-round pick Aireontae Ersery to win the starting job. Robinson had started all 101 games he played over his first eight NFL seasons prior to this campaign.The Browns losing starting left tackle Dawand Jones to a season-ending knee injury in Week 3 prompted a trade for Robinson. The Texans acquired a 2027 sixth-round pick in exchange for Robinson and a 2027 seventh-round pick. Robinson was a healthy scratch in his final game with Houston against the Titans in Week 4 before the deal.\nRobinson validated Houston's decision to move him while he was with the Browns. After the trade, only Stone Forsythe allowed more than the eight sacks Robinson gave up in his 13 games in Cleveland, according to Pro Football Focus.Runner-up: Haason Reddick, EDGE, BuccaneersBest Contract Extension (for a team)\nThe Bills signed James Cook to a four-year, $46 million extension in August after contentious negotiations. The deal averages $11.5 million per year and includes $30 million in guarantees, with $15.28 million fully guaranteed. Salary escalators can push the contract's value as high as $48 million. The signing came after the 2022 second-round pick skipped voluntary offseason workouts and staged a hold-in during training camp because of his frustration with contract talks.Cook's chances of landing the $15 million per year he sought disappeared once Kyren Williams, a fellow 2022 draft pick, signed a three-year, $33 million extension with the Rams that averages $11 million per year about a week earlier. Cook was coming off a 2024 season in which he rushed for 1,009 yards while averaging 4.9 yards per carry. He also shared the NFL lead with 16 rushing touchdowns.Cook delivered a 2025 season nobody saw coming. After averaging 64.6 rushing yards per game over his previous two years as a starter, he made a massive jump by leading the league at 95.4 yards per game on the ground. Cook paced the NFL with 1,621 rushing yards while averaging 5.2 yards per carry, the league's second-best mark. He scored 14 total touchdowns (12 rushing, two receiving) and earned first-team All-NFL honors from the Pro Football Writers of America.The Bills would have been forced to use the franchise tag if Cook had played out his rookie deal with this type of season. The 2026 non-exclusive franchise tag for running backs projects to 4.723% of the 2026 salary cap, down slightly from 4.886% in 2025. If the 2026 cap is set at $300 million, the running back tag should come in at $14.171 million.Cook's asking price surely would have climbed beyond $15 million per year, and he would have been positioned to benefit from a changing running back market. 2023 first-round picks Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs are now eligible for extensions.It's conceivable Robinson could become the NFL's highest-paid running back ahead of Saquon Barkley, who signed a two-year, $41.2 million extension last March that averages $20.6 million per year, before the 2026 season begins. Robinson led the NFL with 2,298 yards from scrimmage (combined rushing and receiving yards) for the Atlanta Falcons.Gibbs could also benefit from the Detroit Lions' aggressive approach to extending core players on rookie contracts. He will likely aim to join Barkley in the $20 million-per-year running back club.Runner-up: Nik Bonitto, EDGE, BroncosWorst Contract Extension (for a team)\nDaron Bland became the first beneficiary of Parsons being traded to the Packers. He signed a four-year, $90 million extension three days after the deal, with $50 million in guarantees, including $36.346 million fully guaranteed at signing. Salary escalators can push the contract's value to $92 million. At $22.5 million per year, Bland is the NFL's sixth-highest-paid cornerback.Jones appears to have jumped the gun with Bland after dragging his feet on other extensions in the past, including quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and Parsons. Bland was limited to seven games in 2024 because of a left foot fracture that required surgery, and his play was uneven after returning from the injury.Bland earned the extension largely on the strength of his 2023 breakout season, when he secured first-team All-Pro honors after leading the league with nine interceptions. His five pick-sixes set an NFL single-season record.Bland didn't regain his All-Pro form this season. Opposing quarterbacks completed 67.1% of their passes (51 of 76) for a 108.9 passer rating when targeting him, according to PFF. Bland also surrendered five touchdowns in coverage in the 12 games he played. The Cowboys finished with the NFL's worst pass defense, allowing 251.5 yards per game.Bland underwent left foot surgery a couple of weeks ago after finishing the season on injured reserve. He is fortunate he isn't headed into free agency in March after two injury-plagued seasons that make his 2023 All-Pro campaign look more like an outlier. Bland could find himself on the chopping block if he doesn't bounce back in 2026 under new defensive coordinator Christian Parker.\n            ",

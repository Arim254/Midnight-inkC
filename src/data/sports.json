    "body": "\n        While every manager has their Week 13 Fantasy football picks that are must-starts, there are also Fantasy streamers you have to consider. Jacoby Brissett is coming off a 300-yard game and has been one of the most productive quarterbacks over the last six weeks. Meanwhile, the likes of Tyrone Tracy Jr., Kenneth Gainwell, Khalil Shakir, Michael Wilson and Hunter Henry all had 100-plus scrimmage yards last week. Your Week 13 Fantasy football strategy has to decipher if these were one-off performances or if any of the aforementioned are deserving to be in your Week 13 Fantasy football lineups.In the case of Brissett, the journeyman has clearly been more than a one-week wonder as he has at least 337 total yards or multiple touchdowns in six straight. On Sunday, he and Arizona will face Tampa, which allowed Josh Allen and Matthew Stafford to absolutely shred it over the last two games. Where do the Week 13 Fantasy football projections rank Brissett in comparison to QBs potentially returning from injury like Aaron Rodgers, C.J. Stroud and Jaxson Dart? Before making your Week 13 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 13 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 13 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 13 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 13 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 13: The model is fading Steelers WR D.K. Metcalf, a three-time 1,000-yard receiver who is the WR17 entering Week 13, may not warrant a spot in Week 13 Fantasy football lineups even though he's being started in 70% of leagues. The wideout scored a rushing touchdown last week, as Pittsburgh had to manufacture touches for him as the passing game, alone, isn't helping much in that regard. Metcalf has had 55 or fewer receiving yards in each of the last six weeks, with just one receiving score. Now he has to face Buffalo's No. 1 passing defense on Sunday, as the Bills are giving up just 169.4 passing yards over their last five games. Metcalf isn't among the top 24 wideouts in the Week 13 Fantasy football rankings, putting him outside of the WR2 radar in most-sized leagues.Another curveball: The model is high on Texans running back Woody Marks, who is the RB29 in standard leagues and the RB30 in PPR scoring. He's being started in just over 60% of leagues, so many still have him on the bench. The rookie has supplanted veteran Nick Chubb as Houston's top back, with six straight games with double-digit carries. Marks is averaging 62.8 scrimmage yards with two scores over his last half-dozen contests, despite facing stacked boxes in the last three of those with Davis Mills under center. The Texans will face the Colts on Sunday, who just allowed Kareem Hunt to have 130 scrimmage yards last week and have given up five touchdowns to running backs over the last three games. Marks is a top-20 Fantasy RB in Week 13, per the model, slotting ahead of Breece Hall and Kenneth Walker III.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing.

    "body": "\n        Teams coming off byes but going in opposite directions will meet in the 'Sunday Night Football' NFL Week 13 matchup as the Denver Broncos visit the Washington Commanders. Denver (9-2) has won eight in a row and defeated Kansas City, 22-19, in its last game. Meanwhile, Washington has lost six in a row, most recently falling to Miami, 16-13, in the first-ever NFL Madrid Game on Nov. 16. Jayden Daniels (elbow), who has been out since Week 9, has been ruled out. Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Northwest Stadium in Landover, Md. The teams have alternated wins and losses over their last eight matchups, with Washington prevailing in the last meeting in 2023. The latest Commanders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 5.5-point road favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 43.5 via SportsLine consensus. Before making any Broncos vs. Commanders picks, check out the NFL predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 13 on a 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, the model has set its sights on Commanders vs. Broncos.

That contrasts with Washington which has not only lost six in a row straight up, but the Commanders have also lost versus the spread in all six of those. The Broncos possess an elite defense, leading the NFL in sacks, having allowed the fewest passing touchdowns, and holding opponents to a league-low in yards per rush. The defense gets another boost with cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) cleared to play. At the other end of the spectrum is Washington's defense, which has bottom-five rankings in points allowed, yards allowed and turnovers forced. Washington has allowed an average of 34 points over its last five games, while the Broncos haven't given up 34 points in any game this season. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Commanders can coverWashington HC Dan Quinn took over defensive play-calling duties prior to the team's last game, and the results were instant as the Commanders gave up just 16 points and a season-low of 142 passing yards. That's a promising sign heading into SNF, especially facing a Broncos offense that does not travel. The Broncos are averaging just 18 points over their last four road games, and they've failed to rush for more than 100 yards in three straight games overall. While Daniels' return is in doubt, receiver Terry McLaurin (quad) has been cleared to return after being out since Week 8. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Broncos vs. Commanders picksSportsLine's model has simulated Commanders vs. Broncos 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 45 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Ten more games are set for the Week 13 NFL DFS 'main slate' on Sunday, consisting of all the games that kick in the afternoon windows. The highest total on the board is Bills vs. Steelers at 45.5, making players like Josh Allen, James Cook and DK Metcalf potential targets for NFL lineups. With injuries impacting many rosters and the weather turning colder, however, offense could be tougher to find as the regular season winds down.Which players should you target for your NFL DFS picks, and who are the daily Fantasy football sleepers that can differentiate your roster in tournaments on daily Fantasy sites like FanDuel or DraftKings? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Week 13 Sunday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Sunday NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks.

Walker was limited in practice earlier in the week, but got back to full participation and does not carry an injury designation. He's provided a high floor for DFS players this season, taking at least 10 carries in every game. He's cleared 65 rushing yards in all but four games this season as well. As a bonus, he's been more active in the passing game the past two weeks, combining for six catches and 74 yards in that span. He has a great matchup against the Vikings, a team with a poor run defense. Seattle's status as an 11.5-point favorite could play in his favor as well in terms of game flow. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Chargers tight end Oronde Gadsden II at $4,300 on DraftKings and $5,900 on FanDuel. The rookie out of Syracuse has been a breakout star this year with a 37-507-2 receiving line that few saw coming. Big plays are his speciality as he ranks third among tight ends in average yards per catch at 13.7. McClure has him rated as one of his top tight ends this week against the Raiders, but Gadsden is just the fifth-most expensive tight end on both FanDuel and DraftKings, making him a steal in Week 13.

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 NFL schedule has already seen four upsets over the course of Thanksgiving and Black Friday. There's plenty more to come over the weekend, however. The other standalone games to make Week 13 NFL picks on are both Super Bowl rematches. Broncos vs. Commanders saw Washington prevail in The Big Game back in 1988, and the Week 13 NFL odds have Denver as 5.5-point road favorites on Sunday night, with Jayden Daniels (elbow) ruled out. Then on Monday, Giants vs. Patriots (-7.5) is a matchup we've seen twice in the Super Bowl, with New York winning each time.Sunday afternoon's slate features a couple of matchups where time and travel could be factors with your Week 13 NFL picks. Cardinals vs. Buccaneers (-4.5) and Rams vs. Panthers (+10.5) both see the NFC West teams flying to the East Coast for 1 p.m. ET kickoffs. Historically, this is known to favor the home teams, thus making the Bucs and Panthers, perhaps, a bit more appealing than the NFL spreads suggest. All of the updated Week 13 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 13 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 13 on a 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 13 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:Top Week 13 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 13 NFL picks is that the Falcons (-2.5, 39.5) cover at the New York Jets in a Sunday 1 p.m. ET kickoff. Kirk Cousins had two passing touchdowns in Sunday's win over New Orleans, and having two passing scores, plus getting a win, is something that Michael Penix Jr. did once across his 12 NFL starts. Meanwhile, the Jets also had a QB change, but Tyrod Taylor dropped to 0-2 this season in a Week 12 loss to Baltimore. Taylor has nearly as many turnovers (three) across his pair of starts as Justin Fields had (four) across nine starts, so it's hard to call the change an upgrade. The Falcons are undefeated ATS over their last three outside of Atlanta, while the Jets are just 1-3 ATS over their last four at MetLife Stadium. The model has Atlanta prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 13 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-6, 41.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations. The Jags have won five of their last six versus the Titans, as Tennessee is now 1-16 over its last 17 games overall. Cam Ward hasn't thrown more than one touchdown in any game as a pro, and only J.J. McCarthy has a lower passer rating this season. Ward won't find much help in the ground game on Sunday as Jacksonville has the No. 1 run defense, while the Jags also control the trenches on offense as they rank eighth in rushing yards. The Jaguars are projected to have over 120 rushing yards, while the Titans have under 80 and average less than 3.8 yards per carry. The model has the Jags covering and says the Over hits in almost 60% of sims. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 13 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 13 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams projected to outright win in at least 70% of simulations, potentially giving you a huge payday by betting the money line. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 13 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now? Check out the latest NFL odds below, then visit SportsLine to see which teams win and cover the spread, all from a proven computer model that has returned well over $7,000, and find out.Week 13 NFL betting odds, lines, live spreads, scoresGet Week 13 NFL picks at SportsLineGameSpreadTotalPicksPackers at Lions (Thursday)F: Packers 31, Lions 24Chiefs at Cowboys (Thursday)F: Cowboys 31, Chiefs 28Bengals at Ravens (Thursday)F: Bengals 32, Ravens 14Bears at Eagles (Friday)F: Bears 24, Eagles 15Rams at PanthersLAR -10.545SEE  PICKS HERE49ers at BrownsSF -4.536.5SEE  PICKS HERETexans at ColtsIND -3.544.5SEE  PICKS HERESaints at DolphinsMIA -5.541.5SEE  PICKS HEREFalcons at JetsATL -2.539.5SEE  PICKS HERECardinals at BuccaneersTB -4.544.5SEE  PICKS HEREJaguars at TitansJAX -641.5SEE  PICKS HEREVikings at SeahawksSEA -11.541SEE  PICKS HERERaiders at ChargersLAC -9.540.5SEE  PICKS HEREBills at SteelersBUF -345.5SEE  PICKS HEREBroncos at CommandersDEN -5.543.5SEE  PICKS HEREGiants at Patriots (Monday)NE -7.546.5SEE  PICKS HERE\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Big 12 Championship Game is set as No. 5 Texas Tech and No. 11 BYU will battle at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday morning. The Cougars and Red Raiders have lorded above the rest of the league all season and formally clinched the matchup after Arizona State lost to Arizona on Friday night. Last year, four different teams tied at 7-2 in conference play. This year, there was no such concern. The Red Raiders and Cougars stood above the rest of the Big 12 for most of the 2025 season and previously played a top 10 matchup in Lubbock in November. The game will be highly significant as both BYU and Texas Tech try to make a College Football Playoff case. The Red Raiders are locks for the field and could push for a bye, but BYU sits on the outside looking in heading into the battle. They could need the Big 12's auto-bid just to reach the postseason. Here's everything you need to know about the 2025 Big 12 Championship Game. \n    \n                                        \n    What to know about Texas TechThe Red Raiders have been one of the best stories of the college football season after making a significant transfer portal investment over the offseason. Despite replacing both coordinators over the offseason, the Red Raiders lead the Big 12 in every major statistical category, including total offense, total defense, scoring offense and scoring defense. \nAfter destroying UCF 48-9 last week, the Red Raiders captured their first 10-win season since 2008, the historic Michael Crabtree campaign. All 10 wins have come by double-digits, making for one of the most dominant runs in Big 12 history. The only loss came when starting quarterback Behren Morton was sidelined. With Morton banged up, Texas Tech has leaned heavily on running back Cameron Dickey to great success. The sophomore is No. 2 in the conference with 944 yards and leads the league with 13 touchdowns entering Week 14. However, the defense is the star of the show, rating top-five nationally in most analytic metrics. The Red Raiders are the only team with multiple finalists for the Nagurski Award, as linebacker Jacob Rodriguez and edge rusher David Bailey push for All-America honors. Texas Tech has not won an outright conference championship since 1955 or played for a Big 12 title since the league was formed in 1996. Generational curses could come to an end in Arlington. \n\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about BYUThe Cougars are one of the top teams in college football over the past two years, posting a 21-3 combined record heading into Week 14. The only multi-score loss came against the Red Raiders on Nov. 8 in a marquee matchup, a 29-7 decision in Lubbock. After losing incumbent starting quarterback Jake Retzlaff to transfer, the Cougars turned to true freshman Bear Bachmeier. Despite only joining for the fall, Bachmeier has been one of the most effective quarterbacks in the Big 12. The Murrieta, California, native has thrown for 2,304 yards, rushed for 525 yards and scored 24 total touchdowns entering the weekend. But for BYU, defense and running take the spotlight. The Cougars rank near the top in most defensive metrics as linebackers Jack Kelly and Isaiah Glasker lead the way. Safety Faletau Satuala has been a breakout star, while running back LJ Martin leads the Big 12 in rushing yards. \nThe Cougars become the first team from the Big 12's first expansion in 2023 to reach the Big 12 Championship Game and second overall behind Arizona State. BYU has not won a conference championship since leaving the Mountain West Conference for independence in 2011. Texas Tech vs. BYU predictionWhen these two teams played in Lubbock, Texas Tech's defense dominated the matchup. Linebacker Jacob Rodriguez had a key interception and forced fumble in the game as BYU's offense was held off the scoreboard until the fourth quarter. BYU offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick will open up the downfield playbook with his freshman quarterback to try and spread the defense, which will create opportunities. However, Texas Tech is playing at an unbelievably high level right now, and won't waste its crowning moment. Prediction: Texas Tech wins Big 12 championship\n            ",

Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs (3-1) got a 139-136 road win over the Denver Nuggets to take Group C. The conference's wild-card spot was claimed by Phoenix because of its +31 point differential.\nEntering Friday, six of the eight spots in the league's third annual in-season tournament were up for grabs. The Los Angeles Lakers (4-0) and Toronto Raptors (4-0) previously clinched a spot in the quarterfinals.The quarterfinals will be Tuesday, Dec. 9, and Wednesday, Dec. 10.

    "body": "\n        The most dominant play in the NFL from the 1-yard line may not be the one you are thinking of. While the Eagles' Tush Push garners the most attention as a nearly unstoppable play near the end zone, Matthew Stafford to Davante Adams is becoming an undefendable goal-line occurrence. Adams leads the NFL with 12 touchdown receptions, three more than anyone else in the NFL, with four of those touchdowns coming from 1-yard receptions with eight scores inside the 5-yard line. He has a touchdown in five straight games, and that's a trend the SportsLine Machine Learning Model projects to continue on Sunday, making Adams one of its top picks for Week 13 anytime TD scorer bets at online sports betting sites. The model also has a few other top picks for Week 13 anytime touchdown scorer bets, including Dolphins running back De'Von Achane and Browns running back Quinshon Judkins to cash for Week 13 anytime TD scorer bets.Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Week 13 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 13 NFL picks.

He was held out of the end zone, but the 24-year-old scored two touchdowns on 225 total yards the week before against Buffalo. The Dolphins are 5.5-point favorites at home against the Saints on Sunday, with the Saints allowing 24.9 ppg this season, which ranks 22nd in the league. New Orleans has allowed a touchdown to a running back in four of its last five games, and the model expects that trend to continue on Sunday. Fanatics Sportsbook offers Achane at -150 odds, while other betting apps have Achane in the -165 range. Click here to bet Achane as a Week 13 anytime touchdown scorer at Fanatics Sportsbook, which allows new users to bet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets in FanCash:Davante Adams, Rams (-135)It has taken no time for Adams to form an elite chemistry with Matthew Stafford, especially around the goal line. Eight of Adams' 12 touchdowns have come inside the 5-yard line, and the two have connected for touchdowns in five straight weeks, including multiple scores in three of those contests. Adams has at least one touchdown in eight of 11 games this season. The Rams are 10.5-point favorites against the Panthers, which could lead to plenty of scoring opportunities, and Caesars Sportsbook offers Adams at -135 odds, while other betting apps have him as high as -160 odds.Click here to bet on Adams as a Week 13 anytime touchdown scorer at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users receive 20 100% profit boost tokens with a $1 wager:Quinshon Judkins, Browns (+120)Judkins ran the wildcat to perfection inside the 10-yard line in the first quarter last week, taking two direct snaps into the end zone in the opening quarter for Cleveland. Shedeur Sanders was efficient enough to drive Cleveland into scoring opportunities, with Judkins most often finishing those off in a 24-10 win over the Raiders. Cleveland plays San Francisco on Sunday, which figures to be a tougher matchup, however, the Browns will be home on a day that could feature less-than-ideal weather conditions, leading to a heavier rushing workload. The 49ers have allowed the opposing team's running back to score in two of their last three games, and at plus-money odds, the model projects value in Judkins for Sunday anytime TD bets. Click here to bet on Judkins as a Week 13 anytime touchdown scorer at FanDuel, where new users receive $150 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Want more Week 13 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Week 13.

    "body": "\n        The latest via CBS Sports sources on several top head coaching openings:Lane WatchWe enter what *should* be the last day of the Lane Kiffin sweepstakes, though Ole Miss now having a chance to make the SEC Championship has added a new wrinkle following Texas' win over Texas A&M Friday night. If Auburn beats Alabama on Saturday night, Ole Miss will be in the SEC title game. As of Saturday morning, it was business as usual inside the Ole Miss football facility as the coaching staff prepared for a possible SEC Championship game against Georgia. Kiffin is weighing whether to leave for LSU or stay at Ole Miss and coach the Rebels in the College Football Playoff. Kiffin said Friday that he hadn't made a final decision and would have to do a lot of praying about it on Saturday. That may have come off as a dodge, but it's not. Both LSU and Ole Miss have been in contact with other coaches in recent days, which is further confirmation that even the schools involved don't have a definitive answer from Kiffin yet.\n        \n            \n                Everything Lane Kiffin said about his coaching future with Ole Miss after Egg Bowl win\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat Kiffin decides to do -- stay or go -- will have a significant impact on the rest of the coaching carousel. FloridaTulane's Jon Sumrall has become the clear top target for Florida, although he's also on the radar for both Ole Miss and LSU as a potential backup option depending on what happens with Kiffin. Sumrall plans to make a final decision regarding his future Sunday. \nSumrall is 41-11 in four seasons as a head coach at Tulane and Troy, including 9-2 with the Green Wave this season heading into a matchup tonight vs. Rice. Among the other coaches the Gators have vetted are Washington's Jedd Fisch, former Northwestern head coach Pat Fitzgerald, Vanderbilt's Clark Lea and Missouri's Eli Drinkwitz. Lea and Drinkwitz have both now agreed to contract extensions that will keep them with their current teams.AuburnSumrall had been a top person of interest for Auburn, but it's become clear in the last couple days that Sumrall is unlikely to end up being the Tigers' next head coach. With Sumrall now more likely to end up elsewhere, interim head coach D.J. Durkin has become even more of a contender to be Auburn's next head coach. He took over the program from Hugh Freeze and is 1-1, including a close 45-38 overtime loss to Vanderbilt, headed into a critical Iron Bowl game inside Jordan-Hare Stadium. An Auburn win would strengthen Durkin's case to keep the permanent job. Auburn AD John Cohen has already said publicly he'd like for Durkin, who was in his second season as Auburn's defensive coordinator, to be retained regardless, an interesting wrinkle for any possible head coach to consider. Durkin wants the Auburn head coach job but could be open to staying as DC under the right person. ArkansasReports on Wednesday that South Florida's Alex Golesh has already accepted the job were premature. That said, Golesh is the Razorbacks' clear top target and his plan is to make a final decision whether he's taking the Arkansas job Sunday after the Bulls' game today against Rice. South Florida is 8-3 on the season and is expected to become the first non-Power 4 school to commit to spending the full $20.5 million revenue share. \nAlabama defensive coordinator Kane Wommack is the other finalist for Arkansas and would seemingly become the focus for the Razorbacks if Golesh decides to pass on the job. Wommack, who played football at Arkansas, was previously a head coach at South Alabama before joining Kalen DeBoer's Crimson Tide staff. Wommack went 22-16 in three seasons at USA and was a person of interest for the Liberty opening three years ago before the Flames hired Jamey Chadwell.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThere are a lot of things that make college football so great, and rivalries are certainly at or near the top of the list. If you love seeing teams with bad blood going up against one another, Saturday is a good day for you as Rivalry Week is in full swing. Week 14, the final week of the college football regular season, sees archrivals square off in games with massive implications. In some cases, we've got trophies and bragging rights on the line. In others, there's the potential for making or missing the College Football Playoff depending on the game's result. And then there's The Game between Ohio State and Michigan. These two foes have no shortage of bad blood, with the Wolverines winning this matchup each of the last four years, with last year's win in Columbus setting off a massive postgame skirmish after a Michigan player planted a team flag at midfield. That will all surely be front of mind for both sides when the 11-0 Buckeyes visit the 9-2 Wolverines, the latter of whom could punch a CFP ticket with another win in this rivalry.The rivalry action hardly stops there, with 9-2 Vanderbilt facing 8-3 Tennessee, 8-3 Washington hosting 10-1 Oregon, and, of course, the annual Iron Bowl between 9-2 Alabama and 5-6 Auburn. All three of these games are among the more heated rivalries in the nation, and all three could drastically shake up the CFP field ahead of the final selection process. In addition to Rivalry Week in college football, Saturday has no shortage of other action across the NBA, NHL and college basketball. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on at the top sportsbooks on Saturday, Nov. 29. All times Eastern. CFB best bets today, where to watchNo. 1 Ohio State at No. 15 MichiganTime: 12 p.m. | Location: Ann Arbor | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Michigan ML +311 Expert: Michigan +10.5 (Matt Severance)\nThe Buckeyes are in good shape when it comes to making the CFP, but they surely will look to get the monkey off their back as it pertains to this rivalry. Michigan has beaten Ohio State four years in a row, taking back a rivalry that was pretty one-sided since the turn of the century. Even amid a down year last season, Michigan was able to upset the Buckeyes in Columbus. While the result was stunning enough, what occurred postgame was talked about just as much, if not more, as a Wolverines player planted a team flag at midfield on the OSU logo, setting off a skirmish that resulted in police presence and pepper spray. While that all didn't impact the Buckeyes' CFP run as they won it all, OSU needs to get over its Michigan problem. The Buckeyes have hardly had to sweat this year, but it's worth monitoring the statuses of star receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate, who both missed last week. Additionally, the Wolverines are 5-0 at home this year. The SportsLine Projection Model sees value backing the underdog Wolverines on the money line as they win in 33% of simulations, and SportsLine expert Matt Severance thinks Michigan will, at the very least, cover at +10.5.\nNo. 10 Alabama at AuburnTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Auburn, Ala. | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Alabama -5.5\nThe Crimson Tide rolled to eight wins in a row after falling to Florida State in Week 1, and it looked like Alabama was going to have no problem making the CFP after missing out last season. Well, the Tide surprisingly lost to Oklahoma a few weeks ago, giving them their second loss of the year. A loss to in-state rival Auburn would put the Tide at 9-3, and that may keep them out of the playoff for the second year in a row. Auburn has had a strange year, as the Tigers enter Week 14 at 5-6 and having fired head coach Hugh Freeze. This Auburn team is excellent at keeping things close and uncomfortable, as five of its six losses this year were by one score, and the other was by 10 to Georgia. The Tigers will obviously be playing for pride and for the ability to potentially knock their rival out of the CFP, but a win over Bama would also get Auburn to 6-6 and make the team bowl eligible. The SportsLine model, however, sees Alabama taking care of its rival, as the Tide win in the vast majority of simulations and also cover the 5.5-point spread 55% of the time. More CFB best bets:Thomas Casale's power ratingsBruce Marshall's Week 14 spread tips and trendsNBA best bets today, where to watchBoston Celtics at Minnesota TimberwolvesTime: 5 p.m. | Location: Minnesota | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Boston ML +233\nTwo playoff contenders face off to kick off the NBA slate on Saturday with the Celtics visiting the Timberwolves. Boston is 10-8 and has won two in a row and seven of its last 10 games, while Minnesota has dropped three in a row but has still won six of its last 10. These foes met three times last year, and the Celtics won all three contests. The Celtics this year are dealing with life without star forward Jayson Tatum, who is rehabbing from a torn Achilles. In his absence, Jaylen Brown has been the go-to guy, averaging 28.2 points per game. Anthony Edwards once again leads the way for the Timberwolves, averaging 28 points per game. Minnesota is favored at home, but the SportsLine model prefers backing the Celtics on the money line as they win in 43% of simulations, returning value at +233. Looking ahead: Bills at SteelersTime: 4:25 p.m., Sunday | Location: Kansas City | TV: CBS and Paramount+  | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Steelers ML +150 | Expert: Pittsburgh +4 (R.J. White)\nOne of the top games of the Sunday NFL slate is a battle of two playoff contenders as the Bills visit the Steelers in what very well could be a playoff preview of sorts. Both teams are looking to get back on track after some recent struggles, with Buffalo having dropped two of its last three, including last week to Houston, while Pittsburgh has also dropped two of three. While the Bills are trying to get catch up with the Patriots, who have won nine in a row entering the weekend, the Steelers enter Week 13 with a slim lead in the AFC North race at 6-5 thanks to the Bengals beating the Ravens on Thursday. What makes this matchup extra interesting is the Steelers should have Aaron Rodgers back this week after he missed last week's loss to Chicago due to a left wrist injury. The Bills are favored here even with the game in Pittsburgh, but the SportsLine model sees more value backing Pittsburgh as plus money underdogs on the money line. SportsLine's R.J. White is also backing the Steelers, but against the spread, noting a potential mismatch in Pittsburgh's favor against a weakened Buffalo offensive line. \"The Bills struggled offensively last Thursday when facing an elite defensive front, and while the Steelers aren't on that same level anymore, they certainly still have defenders who can get after the passer,\" White said. \"The Bills have major injury concerns on the O-line with both tackles missing practice to begin the week, including Dion Dawkins being in concussion protocol, and they might be held under 20 points for the third time in four weeks.\"\n            ",

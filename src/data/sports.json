    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Unified heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk (24-0-0, 15 KOs) has dispatched most of the top heavyweights in boxing. His next challenge will come from the world of kickboxing on May 23 when he puts his WBC heavyweight title on the line against Rico Verhoeven (1-0-0, 1 KO). The fight will take place in front of the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt and will be broadcast by DAZN. Usyk's last six fights have been victories over the heavyweight division's three top challengers and former champions, as he's defeated Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Daniel Dubois twice each. While Fury has resumed his career after a brief retirement and seems headed for a matchup with Joshua later this year, Usyk will look outside the traditional boxing rankings for his next fight. Verhoeven is a kickboxing legend, with a 66-10 career record in kickboxing, he has the longest heavyweight title reign in GLORY history, defending his title 13 times and has been the top-ranked kickboxing heavyweight in the world for more than a decade. His last loss came back in 2015, and he's looking to find a new challenge in the boxing ring. As a boxer, Verhoeven is extremely unproven. He has one professional boxing fight under his belt, a knockout victory over a winless Janos Finfera all the way back in 2014. For all his talents as a fighter, making the move from kickboxing to boxing is already difficult, much less doing so against the No. 2 pound-for-pound boxer in the world in Usyk. \nFor Usyk, this is the biggest fight he can make as he waits to see if Fabio Wardley can beat Dubois on May 9, which would move him up the heavyweight rankings into the top contender spot. Until then, Usyk needed a fight having not stepped in the ring since July 2025, and rather than go for a lower-ranked heavyweight, he opted for the intrigue of bringing Verhoeven into the boxing world. \n            \n",

He previously spent multiple seasons as an assistant at Michigan. The sexual assault allegations stem from his time with the Wolverines, and the Ann Arbor Police Department confirmed to ESPN that it is investigating the claims against Lewis. After a college career at Tennessee, Lewis went undrafted in 2017 before having brief stints with the then-Oakland Raiders, Houston Texans and Tennessee Titans. His playing career ended following one season with the XFL's Houston Roughnecks in 2020. \nLewis broke into coaching at Akron in 2020 as a graduate assistant. He then spent one season at South Alabama and another at Wake Forest before joining then-Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh's staff at Michigan ahead of the 2023 season.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Professional wrestling is obsessed with singular achievements, especially during WrestleMania season. Superstars chase their \"WrestleMania moment\" and strive to \"finish the story.\" Finn Balor doesn't see it that way. For him, every accomplishment is a thread in a much grander body of work.  This year marks 25 years since Balor's wrestling debut. He may not look it, but he's long in the tooth. The milestone hit harder when his longtime friend and colleague AJ Styles retired ahead of his WWE Hall of Fame induction.\"Seeing AJ retire got me thinking about a lot of things,\" Balor told CBS Sports before Saturday's WWE Elimination Chamber. \"I've always  looked up to AJ. I've always chased his coattails, so to speak. He's  always been the benchmark for what we all strive to be. Seeing him  retire brought it home to me that my days are numbered. AJ has been an  ever-present for me for the last 25 years.\"  Balor will challenge world heavyweight champion CM Punk at Elimination Chamber. The title isn't the only thing at stake. The winner will defend it against Roman Reigns in the main event of WrestleMania 42. Balor is one pinfall away from righting a wrong and securing what many consider the biggest match of his career.  \n\"I have this massive stain on my career from 10 years ago when I got hurt and had to relinquish the universal championship,\" Balor said. \"I've been asked about that in every interview for 10 years. This whole 'what if.'\"Balor couldn't have scripted a better main roster start. In 2016, he defeated Roman Reigns, Kevin Owens and two others in the same night to earn a universal championship match. He became the first person to win a WWE world title in his debut pay-per-view match by dethroning Seth Rollins at SummerSlam. He also suffered a torn labrum that night. His first and only WWE world title reign lasted 22 hours.For 10 years, Balor has revisited that moment in nearly every interview. People remain fixated on what could have been. Since vacating the universal championship, he's won multiple intercontinental and tag team titles, reclaimed the NXT championship and captured the United States title. None of it has erased the stain of that lone world title run.  \n\"It's not like I haven't been trying, but for some reason, people can't  get these 'what ifs' out of their heads,\" Balor said. \"The only way  to fix that is by becoming world champion again.\"  \nBalor might not live in the main event, but he's a constant presence on television. That consistency isn't complacency. It's the product of a drive that's endured for 25 years, regardless of where he's slotted on the card. Headlining Elimination Chamber, and potentially WrestleMania, matters. It just isn't new fuel.\"You can't define your legacy over one match in Belfast, or one moment in Barclays Center, where I got hurt. It's  based on a 25-year career,\" Balor explained. \"It's a body of work that I'm trying to  present. If you look at my body of work, I think it's pretty  accomplished. Sure, I haven't won the world title in 10 years. How many  people have won the Best of the Super Juniors? How many have dominated  in Japan, been successful in Mexico, Europe, and WWE for 10 years?\n\"I try not to worry too much about  feelings in the moment. I try to zoom out and look at the 25 years. Am I  happy with the 25 years? Yes. Has being in the main event reignited a  spark that may have extinguished? No, because the spark never  extinguished. I've always had this burning desire to perform. If that's  in the first match or the last match, once I'm performing, that's what's  important.\"Elimination Chamber isn't about retribution. It's another entry into a rich codex.\"Am I happy with my career?\" Balor asked. \"I would have been happy having one match. My goal when I started training was to have one match. Everything after that was a bonus. Coming to WWE was the most far-fetched idea for a small kid from Ireland. There were no wrestling schools. There was no industry. Nothing.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As we enter the month of March, there will be several unlikely players that will morph into valuable fantasy options with teams resting players and dealing with injuries. Finding the right ones to add could help you bring home a championship. Here are five under-the-radar players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Gui Santos, Golden State Warriors (48% rostered)Stephen Curry has missed the entire month of February as he continues to battle his knee injury. The Warriors acquired Kristaps Porzingis (illness) at the trade deadline, but he has appeared in just one game for them. He has played just 18 games total this season, and even when he has taken the floor, he usually sees limited minutes.With the Warriors so shorthanded, Santos has averaged 29 minutes over their last 12 games. During that stretch, he put up 15 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.8 3-pointers a night. For the season, he is shooting 53.1% from the field and 39% from behind the arc. Even when Curry comes back, there should be enough minutes and shot attempts for Santos to remain a valuable fantasy option.Precious Achiuwa, Sacramento Kings (33% rostered)As the Kings continue their path to finishing with one of the worst records in the NBA, they don't have any reinforcements coming. Domantas Sabonis (knee), Zach LaVine (finger), and De'Andre Hunter (eye) are all out for the remainder of the season. Dylan Cardwell (ankle) will likely be out for at least three more weeks, and Keegan Murray left Wednesday's game against the Rockets with an ankle injury. For Murray, it's the same ankle that sidelined him for 20 games recently. It would not be a surprise to see the Kings take a cautious approach with him moving forward.\nA lack of healthy options has forced Achiuwa into more playing time. He has averaged 30 minutes over the last four games, which helped him produce averages of 17 points, 9.4 rebounds, 1.8 steals, and 0.8 blocks. Given the state of the Kings' roster right now, Achiuwa has the potential to be a nightly double-double threat down the stretch.Marvin Bagley III, Dallas Mavericks (28% rostered)Daniel Gafford has been hampered by injuries for much of the season. The Mavericks need him to play more with Dereck Lively II (foot) out and Anthony Davis having been traded, but he has only averaged 23 minutes over the last 12 games as he battles an ankle ailment. Thursday, he did not play against the Kings in what was the first game of a back-to-back set for Dallas.With Gafford seemingly unable to log heavy minutes, Bagley has settled into a significant role off the bench. He has averaged 24 minutes over seven games with the Mavericks, leaving him to average 13 points and 8.9 rebounds during that span. Don't count on him for many assists or defensive stats, but if your squad needs rebounds, Bagley is worth considering on the waiver wire.\nJavon Small, Memphis Grizzlies (16% rostered)The Grizzlies continue to try to improve their lottery odds by giving more minutes to their younger players. Ja Morant (elbow) and Zach Edey (ankle) might not play again this season. The Grizzlies have also been operating without Santi Aldama (knee) and Cedric Coward (knee) recently. That has helped Small average 26 minutes over his last seven games.Small has made a case to remain in a significant role down the stretch, averaging 14.9 points, 4.4 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 2.3 3-pointers over those seven games. He shot 59.3% from the field and 85.7% from the charity stripe. The Grizzlies don't give any of their players over 30 minutes a night on a regular basis, but Small could certainly play around 25 minutes a game moving forward. For those who play in deeper formats, Small has some upside.Guerschon Yabusele, Chicago Bulls (9% rostered)The Bulls are another team that is dealing with a lack of depth up front. They traded away Nikola Vucevic as they dove into a rebuild at the trade deadline. Zach Collins (toe) is out for the rest of the season, and Jalen Smith can't seem to shake a nagging calf injury. Smith has missed seven of the last 12 games and didn't log more than 25 minutes in any of the games that he did appear in. He is expected to miss a minimum of one week. Given that the Bulls continue to fall out of the playoff hunt, it would make sense for them to sit Smith until he is completely healthy.\nYabusele went from barely playing on the Knicks to being an important player for the Bulls. Since landing with his new team, he has averaged 10.1 points, 5.9 rebounds, two assists, and 2.1 3-pointers over nine games. The only real size behind him right now is journeyman Nick Richards. The Bulls don't have an up-and-coming young center to give minutes to, so Yabusele could split time at both the four and the five and play around 25 minutes a night for the foreseeable future. In 14-team and deeper leagues, that's enough to warrant adding him.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Charles Bediako's latest attempt to play for Alabama was denied on Friday. The former Crimson Tide center filed an appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court on Monday, two weeks after a Tuscaloosa County circuit court judge denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules. The appeal was denied on Friday.Bediako sought an interim injunctive relief that would have allowed him to play immediately. Judge Daniel Pruet, who ruled on Bediako's initial injunction request, denied that temporary relief on Tuesday. The next step for Bediako and his representation was to make the same request to the Alabama Supreme Court in search of a different outcome via an emergency motion. It did not come to fruition, likely signaling an end to Bediako's hopes of returning to the floor for the Crimson Tide this season.Bediako has remained a student at Alabama and helped with the scout team, per coach Nate Oats. While waiting for the result of his appeal, Bediako played for Team Canada in Puerto Rico on Thursday as part of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers. Meanwhile, No. 17 Alabama will face No. 22 Tennessee on the road on Saturday as it looks to extend its winning streak to eight games.\"We understand that Charles is pursuing an appeal in his case against the NCAA, and ultimately, he must do what he considers to be in his best interest,\" the University of Alabama said in a statement. \"The University continues to support Charles as he works toward completing his degree.\"\nIt's the latest twist in what's been quite the saga for Bediako, the NCAA and eligibility rules.Bediako played for Alabama in 2021-22 and 2022-23 before forgoing the rest of his eligibility and entering the NBA Draft pool. Though he did not get drafted, he signed a two-way contract with the San Antonio Spurs. He never appeared in an NBA game but did play for the Austin Spurs of the NBA G League. He also appeared in G League games for the Grand Rapids Gold and the Motor City Cruise on Exhibit 10 contracts.\n        \n            \n                Charles Bediako ineligible after judge's ruling: Why 7-footer's journey from G League back to Alabama is over\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn late January 2026, Bediako filed suit against the NCAA, requesting \"immediate preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\" Because Bediako enrolled in Alabama in 2021, he was -- and is still -- within his five-year eligibility clock. Tuscaloosa County judge James Roberts granted Beidako a temporary restraining order against the NCAA, paving the way for him to return to the Crimson Tide. After it was later discovered Roberts is an Alabama donor; he recused himself from the case.\nUnder the order, Bediako played in five games with Alabama from Jan. 24 to Feb. 7, averaging 10 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks while shooting 77%.On Feb. 9, Alabama circuit court judge Daniel Pruet denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules. The aim of the preliminary injunction had been to allow Bediako to play for the rest of the season.\"Common sense won a round today,\" NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"The court saw this for what it is: an attempt by professionals to pivot back to college and crowd out the next generation of students. College sports are for students, not for people who already walked away to go pro and now want to hit the 'undo' button at the expense of a teenager's dream.\n\"While we're glad the court upheld the rules our members actually want, one win doesn't fix the national mess of state laws. It's time for Congress to stop watching from the sidelines and help us provide some actual stability.\"Bediako's return to college basketball after signing multiple NBA contracts had caused significant consternation among NCAA higher-ups, with even SEC commissioner Greg Sankey signing an affidavit against Bediako's cause.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Business is booming for the NFL. And if you need any evidence of that, just look at how rapidly the salary cap has increased over the last decade. Ahead of the 2026 season, the salary cap will be $301.2 million, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reported Friday, as the league's financial explosion continues.The NFL had previously informed its clubs that the 2026 salary cap will land anywhere between $301.2 million and $305.7 million next season. That is an increase of more than $20 million from one season to the next, and that hasn't been unusual in recent years. The cap has increased nearly $100 million since 2022, when it was set at $208.2 million.Going back over a decade, the NFL salary cap has risen exponentially, with the only period of contraction coming during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the cap dipped from $198.2 million to $182.5 million, but the numbers have ballooned in each subsequent season.\nYou can thank the NFL's lucrative TV rights deals with its broadcast partners for these huge upticks; this trend doesn't seem like it'll stop anytime soon. This increase should only help teams who are up against a cap crunch, and it will provide more ammo to teams who already are loading up the money cannon in anticipation of free agency.\nPerhaps no one is happier about seeing the salary cap cross the $300 million mark than this year's crop of pending free agents, headlined by players like Trey Hendrickson, Daniel Jones and Jaelan Phillips, who are set to command massive paydays.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Every Friday leading up to conference tournaments I'll take an early look at some of Saturday's biggest college basketball games based on the opening lines. This Saturday features an SEC showdown between Arkansas and Florida, while Arizona hosts Kansas in a key Big 12 matchup.  I'll give an early lean for each game and where I think the line will move closer to tip-off. These are just leans, unless I mention I officially gave out a pick on SportsLine in the analysis.Kansas Jayhawks at Arizona Wildcats \nI bet against Arizona last Saturday on the road at Houston but came away extremely impressed with the Wildcats. I wasn't surprised that they won the game, but rather how they won it. Very few teams push Houston around, but Arizona did in an impressive defensive performance. I expect another defensive grinder this Saturday when Kansas goes to Tucson. Like Arizona, the Jayhawks got a big win over Houston thanks to a defense that held the Cougars to just 56 points on 38% shooting. This game could come down to rebounding. Arizona has a big edge on both the offensive and defensive boards, which is key against a Kansas defense that ranks first in two-point field goal percentage. The Wildcats don't shoot many threes, so second-chance points will be a big factor if the Jayhawks' can't keep Arizona's big front line off the offensive glass. I do believe Kansas can keep this game close, though. It's tough to bet against Arizona at home, although Bill Self's teams typically excel in the underdog role. I expect a lower-scoring game, and if the Jayhawks can limit Arizona's second-chance opportunities, they should stay within the big number. Leans: Kansas +8.5 and Under 147.5Bet the Under in Kansas vs. Arizona at Caesars Sportsbook:Arkansas Razorbacks at Florida Gators\nFlorida is rolling right now. The Gators are 13-1 in their last 14 games, winning 11 of those matchups by double-digits. Florida gets one of its toughest tests of the season on Saturday when Arkansas and its high-flying offense comes to town. The Hogs are playing at a blistering pace and have scored 80+ points in 12 of their 15 SEC games. Led by freshman sensation Darius Acuff (22.2 PPG), Arkansas has four players scoring in double-digits. While the Razorbacks have the SEC's top offense, they will be facing the conference's No. 1 defense. Florida's defense ranks first in the SEC in efficiency, rebounding, and two-point field goal percentage. The bottom line is, it's tough to score on the Gators and when teams miss shots, Florida doesn't allow many second-chance opportunities. Even though the Gators' defense has been impressive in league play, I still like this game to go Over. Todd Golden has shown he will run when teams want to play fast with Florida. The Gators averaged 92 points in five wins over Georgia, Vanderbilt, Alabama, and Texas A&M -- all teams that rank top 80 in tempo.  The total opened at 167.5 and quickly dropped a point but is back up to 167.5. I think it could get down to 164.5 because of Florida's dominant defense. If it goes that low, I might make the Over an official play. I also lean Arkansas at +10.5. I make the line closer to 7.5. Lean: Arkansas +10.5 and Over 167.5Bet the Razorbacks to cover the spread in Arkansas vs. Florida at DraftKings:Gonzaga Bulldogs at St. Mary's Gaels\nThese two teams typically play close games, so I like to take the underdog when the line is high. The first time they met, I played St. Mary's +8.5 and the Gaels just got in under the number, losing, 73-65. That game was closer than the final score suggests. St. Mary's actually led by four at halftime and hung on late for the cover. I expect another tight game this time around, although there isn't nearly as much value taking the Gaels at +1.5. The question is, can St. Mary's shoot better from the perimeter? They were just 6-of-21 (28.6%) in the first meeting. This matchup is pretty even on paper. The biggest edge one team has is St. Mary's at the foul line. The Gaels are the top free throw shooting team in the WCC at 80 percent, while Gonzaga ranks last at 67.8 percent. This was a factor in the first game when St. Mary's went 23-of-25 (92%) from the foul line. The Gaels are undefeated at home this season, and I like that trend to continue on Saturday. Gonzaga is the better overall team, although I love how St. Mary's is playing right now. The Gaels as a slight home dog will likely be an official play for me. Lean: St. Mary's +1.5Bet on the Gaels to cover at home against Gonzaga at DraftKings:\n            ",

I am thrilled for the opportunity that awaits, but the moment is nonetheless bittersweet. In my nine years, I have been afforded opportunities I never dreamed of having -- covering Final Fours, writing features, motivating Hall of Fame coaches to use my work as bulletin board material and having the Bill Murray sit in my seat at a national semifinal game -- and I have been blessed to work with and for an amazing group of people. I could say much more, but I'll spare you the Oklahoma farewell and just say: this Power Rankings being my last means I will therefore make it a bit different. This week's edition will not be a ranking of the teams that have played best of late, as I usually rank it, nor is it a ranking of resumes or any other form of list based on results. Instead, today is a Power Ranking of the 25 college basketball teams based on how I would rank them as most likely to win the national championship. \nLet's get to the rankings and go out with a bang.College Basketball Power Rankings1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    The five-point loss on to Duke on a neutral court last weekend doesn't dissuade me from the belief that Dusty May has the best team in college basketball. Wolverines are 26-2, on trajectory to win the loaded Big Ten and a lock to be a 1 seed.2\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    Houston's doubled its loss total the last two weeks with three consecutive losses to drop to 23-5. But I'm not pushing the panic button on the Cougs. They have NBA talent in the frontcourt and backcourt, play elite defense, have quality guards who can dictate tempo and have roster versatility to boot. This'll be a hard team to out in the tourney.3\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Few teams are more difficult to match with than Arizona -- one of only three teams to be rated top-10 in offensive and defensive adjusted efficiency at KenPom. The Wildcats have their best defensive unit since Tommy Lloyd's arrival and have managed to pair that with an elite offense. If fully healthy, they should be considered the 1B title favorite with Michigan.4\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Duke's No. 1 at KenPom and the frontrunner to be the No. 1 overall seed. But, by a slim margin, I have the Bule Devils fourth among title contenders solely because of reservations about this team's backcourt and its shooting potential surrounding Cameron Boozer. Boozer, though, has the ability to just drag this team all the way. He's that good.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    Dan Hurley has his Huskies playing with verve at just the right time after smacking St. John's by 32 points this week.

    "body": "\n        As winds picked up on Friday, PGA National started to show a bit more of its teeth, and the conditions that produced some incredibly low scores gave way to a greater challenge in the second round of the 2026 Cognizant Classic. Still sitting atop the leaderboard going into Saturday is Austin Smotherman, one of the few players who ended Thursday on the first page of the leaderboard.Smotherman backed up his strong play with a quality round Friday, extending his lead from one to three shots thanks to a solid 69 that put him 11 under par. Few players were able to mount a real charge on a difficult day. While it wasn't as dynamic a round as his 62 on Thursday, Smotherman acquitted himself well in the tougher conditions on Friday afternoon. Most of the best scores of the day were posted in the morning, and Smotherman's 69 was among the better rounds of the later wave. Unsurprisingly, his approach play was the first thing to falter in the wind, but the putter stayed warm with another day with more than 2 strokes gained on the field on the greens. This bomb for birdie on No. 17 did some of the heavy lifting. \nWith two excellent rounds in the books, Smotherman is in the driver's seat to pick up the first win of his PGA Tour career going into the weekend. He's been boom or bust to start the 2026 PGA Tour season, with just one made cut in his first four events, a T8 at The American Express. Now he looks poised to not only pick up a second top 10 of the season but also a potential career-changing victory. \nWhile Smotherman was extending his lead at the top of the leaderboard, some of the biggest names in the field came into Friday's second round needing serious improvement just to make the weekend. Brooks Koepka, Max Homa and Ryan Gerard all entered Friday over par and outside the projected cut, but each posted rounds in the mid-60s on Friday to punch their tickets to the final 36 holes. Gerard entered the week in unfamiliar territory as the pre-tournament favorite, and while he struggled to produce his best on Thursday, a 67 on Friday got him into red figures at 2 under and two more rounds of golf this weekend. Homa and Koepka, meanwhile, shot matching 66s as they continue to try to create the spark that can help them capture past form. For Homa, it was his iron play coming to life that led to his second-round surge, as he gained more than 3.3 strokes on the field approaching the green. Once a premier ball-striker on the PGA Tour, Homa has slipped significantly of late, but Friday brought a reminder of what he's capable of achieving when he gets in a good swing rhythm. \nKoepka, meanwhile, has been one of the worst putters on the PGA Tour this season in his return. He came into the week 171st in strokes gained putting and was 111th on Thursday on his way to a 74. His putting turned around in a major way on Friday, as he poured in 131 feet and 3 inches of putts in the second round -- the most of anyone in the field -- picking up nearly 4 strokes on the greens. After his round, he credited a setup change he made after his first round struggles that turned around his fortunes, despite, in his mind, hitting the ball worse on Friday.\"Just may hand position at setup,\" Koepka said. \"I was just cheating it. Changed the stroke a little bit. I'm not getting as handsy, and I was cheating it by getting my hands back, and it just was creating an inconsistent feel. Where I thought it was taking off, it wasn't.\"\nReplicating that exact kind of putting performance will be nearly impossible, but for a player who hasn't been able to get anything to drop all year, having a day where the putter gets red-hot could be huge for his confidence on the greens -- especially after putting a new putter in the bag this year.Leader1. Austin Smotherman (-12): The winds are supposed to settle down again on Saturday before picking back up on Sunday, and the field will be starting play early due to potential storms in the area. That means, if Smotherman is going to maintain a comfortable lead going into the final round, he'll need to keep the pedal down on Moving Day in solid conditions. We've seen that low scores are available at PGA National since they've made some recent changes to the setup, and Smotherman will need to stay on the front foot with an eye on another round in the 60s rather than simply trying to hold on for 36 holes. Contenders2. Taylor Moore (-8)T3. Nico Echavarria, A.J. Ewart (-7)5. Joel Dahmen (-6)T6. Shane Lowry, Aaron Rai and four others (-5)T12. Daniel Berger and five others (-4)T18. Max Homa and eight others (-3) \nEwart posted the round of the day on Friday to thrust himself into contention after starting the second set of 18 holes at even par. His 64 paced the field in scoring, and now, he finds himself in unfamiliar territory with a late tee time on the weekend for the first time in his young career. Echavarria started Friday one back of Smotherman, but he struggled in the more challenging conditions and moved backwards a spot on the leaderboard. Even with that minor setback, Echavarria is certainly a threat going into the weekend, particularly with the forecast for Saturday looking more like Thursday when he fired a 63. Lurking a bit further back are some notable names like Joel Dahmen, Shane Lowry, Aaron Rai and Daniel Berger. Dahmen has put together consecutive rock-solid 68s, but if he's going to contend, he'll need to take it a bit deeper and find some more birdies to get in the mix. Lowry has made the cut at the Cognizant for nine straight starts and loves PGA National, so don't count him out if he can get the putter warmed up and see some fall early on Saturday. Players won't have to look far to find a reason for optimism heading into the weekend trailing, as Joe Highsmith won last year after making the cut on the number. That required a pair of weekend 64s, and he was only eight shots off the lead, not 11, but everyone will know what's possible, and we ought to see some extremely aggressive play early on Saturday with the winds down. \nNotable players who missed the cutLuke Clanton (+1)Webb Simpson (+1)Michael Thorbjornsen (+1)Neal Shipley (+2)Gary Woodland (+2)Chris Kirk (+2)Stephan Jaeger (+2)A late move on Friday afternoon shifted the cut line from +1 to Even, which dropped a huge group of players from the weekend. Some of the rising young stars of the game were included in that group, as Luke Clanton, Michael Thorbjornsen and Neal Shipley (who bogeyed his last, trying to make a birdie to get to the weekend) all narrowly missed out.Updated 2026 Cognizant Classic odds, picksOdds via Caesars SportsbookAustin Smotherman (7/4)Taylor Moore (7-1)Nico Echavarria (19/2)Shane Lowry (12-1)A.J. Ewart (17-1)Joel Dahmen (18-1)Aaron Rai (20-1)We'll see how Smotherman handles the nerves of being the 36-hole leader in pursuit of his first career win. The nature of this course (with the current setup) is going to make it so someone from the chase pack reels him in. Echavarria, despite a rough Friday, has a good chance to post another low round on Saturday and get in position for a win, and Lowry's comfort on this course should keep him in the mix all the way through Sunday afternoon. \n            ",

Expect the Knicks to want to erase that performance, and with the Knicks having a top-10 scoring offense (117.2 points per game, ninth), that's likely to happen. Meanwhile, the Bucks' offense has been rolling lately even without Giannis Antetokounmpo (calf). Milwaukee has scored at least 118 points in three of its last four games. The Over has cashed in three of the last four Bucks games, and the model projects the Over to hit in 67.5% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:Illinois (+105) to defeat Michigan\"Illinois has had all week to stew over blowing a 23-point lead in an overtime loss at UCLA last Saturday. So while Michigan had a bit of a palate-cleanser from the Duke game with its win against Minnesota at home, I think the Illini are going to be breathing fire,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"Then there's the matchup, which has Illinois with a notable advantage in the backcourt (Keaton Wagler and Kylan Boswell over Elliot Cadaeu and Nimari Burnett) and comparable size to handle Michigan's 6-9, 6-9, 7-3 jumbo-sized front-court. Plus, there's a sneaky series edge here because while Michigan might eye Ohio State or Michigan State as its primary rivals, Illinois has won nine straight against the Wolverines, a streak that dates back to Jan. 2019.\" Back Illinois to win at DraftKings here:Thunder (-7.5) vs. Nuggets (-102)Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is back for the Thunder after missing nine games with an abdominal strain, and although they played well without him, going 5-4, his return takes them to a new level. SGA is the reigning NBA MVP on the reigning NBA champions, and Oklahoma City has the No. 1 score differential (+11.4 ppg) largely due to his court presence. Gilgeous-Alexander is second in the NBA in scoring at 31.8 ppg this year. The Thunder are home on Friday, where OKC is 24-6 overall this season. The Nuggets have lost six of their last 10 games, including a 121-111 loss to the Thunder in Denver where SGA scored 34 points.

    "body": "\n        The Road to WrestleMania has reached its final prelude. WWE has just one PPV left before the greatest show of them all in April and that's the Elimination Chamber. WWE returns to Chicago on Saturday night for the epic event where two superstars will punch their ticket to WrestleMania 42 by outlasting five others inside the sadistic structure. The men's match has some massive names looking to return to a headlining role at WrestleMania (Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton and Jey Uso) but it also has some men looking to make their mark and earn their first headlining spot (LA Knight, Je'Von Evans and Trick Williams).On the women's side, four former champions are set to compete in Tiffany Stratton, Rhea Ripley, Alexa Bliss and Asuka while two newer competitors look to make a splash in Kiana James and Raquel Rodriguez.\nThe other two matches are near and dear to the fans in Chicago. World heavyweight champion CM Punk puts his title on the line in front of his hometown fans when he takes on Finn Balor. And Punk's wife, AJ Lee, challenges Becky Lynch for the women's intercontinental title in her first singles match in more than a decade.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited on Saturday with the main card starting at 6 p.m. ET.2026 WWE Elimination Chamber matchesWorld Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: Balor returned to the main event scene after Judgment Day ally Liv Morgan accused him of complacency. Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.\nElimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. Trick Williams vs. Jey Uso: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. After Rhodes earned his spot with a win over Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn, Evans became the biggest surprise entrant in the match by defeating Gunther and Dominik Mysterio on Raw. Williams earned the penultimate spot by beating Carmelo Hayes and Damian Priest. Uso was the final man to qualify, partially as a result of a legitimate injury suffered by Bronson Reed during the qualifying match against Uso and El Grande Americano.Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.Elimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. Kiana James vs. Raquel Rodriguez: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Bliss defeated Giulia and Zelina Vega to grab a spot in the match, and was joined by Asuka, who defeated Bayley and Nattie. James snuck a pinfall over Charlotte Flair in their match with Nia Jax. Rodriguez has the chance to join Judgment Day Liv Morgan in challenging for a world championship at WrestleMania after defeating Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane in the final qualifier.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Diego Pavia is one of the most polarizing prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft. On one hand, the former Vanderbilt star has the production and track record that one would expect of an early-round pick. He never had a losing season as a starting quarterback at the collegiate level and was a 2025 Heisman Trophy finalist after throwing for an SEC-leading 29 touchdowns and rushing for 10 more scores. But Pavia does carry some significant question marks into the draft process. During multiple media availabilities at the NFL Scouting Combine on Friday, Pavia was pelted with questions about his maturity, an issue that often took the spotlight during his time with the Commodores. \"Yeah, [Vanderbilt] coach [Clark] Lea always preached that your frontal lobe isn't fully developed until you're 25,\" Pavia joked when fielding one question about his maturity. \"I just turned 24, so I got like 360 more days to go.\"\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL Draft Big Board: Ranking the top 200 prospects as the NFL combine unfolds\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPavia's humor didn't deflect the deluge. NFL front offices have likely had similar questions to what Pavia has faced in his public appearances. \nHe issued an apology in December after facing backlash after a social media post that stated \"F-all the [Heisman] voters.\" He was also spotted at a club partying with a \"F--- Indiana\" sign in reaction to Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who beat Pavia for the Heisman before leading the Hoosiers to a national title. Pavia defended his reputation in an interview with CBS Sports by arguing that outsiders often confuse his confidence for arrogance. \"I want them to know, and the future teammates that I do have, that, game on the line, I got you. Don't worry about it,\" Pavia said. \"That's how I carry myself. I think people get caught up in my confidence for arrogance. But my confidence comes from my preparation of work that I put in in the offseason, the week of, just things like that. That's what boosts me to have that extra edge on Saturday.\"\nPavia is one of the most experienced quarterbacks in the 2026 draft class, something he can leverage in his interviews with NFL teams. He played two years at New Mexico Military Institute, two at New Mexico State and two at Vanderbilt. In that time, he amassed a 47-22 record while throwing for 12,899 yards and 114 touchdowns with 4,210 yards and 46 touchdowns rushing. \"I've seen a lot of football,\" Pavia said. \"I feel like I can process a defense really fast, get the ball where it needs to go, check us into good plays, stay out of bad plays. I feel like that's how you stay on schedule, that second-and-6, third-and-short, that's how you win football games.\"   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        George Pickens had a career season in his first year in Dallas in 2025. Now, we could get a repeat performance in 2026 after the Cowboys placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Pickens on Friday.Under the non-exclusive franchise tag, Pickens can negotiate with other teams, but Dallas has the right to match any offer. And both sides will still have until mid-July to negotiate a potential multi-year deal, which is something the Cowboys have expressed interest in doing. If no long-term extension is finalized, Pickens will play out the 2026 campaign on a one-year, $28.8 million contract, which is fully guaranteed.We hope this contract situation doesn't get messy and cause Pickens to miss any time in training camp. If he remains with the Cowboys as expected then he has the chance to be a low-end No. 1 Fantasy receiver in all leagues, and he will be worth drafting as early as Round 3.Pickens came to Dallas prior to last season in a trade from Pittsburgh, and it was a fantastic deal for the Cowboys. He had career highs in catches (93), yards (1,429), touchdowns (nine) and targets (137), and he played all 17 games. He averaged a career-best 17.2 PPR points per game, which was No. 6 behind Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Ja'Marr Chase, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Rashee Rice.\nPickens had five games with more than 100 yards receiving, and he set a franchise record with five games of at least 130 yards receiving and a touchdown. According to ESPN, his 13 catches of at least 25 yards and 73 first-down receptions ranked in the top five in the NFL.Now, while Pickens was great all season, he was a dominant force when CeeDee Lamb missed three games and the majority of another from Weeks 3-6 with an ankle injury. Pickens scored at least 17.8 PPR points in three of those four games and averaged 24.2 PPR points over that span, with five touchdowns.Pickens staying in Dallas isn't great news for Lamb, who had a down year in 2025. He finished the season with 75 catches for 1,077 yards and three touchdowns on 117 targets in 14 games, and he averaged just 14.4 PPR points per game. It was his lowest reception and yardage total since his rookie season in 2020, and this was the worst touchdown total of his career.\nWe're counting on Lamb to bounce back in 2026, even with Pickens on the roster, and he should be drafted no later than Round 2 in the majority of leagues. But Lamb is no longer in the same tier as Nacua, Smith-Njigba, Chase and St. Brown, and you shouldn't reach for Lamb on Draft Day.Pickens' return is great news for Dak Prescott, who passed for 4,552 yards, 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions in 2025, along with 177 rushing yards and two touchdowns. He averaged 21.9 Fantasy points per game, which was No. 7 among quarterbacks behind Matthew Stafford, Josh Allen, Drake Maye, Brock Purdy, Patrick Mahomes and Trevor Lawrence.This was the third time in Prescott's career that he passed for at least 4,500 yards and fourth time with at least 30 touchdowns. With his elite duo of receivers back, Prescott is worth drafting as a No. 1 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues with a mid-round pick.\nThe Cowboys have been aggressive so far this offseason by using the franchise tag on Pickens and signing Javonte Williams to a contract extension. Dallas should once again be a standout offense, and we like that as Fantasy managers.We'll continue to monitor the situation for Pickens and if he'll get a long-term contract. As long as he doesn't hold out in training camp, Pickens has the chance to once again be an awesome Fantasy receiver in 2026.\n            ",

    "body": "\nFlash back to Jan. 10, 2019. Brad Underwood was in just his second season as coach of the Fighting Illini. John Beilein was in his final season as coach of the Wolverines, and Illinois and Michigan were led in scoring by — wait for it — Ignas Brazdeikis and Trent Frazier, respectively.The second-ranked Wolverines beat the Illini, 79-69, that night in Champaign, Ill. That is noteworthy because that is the last time Michigan has beaten Illinois in men's basketball.The Illinois Fighting Illini have won nine in a row against the Michigan Wolverines, and it is with that backdrop that No. 3 Michigan and No. 10 Illinois meet tonight at the State Farm Center in Champaign. If the Wolverines (26-2, 16-1 in Big Ten) can stop the nine-game losing streak, they would clinch the outright conference regular season title. They are coming off a 77-67 victory over Minnesota on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the Illini (22-6, 13-4) are looking to bounce back from a 95-94 overtime loss at UCLA on Saturday. The team sits in a three-way tie for second in the Big Ten, with Michigan State and Nebraska. Michigan is a slight 1.5-point favorite over Illinois on Friday.While Wolverines vs. Illini is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes five NBA games and a partial college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Feb. 27. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 3 Michigan at No. 10 IllinoisTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Champaign, Ill. | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Illinois +1.5 | Expert: Illinois -105 (Chip Patterson)\nAs Duke showed last weekend, the Wolverines are not unbeatable. The Blue Devils knocked off then No. 1-ranked Michigan by controlling the boards and preventing second shots, outrebounding the Wolverines 41-28. That bodes well for Illinois, which ranks sixth in the country in rebound margin (10.6 rebounds per game). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, says the Illini have a 75.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Illinois +1.5. Meanwhile Patterson notes that Illinois hasn't had a game since blowing a 23-point lead in an overtime loss at UCLA last Saturday. \"So while Michigan had a bit of a palate-cleanser from the Duke game with its win against Minnesota at home, I think the Illini are going to be breathing fire,\" he says.NBA best bets, where to watchCavaliers at PistonsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Detroit -5.5\nTwo Eastern Conference contenders collide when the Detroit Pistons and Cleveland Cavaliers battle at Little Caesars Arena. The Pistons (43-14) lead the East by 5.5 games over the Celtics, while the Cavaliers (37-23) sit in fourth. But Cleveland is actually the +280 betting favorite at DraftKings to win the conference, ahead of Boston (+310) and Detroit (+360). On Friday, however, the Cavaliers will be without All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell, who has a right groin strain. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Pistons have a 52.0% chance to cover and gives a C grade to Detroit -5.5.Nuggets at ThunderTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Oklahoma City | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Nuggets +8 | Expert: Nikola Jokic Under 52.5 Points + Assists + Rebounds -121 (Matt Severance)\nWhom do you have for NBA MVP? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander or Nikola Jokic? Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning MVP, is the -250 favorite at DraftKings, while three-time MVP Jokic is the +425 second choice. On Friday they will go head-to-head when Gilgeous-Alexander and the Oklahoma City Thunder host Jokic and the Denver Nuggets. The game will be the first since Feb. 3 for Gilgeous-Alexander, who has missed the last nine games with an abdominal strain. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Nuggets have a 51.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Denver +8. Meanwhile, Severance notes that Jokic had \"just\" 31 total points, rebounds and assists in his lone game against Oklahoma City this season. \"Jokic could go 30/10/10 and we still win fairly easily,\" he says.Looking aheadCollege basketball: No. 14 Kansas at No. 2 ArizonaTime: 4 p.m. Saturday | Location: Tucson, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Arizona -8.5\nThe first meeting this season between these two teams was one of college basketball's games of the year. In a raucous environment at Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks gave the No. 1 Wildcats their first loss of the season, 82-78. Kansas pulled the upset despite playing without presumptive No. 1 overall pick Darryn Peterson, whose mysterious absences from games this season have been well documented. He, however, has finished back-to-back games now for the Jayhawks (21-7, 11-4 in Big 12). Speaking of absences, Arizona stud freshman Koa Peat is getting closer to a return and could be back in the lineup on Saturday for the Wildcats (26-2, 13-2). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 55.0% chance Arizona covers and gives a C grade to Wildcats -8.5.No. 20 Arkansas at No. 7 FloridaTime: 8:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Arkansas +9.5 | Expert: Over 166.5 (Thomas Casale)\nTwo of the top teams in the SEC collide when the Florida Gators host the Arkansas Razorbacks at the O'Connell Center. The Gators (22-6, 13-2 in SEC) lead the conference by two games over the Razorbacks (21-7, 11-4) and Alabama, and they can clinch the outright regular season title with a win and a Crimson Tide loss at Tennessee on Saturday. But Arkansas has one of the most efficient offenses in the country. Led by freshman Darius Acuff, the Razorbacks average 128.6 points per 100 possessions according to KenPom, which ranks fourth in the nation. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 52.0% chance Arkansas covers and assigns a C grade to Razorbacks +9.5. Meanwhile, Casale likes that Arkansas plays at a fast tempo (28th in the country). \"The Gators averaged 92 points in wins over Georgia, Vanderbilt, Alabama and Texas A&M — all teams that rank top 80 in tempo,\" he says.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Off-the-wall questioning is fairly common during the evaluation process leading up to the NFL Draft. Sometimes, head coaches and front office members throw random questions at players during interviews simply to see how they react when things go off-kilter.In Fernando Mendoza's case, the most bizarre moment he's encountered so far during draft interviews wasn't a question at all. Instead, it was a request that he find himself in handcuffs. Literally.\"I don't know if I can say this,\" a smirking Mendoza said when CBS Sports' Aditi Kinkhabwala asked about the strangest questions he's received. \"It was, 'Hey, maybe you should get arrested.'\"Mendoza clarified that the team suggesting he get arrested did so in hopes it would impact his draft stock enough for him to slide out of being the No. 1 overall pick, which he is widely expected to be. He also quickly noted the club was not one of the teams he had a formal interview with.\"Hopefully, I don't get arrested,\" he chuckled.\nOf course, this was a tongue-in-cheek remark from a team wishing it were in position to select Mendoza. That's especially true with this year's draft class lacking high-end quarterback talent, while the free agent and trade markets also don't feature clear-cut cornerstone options.The Indiana signal-caller is the presumptive No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, which means he's currently projected to land in Las Vegas with the Raiders. During his press conference Friday, he gave a rave review of his formal interview with the organization.\"It was a fantastic interview,\" Mendoza said, via NFL.com. \"Coaching staff was in there. We went over some of my previous plays and did plays on the board. I thought it was a great meeting. I know they have the No. 1 pick, but anything can happen in the draft. Excited for the opportunity and whatever team drafts me, I am going to give everything I got to them.\"He also added that he'd be thrilled wherever he ends up, \"whether it's the No. 1 pick or whether it's, you know, the 199th pick.\" That was a not-so-subtle nod to his likely soon-to-be boss, Raiders minority owner Tom Brady, who was famously the 199th pick in the 2000 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots.\n\n        \n            \n                Fernando Mendoza explains what he wants to learn most from Tom Brady if he's drafted No. 1 by the Raiders\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMendoza is coming off a historic 2025 season for the Hoosiers, leading the program to a 16-0 record, a Heisman Trophy and a win over Miami in the CFP National Championship.

    "body": "\n        Back in April, the margins between Chelsea and Barcelona seemed unbridgeable, 4-1 defeats home and away cementing the sense that European football's finest club were streaking away from the field. Seven months later and the English champions know just how close they are. What were the margins Thursday? The inches that Ellie Carpenter somehow contrived to find when it seemed so much easier for the scorer of a brilliant opener to double her tally. The flick of the post that denied Wieke Kaptein off Alyssa Thompson's delicate touch. The subatomic particles by which Catarina Macario was offside when her header had unleashed delirium at Stamford Bridge.On many another day, this would have been a win to send a statement to the rest of Europe. Then again, if Chelsea continue to perform at this level, they need not worry too much about that. They will get the points needed for a top-four finish and a swift passage to the quarterfinals. What will matter is the statement sent to Barcelona. This doesn't look like a team who are semifinal fodder in waiting. If these two meet again, they should do so as evenly matched foes.Indeed, if anyone will have to adjust it might be Barcelona, who never really found an answer for what Chelsea wanted to do to them. The hosts had judged their game plan to a tee. When Barcelona had the ball at the back, blue shirts converged on central areas, waiting as long as they had to for Cata Coll to get possession moving. If she wanted to tiptoe 15 yards up the pitch, no matter. Chelsea would not be baited into flinching first in the standoff. If they could stay patient, let Barcelona make the first move, they had a good sense of what would happen next. Even a midfield with Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmati can't pass its way around every roadblock. Sometimes they'd be played through but more infrequently than you might have expected.\nWhen Chelsea did get the ball back, they knew the weak points to hit. Claudia Pina's justified proclivity to vacate her left wing berth and Esmee Brugts' commitment to driving up the field opened up a clear avenue for the breakaway. Carpenter charged into it and kept charging until she found herself just inside the penalty area, a ferocious swing of her right boot serving as evidence that sometimes you can't blame a goalkeeper for being beaten at their near post.A poacher's finish off a scrappy corner from Ewa Pajor had Barcelona level but it did not deliver the rhythm that the Catalans had established early on. Their pursuit of it was further disrupted by a lengthy break in play in the first half as broadcast facilities at Stamford Bridge went haywire. Ten minutes in 30-degree conditions is hardly conducive to anyone performing at the highest level and Bonmati and Putellas in particular seemed to ease off after both breaks.Their first dropped points of the European season will matter little for Barcelona and it would be easy to say that they meandered to the final whistle because they never needed more than the point they clung onto. To do so would be to give discredit to Chelsea though.\nAcross the field, their organization was exemplary. In a way not dissimilar to how she throttled the Spanish at the Euros, Lucy Bronze would track whichever of Putellas, Pina or Pajor happened to be serving as the left winger in that particular passage of play. Carpenter, the dynamo on Chelsea breakaways, dropped back to ensure that wherever her teammate went, a right back was still on hand.Should Barcelona get through, then they found Naomi Girma to be at the top of her game. Nights like these call for so much from top players but often what is required can boil down to the simplest things. For Girma, this was a day for proper old school center backing. See ball, clear ball. There'll be plenty of other opportunities to demonstrate her abilities to progress possession.On this night, it was more important that Chelsea demonstrate their worth as a rival to Barcelona for the biggest prizes. Their collective responses at the final whistle said just how much there would have been to gain from a win. Sonia Bompastor shook her head, Nathalie Bjorn threw her arms up in frustration. There but for the grace of a few pixels went a win.\nAnd yet in the huddle that soon followed, you sensed a different view was emerging. The heavy favorites to win the Champions League had come to town, perhaps not as the best version of themselves, and Chelsea had been better than them. That may matter a great deal when this competition reaches its decisive games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said the league \"will fight\" to keep Trinity Rodman as a bidding war of sorts emerges for the U.S. women's national team star, who will be out of contract after Saturday's NWSL Championship (8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+). Rodman's deal with the Washington Spirit, who will face Gotham FC on Saturday, expires upon the conclusion of the 2025 season with her future currently unclear. The Spirit remain in the mix to re-sign her but three clubs out of England's Women's Super League are interested, as are the USL Super League side D.C. Power, according to The Athletic.Most of the contenders for Rodman's signature, including the Power, are reportedly currently able to offer higher wages than the Spirit are because of the restraints of the NWSL's salary cap. The cap will sit at $3.3 million in 2026 and will rise incrementally each year until it reaches $5.1 million in 2030 but Rodman's contract status has raised concerns about the current structure, which Berman tried to dispel in a press conference on Thursday.\"Specifically, as it relates to Trinity and candidly, any other top player in the world, we want those top players here in the NWSL and particularly, we want Trinity in the NWSL and we will fight for her and we are excited to see her compete in the championship on Saturday,\" Berman said.Berman said she believes the NWSL's selling points are greater than just compensation.\n\"We really believe that there is a holistic picture that players evaluate and the reason we believe this is because we hear it from players in our league and around the world,\" she continued. \"I go and sit with the players on every single team in the NWSL every season and they tell me that yes, compensation matters but they also think about compensation not just from the perspective of what their club is paying them … We also know that our market here in the U.S. has more interest in supporting female athletes and women sports than any other market in the world and then there's all the other components outside of compensation, which I referenced earlier, the other three Css, which is the competition, the club and the coaching and we believe on a holistic basis If you're a player who wants to be performing at your best and wants to be valued and supported and feel like you have the opportunity to train in a best-in-class environment with the best-in-class league, that the NWSL is the place for you.\"The salary cap will grow as dictated by the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the NWSL Players Association, the most recent version ratified in 2024. The CBA does include the ability to raise the cap outside of the scheduled yearly increases but Berman did not signal that changes to the current structure were imminent.\"We do not believe that NWSL is a charity,\" Berman said. \"We believe it's a business and in order to treat it like a business, it means that the amount that our teams are investing has to have a rational relationship to revenue and so when we go through that process of reviewing the overall ecosystem and the value proposition that we're offering to top talent and to our players and we're looking at the amount being invested in training facilities, in stadiums, in compensation for players, we have to look at it in the context of where our business is at and of course, as I said earlier, we've made incredible strides in a very short period of time to drive commercial growth, both at the league level and our clubs, but that is the lens that we consistently look at it through.\"\nShould Rodman leave the NWSL, she would join a growing list of USWNT players who recently moved to Europe like Alyssa Thompson and Naomi Girma, though she would easily be the most high-profile to do so. The prospect of Rodman leaving for the Power is a unique one, though – like the NWSL, the USL Super League has been sanctioned by U.S. Soccer as a Division I league, but the clubs' means and budgets are generally more modest than the NWSL's. In its short history, it has acted more as a developmental tool for NWSL clubs, who have sent players on loan to counterparts in the USL Super League, rather than as a destination for top-tier players.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Baylor and athletic director Mack Rhoades are parting ways after nine years, sources confirm to CBS Sports' Matt Norlander and Matt Zenitz. Rhoades recently stepped down as chair and member of the College Football Playoff Committee. Baylor opened an internal investigation into Rhoades earlier this week, according to a school spokesperson. The probe did not involve the football program or a previous altercation with tight end Michael Trigg. Instead, sources say the incident involves an alleged personal situation that is believed to violate Rhoades' contract and the university's code of ethics. Baylor has been in conversations with Rhoades about a formal separation for approximately a week, according to Norlander. He began a personal leave of absence on Nov. 12,  was set to last 28 days according to multiple reports stated. Instead, the two sides have rapidly moved on. Now, Baylor is freed up to search for a new athletic director for the first time since 2016. The timing of the separation is critical as the university tries to make a decision on football coach Dave Aranda. The sixth-year coach is in the midst of another disappointing season after moving to 5-5 following a devastating 55-27 loss to No. 12 Utah. The Bears are projected underdogs in their final two games. A losing season would represent a fourth in six years, giving Aranda one of the hottest seats in the sport. \nThe personal investigation was the second of the season for Rhoades. Earlier this year, Rhoades allegedly took exception to Trigg wearing a long-sleeved gold undershirt, which was a different color than the rest of the team, according to The Athletic.  The report states that Rhoades grabbed Trigg during the first quarter and, while using an expletive, questioned him about the shirt. Baylor coach Dave Aranda later had \"heated\" words with Rhoades. Rhoades also allegedly was confronted by Trigg's position coach, Jarrett Anderson. The matter was ultimately closed. Rhoades took over at Baylor after the Title IX scandal that occurred under former president Ken Starr and football coach Art Briles. Then-athletic director Ian McCaw also resigned as a result. Rhoades was responsible for hiring football coaches Matt Rhule and Aranda, both of which reached the Big 12 Championship Game and Sugar Bowls during their tenures. \nImportant timelineThe initial timeline put out by the school would have projected Rhoades to be on leave through mid-December. However, reaching a separation agreement creates significantly more flexibility for the school as a decision comes on coach Dave Aranda. Most importantly, opening the athletic director position allows Baylor to immediately begin a nationwide search for their next athletic director. The Bears' final game is on Nov. 29, so the university will have time to make a hire before a decision is formally made on the football coaching staff. If they athletic department decides to move on, they can have formal leadership in place heading into a search. Unpalatable situationBaylor was selected as a potential Big 12 title contender heading into the 2025 season, but instead the situation has flatlined. The Bears lost 55-27 against the Utes last week and are at risk of missing another bowl game. In a narrow 31-30 win against Kansas State, Baylor featured the smallest crowd at a home game since 2010. \nThe athletic department has invested heavily in Aranda's administration, which has led to a revamped 2026 recruiting class that ranks near the top 25. But after another lackluster season, it's harder to make the case that Aranda should come back for Year 7. The quick separation between Rhoades and the athletic department makes it more reasonable for the university to move on from their longtime coach. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        'Thursday Night Football' kicks off NFL Week 12 with a pair of AFC playoff hopefuls battling as the Buffalo Bills visit the Houston Texans. C.J. Stroud (concussion) is out, but creating a Texans vs. Bills SGP could still lean on several big names like Josh Allen, James Cook and Nico Collins. With both teams possessing top-3 passing defenses, though, many may lean on the running backs with NFL props and when looking to construct a winning NFL same-game parlay. Additionally, not only is Stroud out, but Buffalo will be without Dalton Kincaid and Keon Coleman, both of whom are inactive.The Bills are favored by 5.5 points, per the latest NFL odds, and the over/under is 43.5. Apart from Cook, Houston's tandem of Woody Marks and Nick Chubb could factor into NFL player props and TNF best bets. One also can't forget about what Allen can do on the ground as he had three rushing scores last week and has the shortest NFL odds as an anytime touchdown scorer at -125.

    "body": "\n        A trip to the College Football Playoff is off the table for No. 20 Tennessee, but the Volunteers have plenty to play for as they enter a two-game closing stretch against rivalry opponents that begins Saturday at Florida. The Volunteers will be seeking their first road win over the Gators since 2003 as they travel to take on a struggling UF team with no path to a bowl.While a postseason bid is not available to the Gators (3-7), facing the Volunteers marks the first of two straight home rivalry showdowns to end the season. Taking on Tennessee this week and Florida State next week gives UF a chance to close a frustrating campaign with purpose.Playing Tennessee offers a shot at revenge for Florida after it suffered a crushing overtime loss to the Volunteers last season. Tennessee's 23-17 win over the Gators in 2024 snapped a five-game losing streak in the series and set the Vols on a path to the College Football Playoff.There isn't a viable path back to the CFP for Tennessee at this point. But closing the regular season with a pair of victories would get the Vols to 9-3 and give them a chance to secure a 10th victory in a bowl game. If that 3-0 finish comes to fruition, it would mark the program's third season of double-digit victories in four years under fifth-year coach Josh Heupel.\nFlorida vs. Tennessee: Need to know  Turnover troubles: This is a matchup of two of the SEC's most mistake-prone quarterbacks. Florida's DJ Lagway has thrown 13 interceptions, which is second-most nationally. Tennessee's Joey Aguilar is tied for fourth with 10 interceptions, including four in his last two games. The Gators are tied for 88th nationally with a minus-2 turnover margin. While Tennessee is plus-3 for the season in turnover margin, it gave up game-changing defensive touchdowns in losses to both Alabama and Oklahoma.Series changing: These former SEC East rivals have met annually every year since 1990, but that's about to change. With the SEC's new scheduling format taking hold next season, the Volunteers and Gators will no longer be annual foes. Tennessee will play Alabama, Kentucky and Vanderbilt as permanent rivals over the next four years while Florida will play Georgia, South Carolina and Kentucky. The teams will renew their series in 2027 at Tennessee, but the Volunteers won't make another trip to Florida until 2029.Ongoing coaching search: While closing with rivalry opponents like Tennessee and Florida State gives Gators fans a reasons to stay engaged with the on-field product, the focus for most who follow Florida has been on the future for several weeks now. Even before head coach Billy Napier was fired amid a 3-4 start, the writing was on the wall to suggest a regime change was likely coming. Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin is at the top of Florida's wishlist in its pursuit of a new coach, but Tulane's Jon Sumrall is also in the mix. Both are also in the running for other jobs, though, which means the Gators search could get interesting in the days ahead.\n  Where to watch Florida vs. Tennessee live  Date: Saturday, November 22 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET  Location: Ben Hill Griffin Stadium -- Gainesville, Florida  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)Florida vs. Tennessee prediction, picks  \nFlorida's will to defend the run appears to be fading as the Gators plunge deeper into what's become a hopeless season. At 3-7, Florida has officially been disqualified from contention for a bowl game and now must deal with a Tennessee offense that still has explosive potential.

    "body": "\n        As the National Women's Soccer League prepares for its biggest game of the year, the NWSL Championship (8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+), it finds itself in the midst of another high-stakes moment -- whether its biggest star can be retained. Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman is navigating a pivotal moment in her young career. Her 2025 season has been a balancing act of persistent back injury, with an epic comeback, only for a new injury to hamper her playoff status. She's managed all the highs and lows while operating under the unknown of where she could play next, and now, whether or not this is her last game with the Spirit.\"No, I'm not there at all. And genuinely speaking, like I've made no decisions,\" Rodman told the media on if she's thought about this being her last Spirit game.\"Yeah, there could be conversations being had, but right now, like, I am so excited to be representing the Spirit. I'm not even thinking of when my last game will be. But, yeah, I just want to win it [the championship], and we'll see.\"\nShe's currently on the last year of her contract, a record-setting deal she signed out of her rookie year that was the first-ever million-dollar deal in NWSL at the time. There's been plenty of reporting around the increased interest she's receiving both overseas and even through other competing leagues within the United States.Along with interest from teams in England, DC Power of the USL Super League is interested and has a contract \"significantly larger\" than anything the NWSL can currently offer, according to The Athletic. The league is another division one women's league operating in the U.S., currently in its second year of operation, and operates without a salary cap. On Thursday, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said in response to offers from competitors that the league \"will fight\" to keep Rodman in the league, and the player was moved by the sentiment but was trying to retain her focus on the championship final. \n\"I'm honored to have her say that ... Really happy about that, but at the same time, like, I don't want to put that pressure on myself, of like, because she said that now I'm like, 'Oh shoot. Like, I'm trapped.' But at the same time, I'm focused on this weekend, and that's really all I can focus on, and then moving forward, that's when I really have those conversations and tough calls that I need to have,\" Rodman said. The salary cap has rapidly become a point of contention in a year where multiple players have opted to go play overseas. U.S. national team defender Naomi Girma kicked off the transfer flow of players in January, while winger Alyssa Thompson followed during the summer. Defender Emily Fox has played with Arsenal since 2024, and midfielder Catarina Macario turned pro out of Stanford and began her career in France and is now with Chelsea.The league is bullish on the salary cap as its main mechanism to keep its world-renowned parity. That, to keep a league competitive, means there's talent across clubs, and not just one or two teams. \n\"I'm not, like, a vet in the league, like, there's only so much I can say,\" Rodman shared about retaining talent across the league. \"It's grown so much year to year, so I'm grateful for that. And even a position that I'm in, and the pay that I'm getting already is more than a lot of players, so there's only so much I can speak to, and those are conversations my agents are having. So for me, my focus is on the field. There's only so much I can speak on. Obviously, players want to get paid as much money as they possibly can. So, if that can grow, that'd be amazing. But at the same time, the league is slowly but surely growing every single year.\"Whether or not the salary cap is an appropriate mechanism for the league, its clubs, and players to navigate retention and talent, for Rodman, it's a complex balance with the league she's been with since she was 18 years old.\"I mean, I think it's hard to say. In women's sports, there's always this fight for equal pay to get paid more for the work that we do. But again, like, I'm 23 years old, I'm not going to try to completely change the league and fix that, but at the same time, yeah, we're always going to push and strive for more,\" she said. \nIn the weeks leading up to the end of the season, Rodman has been trying to work her way back from an MCL sprain and be a presence for her team in her limited minutes. She featured off the bench for the Spirit in the semifinal and was a threat on goal even in a brief time on the field. As she looks ahead to the final, she's just trying to find ways to shut out the noise about her contract status and focus on herself and her teammates.\"I think prioritizing just a little bit of alone time, because I think it's important, if that's just listening to music, reading a book, or, I don't know, just hanging out, taking a nap, just having that time for yourself, I think is important,\" Rodman told CBS Sports about managing the chaos around her. \"Being on a team sport, you're always around them, as much as you love them. Sometimes it's like, 'Okay, I need to breathe. I need to just live in the moment and be present.' So that's important. And then also, managing time with family, boyfriend, whatever, and then also coming back. Being able to have Ben [Shelton] here this week has been amazing for me.\"\nRodman leaning on her pro tennis boyfriend isn't new; the two have split time supporting each other at their respective sporting events. Sharing the spotlight has been helpful, especially with decisions looming on the horizon. \"He's just telling me that I'm the driver in this situation, and in life, and that I control whatever I want, and yeah, God is great,\" she said.The Washington Spirit will face Gotham FC on Saturday for the 2025 NWSL Championship. Rodman last won the championship with the Spirit in 2021 during her rookie season. All eyes will be on her whether she starts or features off the bench, as it could be her final game in the NWSL if she decides to leave.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Despite being 8-2 and fresh off a Super Bowl win, there continues to be a lot of negativity surrounding the Philadelphia Eagles. At the forefront of this negativity has been wideout A.J. Brown, the Eagles' talented yet disgruntled receiver who hasn't been shy about voicing his frustration with his and the offense's underwhelming production through 10 games. Brown threw more gas on the fire on Thursday when asked about speculation that he isn't the same player that he once was. \"I guess Saquon ain't the same player either, then,\" Brown said. \"I don't care about that.\"\nObviously, Brown putting the spotlight on Barkley's struggles this season is not a good look. It's yet another example of the missteps Brown has taken this season, both on and off the field. But while mentioning another teammate may not have been the best approach, Brown has a point in that you'd be hard-pressed to find any Eagles offensive player who is performing at the level they did a year ago. If Barkley is getting a \"pass\" for his underwhelming numbers, why isn't Brown? The answer to that question might be rooted in the fact that -- unlike Barkley and quarterback Jalen Hurts -- Brown is airing his grievances in a multitude of ways that appear to be detrimental to the Eagles. \nOn the field, Brown has often appeared either frustrated, moody, dejected, disinterested, or a combination of all four. It's worth questioning if his negative body language has contributed to his and the Eagles' offensive struggles this season.\n Off the field, Brown has made headlines for the wrong reasons. His recent comments on a livestream reportedly led to him having a 10-minute conversation with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie. Brown may the figurehead of the current lack of brotherly love in Philadelphia, but he isn't alone. On Wednesday, for example, Hurts had to field questions stemming from a report that coaches and teammates have grown frustrated with him. \n\"I guess I get a lot of attention when things are going well and when things are not going so well,\" Hurts said. \"I never run away from holding myself accountable, and I think that's exactly what I've taken the approach of doing. I take great pride in what we do on offense. I take great pride in how we go out there and play as a team and what our flow is. I think we've got work to do, and that obviously starts with me. That's always my approach. That's always me looking internally first in everything that we do and then in due time rising above.\"While they may be the most dysfunctional Super Bowl caliber team since the 1995 Cowboys, the Eagles still have a lot of football ahead of them. And despite their dysfunction, Philadelphia is currently sitting at 8-2 and are running away with the NFC East title. When it comes to Brown, his frustration does appear to be coming from a good place. He wants to have a larger role in the offense in an effort to help the unit realize its full potential. His next change to do that will be this Sunday in Dallas against the arch rival Cowboys. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're heading into the stretch run of the NFL season now, and the stakes are getting higher. For everybody. Not just the teams, in terms of their playoff positioning or even the draft. But also for individual players and coaches, whether in terms of their performance on the field or their potential futures. With that in mind, we thought now was as good a time as any to take stock of the people in the league with the most at stake over the final third of the season. We separated the candidates into three separate groups: the coaches, the quarterbacks and the other players.Without further ado...The CoachesMike McDaniel, Kevin Stefanski, Pete Carroll and Chip Kelly, Raheem MorrisBrowns' coach Kevin Stefanski \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            McDaniel is reportedly safe for the rest of the season. Supposedly, Dolphins ownership wants to keep him around beyond this year as well. But not having alignment between the front office and the coaching staff is always dicey, and whoever is hired as the new general manager could decide to go in a different direction. How the Dolphins play down the stretch could have a significant effect on that decision, whenever it comes. The Browns remain a disaster. They're now 5-22 over the last two seasons. It wouldn't be surprising if they decided to make a change this offseason, even if it was expected that they'd be bad this year. Beyond that, it wouldn't be surprising if Stefanski decided he wanted a change this offseason and decided to chase one of the other open jobs, given how bleak the prospects are in Cleveland.\nThe Raiders are also a disaster, and it really looks like they don't have much of a clue what to do on either side of the ball. Particularly on offense, things are... brutal. They don't have a plan to get the ball to their best players; they can't block; the Geno Smith experiment has been a failure. The Raiders reportedly have confidence in the John Spytek-led front office, but it's not hard to see them pivoting away from the oldest coach in league history after a season that's gone the way this one has so far, assuming it continues this way for the rest of the year. Terry Fontenot was one of the general managers on the hottest seats in our hot seat rankings earlier this week, and one way for a GM to take the pressure off himself is to lay it off on the coaching staff. The Falcons have regressed pretty badly from one year to the next and it's not like Morris has an extensive track record of success as a head coach to fall back on here. If Atlanta plays its way into a top-five pick that is headed to the Rams, we could definitely see a change here. The QuarterbacksTua Tagovailoa, Daniel Jones, J.J. McCarthy, Kirk CousinsVikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Tagovailoa has been extremely up and down this season, and it's been mostly down. He's gone from leading the NFL in passing yards two years ago to leading the league in interceptions this year, and his yards per attempt average has plummeted since his career high all the way back in 2022. His contract is massive, but the Dolphins can't really save money by cutting him this offseason, though they can do so by trading him. \nThe Colts traded two first-round picks for Sauce Gardner and reportedly believe enough in Jones that they want to give him a new contract this coming offseason. But we've seen some signs over the last few weeks of Jones regressing into some bad habits in terms of sacks, fumbles and interceptions, and if that continues down the stretch of the season, it could change Indianapolis' plans. We saw something similar happen with Sam Darnold in Minnesota last year. Indy doesn't have a McCarthy type waiting in the wings, but that might not matter if Jones falters. If he stabilizes, though, he's likely going to get paid a handsome amount. McCarthy is already getting the \"well, we don't know about his future in Minnesota\" type of reporting, just five starts into his career. It's been pretty bleak out there for him, so it's not hard to see why that's been the case. The Vikings moved on from Darnold to hand him the job and that looks like the wrong decision so far, but McCarthy has a chance to show down the stretch why they were willing to do so. If he continues to struggle, though, the Vikings could be looking to move on pretty quickly. It'd be wild, but it's possible. Cousins is going to start down the stretch for the Falcons and this following slate of games is likely going to determine whether he sticks in the league or his career is over. The results when he's been counted on this year and last haven't been encouraging and he won't have top target Drake London for at least a week, so it's hard to see him making a run at a significant contract this offseason. (The Falcons are clearly going to cut him given the financial realities they'd face by keeping him around, and nobody is going to trade for him at his base salary.)\nThe OthersTrey Hendrickson, Kyle Pitts, Breece Hall, Mark Andrews, Jaelan PhillipsBengals' Trey Hendrickson \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            These players are all pending free agents, so they have a lot to play for down the stretch of the season. Hendrickson has yet to return to practice for the Bengals, who are 3-7 and set to play the Patriots this week, without Ja'Marr Chase. If Hendrickson doesn't return soon and the Bengals continue to stack losses, he may decide just to shut it down for the rest of the year to preserve his body ahead of his foray into the market. He's going to be 31 years old in a few weeks, but there should be plenty of time left for him as a premium edge rusher if he gets a three- or four-year deal -- it's just a matter of how much that deal is worth. Pitts has underwhelmed through the first five seasons of his career, regressing badly amid injuries and limited playing time after his spectacular rookie year, when he caught 68 passes for 1,026 yards. But he has an opportunity over the next few weeks, with Drake London likely out, to prove that he can be a top-level target if featured in the passing game.\nHall was reportedly available for a third-round pick at the trade deadline, but nobody paid that price. He's flashed extremely high-level rushing ability throughout his career, but he's also had periods where he looked extremely ordinary. If he can put together a nice stretch run with Tyrod Taylor under center, maybe he can earn himself a sizable free-agent contract this offseason from one of the running back-needy teams.Andrews is probably in his final season with the Ravens, given the team is more likely to re-sign, well, Isaiah Likely, given the players' ages and Andrews' declining production in recent seasons. But he's still auditioning for a new contract. He probably needs to perform better than his current 8.6 yards-per-catch average over the next few weeks to earn himself a multi-year deal worth a significant amount of money.Phillips is already excelling for the Eagles and has the potential to earn himself a ton of money by continuing to play at that level for the next several weeks and into the playoffs. He has occasionally been an electric edge rusher throughout his career and again looks like that right now, but injury issues have plagued him going all the way back to college and it might be viewed as a significant risk to give him a long-term, big-money deal. If he plays well enough, though, teams could be willing to overlook that history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first two years of the dynamic kickoff era in the NFL brought an uptick in returns, fulfilling the league's goal of increasing action on special teams. The shift in formats in 2024 brought fairly radical changes, and the NFL continues to assess and tweak its rules to find the sweet spot between excitement and safety. Many coaches embraced the refreshed kickoff model, but it is not without its points of contention, including the elimination of surprise onside kicks and introduction of the 35-yard touchback.President Donald Trump is among those to voice displeasure with the dynamic kickoff format. Earlier this season, he called it \"demeaning\" to the game of football and said he urged commissioner Roger Goodell to revert to more traditional rules.Kansas City Chiefs special teams coach Dave Toub was not having any of that criticism, though.\"He doesn't even know what he's looking at,\" Toub said in Thursday's media availability. \"He has no idea what's going on with the kickoff rule. Take that for what it's worth. I hope he hears it.\"\nTrump's primary point of contention pertains to the delay from the kick to the moment coverage players are allowed to move. Players on the kicking team line up on the opposing 40-yard line while players on the receiving team stand between their own 30-and 35-yard lines and are not allowed to move until the ball lands or hits a returner.\"I hate the kickoff in football,\" Trump said last week on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"I think it's so terrible. I think it's so demeaning. I think it hurts the game, it hurts the pageantry. I've told that to Roger Goodell. And I don't think it's any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other. It's the opposite of what the game -- the ball is in the air, nobody's moving. It's supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you're supposed to be moving. The pageantry of the game is so badly hurt.\"In an effort to further increase the frequency of returns, the NFL ahead of the 2025 season modified its touchback rule, bringing the ball out to the 35-yard line instead of the 30 (in the first year of the dynamic kickoff model) or the 25 (prior to dynamic kickoffs).Returns are up again in 2025The experimental year of the dynamic kickoff format delivered precisely what the NFL sought: an increase in return frequency. The return rate grew to 32.8%, up from the 21.8% mark from the final year of the old format (which was the lowest rate in NFL history). The average length of return also ballooned from 23 yards to 27.5 yards.But it was not the dramatic increase the league desired, so it made the change this year to touchbacks in an effort to further improve the odds of a return. So far, so good in that regard. \nLeague data obtained by The Athletic showed that through Week 7, players returned an astounding 79.3% of kickoffs, marking more than a 100% uptick from the first seven weeks of the 2024 season. Lengthy returns are also up significantly this season. There were 32 returns of at least 40 yards through Week 7 this year, more than double the 13 from that same time period a year ago.Players may not be in motion while the ball is in the air like Trump said he prefers. But once they get the green light, they produce more action than they did under previous kickoff formats.Injury rate fluctuates with format changesTrump contested that dynamic kickoffs are no safer than standard kickoffs, but NFL data from 2024 indicated otherwise. The league said that the concussion rate on kickoffs dropped by 43% in the first year of the dynamic model and that the overall injury rate was the same as on all plays from scrimmage.\nHowever, with the uptick in returns in 2025 also came more concussions. League data showed that, through Week 7, the rate of concussions per 100 kickoffs jumped from 0.09 last year to 1.18 this year. The NFL acknowledged that the uptick in overall injuries was expected.Player safety was among the reasons for the move to the dynamic kickoff format, and the restriction of full-speed movement projected to reduce serious injuries.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 17 Texas took a tumble down the College Football Playoff Rankings following last week's 35-10 loss at Georgia. The Longhorns fell seven spots in the poll, and now find themselves in serious danger of being left out of the College Football Playoff this season. This is the reality of any team with three losses.However, not all hope is lost. Texas still has a possible path back into the field, and the formula is pretty simple: win the final two games. While beating a 2-8 Arkansas team won't do much to boost their stock, the Longhorns will finish the regular season with a game against No. 3 Texas A&M. A win there could provide a boost large enough to snatch an at-large.But they have to win this game first, and don't let Arkansas' 2-8 record fool you. This team has made a habit of sticking around in games when it isn't expected to, and you know they would love to destroy Texas' season for good.Texas vs. Arkansas: Need to know  Texas has won 19 straight home games against unranked teams: The Longhorns have lost six games since the start of the 2024 season and five of those losses have come against Ohio State and Georgia. The third Georgia loss came last week in a 35-10 defeat in Athens. While the Longhorns lost to Florida earlier this year, it was in Gainesville, which kept Texas' home win streak alive against unranked opponents. The last home loss to a team outside the polls was a wild 57-56 loss to Kansas during the 2021 season. Of the 19 straight wins, 17 have come by at least 10 points.  The Texas defense is struggling: The Texas defense had been its strength all year, but it comes into this game having allowed at least 30 points in its last three games. The Arkansas offense has been one of the more explosive attacks in the SEC this season, and if the Hogs crack 30, it'll be the first time Texas has allowed 30 or more in four straight games since that same 2021 season.  \nArkansas has a positive point differential: What's the big deal about that? Well, Arkansas is 2-8 on the season, and one of those eight losses came by 43 points. Yet, some how, some way, the Hogs have still scored more points than they've allowed. How's that possible? Well, five of their eight losses have come by three points or fewer. That's tied for the most in one season by any FBS program this century.

And it's not just Georgia and Vanderbilt. Mississippi State was able to put 38 points on the board, and their offense isn't all that dissimilar to what Arkansas does. That, combined with the chance Texas may have its eyes looking slightly forward to the A&M game, make me think this one won't be a blowout. Pick: Arkansas +10.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        Saturday's showdown between No. 7 USC (8-2) and No. 13 Oregon (9-1) gives B1G Time on CBS a West Coast collision with major College Football Playoff stakes. With both teams fighting to stay in the hunt for a spot in the 12-team bracket, the stage delivers the essence of late-November football.Oregon has rattled off four straight wins since its October loss to Indiana, while Lincoln Riley and the Trojans are on a surge of their own, winning four consecutive Big Ten games for the first time. USC is coming off a gritty win over Iowa in the rare Los Angeles rain, but the program has just one victory at Autzen Stadium in its last five trips dating to 2007.Both teams are long known for high-powered offenses, but the shift into the Big Ten has added a tougher edge. What once felt like a track meet could now play more like a bruising battle, with two of the nation's most efficient rushing attacks driving the matchup. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming live on Paramount+.  USC vs. Oregon: Need to know  Playoff paths: Oregon would make the 12-team CFP bracket if it started today, but USC still has work to do at No. 13 in the committee's latest rankings. A win would give the Trojans a major résumé boost heading into their regular-season finale against crosstown rival UCLA. For the Ducks, a loss could be damaging — even with just two defeats — because they lack a win over any team currently in the CFP rankings.Efficient offenses: Oregon (39.0 points per game) and USC (38.2) both boast top-10 scoring attacks. First-year starting quarterback Dante Moore has shown poise in key moments, but the Ducks lean on a deep backfield that averages 6.31 yards per carry against FBS opponents, best in the nation. For the Trojans, walk-on running back King Miller provides a spark, but the star remains wideout Makai Lemon, one of only three FBS players to reach 1,000 receiving yards this season.\nMargins matter: Oregon (+23.0) and USC (+16.5) also rank in the top 10 nationally in scoring margin. But the Trojans have struggled away from home, posting just a +2.0 average margin in true road games (32nd in the FBS). While Lincoln Riley has picked up two Big Ten road wins this season — at Nebraska and Purdue — he is only 2-6 in road games outside California since USC joined the conference last year.  Where to watch USC vs. Oregon liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: Autzen Stadium -- Eugene, OregonTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium USC vs. Oregon prediction, picks  \nIt goes without saying that the team that comes out on top will get the most from its top offensive stars. For Oregon, that means big contributions from Noah Whittington and Kenyon Sadiq — especially if Dante Moore and Gary Bryant Jr. remain sidelined. Whittington averages an eye-popping 8.2 yards per carry, third-most among FBS players with at least 60 attempts, a major challenge for a USC defense that has struggled against the run at times. The Ducks' clearest path to victory is simple: sustain long drives and keep USC's passing attack off the field. Pick: Oregon -10.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        No. 8 Oklahoma can almost taste the College Football Playoff. The Sooners will be favored in each of their final two regular-season games, likely needing to go 2-0 to clinch a spot in the CFP bracket. The first of those contests comes at home Saturday against No. 22 Missouri, a team -- despite being down its starting quarterback and rolling with a true freshman -- that just put up 49 points against an SEC opponent in Mississippi State.The Week 13 matchup has letdown potential for the Sooners after they posted consecutive wins over ranked opponents. The Tigers are a tough out, having played both Alabama and Vanderbilt to one possession. But with John Mateer leading the offense and Brent Venables poised to cook up another vicious defensive game plan, Oklahoma has everything it needs to take care of business. If the Sooners can make life tough on quarterback Matt Zollers and keep star running back Ahmad Hardy in check, they should pick up their third consecutive win.Oklahoma and Missouri played almost annually for a century, but this is just the second meeting between the former Big 12 rivals since 2011. The Tigers took their debut SEC showdown last season in a 30-23 win in Columbia.Neither side has life in the SEC Championship race, so it is full steam ahead towards the playoff for Oklahoma and all eyes getting to a premier bowl game for Missouri.\nOklahoma vs. Missouri: Need to knowPoints at a premium: The scoreboard operator in Norman might have a nice, calm afternoon on Saturday. The defenses in this matchup are two of the 11 stingiest units in college football in yards allowed per game. Moving the ball on the ground is borderline impossible against Oklahoma, which ranks No. 3 against the run, and Missouri does not let much fly with its No. 15 pass defense. Sooners defensive lineman David Stone is arguably the most fearsome standout between the two units, and that the Midseason All-American comes off the bench is a testament to Oklahoma's elite depth up front.Zollers settles in: The first start of Zollers' young career did not go swimmingly. In fact, that is an understatement. The Missouri quarterback delivered a putrid 7-for-22 passing effort in a blowout loss to Texas A&M two weeks ago. But while his accuracy only improved slightly in his second outing, the former blue-chip recruit gained some necessary confidence in the Tigers' rout of Mississippi State, tossing a pair of touchdowns. Zollers will have his hands full with his toughest test to date on Saturday.Pound the rock: Both teams like to run the ball at a high rate, but doing so against these defenses will be a challenge. Missouri's offense is a ground-oriented operation that runs on nearly 60% of its snaps, and it's hard to blame Eli Drinkwitz for handing the ball off so often with Hardy leading the nation in rushing yards. The sophomore ballcarrier just posted the best performance of his career with a 300-yard, three-touchdown explosion and has crossed the century mark in all but three games. Oklahoma, meanwhile, has one of the country's most lethal quarterback run games with Mateer leading all ballcarriers in attempts (104) and touchdowns (7).\nWhere to watch Oklahoma vs. Missouri liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, OklahomaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Oklahoma vs. Missouri prediction, picks\nThe defenses are the two most reliable units in this matchup. On the Oklahoma side, Venables should have plenty up his sleeve for an inexperienced quarterback in Zollers who has yet to find much footing. His run-stopping unit will be the best that Hardy has seen all year, too, so another 300-yard effort is almost certainly not in the cards for the Doak Walker Award candidate. Simply put, there is no straightforward path for the Tigers to move the ball. With both teams content to run at a high rate -- thus keeping the clock ticking -- and both defenses ranking among the nation's best, it should not take more than a couple scores to decide this game. Just be wary of a defensive touchdown.

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 12 kicks off with an AFC showdown in the Lone Star State, as the 5-5 Houston Texans welcome Josh Allen and the 7-3 Buffalo Bills to town. The Texans are coming off their second straight victory, a 16-13 win against division rival Tennessee Titans, while the Bills emerged on the right side of a 44-32 shootout with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It will be Davis Mills under center again for the Texans, as C.J. Stroud will miss a second straight start due to his concussion. Mills is 2-0 this season as a starter and is averaging 283 passing yards per game. He's scored four total touchdowns, thrown one interception, but also been sacked six times in those contests. You can bet Texans vs. Bills at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:The Bills got back to their winning ways last week in a game that featured nine lead changes, but they are still 1.5 games behind the surprising New England Patriots in the AFC East. Between facing a backup quarterback and a bottom-10 rushing attack, this is a big opportunity for Buffalo.\nIt's probably safe to say that another six-touchdown outing is probably not in the cards for Allen, but the NFL's reigning MVP does have an 8-0 record on Thursdays. Six of those victories have come on the road, although Houston has not been kind to Allen who is 0-3 when playing deep in the heart of Texas.Let's break down this week's edition of \"Thursday Night Football,\" but first, here's how you can watch the game. Where to watch Bills vs. Texans liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 20 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: NRG Stadium -- HoustonStream: PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -5.5; O/U 43.5 (via FanDuel)Bills vs. Texans: Need to knowDavis Mills struggled in his one start vs. Buffalo. While Mills has been winning as of late, his one career start vs. the Bills back in 2021 was a disaster. He completed 11 of 21 passes for 87 yards, zero touchdowns and a career-high four interceptions in a 40-0 loss. Josh Allen has bad luck in Houston. Allen has an 83-37 record as a starter in the regular season, but he's had bad luck in H-Town. The Bills have lost on walk-off field goals in Houston twice when Allen has started.Bills run defense is an issue. The Bills have the No. 2 pass defense in the NFL, allowing 169.7 yards per game. However, the run defense is a major problem. Buffalo allows the second-most rushing yards per game with 153.0, and has allowed six rushing touchdowns of 30 or more yards this season -- which are tied for the most through 10 games in NFL history.Best defense in the NFL? Many believe the Denver Broncos have the best defense in the NFL, but that title may belong to the Texans. Houston allows a league-low 258.1 total yards per game, and is the stingiest when it comes to allowing points on the board at 16.3 per game. And that 16.3 is the fewest allowed through 10 games by a team without a winning record since 2003! Houston has allowed fewer than 20 points in seven of 10 games this season.Not-ready-for-prime-time players? The Bills are 2-2 in prime time this season, but have lost their past two night games. The Texans on the other hand have lost both of their prime-time matchups this year. Bills vs. Texans prediction, pick\nAllen may not love playing in Houston, but he certainly likes playing on Thursdays. Allen has the best Thursday record (8-0) by a starting quarterback since 1950. He's scored 290 total touchdowns in his career, which are the most all-time by a player 30 years old or younger, and has the most total touchdowns in the NFL this season with 28. All that to say, he's good enough to rise above this vaunted Texans defense. \nThe Texans mounted an impressive comeback against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 10 and found a way to win in Tennessee last Sunday despite not scoring a single point in the first half, but the Bills are a different kind of test. Buffalo covers the spread in prime time. Pick: Bills -5.5; Under 43.5\n            ",

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                      What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game.

    "body": "\n        One of the top events on the PGA Tour tees off on Thursday as the 2026 WM Phoenix Open unfolds at TPC Scottsdale (Stadium Course). Known for its raucous crowds, the WM Phoenix Open usually draws a great field, and this year is no exception. Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Hideki Matsuyama are among the players teeing it up. They'll be joined by Brooks Koepka, who is playing his second event since rejoining the PGA Tour last week at the Farmers Insurance Open.The latest 2026 WM Phoenix Open odds list Scheffler as the +230 favorite (risk $100 to win $230), followed by Schauffele at +1700. Si Woo Kim and Cameron Young are at +2500. Koepka, who finished T56 last week, is +4500 this week. Before locking in any 2026 WM Phoenix Open picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 WM Phoenix Open field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 WM Phoenix Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Si Woo Kim, who is one of the favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to fade this week. The 30-year-old is off to a fast start this season, finishing T11 at the Sony Open, T6 at The American Express and T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open. This event has been a real struggle for him, however, as he's missed three of thee past five WM Phoenix Open cuts and hasn't finished better than 50th since 2022. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Ben Griffin this week. He has only played this event twice, but he made the cut both times and finished 36th last year and 28th in 2024. Both times he shot above 70 in the first round, but rallied over the weekend, so if he can get off to a fast start at TPC Scottsdale this week, he'll have a chance to be in the mix on Sunday. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 WM Phoenix Open picksThe model is also targeting three other longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 WM Phoenix Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

The over/under for Clippers vs. 76ers is 218.5 points. The model is also backing the Timberwolves to cover as 7.5-point favorites against the Grizzlies for Monday NBA picks.

The Timberwolves have won four straight games, bouncing back from a five-game losing skid, and they are 31-19 on the season. Each of their most recent four wins has come by at least 12 points, winning by an average of 16.8 points per game. The Grizzlies (18-29) remain without Ja Morant (elbow), who could be traded this NBA Trade Deadline week, and they have lost six straight games. Each of their last four losses has come by at least eight points. Timberwolves stars Anthony Edwards (back) and Julius Randle (thumb) are questionable as injuries to watch, but the model still projects Minnesota to cover in 62% of simulations. Bet the Timberwolves to cover at DraftKings here:Clippers (-2.5) vs. 76ers (-105)The Clippers have been arguably the best team in the NBA since near Christmas, going 17-4 over their last 21 games after a 6-21 start to the season. They have won five straight and are 10-1 over their last 11 home games. Even with James Harden (personal) out on Sunday, the Clippers defeated the Suns, 117-93. Harden had 25 points and nine assists on Friday against Denver, and he's 16th in scoring (25.4 points per game) and third in assists (8.1). His being out in the front end of a Clippers back-to-back could raise his chances of playing Monday. Meanwhile, the 76ers go into this contest without star Paul George, who was hit with a 25-game suspension on Saturday for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy. The model projects the Clippers' winning ways to continue, projecting them to cover in 69% of simulations. Bet the Clippers at DraftKings here:Sacramento State (+1.5) vs. Weber State (-120)\"Familiar local face Mike Bibby had to throw out the blueprint for his first Sac State side when 6-11 UNLV transfer Bear Cherry went down with a leg injury in November. The Hornets, however, have made adjustments and sit mid-table in Big Sky into February after back-to-back wins over Montana State and Montana at the Nest,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"It's also worth noting those were only the third and fourth home games since Thanksgiving...all wins in Big Sky play. Bibby's transfer guards Prophet Johnson (via-Fairfield; 17.3 ppg) & Mikey Williams (via UCF; 16.9 ppg) combined for 45 ppg in those two wins. It's also revenge time for Sac State after Weber State got the Hornets in Ogden when hitting 51% from the floor on January 3.\" Bet Sacramento State at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

Seattle loss its opener to San Francisco and fell to 3-2 after a Week 5 loss to Tampa Bay, but ripped off wins in 13 of the next 14 wins to earn its way into the Big Game. Meanwhile, New England lost two of its first three but has won 16 of its last 17.Sam Darnold and Drake Maye both looked like NFL MVP candidates at points throughout the season, though they'll likely fall short to Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford. Darnold has rejuvenated his career by throwing 60 touchdown passes in the last two seasons and Maye became the youngest player in NFL history to lead the league in completion percentage (72.0%).Both teams were top five in the NFL in scoring offense and scoring defense and the SportsLine Projection Model is predicting thin margins against the spread and with the over/under. It's slightly leaning towards Seattle to cover against the spread based on the percentages and also projects that the Under hits in 59% of its 10,000 simulations of the Big Game, higher than the implied odds of 52.2%.Exact score prediction: Seattle Seahawks 24, New England Patriots 20 (best odds +15000 at BetMGM):Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

It's no surprise to see Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals taking part in the games, but not many expected rookie Shedeur Sanders or 41-year-old Joe Flacco to be named to the Pro Bowl. There was another surprising player that was reportedly asked to participate in the Pro Bowl Games, but he declined to focus on his offseason training. That was Justin Fields of the New York Jets, according to NFL Media.It's surprising a quarterback that was benched this season was asked to attend the Pro Bowl. Fields went 2-7 as the starter for the Jets in 2025, and completed 62.7% of his passes for 1,259 yards, seven touchdowns and one interception. His 6.2 yards per attempt marked a career low, and it wouldn't be surprising to see the Jets part ways with him after he signed a two-year, $40 million deal with New York 11 months ago. Fields is certainly an electric athlete that would be fun to watch participate in the games. Back in 2022 with the Chicago Bears, he rushed for 1,143 yards and eight touchdowns. Only Lamar Jackson has rushed for more yards in a single season as a quarterback. In a 35-32 loss to the Miami Dolphins that season, Fields set an NFL record by rushing for 178 yards and a touchdown. Fields was not the only AFC quarterback to decline an invite to the Pro Bowl, as KPRC2 reports C.J. Stroud of the Houston Texans also turned down the Pro Bowl to prepare for next season. The AFC really had to go back to the drawing board when it came to their quarterbacks, as their original Pro Bowl signal-callers were Josh Allen, Drake Maye and Justin Herbert. Allen is recovering from foot surgery, Maye is playing in the Super Bowl and Herbert is banged-up as well.\nThe Pro Bowl Games will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 3 at 8 p.m. ET, and take place at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Let's be honest,  Monday was one of the least interesting transfer deadline days that we can remember. No last minute deals, no dramatic races to beat the deadline that just missed, no drama. It was a disappointing day for fans of the soccer transfer deadlines as no big deals happened in the last day of business for teams around Europe. However, there are some reasons that can explain why it was such a boring day for agents, clubs and players. If the transfer of Ademola Lookman from Atalanta to Atletico Madrid was probably the biggest one of the day, many others just didn't happen. The transfer market has changed significantly in recent years, as the financial situations of many of Europe's biggest clubs no longer allow them to do the kind of business they would like. This is especially true in January, when clubs are increasingly reluctant to sign players on permanent deals, opting instead for short-term loans for the remainder of the season. But there are more reasons behind what has, or hasn't, happened on Monday. Early moves affected the businessThe Premier League's top teams are deeply affecting the transfer window around Europe. With their financial power, they can provide the kind of cash flowing into the other clubs that can start a transfer domino effect, but this wasn't the case in January 2026. Looking at the data provided by Transfermarkt, Premier League clubs have spent around $440 million during the current winter transfer window (the data will be updated after Monday's business) while during the 2025 winter transfer window they have spent around $600 million in just one month of transfer business. There is a difference but not that big to justify what happened on deadline day. This is why it was more about timing. Manchester City were among the most active big clubs in Europe during the winter transfer window. Pep Guardiola's side secured Antoine Semenyo from Crystal Palace for $88 million and Marc Guehi for $27 million but many others weren't as active as the Citizens, working mostly on loans and deals for the summer 2026, as Liverpool for example already secured Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes for the 2026-27 season. Elsewhere, things weren't busy at all. Big clubs in Germany, Spain and France barely made business while in the Italian Serie A only AS Roma and Atalanta were among the busiest teams of the window. While the Giallorossi signed Robinio Vaz from Olympique Marseille and Donyell Malen from Aston Villa, the team coached by Raffaele Palladino were able to sign Giacomo Raspadori from Atletico Madrid for around $35 million before selling Ademola Lookman to the Spanish team on deadline day. Juventus signed Jeremie Boga while Joao Mario was swapped with Emil Holm at Bologna. The Bianconeri failed to sign a striker after talks with multiple players such as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Youssef En-Nesyri, same as AC Milan that were looking for an additional striker after signing Niclas Füllkrug earlier in the window. Inter, the Serie A leaders, wanted a new right winger and after talks to sign Ivan Perisic and Moussa Diaby, none of them joined the team coached by Cristian Chivu. Antonio Conte's Napoli underwent a major overhaul earlier in January, with several key signings from the summer window leaving the club. Lorenzo Lucca joined Nottingham Forest, while Noa Lang moved to Galatasaray on loan, as Napoli brought in Giovane from Hellas Verona and Alisson from Sporting CP.\nThe biggest deadline day transfersAdemola Lookman to Atletico MadridIt was probably the most exciting transfer of the day across Europe as Atletico Madrid agreed to terms with Atalanta for the transfer of the Nigerian striker who will replace Giacomo Raspadori, who joined Atalanta few weeks ago. Lookman had been a key player under Gian Piero Gasperini at Atalanta, while also scoring an iconic hat trick in the 3-0 win against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2024 Europa League final. Lookman had disagreements with the Italian club last year when he was expected to leave Atalanta and join Inter. After several weeks of tension, during which he also refused to train with the team, the parties involved have now finally reached an agreement to bring their working relationship to an end.Karim Benzema to Al HilalThis transfer move was probably the biggest surprise of the week as Karim Benzema left Al-Ittihad and joined Al-Hilal on Monday in the Saudi Pro League, and will now play for the team coached by Simone Inzaghi that is currently leading the standings by one point on Al-Nassr. Benzema also had issues with his former club, which led to his departure during the winter transfer window. He is now set to make his first move since joining the Saudi Pro League in 2023 after leaving Real Madrid, where he became a soccer legend and played from 2009 to 2023. \n        \n            \n                Cristiano Ronaldo frustrations with PIF ownership of Al-Nassr grow as Karim Benzema secures Al-Hilal move\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTransfers that didn't happen Sandro Tonali to Arsenal While only a few transfers happened, many others didn't take place. Some of them due to the medical tests, such as Mateta who was set to join AC Milan during the last day of transfers, but then he didn't get the final green light from the doctors that the Rossoneri sent to London. There was some noise also around Italian midfielder Sandro Tonali, as Arsenal, according to Sky Germany, was interested to sign him on Deadline Day. However, both Arsenal and Newcastle had denied the rumours off the records while the agent of the Italian player Giuseppe Riso said to Sky Italy: \"We never had any conversation with Arsenal. Newcastle were never gonna let Tonali leave in January and we didn't even talk about it.\"\nRicardo Pepi to FulhamAnd lastly, one of the potentially key players of the United States men's national team. Ricardo Pepi was close to leaving PSV in the last 24 hours of the winter transfer window, but his move to Fulham was called off on Monday morning after the Dutch team couldn't find a replacement before the end of the window. Pepi will now remain at PSV until the end of the season, focusing on preparing for the 2026 World Cup. Sometimes the best moves are the ones that don't happen, and hopefully this will be the case for him and many others. \n        \n            \n                Why Ricardo Pepi's failed transfer to Fulham is a good thing for his career and the USMNT as World Cup nears\n                \n                    Chuck Booth                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first major pieces fell into place for the Los Angeles Rams in 2026, signing coach Sean McVay and general manager Les Snead Monday to multi-year contract extensions. Questions still linger, however, about whether quarterback and NFL MVP finalist Matthew Stafford will return for an 18th season in the league. If he does wish to suit up for another year, McVay said the Rams would eagerly welcome him back.The uncertainty on the Rams' side is not about whether they would start a 38-year-old Stafford next season but rather about the quarterback's desire to play in the first place. McVay has his \"fingers crossed\" that Stafford has more fuel left in his tank.\"I think that if that's something that he wants to do, the answer is absolutely yes,\" McVay said, expressing his interest in constructing another offense around Stafford \"... I think what's great is he's going to take his time, talk with [his wife] Kelly and the girls and see what's best.\"From a production standpoint, the Rams have no good reason to turn down another year of Stafford. The three-time Pro Bowler just set career highs in passing yards (4,707) and touchdowns (46) and is four years removed from delivering the franchise's first Super Bowl victory since its return to Los Angeles. The Rams have never won fewer than nine games with Stafford under center for a full season.\n\"Man, is he still playing at an incredible level,\" McVay said. \"Our hope is that he does [return], but I think with respect to his timetable and ability to be able to communicate with you guys whenever he feels ready to make that announcement, we'll let him be able to do that.\"That timetable is entirely unclear, although McVay said he does not get the sense that Stafford \"wants to let it drag on.\" The last time Stafford stood in front of a microphone at a press conference was after the Rams' NFC Championship game loss to the Seattle Seahawks, and it was too soon after the season ended for the veteran quarterback to offer insight into his future.\"I can't generalize six months of my life 10 minutes after a loss,\" Stafford said. \"So I appreciate the guys in this locker room a whole hell of a lot. Everybody that helped me and helped our team be the success that we were this year. And that's all I'll answer for you.\"\nStafford agreed last offseason to a restructured contract which added five void years onto the end of his deal and thus lowered his cap hit. He is under contract for one more season and will earn approximately $42 million in 2026 should he return.\n            ",

All the while, Rozier has been away from the Heat after being placed on unpaid leave after he was arrested. The NBPA filed a grievance for Rozier to be paid his salary, citing the necessary presumption of innoncence until proven guilty, which an arbitrator agreed with.\"We are pleased with the arbitrator's ruling and remain committed to ensuring that Terry's due process rights are protected and that he is afforded the presumption of innocence throughout this process,\" a NBPA spokesperson said.The Heat had been holding Rozier's payments in escrow, and will now pay him his full salary for the 2025-26 season -- or until a ruling is made on his case and it's determined whether he was guilty in the alleged betting scandal. \nThat ruling comes at an interesting time for the Heat, as they are considered one of the top potential suitors for Giannis Antetokounmpo ahead of the NBA's trade deadline on Thursday. Rozier's salary could be important filler in any deal, whether for Antetokounmpo or any other trade the Heat want to make. Because Rozier is an expiring salary, using his contract would allow the Heat some added flexibility in trade talks. His money will come off of the books after this season and would allow Miami to make an offer to the Bucks that could provide some much-needed cap relief for the Bucks. \nRozier's contract has counted against Miami's cap all season and has always been considered tradable, but the uncertainty of his situation given the charges against him made it feel a bit murky. The arbitrator's ruling in Rozier's favor could help provide clarity for teams perhaps unsure if a deal involving Rozier would clear at the league level. \n            \n    ",

Switch-pitcher Jurrangelo Cijntje is headed back from Seattle to St. Louis and the Rays are expected to get third baseman Ben Williamson from the Mariners. The Cardinals will also receive 2023 first-round draft pick Tai Peete from the Mariners and outfielder Colton Ledbetter and a compensatory draft pick from the Rays. None of the involved clubs has yet announced the trade. Mariners receive: UTL Brendan DonovanRays receive: 3B Ben WilliamsonCardinals receive: SHP Jurrangelo Cijntje, OF Tai Peete, OF Colton Ledbetter, two compensatory draft picksDonovan, who's going into his age-29 season in 2026, is coming off his first career All-Star selection this past season. His best position is second base, and he can also man first, third, and left, and cover shortstop in limited doses. At the plate, Donovan put up an OPS+ of 119 this past season, and that figure is right in line with his career mark of 117 across parts of four MLB campaigns. Furthermore, there's cause to believe he may have found a higher level with the bat in 2025. Through the end of May, Donovan boasted a wOBA of .373 and backed it up with expected wOBA of .370. In June, though, an MRI on Donovan's ailing left toe turned up a sprained capsule in the joint. Donovan toughed it out, but the injury cascaded throughout his lower half, messed up his swing mechanics, and sapped his production. The Mariners are no doubt hoping he's able to rediscover and sustain that higher level moving forward. Donovan won't hit free agency until after the 2027 season.\n        \n            \n                Brendan Donovan trade grades: Mariners find obvious fit, Cardinals finish offseason teardown with biggest move\n                \n                    R.J.

The Mariners won the AL West in 2025 with a 90-72 record, three games ahead of the Houston Astros, before losing in the ALCS to the Toronto Blue Jays.From the Cardinals' standpoint, the trade of Donovan is in many ways the capstone on an offseason that's seen them commit fully to a rebuild under first-year president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom. Earlier in the winter, Bloom and the Cardinals in a pair of deals sent right-hander Sonny Gray and first baseman/former catcher Willson Contreras to the Red Sox and then offloaded veteran third baseman Nolan Arenado to the Diamondbacks. In each deal, the Cardinals added young pitching to an organization that prior to Bloom's takeover was starved for velocity and swing and miss. As well, ownership in each of those three deals included significant cash in order improve the return. That was especially the case in the Arenado swap. As for the Donovan trade, it not only adds young talent to an improving farm system but also fully clears the decks for top prospect JJ Wetherholt in 2026. He's now the favorite to open the 2026 season as the Cardinals' starting second baseman.\nCijntje, headlining the return for St. Louis, was Seattle's first-round pick in 2024. CBS Sports' R.J. Anderson recently ranked him the No. 7 prospect in the AL West, crediting a \"sneaky good right-handed fastball as well as a swing-and-miss breaker that ought to result in a middle-of-the-rotation future,\" but warned that his best future almost certainly involves pitching exclusively as a right-hander.Peete, also headed to the Cardinals, spent all of 2025 in High A, hitting .217/.288/.404 in 125 games.Williamson, headed south to the Rays, made his major-league debut in 2025, hitting .253/.294/.310 in 85 games for the Mariners.\nLedbetter hit .265/.337/.378 in Double A last season.\n            ",

An amended complaint filed last week includes a total of 31 plaintiffs, which attorney Kerry Sutton said comprises athletes from eight different sports teams. Three former athletes filed individual lawsuits in 2022 and 2023, and the case grew in September when 11 alleged victims filed a fourth suit.The lawsuit alleges that Murphy over multiple years engaged in acts of misconduct involving improper touching of the genitals during massages and intrusive observation while collecting urine samples during drug tests.Murphy, who worked at NC State from 2012-22 and was promoted to director of sports medicine in 2018, is one of nine defendants named in the lawsuit. The others are school officials, including former athletic director Debbie Yow, who are accused of negligence. The plaintiffs claim that Yow and other administrators were aware of Murphy's behavior but did not investigate nor prevent him from working with male athletes.\"The health and safety of students and student-athletes is paramount to NC State Athletics and the university,\" a university spokesperson said Monday to ESPN. \"Sexual misconduct of any kind is unacceptable, prohibited by NC State's policies, and in direct opposition to the mission, culture and standards of the university. NC State is reviewing the lawsuit and determining appropriate next steps.\"\nNC State placed Murphy on administrative leave and fired him in 2022, the same year in which former men's soccer player Benjamin Locke filed the initial lawsuit. That complaint stated that former men's soccer coach Kelly Findley told a senior athletic department official in 2016 that Murphy was engaging in conduct consistent with \"grooming\" behavior. The September lawsuit added that Findley raised concerns four years prior in 2012 and requested that Murphy be removed from his role as the team's trainer.Murphy was reassigned from his role in 2013 but resumed working with the men's soccer team in 2014. Athletic department officials allegedly told Murphy between 2016 and 2021 to refrain from treating male athletes and to distance himself from the men's soccer team, but the lawsuit states they did not enforce those requests when he failed to comply.\n\"A culture of fear in the NCSU athletics department led to this tragic set of circumstances,\" Sutton said in September. \"Athletes afraid of losing their scholarship or their spot on the team, trainers afraid of reporting their boss, coaches afraid of getting involved, directors afraid of harming NCSU's reputation. Murphy took advantage of those fears to get away with abusing what we believe may turn out to be hundreds of former Wolfpack athletes.\"\n            \n    ",

Ronaldo's frustrations come at a time when the side Al-Nassr are attempting to overhaul in the Saudi title race have been granted a major boost with Al-Hilal close to finalising the signing of Karim Benzema from Al-Ittihad.Ronaldo was nowhere to be seen when head coach Jorge Jesus named his side to face Al-Riyadh on Monday in what is understood to be a decision taken by the player, reflecting his frustration at transfer business with the Pro League giants. Al-Nassr have made no new signings in the January transfer window but sources say they were still working to strengthen their squad in the final hours before the transfer window closes Monday.Without their top scorer Al-Nassr earned a 1-0 win that moved them within a point of leaders Al-Hilal, who played out a goalless draw in their game against Al-Ahli. At the same time they were bidding to conclude the on-again, off-again saga around Benzema, whose move from Jeddah to Riyadh seemed to have stalled in the afternoon only for an agreement to be struck late on. It had been suggested that Benzema, out of contract at Al-Ittihad in the summer, was not keen to stay at his current club under the terms offered by PIF, who own Al-Ittihad, Al-Nassr, Al-Ahli and Al-Hilal.\nHowever a late breakthrough has been found that is expected to see Benzema sign on as an Al-Hilal player until the summer of 2027. That move is understood to have been poorly received by Ronaldo, who is frustrated at the lack of support that his club have received from PIF.Ronaldo's actions have the backing of some senior figures at Al-Nassr, according to CBS Sports sources, as the complications that come with one organisation owning four of Saudi Arabia's leading clubs spill over onto the pitch. CBS Sports has previously revealed the tension that hovers over relations between some of the biggest teams in the country, which burst to the surface in the summer when Al-Hilal attempted to secure the services of Ronaldo for the Club World Cup. Questions over how PIF was managing Al-Nassr also bubbled up a year ago when there was a split between club and owner over whether to pursue a deal for Victor Boniface or Jhon Duran, the latter arriving despite not being the first choice of the hierarchy at AL-AWWAL PARK Stadium.\nRonaldo, 40, still has nearly 18 months left to run on the contract he signed with Al-Nassr in the summer and there has so far been no suggestion that he might look to cut his stay short. Instead he will hope that his deadline day strike will convince PIF to offer backing to his side in the final moments of the transfer window.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar, who has been in search of an additional year of eligibility since the conclusion of the 2025 season, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in Knox County Chancery Court. In his complaint, Aguilar seeks a temporary restraining order against the NCAA with the goal of obtaining an injunction that would allow him to play for the Volunteers in 2026.Aguilar is the latest athlete to sue the NCAA over its eligibility rules, and like the other cases, the Tennessee quarterback's complaint alleges that those rules deprive him of the opportunity to earn NIL compensation. Aguilar played two seasons of junior college football, which he argues should not count against his eligibility clock.\"If the Court granted Aguilar relief from the NCAA's JUCO rule in the near term, Tennessee has a spot for him on the roster and would welcome him back,\" the complaint says, per the Knoxville News Sentinel. \"His compensation for playing college football in 2026 would be approximately $2 million.\"If the court rules in Aguilar's favor, it would pave the way for him to join the Tennessee roster while awaiting a final ruling on the injunction. The 2026 season would be Aguilar's second with the Volunteers and fourth at the FBS level. He redshirted in 2019 at the City College of San Francisco, did not play in 2020 when the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, started five games at Diablo Valley College in 2021 and started six games the following year before making his Division I debut in 2023 at Appalachian State.\nAguilar will be 25 at the start of the 2026 campaign.There is no date set for Aguilar's hearing, but he seeks a speedy decision as he charts his path forward. The complaint states the need for a timely ruling in order to allow him to either return for spring practices or prepare for the NFL Draft.Aguilar was the SEC leader last season in passing yards per game and totaled 3,565 on the year, which placed him in third place in Tennessee single-season history. He passed for 24 touchdowns and ran for four more scores while guiding the Volunteers to an 8-5 record.Tennessee's offensive outlook hinges on Aguilar rulingAn injunction allowing Aguilar to spend one more year at Tennessee would likely raise the Volunteers' floor in 2026. The quarterback room in his absence lacks experience and would turn either to George MacIntyre or Faizon Brandon as its starter. Ryan Staub transferred in from Colorado but does not carry the same high-end upside as the former blue-chip recruits in the group.\nWith Aguilar under center, the Volunteers would benefit from both his experience as a fourth-year FBS starter and his familiarity with the offensive system. Any development between his first and second seasons in the program could help the Volunteers pull out of the SEC's middle tier and compete more strongly for a College Football Playoff berth.Diego Pavia case has implications for Aguilar, othersAguilar was initially a plaintiff in Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia's lawsuit against the NCAA, which challenges in federal court the legality of counting junior college seasons towards athlete's five-year eligibility clocks. He was granted voluntary dismissal from Pavia's suit and is thus no longer tied to the decision. The more than 25 plaintiffs in the Pavia case await a Feb. 10 hearing in which a judge will consider a preliminary injunction that halts the NCAA's junior college rule.If the federal court rules against Pavia and the other plaintiffs, Aguilar could still obtain his eligibility through his own lawsuit in state court. If it grants the injunction, further actions could bring additional eligibility to any former junior college player who has yet to play four years of Division I athletics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Mariners, St. Louis Cardinals, and Tampa Bay Rays reportedly agreed to a massive three-team trade on Monday centered around veteran utility player Brendan Donovan. In total, five players and a draft pick were moved as part of the swap, including third baseman Ben Williamson and former first-round draft picks Jurrangelo Cijntje and Tai Peete.As is the case whenever a notable trade happens during Major League Baseball's offseason, I'm here to provide analysis on each of the players and to judge how the teams fared. That analysis is then reduced to bite-size in the form of a letter grade -- that part is (by far) the least important of the exercise.Before we get to the analysis, here's a look at the trade again in its entirety:Mariners receive: UTL Brendan DonovanRays receive: 3B Ben WilliamsonCardinals receive: SHP Jurrangelo Cijntje, OF Tai Peete, OF Colton Ledbetter, two compensatory draft picksLet's proceed.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mariners grade: BJust last week, three members of our baseball staff predicted Donovan would end up on the Mariners before spring training started. Sometimes, player-team fits are too obvious to actually happen. That looked like it might end up being the case here, with Donovan's tenure in St. Louis stretching deeper into the offseason than most would have expected back in November. That's life for you.The 29-year-old Donovan is a compelling fit for the Mariners because of his offensive track record and his defensive versatility. In four big-league seasons, he's yet to produce an OPS+ below 114. Last year's Mariners club, a 90-win team that almost won the pennant, had just four players clear that mark in more than 300 trips to the plate. Donovan's offensive game is built around discipline and contact. He's comfortable working at-bats and he's connected on more than 90% of the in-zone swings he's taken as a big-league player. When he puts a ball in play, it's usually on a line and often classified as being hit hard. That's a good combination, and he should continue to find success despite now playing his home games in the least friendly offensive environment in the sport for left-handed batters, per Statcast.\nDefensively, Donovan has ample experience across the diamond, with most of his recent burn coming at second base or in left field. The Mariners have shed multiple options at the hot corner this winter (Williamson in this deal and Eugenio Suárez through free agency), so they may prefer to deploy him at third base most days, depending on how they fill out the remainder of their roster.\nDonovan is under team control through the 2027 season, which helps explain why the Mariners had to give up Cijntje and Williamson to complete the deal. Seattle probably won't regret it in the long haul. The Mariners have shown a real talent for pitching development and they have another promising young infielder in the way in Colt Emerson. Add in Donovan's immediate impact on a club that may again compete for the pennant and this would be a likable trade without the other pieces.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cardinals grade: ACijntje, 22, was the 15th pick in the 2024 draft. CBS Sports just ranked him as the 44th-best prospect in the minors. Here's the extent of his writeup:\nCijntje, best known for being a switch-pitcher who can clear 90 mph with either arm, was Seattle's first-round pick in 2024. He reached Double-A in his first full professional season despite some underwhelming numbers that make it clear his future is exclusively as a right-hander. Indeed, he surrendered a .618 OPS and recorded a nearly 20% strikeout-minus-walk rate throwing righty, as opposed to 1.117 OPS and more walks than strikeouts as a lefty. Cijntje will be just dandy when and if he gives up on the novelty act: he has a sneaky good right-handed fastball as well as a swing-and-miss breaker that ought to result in a middle-of-the-rotation future. Cijntje joins a vastly improved group of Cardinals pitching prospects. Dating back to last summer, they've now drafted Liam Doyle and added Cijntje, Hunter Dobbins, Richard Fitts, Yhoiker Fajardo, Brandon Clarke, Blake Aita, and Jack Martinez to the organization through trades. Clearly they had a desire to upgrade their pitching depth without having to pay for it on the free-agent market.Peete, 20, was the 30th pick in the 2023 Draft. He's a lefty-swinging outfielder with dynamic power-speed upside, but usability continues to be an issue -- specifically with respect to a nearly 33% whiff rate. Last year in High-A, he hit .217/.288/.404 with 19 home runs and 25 stolen bases in 125 games. Peete's game is centered on pulling and lifting the ball. If he can make contact a little more frequently, he has a chance to make an impact at the big-league level. Ledbetter, 24, was the 55th pick in the 2023 Draft by way of Mississippi State. He spent last season in Double-A, hitting .265/.337/.378 with seven home runs and 37 stolen bases. Ledbetter, a left-handed swinger, has struggled with same-handed pitching throughout his professional career. He's a capable athlete who can play across the outfield, though he's best deployed in a corner spot. Add those sentences together and you have a player who is probably topping out as a spare outfielder.The two compensatory pick should check in around Nos. 68 and 72. In total, that gives the Cardinals five picks in the top 72 overall in the 2026 Draft.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rays grade: BWilliamson, 25, is a former second-round pick who batted .253/.294/.310 (76 OPS+) with a home run and five stolen bases in his 85-game introduction to the majors. He's a fantastic third baseman who would likely be earmarked for a future Gold Glove Award if he could hit more. As it stands, Williamson lacks the swing path and bat speed to hit for power. His approach is also mismatched: he offers less within the zone and more outside of the zone than the league-average player. \nWithout any gains on the offensive end -- and without a positional switch to shortstop -- Williamson's game probably looks something like Ke'Bryan Hayes'. There are worse fates to experience.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell held his annual state of the NFL press conference Monday from the Bay Area, the site of Super Bowl LX.Goodell, who is near the end of his 20th season as commissioner, touched on a number of topics, including the future of the league's international schedule, a potential increase to the regular-season slate, Bill Belichick's reported exclusion from this year's Pro Football Hall of Fame class and Giants co-owner Steve Tisch's inclusion in the latest release of the \"Epstein Files\" regarding convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Here's a rundown of some of the main topics Goodell addressed with the assembled media.International scheduleGoodell said the NFL will play nine games overseas in 2026, including a return to Mexico City in December. Earlier in the day, the league revealed that the New Orleans Saints will serve as the home team in the first-ever regular-season game played in Paris.\nThe nine international games in 2026 mark an increase from the seven the league played overseas in 2025. Goodell said his goal is to reach 16 international games per season, with every team playing at least one game abroad.\"We're getting great reactions from our teams,\" Goodell said. \"They all want to play. Our players loved it. One of the greatest things from last season was talking to our players and our coaches about how proud they were to be there and talk about the game to help globalize the game. They felt like ambassadors, and they enjoyed the experience, and that's really part of it.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL announces return to Mexico with International Series Game in Mexico City for next three seasons\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSteve Tisch in the 'Epstein Files' \"I would say that absolutely, we are going to look at all the facts,\" Goodell said. \"We're going to look at the context. We're going to try to understand that, and we'll see how that falls under the policy. But I think we take one step at a time. Let's get to facts first.\"\nA follow-up asked whether the NFL will investigate Tisch's involvement in the files and whether Goodell is concerned about more NFL figures being named.\"We'll continue to follow any of the facts that come up,\" he said, \"and we'll determine whether we open an investigation based on those facts.\"\n        \n            \n                Steve Tisch in Jeffrey Epstein files: Emails show sex offender scouted women for New York Giants co-owner\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBill Belichick's Hall of Fame exclusion\"That's a Hall of Fame career, but there's a decision-making process here, and it's a timing issue,\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of people who are deserving of this, so I think that's something that the media will have to make that determination on as they go. But there's a lot of people who want to be in that Hall of Fame, and Bill Belichick deserves to be in that Hall of Fame too.\"\nGoodell made it clear that the NFL and the Pro Football Hall of Fame are separate entities. He also brushed off a question about whether he feels responsible for Belichick's exclusion after he fined Belichick and the Patriots for their role in Spygate, which was reportedly one of the things that kept Belichick out of the Hall of Fame this year.\n        \n            \n                How did Bill Belichick get snubbed? Inside the Hall of Fame vote, who backed him and what may have happened\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLack of diversity hiringGoodell acknowledged that more work needs to be done to improve diversity in hiring. Of the 10 head coaching vacancies recently filled, only one went to a minority candidate (new Titans head coach Robert Saleh). No head coaching openings were filled by a Black candidate.Of the NFL's 32 head coaches, only three -- Todd Bowles, DeMeco Ryans and Aaron Glenn -- are Black.\nDespite expanding the Rooney Rule in recent years and taking other steps to address the issue, the league continues to face challenges in that area. Goodell said he will keep working to find solutions to one of the NFL's biggest problems.Goodell also defended the Rooney Rule, which has faced criticism for years. Established in 2003 and named after former Steelers owner Dan Rooney, the rule requires teams to interview at least two external minority and/or female candidates for head coach and general manager vacancies, as well as one for various coordinator positions.\"I think the Rooney Rule has been seen as a positive by our clubs,\" Goodell said, \"by giving them an opportunity to look at a diverse set of candidates. They make the choice ultimately, but I think it's shown them the value to look at talent where you might not know it, or you may not see it.\"\n\"We're in a competitive league. ... We have 10 openings this year. Teams are trying to get the coach that they think can win. So I think taking the time pressure off of that is one of the things we focus on as a league ... to give them that time so they can make a really good decision independently, but one that is based on being able to look at a diversity of candidates. I think that only benefits the NFL.\"Regular-season expansionGoodell said adding a game to the regular-season schedule \"is not a given.\" The league expanded from 16 to 17 regular-season games in 2021, with a common assumption that an 18th game could be added in the next Collective Bargaining Agreement, which does not expire until 2031.\"We have not had any formal discussions about it, and frankly, very little with any informal conversations,\" he said. \"It is not a given that we'll do it. That is not something that we assume will happen. It is something that we want to talk about with the union leadership.\"\nGoodell listed several factors that could go into whether the league expands the regular season.\"It'll depend on a lot of factors, including safety of the game,\" he said. \"What other changes can we make ... from a safety standpoint, but also a competitive standpoint? Should we have two byes? What are the roster sizes? There are a number of issues that need to be discussed with the players.\"Honoring Paul TagliabueGoodell announced the league is creating the \"Paul Tagliabue Academic Achievement Award\" in honor of former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who died in November. \nThe award will go to an NFL player \"who demonstrates their desire to continue their education, to excel in that area, not for what they do on the field, but rather the work that they do.\" \"Bobby Wagner just went back and got his MBA and is playing world-class football,\" Goodell said. \"That's pretty amazing. And so we want to acknowledge that, celebrate that, but also celebrate Paul's legacy in a way I think he'd be proud.\"\n            ",

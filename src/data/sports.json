    "body": "\n        Lindsey Vonn's incredible comeback to compete at the 2026 Winter Olympics came to a sudden end on Sunday when she crashed in the women's downhill event and suffered a gruesome leg injury that required her to be airlifted off of the course. Vonn, in her first public statement following the crash, insisted she had no regrets about pushing to compete on a torn ACL and revealed she suffered a complex tibia fracture that would require multiple surgeries to repair. On Friday, Vonn posted a video thanking fans for all of the support, including the flowers and stuffed animals she's been sent, as she prepares for surgery on Saturday -- her fourth since the crash. She said she hopes that will be her last procedure in Italy, allowing her to return home to the U.S. to continue her recovery and have a fifth surgery. \"It has been quite a hard few days in the hospital here. I'm finally feeling more like myself. I have a long, long way to go,\" Vonn said. \"Tomorrow I'll have another surgery and hopefully that goes well and then I can potentially leave and go back home, at which point I will need another surgery. Still don't know exactly what that entails yet until I get some better imaging, but it's kind of where I am right now.\"\n\nFollowing her third surgery on Wednesday, Vonn posted an update with a photo from her hospital bed. \nI had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful. Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago. I'm making progress and while it is slow, I know I'll be ok. Thankful for all of the incredible medical staff, friends, family, who have been by my side and the beautiful outpouring of love and support from people around the world. Also, huge congrats to my teammates and all of the Team USA athletes who are out there inspiring me and giving me something to cheer for. ❤️🤍💙In the photo, the extent of the injury is evident in the amount of bracing on Vonn's leg. However, even in the face of what seems likely to be a career-ending injury, Vonn has continued to express gratitude and appreciation for fans supporting her journey back to competition. Vonn's return to the Olympics saw her return to the top of the downhill standings this season, but a crash in Switzerland a week before the games threatened to derail her comeback after she suffered a torn ACL in her left knee. Vonn was able to get cleared by doctors to continue competing, and after successfully completing her training runs, she was still a podium contender heading into Sunday's downhill. \n        \n            \n                Lindsey Vonn has 'no regrets' after Olympics crash as skiing figures defend her decision to race on torn ACL\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarly in her run, Vonn clipped a gate as she came over a jump that caused her to get off balance and led to the crash that made for a cruel ending to an inspiring comeback bid. She explained that she was just five inches too far inside on her line, pushing herself to the limit as always trying to get every edge possible. \nThat willingness to push boundaries made Vonn a legend, and her resilience in the face of injuries and heartache continues to make her a beloved figure in American sport. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) denied Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych's appeal of his disqualification from the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. The CAS agreed with the International Olympic Committee's assertion that Heraskevych's plan to wear a helmet honoring Ukrainian athletes killed during Russia's invasion of Ukraine would violate Olympic rules against making political statement on the field of play. According to a statement released by the CAS and acquired by the Associated Press, an arbitrator \"found these limitations reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr. Heraskevych's case, wearing the helmet during four training runs.\"  Heraskevych trained in the helmet, which depicts at least 20 athletes and coaches, as late as Wednesday before the IOC made its final decision to bar him from Thursday's race. The IOC said Monday that Heraskevych's helmet would not be allowed in competition, citing a rule against making political statements on the Olympic field of play. \n\"I never wanted a scandal with the IOC, and I did not create it,\" Heraskevych wrote in a statement on social media. \"The IOC created it with its interpretation of the rules, which many view as discriminatory. Although the IOC's actions have made it possible to loudly speak about Ukrainian athletes who have been killed, at the same time the very fact of the scandal distracts a tremendous amount of attention away from the competitions themselves and from the athletes participating in them.\"Heraskevych also posted a picture of his wearing the helmet during training after the ban was announced.   \nIOC spokesperson Mark Adams noted while speaking with the media that Heraskevych had the opportunity to \"express his grief\" on social media, during press conferences and in the mixed zone, where athletes interact with reporters following competitions. \n\"In the end, let me be clear, it's not the message, it's the place that counts,\" Adams said. \"That for us -- and not actually us. We are, in this sense, in a back seat. It's the message of the athletes, that the athletes reiterate to us time and time again. There are 130 conflicts going on in the world. We cannot have 130 different conflicts feature. However terrible they are, we cannot have them featured during the field of play.\"   Other prominent Ukrainian athletes have come out in support of Heraskevych. Boxer Oleksandr Usyk, a two-time undisputed world heavyweight champion and a gold medalist in boxing while representing Ukraine in 2012, added his voice on social media. \"I'm proud of you @heraskevych, for your courage and bravery,\" Usyk wrote. \"The helmet with portraits of fallen Ukrainian athletes is a tribute, not a rule violation!  Sport doesn't mean forgetting. True strength is having the courage to remain human, even in the toughest times.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Spring training opened for all 30 MLB teams this week with the annual pitchers and catchers reporting dates coming and going. Most of the free agents are settled in either new homes or back with their same team. Still, a few notable names remain and especially with the litany of early injuries, there will continue to be trades. Let's gather the news and rumors of the day here. Cubs, Miller close to dealThe Cubs and free agent reliever Shelby Miller are \"nearing a multi-year deal,\" according to Fansided.Miller, 35, was a first-round pick all the way back in 2009. His career as a starter was finished a while back, but he pitched to a 2.74 ERA and 1.04 WHIP with 54 strikeouts in 46 innings in relief last season for the Diamondbacks and Brewers. He was a trade deadline acquisition for the Brewers and was roughed up a few times in his month for the ballclub before an elbow injury ended his season. He's expected to miss all of the 2026 season, which is why this is a multi-year deal. The Cubs are going to have him rehabbing in house with eyes on the 2027 season.\nBlue Jays, Astros swing dealThe Blue Jays have traded for outfielder Jesús Sánchez with the Astros getting outfielder Joey Loperfido, both teams announced. Sánchez, 28, hit .237/.304/.395 with 1.3 WAR in 134 games last season for the Marlins and Astros. Loperfido, 26, returns to the Astros organization, where he was drafted and developed until heading to the Blue Jays in the Yusei Kikuchi trade at the 2024 deadline. In 41 games for the Jays last season, he hit .333/.379/.500 with 0.6 WAR.Reds add first base depthFree agent first baseman Nathaniel Lowe has signed with the Reds, reports MLB.com. The 30 year old is coming off a down 2025 season in which he hit .228/.307/.381 with 18 homers and 84 RBI. In the previous three seasons he hit .277/.360/.438 (126 OPS+), so the Reds will be hoping for a bounce-back. \nAngels bringing Taylor backThe Angels and veteran utility man Chris Taylor have agreed to a minor-league deal, per the New York Post. Taylor, 35, started last season with the Dodgers -- where he'd spent the overwhelming majority of his MLB career -- but finished with the Angels after the Dodgers released him. In 58 games between the two stops, he slashed .186/.256/.301.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chris Paul announced on Friday that he is officially retiring from the NBA, effective immediately. The 40-year-old point guard released a statement saying \"this is it!\" after being waived by the Toronto Raptors. This is it! After over 21 years I'm stepping away from basketball. As I write this, it's hard to really know what to feel, but for once — most people would be surprised — I don't have the answer lol! But, mostly I'm filled with so much joy and gratitude! While this chapter of being an \"NBA player\" is done, the game of basketball will forever be engrained in the DNA of my life. I've been in the NBA for more than half of my life, spanning three decades. It's crazy even saying that!! Playing basketball for a living has been an unbelievable blessing that also came with lots of responsibility. I embraced it all. The good and the bad. As a lifelong learner, leadership is hard and is not for the weak. Some will like you and many people won't. Bu the goal was always the goal, and my intentions were always sincere (Damn, I love competing!!).  Paul's Hall of Fame career did not come to a storybook ending in his 21st season in the NBA. After returning to the Los Angeles Clippers this offseason, Paul announced this would be his final season in the NBA, but the team parted ways with Paul less than two months into the season amid reports of internal frustration with the veteran. Paul was then traded to the Toronto Raptors in a three-team deal as part of a salary dump, with Toronto never requiring the legendary point guard to report to the team before officially waiving him on Friday. Rather than seek an eighth team to play for to close out his illustrious career, the 40-year-old opted to call it on a disappointing season that ends an otherwise spectacular career on a bit of a sour note. Paul hoped he could return to the Clippers organization he helped build into a perennial playoff threat and be part of another contending squad, but instead found himself clashing with the current leadership in the L.A. locker room. \n        \n            \n                Chris Paul retires without a ring -- but his career proves he was one of NBA's greatest winners\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite that disappointing ending, Paul will be a first-ballot Hall of Famer and will go down as one of the greatest point guards to ever play in the NBA. Over his 21-year career, Paul scored 23,058 points, dished out 12,552 assists, pulled down 6,006 rebounds and created 2,728 steals in 1,370 games played. That productivity puts him all over the NBA's all-time record books, as he's second in all-time assists, second in steals, 16th in games played and 41st in points. \nHe finishes his career selected to 12 All-Star teams, 11 All-NBA teams and nine All-Defense teams. While he never captured the ever-elusive NBA championship, teams always took a step forward after acquiring the Point God, and he reached the postseason 15 times with five different teams in his career. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL has won its grievance against the NFLPA, which claimed the annual team report cards were a violation of the collective bargaining agreement, according to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. The league initially filed the grievance in August, and this ruling was a big victory for the owners.When it first filed its grievance, the NFL argued that the team report cards violated the league's constitution and bylaws, which prohibit players from \"publicly criticizing any member club or its management, personnel, employees or coaches.\" The report cards allowed players to assign teams grades on a number of categories, and the teams were then ranks from 1-32. The NFLPA then published the results and worked with media to amplify them.In a memo to team presidents obtained by CBS Sports, the NFL claimed that NFLPA witnesses at the hearing characterized the report cards as \"union speech.\" The league also asserted that NFLPA witnesses admitted to using \"cherry-picked\" topics, responses and quotes in the published results and said the players didn't have a say in \"drafting commentary,\" a task left to union staffers. The NFL also maintained that the NFLPA chose to weight certain topics differently, which would tip the scales when determining the alphabetical grades.\"In essence, the record established that the Report Cards were designed by the union to advance its interests under the guise of a scientific exercise,\" the NFL said in its memo.\n        \n            \n                NFL files grievance against NFLPA over annual team report cards, alleges CBA violation\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe league claimed that the hearing highlighted \"the numerous and significant limitations in the methodology and accuracy of the Team Report Card results.\" The memo still advised teams to \"solicit feedback directly from their own players\" while evaluating their strengths and weaknesses.\nIn its response, the NFLPA said that while it disagreed with the ruling, it will continue the survey. The results will no longer be made public, but the NFLPA said players will still have access to them, and the union argued it's a good chance for teams to hear from their players.\"The ruling upholds our right to survey players and share results with players and clubs,\" the NFLPA said in a statement. \"While we strongly disagree with the restriction on making those results public, that limitation does not stop the program or its impact. Players will continue to receive the results, and teams will hear directly from their locker rooms.\"\"Importantly, the arbitrator rejected the NFL's characterization of the process, finding the Team Report Cards to be fair, balanced, and increasingly positive over time. Our methodology is sound.\"\nIn the 2025 edition of the team report cards, the Miami Dolphins finished as the top-ranked organization in the NFL, and the Arizona Cardinals finished last.\n            ",

Whitwell appeared to choke up with emotion. When Whitwell ruled that Chambliss would be granted a preliminary injunction against the NCAA, the crowd in attendance broke into applause. Ole Miss got its quarterback back. The evil NCAA had been defeated. A chancery courthouse in the tiny town of Pittsboro, Mississippi -- population 157 -- delivered Chambliss a win for the program and the state. At least that would be the script if Chambliss' win played out as a TV courtroom procedural -- a win for the little guy against the archvillain NCAA. \nThe reality is far more complicated. Chambliss' case is the latest example of a rapidly eroding eligibility system in which courts -- not conferences or the NCAA -- increasingly determine who is allowed to play college football.No one objects to Chambliss receiving another season. He is one of the sport's most exciting players, and the 2026 college football season will be better with him in Oxford.The concern is precedent.Chambliss' fight for a sixth season hinges on an argument he should have been granted a medical redshirt at Ferris State in 2022. He used his traditional redshirt as a true freshman in 2021 and said he sat out in 2022 because of medical condition: lingering tonsillitis.\nThe NCAA disagreed and denied his waiver three separate times, determining the illness did not meet the threshold for a medical hardship waiver.In a Mississippi courtroom, however, the case drew obvious sympathy. So much so that at one point Whitwell seemed to coach Chambliss around one of his answers after Chambliss stumbled in the face of NCAA cross-examination.When asked by a NCAA lawyer if he was limited in practice during the 2022 season, Chambliss said: \"No sir.\" He participated the entire season on the scout team. \nAfter the cross-examination finished, Whitwell and Chambliss had this exchange:Whitwell: \"In 2022 you just got through saying you didn't have any issues. My understanding is you said you complained to the trainers, and you were out there with the scout team and that you weren't up to par. Were you up to par or not?\" Chambliss: \"No sir.\" Whitwell: \"I didn't understand why you were saying what you were saying a while ago, because 2022 is the year we're looking at. Did you go in and report to the training staff that you were having problems?\" Chambliss: \"Yes sir, multiple times.\" Whitwell: \"Dr. Howard said you didn't have any flare ups. But you still had some swelling from the injections in December after you had three-plus in August of 2022. You still had some swelling, did you not? Was it bothering you or not?Chambliss: \"Yes sir. It was constant. It was like a roller coaster.\" Whitwell: \"That's why you believe you couldn't play in 2022.\" Chambliss: \"Yes sir.\" Whitwell: \"You never played a down in 2022.\"Chambliss: \"Not one.\" Judges often clarify testimony. Still, the moment illustrated why athletes have increasingly turned to local courts for their eligibility lawsuits. A sympathetic local jurisdiction can succeed when the NCAA appeals process fails.  That strategy has worked repetitively since Diego Pavia successfully sued the NCAA in Tennessee, leading to a wave of eligibility lawsuits. It's all part of an eroding enforcement and eligibility model for the NCAA. A historic boogeyman the NCAA may be, but the organization is only trying to enforce rules schools like Ole Miss helped create. Remember, the NCAA is a bureaucratic body whose primary function is to enforce rules approved by its membership.Chambliss stood to lose millions because the NCAA denied his medical redshirt appeal. Prior generations would have just had to deal with it. But in the post-Pavia landscape billable hours always provide another avenue of attack.It doesn't work every time. The NCAA wins the majority of the cases. Even the wins by the athletes are usually narrow, temporary decisions. But the assault on eligibility standards from multiple fronts erodes the foundation of the sport. \"This decision in a state court illustrates the impossible situation created by differing court decisions that serve to undermine rules agreed to by the same NCAA members who later challenge them in court,\" the NCAA said in a statement Thursday following the Chambliss decision.Another test comes Friday when Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar will appear in a Knoxville courtroom arguing that junior college competition should not count against his eligibility clock since junior colleges are not part of NCAA membership. He began his college football career in 2019. That's eight years ago. Things won't get any easier for the NCAA moving forward.Chambliss' lawsuit differed from many others as it hinged on a contract issue, not an antitrust case like so many others who have sued for additional seasons of eligibility. It's a new blueprint for future lawsuits. Antitrust violations carry a high burden of proof. Chambliss argued the NCAA breached its contract with Ole Miss, failing to apply its rules in good faith when it comes to the development of student athletes.The NCAA will likely appeal, and this is only a preliminary injunction allowing Chambliss to play while litigation continues. Still, the direction is clear: eligibility is no longer being decided by rulebooks but by judges in local courtrooms.College football is better for it in 2026. Chambliss is back. Fans win. SEC Saturday afternoons are more fun.Long term, the consequences are far murkier. How can college football operate if the rules vary from state to state and courtroom to courtroom? Every eligibility lawsuit is a further danger to the foundation of the sport.  \nThe good guy won in this TV procedural. The question is the cost.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL MVP race resembled that of many memorable Kentucky Derby finishes in which a cluster of viable competitors rounded the final turn, only to see two thoroughbreds break away toward a photo finish. Rams QB Matthew Stafford crossed the finish line by a length – in this case, exactly one first-place vote – ahead of Patriots second-year sensation Drake Maye after the two traded the lead in the sportsbook MVP odds numerous times down the stretch. Heading into Week 18, Maye was the odds-on favorite with a price of around -400 at most betting outlets, suggesting his receipt of the accolade was all but a foregone conclusion. But those who backed Stafford were rewarded after the veteran signal-caller threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns in a 37-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals to finish the regular season. Although the regular-season finale was far from his most prolific stat line, it is widely believed Stafford received credit among voters for notching 457 yards and three scores in a wild 38-37 Week 16 overtime loss to the Seattle Seahawks, who would go on to allow just one offensive touchdown combined across their final two games.  The intrigue surrounding the air-tight finish makes it easy to forget that neither finalist was even on the radar of football analysts and oddsmakers ahead of the 2025 NFL season. Maye, who was heading into his second season on a Patriots club that went 4-13 in his rookie campaign, could be found with odds of +6000 or better at most sportsbooks. Stafford, on the other hand, literally wasn't even on the betting menu. He was an afterthought amid widespread speculation that lingering injuries could keep him out part or all of the 2025 NFL season. He first emerged in the NFL MVP odds about four weeks into the season and could still be backed at odds of +2200 or better midway through the schedule.So the obvious question is, are any such viable longshots in the 2026 NFL MVP odds worth a sprinkle right now? Similar to the Stafford plight that basically nobody saw coming, such a position would require an imaginative narrative that at least has some potential merit. For instance, imagine pending free agent Kirk Cousins (+20000) were to return to the Vikings, win the starting job over erratic prospect J.J. McCarthy, and put up massive numbers with Justin Jefferson and friends while leading the Vikings back to the NFC North title. Keep in mind Cousins is ultra popular with the NFL media and such a  feel-good storyline would captivate the voters and fans alike. It would take this type of a redemption or comeback journey to give a super longshot a legitimate chance. One thing you can do for sure is eliminate all non-quarterbacks. Although 16 running backs have won the award in NFL history, Adrian Peterson was the last to do so in 2012 and it appears award voters have decided that Offensive Player of the Year is the ceiling accolade that non-quarterbacks can attain in the modern era. This is illustrated by the fact that 49ers RB Christian McCaffrey and Saquon Barkley of the Eagles have produced record-breaking numbers in each of the past two years and neither received a single MVP vote.

Here are some intial leans: Burrow/Mahomes (+1000): We are grouping these AFC signal-callers together because of their overlapping criteria and the principle that either at +1000 could easily provide some equity. Mahomes is a two-time MVP winner who will be coming off a torn ACL that ended his 2025 season. If he is ready in Week 1 and leads the Chiefs back into the AFC title picture while remaining healthy, there's little doubt he will be in MVP consideration. Burrow's late-season return from a toe injury reminded football observers what the Bengals are capable of with him at the helm. Burrow is extremely popular with the NFL media and, should the Bengals return to playoff contention, he will have the accompanying massive numbers to support an MVP bid.  Lawrence (+2000): The first overall pick of the 2021 draft played the best football of his career in 2025, throwing for 4,007 yards and 29 touchdowns against 12 interceptions as the Jaguars reached the postseason in their first year under head coach Liam Cohen. During an eight-game winning streak to close out the regular season, Lawrence was arguably playing as well or better than any quarterback in the league and had just two interceptions in that span. Should the Clemson product maintain this level of production while keeping turnovers limited, he could win over voters who might have some fatigue of familiar candidates. He might also receive some sentiment on the comeback narrative considering many analysts, prior to last season, were prepared to label him a complete bust. Dart (+4500): Hat tip to SportsLine lead NFL analyst R.J. White for this suggestion. He believes the second-year dual-threat quarterback will be a popular choice among MVP longshot bettors given his chance to excel under new coach John Harbaugh and the potential for big numbers as the Giants attempt to make a major step forward in a vulnerable NFC East. Sign up with DraftKings and start earning bonus bets today:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The All-Star break has arrived, and it couldn't have come at a better time. Injuries continue to come fast and furious, which included the big news Thursday that Jaren Jackson Jr. (knee) is likely out for the remainder of the season. If your fantasy roster needs reinforcements, here are five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Week 18 Fantasy Basketball Waiver WireJakob Poeltl, Toronto Raptors (48% rostered)A back injury has limited Poeltl to only 22 games this season. He is also logging just 25 minutes a game as he tries to battle through it. That is on pace to be his lowest mark since the 2019-20 season. To try and get him right, the Raptors recently shut him down for over a month.Poeltl finally made his return Wednesday and immediately jumped back into the starting lineup. He logged 20 minutes against the Pistons, recording nine points and six rebounds. He has averaged at least 11.1 points, 8.6 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 1.2 blocks in each of the last four seasons. If he is truly past his back issues, he could be a valuable addition for the stretch run.GG Jackson, Memphis Grizzlies (47% rostered)Jackson has only logged 19 minutes a game for the season, but he has a very different role following the Grizzlies big trade with the Jazz. He has started each of the last five games, averaging 27 minutes per contest during that span. In his new role, he averaged 13.8 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.2 assists, one block, and 2.2 3-pointers. He also shot 52.4% from the field and 77.8% from the free throw line during that span.\nThe improved efficiency is a big plus for Jackson. After shooting 37.2% from the field last season, he enters the break at 48.2%. The Grizzlies could get Santi Aldama (knee) back next week. However, with them now being a tanking team, they won't push him to return before he is ready. We may have already seen the last of Zach Edey (ankle) and Brandon Clarke (calf) for the season, too. Playing time likely won't be difficult for Jackson to come by moving forward.Jarace Walker, Indiana Pacers (42% rostered)Ivica Zubac (ankle) has yet to make his debut for the Pacers. The team has been dishing out rest days for Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard lately, which could continue as they look to improve their lottery odds for the draft. Even when Zubac does return, minute restrictions and rest days are likely in his future.The Pacers don't have a ton of promising young talent. One player who flashed some upside was Johnny Furphy, but he's now out with a torn ACL. Their most intriguing young option is Walker, who has averaged 28 minutes over his last 12 games. He parlayed that into averages of 16 points, 5.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.3 steals, and 1.8 3-pointers. Although he shoots 40.4% from the field for the season, regular playing time resulted in him shooting 49.3% over those 12 games. The arrow is clearly pointing up for Walker as the season comes to a close.\nMarvin Bagley III, Dallas Mavericks (25% rostered)The All-Star break came at the perfect time for the Mavericks following the news that Cooper Flagg is dealing with a foot injury. He did not play Thursday against the Lakers and will not participate in the Rising Stars game. The week off will help his cause, but it's unclear right now exactly how much further time he will miss.Bagley doesn't play the same position as Flagg, but there could be more scoring opportunities coming his way. In three games with his new squad, he has averaged 10.7 points, eight rebounds, and 1.3 blocks. In splitting his time with the Wizards and Mavericks, he has averaged 10.2 points and 5.9 rebounds over just 20 minutes per game. If the Mavericks are involved in more lopsided losses because of Flagg being out, Bagley would likely play more in garbage time as Mavericks' starting center, Daniel Gafford, has been in and out of the lineup with injuries. Gafford also left Thursday's game with ankle soreness. While not a flashy option, Bagley can provide fantasy value.Dylan Cardwell, Sacramento Kings (25% rostered)The Kings have lost 14 games in a row and now have the worst record in the NBA. Injuries have played a role in their disappointing season, the most notable of which is Domantas Sabonis being limited to 19 games. He was brought along slowly after his return from a knee injury, and now he has missed four straight games with a back ailment.\nThe Kings have nothing left to play for, so it doesn't make much sense for them to play Sabonis a lot down the stretch. He'd be a rest candidate even if he were healthy, but with him battling two injuries during the season, it would be a surprise if he plays a ton moving forward. With Sabonis missing so much time lately, Cardwell has grabbed at least 10 rebounds in five straight games. Over his last 14 games, he has averaged 6.4 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks. For those in need of boards and blocks, Cardwell makes for an appealing option on the waiver wire.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Though the transfer portal has its fair share of issues, it is unique in the fact that it offers athletes an unprecedented chance at a fresh start. Sometimes athletes find themselves in tough situations through no fault of their own. In other instances, a player may underperform at one program and revitalize their career at another. There have been plenty of stars that have emerged at the national level after undergoing a transfer portal revival. Carson Beck, who was effectively cast off from Georgia, just led Miami to its first national championship appearance of the College Football Playoff era. But those players like Beck that bet on themselves often face a lot of pressure after the decision to transfer.So, with the 2025-26 cycle finally calming down, it felt appropriate to look at the college football transfer players that have a lot to prove in the 2026 season. The situations may be different, but the pressures these players will face are similar. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Boo Carter, DB, Colorado 247Sports transfer ranking: No. 73 overall, No. 4 SCarter's talent is undeniable. When he's bought in, he has the potential to be one of the nation's best slot cornerbacks -- along with the versatility to patrol the backend at safety. He's also a dynamic offensive threat and an effective return man on special teams. Colorado coach Deion Sanders should be able to make the most of his versatility -- à la Travis Hunter -- but getting Carter to buy in could be an issue. Carter was nearly axed from Tennessee's roster last July when he skipped out on some summer workouts, leading to an intervention with Tennessee's leadership group. Then, the Vols finally did part ways with Carter in November when an apparently injured Carter failed to show up to the stadium ahead of Tennessee's game against Oklahoma. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Aidan Chiles, QB, Northwestern 247Sports transfer ranking: No. 124 overall, No. 15 QB Chiles was once one of the most significant recruiting wins in Oregon State history when he signed with the Beavers as the No. 7 quarterback in the class of 2023. He then followed coach Jonathan Smith to Michigan State, where he got his first full experience as a starter... and failed to impress. In 12 games in 2024, he posted a 5-7 record while throwing 13 touchdowns to 11 interceptions. Chiles continued to struggle through the first eight games of the 2025 season and was eventually benched in favor of Alessio Milivojevic. Now he's looking for a fresh start at Northwestern.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chaz Coleman, EDGE, Tennessee 247Sports transfer ranking: No. 7 overall, No. 2 EDGETennessee lost top edge rusher Joshua Josephs to the NFL Draft. Then his top two backups, Caleb Herring and Jordan Ross, entered the transfer portal. That made landing an instant-impact edge rusher a top priority. The Vols did well to land Coleman, who played under new Vols defensive coordinator Jim Knowles at Penn State last season. Knowles and his coaching staff had plenty of praise for Coleman as a freshman. He even drew comparisons to former first-round pick and Nittany Lions star Abdul Carter. The production wasn't necessarily there, though. He had just one sack in five appearances. Coleman has a lot to live up to at Tennessee, which really needs him to quickly reach his full potential. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    DJ Lagway, QB, Baylor 247Sports transfer ranking: No. 14 overall, No. 4 QBAt one point, mentioning \"Lagway\" and \"Heisman Trophy\" in the same breath didn't seem far-fetched. He signed with Florida as the top quarterback prospect in the class of 2024 and, after emerging as the Gators' starter late into his freshman season, entered 2025 as one of the most ballyhooed offensive playmakers in the country. He did not meet those lofty expectations, though. Lagway barely eclipsed 2,000 yards passing and tossed 16 touchdowns to an SEC-high 14 interceptions. As with other entrants on this list, the talent isn't an issue with Lagway. He boasts a huge arm and the athleticism to challenge defenses with his legs. Maybe he can put it all together at Baylor.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Sam Leavitt, QB, LSU 247Sports transfer ranking: No. 1 overall, No. 1 QB Leavitt's health is the major concern. He missed a majority of the 2025 season with a foot injury that's also expected to keep him out during spring practice. That already presents a major setback as he enters a new system at LSU. Foot injuries can also be tricky for quarterbacks -- especially those like Leavitt who are major playmakers with their legs. If he can put the injury behind him, Leavitt will no doubt be a favorite for the Heisman, especially since he gets to play for one of college football's best quarterback gurus in coach Lane Kiffin. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Noah Rogers, WR, Alabama 247Sports transfer ranking: No. 127 overall, No. 32 WR Rogers was the odd man out in Ohio State's 2023 signing class, which also produced Carnell Tate, a likely first-round pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, and Brandon Inniss, who remains a key contributor for the Buckeyes. The former top-40 prospect transferred to NC State, where he produced a pair of solid, if unspectacular, seasons. He totaled 68 catches for 919 yards and three touchdowns over two years with the Wolfpack. Alabama hopes he can fully live up to his recruiting billing as the Crimson Tide look to replace standouts Germie Bernard (NFL) and Isaiah Horton (transfer).\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Qua Russaw, EDGE, Ohio State 247Sports transfer ranking: No. 63 overall, No. 8 EDGE Russaw is yet another former top-billed prospect who has yet to really produce at the collegiate level. He was the No. 64 overall prospect nationally when he signed with Alabama in 2023. He tallied just two sacks over his three seasons with the Crimson Tide, though he did flash that potential when he was on the field. Ohio State does have to replace top sack artist Caden Curry, but they get Kenyatta Jackson Jr. back, so there's only one starting pass-rushing spot up for grabs. Russaw will have to prove himself. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chase Sowell, WR, Penn State 247Sports transfer ranking: No. 74 overall, No. 18 WROn paper, Sowell is the most intriguing wide receiver that Penn State has had in quite some time. He has an ideal frame at 6-foot-3 and 210 pounds, blazing-fast speed and elite abilities after the catch. Those traits were on display when he averaged around 16 yards per catch at East Carolina from 2023-24, but he struggled to acclimate to the Power Four level at Iowa State last season. Sowell had a couple of boom games, including a 146-yard performance against Arizona, but there were also weeks where he was missing in action. Following Iowa State coach Matt Campbell, a majority of his staff and quarterback Rocco Becht to Penn State could help Sowell hit his stride. Penn State is looking for someone to break the wide receiver lull the program has suffered through lately. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Deshaun Watson's tenure with the Browns isn't coming to an end soon although most of Cleveland's fan base would be happy with his immediate departure. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the controversial quarterback is expected to finish the unprecedented fully guaranteed, five-year, $230 million contract he received in connection with his March 2022 trade to the Browns. It doesn't matter that Browns owner Jimmy Haslam has admitted that exchanging 2022, 2023 and 2024 first-round picks, a 2022 fourth-round pick, a 2023 third-round pick and a 2024 fourth-round pick with the Houston Texans for Watson and a 2024 sixth-round pick was a huge mistake. Cleveland's plans with Watson have been etched in stone ever since a December 2024 contract maneuver. Two contract years in 2029 and 2030 voiding on the first day of the 2029 waiver period (one day after Super Bowl LXIII in February 2029) were added while existing dummy/voiding 2027 and 2028 contract years were turned into real contract years with minimum salaries. Watson's base salary in the voiding 2029 contract year is an unsecured $200 million that becomes fully guaranteed on the third day of the 2027 league year.Watson will be released in March 2027 with a post-June 1 designation before the 2029 salary guarantee vests. A team can release two players each league year prior to June 2 using a post-June 1 designation that will be treated under the salary cap as if released after June 1. With a post-June 1 designation, a team is required to carry the player's full cap number until June 2 even though he is no longer a part of the roster. The player's salary comes off the books at that time unless it is guaranteed. Only the current year's bonus proration counts toward the cap with players released using a post-June 1 designation. The acceleration of the bonus proration in future contract years is delayed until the following league year, which typically begins in early to mid-March. In Watson's case, using a post-June 1 designation will allow the Browns to take the salary cap hit from his multiple contract restructures over the 2027 and 2028 league years.\nAnother contract restructure like in the previous three years will be necessary before the 2026 league year starts on March 11 because Cleveland has a tight salary cap situation. Watson has 2026's largest cap number at $80,716,534. Converting $44.7 million of Watson's fully guaranteed $46 million 2026 base salary will create $35.76 million of 2026 cap space.By taking this approach, the Browns will have dead money, a salary cap charge for a player no longer on a team's roster, totaling $86,206,864 when Watson is released in 2027. The current record for dead money in parting ways with a player is the $85 million the Denver Broncos had during 2024 and 2025 for releasing quarterback Russell Wilson in March 2024 with a post-June 1 designation. Watson's dead money will be split into $34,663,514 in 2027 and $51,543,350 in 2028. The $34,663,514 will consist of $8,018,836 in 2027 bonus proration from the 2023 contract restructure, $8,755,678 in 2027 bonus proration from the 2024 contract restructure, $8.949 million in 2027 bonus proration from the 2025 contract restructure and $8.94 million in 2027 bonus proration from the 2026 contract restructure. The $51,543,350 will be composed from $8,755,678 of 2028 bonus proration relating to the 2024 contract restructure, $15,967,672 of 2028 and 2029 bonus proration as a result of the 2025 contract restructure and $26.82 million of 2028 through 2030 bonus proration from the 2026 contract restructure. Watson will be off Cleveland's books starting in 2029.\nGetting rid of Watson this year using a post-June 1 designation without doing another contract restructure would mean $80,716,514 of 2026 dead money, which is his current 2026 cap number, and $50,446,864 in 2027. Watson can't be released conventionally this year because the dead money would be $131,163,378 with the $50,446,864 of bonus proration from his future contract years, including the dummy/voiding years, accelerating to 2026.Trading Watson isn't feasible either. He can't be moved without his consent because of his no-trade clause. Watson doesn't have trade value considering he is coming off the torn right Achilles he suffered in October 2024, the retear requiring another surgical repair in January 2025, his off-the-field baggage and stunning regression since joining the Browns. The quarterback who led the NFL with 4,823 passing yards and set a Texans franchise record for touchdown passes (33) in 2020 doesn't seem to exist anymore. Even if a trade partner could be found after the 2026 salary conversion takes place, the Browns would have the same $86,206,864 of dead money in 2027 as releasing Watson conventionally next year provided he was dealt after June 1. Prior to June 2, the Browns would have $129,863,378 in dead money for 2026 by trading Watson once the 2026 contract restructure occurs.\nThe coaching change from Kevin Stefanki to Todd Monken is potentially beneficial to Watson. Monken is intrigued by Watson because of the quarterback's previous success when playing against him. Watson regaining some semblance of his previous form after his injuries, which also include a fracture to the glenoid bone in his throwing (right) shoulder that limited him to six games in 2023, would be a remarkable and improbable turnaround.\n            ",

Diggs, who participated in New England's loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60 less than a week ago, was allowed to leave without paying any bail. Diggs was also ordered to stay away from his former personal chef, who accused him of assault in December. Diggs is due in court April 1 for a pre-trial hearing. The woman who was working as Diggs' private chef initially filed charges on Dec. 22. She told police that Diggs entered her bedroom and smacked her after they discussed money he owed her.   \n\n        \n            \n                Stefon Diggs charged with felony strangulation, assault: Patriots star 'categorically denies' allegations\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nShe also said that she attempted to push Diggs away and Diggs tried to choke her by placing his elbow around her neck. Additionally, the woman claims that Diggs' assistant tried to get her to sign a nondisclosure agreement before she received her payment. \"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs,\" the Patriots said in a statement in December. \"Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\"\nDiggs just finished his first season with the Patriots after he signed a three-year contract worth $63.5 million in March. Though he had just three catches for 37 yards in the Super Bowl, he was one of New England quarterback Drake Maye's favorite targets in 2025, as he finished the regular season with 85 receptions for 1,013 yards and four touchdowns. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nEvery Friday leading up to conference tournaments I'll take an early look at some of Saturday's biggest college basketball games based on the opening lines. This Saturday features Iowa State in a revenge spot at home versus Kansas, while Kentucky tries to slow down red-hot Florida.  I'll give an early lean for each game and where I think the line will move closer to tip-off. These are just leans unless I mention I officially gave out a pick on SportsLine in the analysis.Note: Saturday's opening lines and subject to change. Clemson Tigers at Duke Blue DevilsDuke -11.5, 133.5 (DraftKings)\nI played Duke on Tuesday and got extremely lucky to cover -15.5 vs. Pitt. One thing the Panthers were able to do was slow the game down and keep it close heading into the final 10 minutes. Clemson will have a similar game plan on Saturday. The Tigers play at an extremely slow pace and will try to limit possessions and make Duke beat them in the half-court. That strategy might work, although Clemson needs to avoid falling behind early on the road in order to keep this game in the low 70s. This is a matchup of the top two defenses in the ACC, and the Tigers are also a strong defensive rebounding team. That's important because Duke kills smaller opponents on the offensive glass. Another factor in this game could be turnovers. The Blue Devils' biggest weakness is they can be sloppy with the basketball, and Clemson does an above-average job of creating turnovers. I can see this game being a lower-scoring grinder between two good defenses. The Tigers are one of the few ACC teams that has been successful versus Duke recently, winning two of the last three games and falling by two points in the other. I think they can stay competitive again on Saturday. Lean: Clemson +11.5Kansas Jayhawks at Iowa State CyclonesIowa State -5.5, 141.5 (DraftKings)\nIowa State is in one of the best spots of the season Saturday. Not only is this a revenge spot for the Cyclones at home after they were blown out at Kansas earlier this season, Iowa State is also coming off a disappointing loss to TCU. It's not easy to bet against Kansas right now. The Jayhawks have won eight straight and just upset previously unbeaten Arizona at home. I can argue Kansas has been the best team in college basketball over the last month, with victories over Iowa State, BYU, Texas Tech and Arizona. Having said all that, everything screams Iowa State here. This has been a big home-and-home series of late and the Cyclones are a perfect 13-0 at Hilton Coliseum, winning their five conference games by an average of 19 points. I lean Iowa State here, but the early number has the revenge angle already baked into it. I would prefer getting the Cyclones at +4.5 or better. Lean: Iowa State -5.5Kentucky Wildcats at Florida GatorsFlorida -11.5, 152.5 (FanDuel)\nFlorida is really rolling right now after blasting Georgia on Wednesday. The Gators are now 9-1 in their last 10 games and peaking at the right time heading into March. Kentucky is also playing well after a slow start, winning eight of nine. The Wildcats are 4-1 in the last five meetings against Florida, with the lone loss coming by three points. If Kentucky is going to keep this game close, the Wildcats can't get bullied on the glass. Florida ranks first in defensive rebounding percentage and second in offensive rebounding percentage in SEC games. The Gators live off second-chance points, so Kentucky must limit those opportunities to stay competitive. I think this line is a little high. I made Florida -9 at home. I lean Kentucky plus the points and over 152.5. Each of the last four meetings between these two games has reached 156 points, with the average being 180. I expect another fast-paced, high-scoring game on Saturday. Another angle here is to back Florida in the first half. Kentucky has a tendency to start slow and come back in the second half. If you like the Gators in this game, Florida -6.5 in the first half is worth a look. Leans: Kentucky +11.5 and Over 152.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While UConn's Sarah Strong has been the top candidate for Player of the Year honors in the 2025-26 women's college basketball season, Vanderbilt sophomore Mikayla Blakes made a loud statement on Thursday night. Blakes scored 34 points in an 86-70 win as the No. 5 Commodores upset No. 4 Texas.\"Prove me wrong that (Mikayla Blakes) is not the SEC Player of the Year and the national Player of the Year,\" Vanderbilt coach Shea Ralph said postgame, while also saying Aubrey Galvan should be Freshman of the Year.\nIt might not be that simple because it will be difficult to take the top spot away from Strong -- the leader of the undefeated No. 1 team in the nation. But Blakes deserves serious consideration.Thursday was her fourth-straight game with at least 30 points, which is impressive in itself but even more so because she is doing it against top competition. She officially joined former UConn star Paige Bueckers as the only two players with three consecutive 30+ points games against AP Top 25 opponents in the last 15 seasons.\nBlakes is averaging 26.2 points per game and recently surpassed Iowa State's Audi Crooks as the Division I leading scorer for this season. One of her biggest strengths is her quick shooting release and high extension. Texas senior Rori Harmon is a solid on-ball defender, but Blakes still figured out how to shoot 9 of 19 from the field and 3 of 6 from beyond the arc on Thursday night. What Blakes did against the Longhorns was historic: her 34 points are the most scored against Texas in the Vic Schaefer era.Blakes is a three-level scorer, but an often overlooked part of her game is her ability to defend. She is averaging around three steals per game, which puts her in the top 25 nationally. Last month, Blakes was named to the Naismith National Defensive Player of the Year Watch List.\nWhile Ralph has no doubt in her mind about the POY award, Blakes is not too concerned about it and is just trying to stay focused on her team's goals.\"Honestly, it's a great award but I think that's not my goal,\" Blakes told SportsCenter after Thursday's game. \"I think my goal is just to do whatever my teammates need me to do. We want to go deep and far into the March Madness tournament and the SEC tournament. So whatever comes with that comes with that. But honestly I'm not really playing just for those awards. I'm playing for my teammates, my coaching staff and for Vanderbilt.\"Last year, Blakes set a new NCAA freshman record by scoring 55 points and helped the Commodores return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in a decade. This year, Vanderbilt looks strong enough to make it to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2009 and beyond.\nHere are some other takeaways from the week in women's college hoops.Vic Schaefer calls out Texas: 'Softest team I've had in years'Thursday was only Texas' third loss of the season, but coach Vic Schaefer was not pleased with the effort he saw on the court. The Longhorns fell behind to Vanderbilt by 12 at the end of the first quarter, which was Texas' worst point differential in a first quarter in six seasons under Schaefer, per ESPN. Their 26-point deficit in the third quarter was also the first time they have been down by 20+ points this season. During the postgame press conference, Schaefer said his team needed to play with more heart.\"Just quite frankly, we had no heart,\" Schaefer said. \"You want to ask me, what does it take to win at this level? What's it going to take for my team? You gotta have heart. We got no heart... I'm accountable. That's my team. It's so disappointing. It's probably the softest team I've had in years.\"\nOlivia Miles sets career-highOlivia Miles helped No. 17 TCU get a 83-67 road victory at No. 12 Baylor with a 40-point performance, a new career-high. Even more impressively is the fact that she did it by becoming the first Division-I women's basketball player in 25 years to make 10 3s on the road against a ranked opponent.\"This is why we play basketball, for moments like this,\" Miles said during her postgame interview.It was also a big night for Marta Suarez. Her career-high 27 points meant Miles and Suarez combined for the same amount of points as the entire Baylor roster.\nLeBron NXXT Gen by JuJu Even though JuJu Watkins is sidelined this season due to a torn ACL, the USC star is staying busy. She recently became the first athlete to co-create a sneaker within the Nike LeBron NXXT Gen line. The shoe will officially launch on March 12 on the Nike website and at select retailers globally.To celebrate, Watkins held a shoe unveiling event in Watts, the community where she grew up. Meanwhile, LeBron James debuted the shoe during the Lakers' 105-99 win over Golden State last weekend. \"Working with LeBron to co-create a first is wild,\" Watkins said in a statement. \"It's built for my game, my story. Shaping something to share with the next generation of hoopers means everything.\"\nGame to watch this weekendNo. 3 South Carolina at No. 6 LSU -- Saturday (8:30 p.m. ET on ABC/fubo)This will be MiLaysia Fulwiley's first time facing the Gamecocks since transferring to LSU, and that alone should be fun to see. However, this is also one of those games that could have a significant impact in March. Although the LSU fell to Texas on Feb. 5, a win over South Carolina could still help the Tigers' case regarding a potential No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. The SEC has been extremely competitive this season, and things got even more interesting after Texas lost to Vanderbilt on Thursday night.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        During the week leading up to the Super Bowl, there was some speculation that Derek Carr was looking to make a comeback, and now we know that's definitely the case because he confirmed it on his podcast. That's right, after sitting in retirement for just one season, it appears that Carr is ready to return to the NFL. During the most recent episode of \"Home Grown with David & Derek Carr,\" the Carr brothers talked about multiple topics, including Derek's thoughts on coming out of retirement. Carr announced his retirement back in May and a big reason made the decision to leave the NFL is because he was dealing with a shoulder injury, an injury that seems to be doing much better now. \"Would I do it? Yes,\" Carr said of coming out of retirement. \"Would I do it for anybody? Absolutely not.\"David then chimed in and pointed out that no team should even bother calling Derek unless they're a true playoff contender. \n\"Unless you're trying to make a run at this thing, the confetti falling, the Lombardi in the sky, that's what we're after,\" David said. Derek then added that he only has two qualifiers for a possible return. \"I told you two things: I'd have to be healthy and I'd want a chance to win a Super Bowl,\" Derek said. \"And obviously, that's a tough thing to find. That's hard to do. That's not easy.\"So there you have it. Derek Carr is open to a return, but he'll likely only come out of retirement for a playoff contender. With that in mind, we're going to take a look at some possible landing spots for Carr and we're only going to include teams that will likely contend for a playoff spot, which is why you won't find a team like the Jets on this list. The Jets have a very obvious need a quarterback, but they're 12 players away from being five players away from a Super Bowl contender, so it seems unlikely that Carr would want to go there. \nOne thing to remember with Carr is that the Saints still own his rights, so if he does come out of retirement, New Orleans would have to be willing to trade him away to his new destination. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. VikingsThe Vikings are currently in a nightmare situation at quarterback. They took at gamble at the position in 2024 and hit the jackpot, but then they threw all their money away in 2025. And of course, we're talk about Sam Darnold here. Darnold led Minnesota to a 14-3 record in 2024, but the Vikings got greedy and thought they could do better, so they let him walk in free agency and decided to roll the dice by going all in with J.J. McCarthy. In his first full year as a starter, McCarthy looked much closer to being a bust than someone who can eventually be Minnesota's franchise quarterback. The Vikings have already proved they can win games with the right quarterback and Carr seems like the perfect veteran who could come in and help. The Vikings won nine games in 2025 with McCarthy, Carson Wentz and Max Brosmer all starting at least two games, and Carr seems like a step up from that combo. \n If you give Carr the right weapons, he generally does pretty well, and the Vikings have some receiving weapons in Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson. Carr might have to compete with McCarthy for the job, but that's likely a competition where he would be feeling pretty confident. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. SteelersThe Steelers are obviously waiting on Aaron Rodgers, but at 42 years old, there's certainly a chance that Rodgers will decide to retire instead of returning for another season. If that happens, then Pittsburgh will be in quite the quandary at quarterback. The Steelers do have Mason Rudolph and Will Howard, but you have to think Mike McCarthy would me more comfortable with a smart veteran quarterback who could efficiently run his offense and that's where Carr would come in.McCarthy has shown that he can work well with veteran quarterbacks. Aaron Rodgers won two MVPs while playing for McCarthy in Green Bay, and let's not forget about Dak Prescott, who finished second in the MVP race in 2023 while playing for McCarthy in Dallas. Carr isn't quite at that level, but McCarty could likely help him elevate his game. \nIf Carr went to Pittsburgh for one year, he could be a bridge guy in a move that would give the Steelers some time to find their eventual quarterback of the future.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Colts or ChiefsWe're lumping these two teams together for one big reason: They both have a starting quarterback who suffered a serious injury toward the end of the 2025 season. Let's start with the Colts. Daniel Jones had a strong season in his first-year with Indianapolis, but it came to a painful end in December when he tore his Achilles. That's one of the most brutal injuries in sports and there's no guarantee he's going to be ready for Week 1 in 2026. As a matter of fact, if you look at the recovery timeline for quarterbacks, it would be a borderline miracle if Jones were to play in Week 1. Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins both tore their Achilles in 2023 and they ended up playing in Week 1 of the following season, but both of those injuries happened early in the season (Cousins' injury came in Week 8 while Rodgers tore his Achilles in Week 1. Jones suffered his injury in Week 14).\nNot only is Jones' health up in the air, but he's also set to be a free agent, so the Colts have fo figure out what they want to do with him, and that's where Carr comes in. If the Colts decide to re-sign Jones, Carr could sign a one-year deal and be the QB until Jones is ready to play. If Carr has proven one thing in his career, it's that he can be successful when he has some great offensive talent around him and the Colts have that. They have a solid offensive line, they have one of the best running backs in the NFL (Jonathan Taylor), they have a solid receiving group led by Michael Pittman and they have a solid young tight end in Tyler Warren. This is the kind of team that Carr could thrive on. As for the Chiefs, Patrick Mahomes is also coming back from a major injury. The two-time MVP tore his ACL in mid-December, and right now, it's not clear if he'll be able to play in Week 1. Mahomes definitely seems to be in a rush to get back, but if the Chiefs added Carr, then the Mahomes could take his time in rehab. In this case, Mahomes could circle Week 3 or Week 4 on the schedule and plan to come back then. Carr would obviously take the job knowing that he would only be the starter for the first few weeks of the season, but he would also take it knowing that he's playing for a Super Bowl contender, which is what he wants to be doing at this point in his career. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. FalconsThe Falcons feel like a wild card here. For one, it's highly unlikely that the Saints would want to do anything to help their hated rival and a trade with New Orleans is the only way Atlanta would be able to acquire Carr. \nIf the Falcons could get over that hump, adding Carr would certainly be an interesting option. The Falcons obviously have Michael Penix Jr., but new team president Matt Ryan was noncommittal when asked if Penix would be the starting QB in 2026. Ryan told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones that Penix's role will be decided by new head coach Kevin Stefanski. \"Kevin's responsibility is to be the head coach of the football team and he's going to let you know who our starters are and who our starters are not. It's not my place to go in there,\" Ryan said during Super Bowl week. \nWith the Falcons expected to release Cousins and with them being noncommittal with Penix, that certainly leaves the door open for them to bring in a new quarterback. They could look to sign someone like Joe Flacco, but if they can get Carr for cheap from New Orleans, then the four-time Pro Bowler would definitely make some sense. \n            ",

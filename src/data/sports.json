    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Sandy Brondello wasn't out of a job for long after not having her contract renewed by the New York Liberty, as Howard Megdal of The IX reported Wednesday that Brondello would be named the first coach of the Toronto Tempo. Brondello spent the past four seasons coaching the Liberty, leading the franchise to its first championship in 2024, but was not renewed after a difficult season in New York that ended in a first-round loss to the team she got her start with as a head coach in the WNBA, the Phoenix Mercury. For her career, Brondello has gone 271-181 with a pair of championships across her 12 seasons in Phoenix and New York. Both of those teams were on the precipice of winning a title when she took over -- Phoenix won in her first year and New York in her third -- but now Brondello will take on an extremely different challenge with the expansion Tempo. \n\n        \n            \n                Adam Silver says WNBA players will get 'big increase' in compensation as CBA negotiations continue\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Golden State Valkyries set the bar extremely high for the new franchises coming into the WNBA in this latest round of expansion, becoming the first team in league history to reach the playoffs in their inaugural season. That'll be difficult to match for Toronto, but Brondello will be able to help guide the franchise into building the kind of roster and culture that's necessary for contending in the long term. When the Tempo will get a chance to start building that roster is still unknown, as they are at the mercy of the ongoing CBA negotiations. The new expansion draft rules will be set in that new collective bargaining agreement, and with reports indicating the two sides aren't particularly close to a deal with the Oct. 31 deadline rapidly approaching, Toronto will likely be waiting a good bit longer before they get to start adding players officially. \nIn the meantime, Brondello and Tempo general manager Monica Wright Rogers can begin working out the kinds of players they want to target in an expansion draft and go through the many contingencies depending on what structure the league and WNBPA adopt for it. \n            \n    ",

Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for just 100 yards and tossed three interceptions before being replaced by rookie Quinn Ewers in the fourth quarter.One of the more glaring takeaways from Sunday's loss was the fact that Dolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle only was targeted four times and caught just one pass for 15 yards. On Wednesday, Tagovailoa revealed that his height kept him from being able to get the ball to his star wideout.\"Some of it has to do with being able to see guys ... I'm not the tallest guy in the back there either,\" said Tagovailoa who stands 6-foot-1. \"So being able to see and then sometimes when that happens, you don't want to just throw it blindly, and you gotta progress. So I think that has some merit to, reasons as to why that happened for Waddle.\"\nTagovailoa completed just 12 of 23 passes, was sacked twice threw three second-half interceptions. The first one came on the first play from scrimmage in the third quarter when Cleveland's Tyson Campbell returned the ball 34 yards for a touchdown to extend the Browns' lead to 24-6. The second interception came on a 3rd and 12 from the Miami 3-yard line and was nearly returned for another pick six. The Browns scored a touchdown on the next play. His passer rating on the day was a dismal 24.1.The veteran signal caller actually only targeted Waddle three times and Ewers targeted Waddle once before the final whistle sounded. \nDespite Tagovailoa's struggles in recent weeks, coach Mike McDaniel confirmed earlier this week that Tagovailoa would be the team's starter against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 8. Tagovailoa has thrown three interceptions in back-to-back games and became the first NFL quarterback to do so since Philip Rivers did it in 2019.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Emoni Bates appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated at 15, while LeBron James was featured in Slam Magazine before his junior year of high school. Zion Williamson began going viral for his vicious dunks at 16, and Victor Wembanyama debuted in the EuroCup at 15.But even this century's most-celebrated basketball phenoms failed to find fame as early in life as Mohamed Dabone, who turned 14 years old Tuesday with a physique and skill set so advanced that he's viewed as a potential No. 1 overall pick in an eventual NBA Draft. Dabone, who is already 6-foot-11, is heralded as a fledgling combination of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Victor Wembanyama. A summertime headline in the Wall Street Journal dubbed Dabone, \"The 13-year-old who might be the NBA's next great unicorn.\"Given Dabone was born 2011, it will be 2030 before he's draft eligible. Age, though, is at the center of the story of online hype around Dabone, with many questioning and even seemingly sowing distrust in his Oct. 21, 2011, birthdate. However, CBS Sports has been told his age was verified by European basketball's governing body and gained answers for some of the questions at the center of the rumor mill.\nDabone, a Burkina Faso native, joined FC Barcelona's senior team in Europe's top pro division this season. Though he's playing primarily for the organization's U22 team for now, he logged preseason action with the main team last month, becoming the youngest player to ever play for a EuroLeague squad.Here's one clip of what a 13-year old Dabone did in his first appearance for a Barcelona squad that features several former NBA players on its roster.\nWhy Mohamed Dabone's age is a questionDabone's combination of age and physical gifts (he purportedly owns a 7-4 wingspan) is such an unfathomable pairing that his birthday has become a topic of debate within the basketball universe in places such as the forum and mock draft repository NBA Draft Room. \nThat Dabone hails from a poverty-stricken West African nation only adds to the skepticism over his true age. Burkina Faso ranked 185th of 193 countries in the 2023-24 Human Development Index from the United Nations. Over 25% of the country's roughly 23 million residents lack birth certificates, according to a World Bank study.Skeptics see Dabone's frame and game alongside his age and can't reconcile them. One easy theory is that Dabone was assigned a 2011 birthday by handlers seeking a lucrative finder's fee for introducing a rare phenom to the international basketball community.But CBS Sports has learned there is at least some supporting documentation to back up Dabone's purported birthday. Dabone was able to compete in the May Adidas NextGen session with Barcelona's U18 squad only after passing the organization's age verification procedures, according to a EuroLeague official.\n\"All clubs participating in our competitions are required to submit official documentation for the registration of each player,\" the EuroLeague official told CBS Sports. \"One of the mandatory documents is the player's official passport. Accordingly, the date of birth of Mohamed Dabone published on our website has been taken directly from his passport.\"RealGM, the well-respected online media outlet covering international basketball, used the Adidas NextGen information to build its profile of Dabone. Thus, the Oct. 21, 2011 birthdate for the budding star has become disseminated more widely in recent months.The verification of Dabone's birthdate through a passport comes after a different online profile created suspicion that he may be older than advertised.\nPrior to the EuroLeague's vetting of Dabone's age for the Adidas NextGen event, skeptics latched on to a FIBA 3x3 profile for a \"Dabone Mohamed Samsoundine,\" who has a listed age of 18.  The profile once featured a photo of Dabone but no longer does. It also lists Dabone as being from Togo, which neighbors Burkina Faso to the south. However, a FIBA representative told CBS Sports that anyone can create a profile and enter personal details for the organization's 3x3 platform without providing supporting documentation.\"Only players seeking to compete in FIBA 3x3 Pro Circuit or 3x3 National Team Competitions must undergo a verification process, which includes submitting an official passport,\" the FIBA official said. \"Since Mohamed Dabone has not participated in any of these competitions, his 3x3 profile has not been verified, and FIBA cannot confirm the accuracy of the listed information.\"\nCutting through the clutterIn summary, a passport for Dabone exists and lists his birthday of Oct. 21, 2011. If there is conflicting documentation to suggest that he's actually four years older, it was not provided when that FIBA 3x3 profile was created.Everyone can agree on one thing, though: Dabone is destined for the NBA as soon as he can legally get there. The problem for Dabone is that he'll have to wait so long.Longtime scout Rafael Barlowe, now of the Mavericks, summed up Dabone's situation last year for his website by cutting through the age-related clutter to paint a picture of a future star.\n\"While there is considerable chatter regarding Mohamed Dabone's age, with few believing he was born in 2011, his talent and physical tools are undeniable,\" Barlowe wrote.\nDabone's film suggests the comparisons with Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama aren't far off base. They are all versatile forwards with rare combinations of size and skill. Barlowe identified Dabone as a \"high-ceiling athletic big with tremendous upside\" and noted his strengths as an athletic lob threat and defensive anchor.Given the promise Dabone has already shown, it's likely a disadvantage to him that he must wait until 2030 to be draft-eligible. Dabone will be physically ready much sooner, but he will be forced to delay the beginning of his NBA earnings window until the year he turns 19.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It was almost crisis mode for Liverpool as Eintracht Frankfurt went ahead in the 26th minute of play on Wednesday in the Champions League, but it was Hugo Ekitike who had a deft finish to bring the Reds level and spark a come-from-behind victory. The Reds went into Frankfurt and ended a four-match losing streak in all competitions with an emphatic 5-1 victory. The match was a return to his former club for Ekitike after leaving Frankfurt for Liverpool during the summer, but with Alexander Isak also joining the Reds, it seemed like Ekitike would be headed to the bench. With Mohamed Salah being rested, the French forward showcased his versatility, starting the match on the right wing and scoring a lovely goal, along with taking three shots.Liverpool went on the counter and Ekitike took a long run before finishing past Frankfurt keeper Michael Zetterer. It was a significant goal as well, with Ekitike finding the back of the net for the fifth time in only his eighth start in all competitions for Liverpool. It's something that has only been done seven times in the last 60 years for Liverpool, and the players who last accomplished the feat make up quite a list, with the late Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah being the last two.\nFrankfurt have now allowed a whopping 10 goals in their last two Champions League fixtures, so this is far from a result that says that all is well for Liverpool, but Ekitike could be in for a run as the point striker. At the half, Slot withdrew Isak, bringing on a winger in Federico Chiesa to move Ekitike to the nine. Isak was withdrawn due to a groin injury, which has been a recurring issue for him over the past year, but it's unknown how long he will be out at this stage. \nIsak still only has one goal and one assist for Liverpool so far since joining, which is far from the expectations after scoring 23 league goals for Newcastle United last season. A chaotic summer that saw Isak train alone due to requesting a transfer away from Newcastle, it has taken longer than expected for him to regain sharpness from and it would make sense for Ekitike to get more starts going forward with Isak coming off the bench.The defensive worries are still there for the Reds, but the best way to combat that is by scoring as many goals as possible like they did defeating Frankfurt. Taking 18 shots and putting 14 on target for 3.18 expected goals, there isn't much more that Slot could want from his attack -- except for consistency. Even Florian Wirtz got two assists after also struggling with his transition to the club. \nLiverpool needed a win to restore confidence, and now they have to chase down Arsenal and Manchester City ahead of them in the Premier League. Next up is an away trip to face Brentford, which is a chance to do more of the same that they did in Frankfurt. If there will be a changing of the tide for Liverpool, Ekitike will have a large part in it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cooper Flagg's NBA debut was completely eclipsed by an MVP performance from Victor Wembanyama, who put up 40 points, 15 rebounds and three blocks. Flagg finished the game with 10 points and 10 rebounds on 4 of 13 from the floor in a 125-92 blowout loss to the Spurs, as the Mavericks were completely clueless in trying to slow Wembanyama.In all fairness, it was always going to be an uphill battle for the Mavericks in this game, because Wembanyama is a literal cheat code on both ends of the floor. It's actually surprising that Dallas entered this game as the slight betting favorites (-2.5), because there's not a single player on that team who can credibly guard him. Anthony Davis was Dallas' best shot, and he -- a five-time All-Defensive player -- was just lost with Wemby in front of him.Having to play against Wembanyama is a difficult first test for Flagg, and while there will certainly be some overreactions because of the outsized expectations that come with being the No. 1 overall pick, there shouldn't be any panic about his uneven debut.\n        \n            \n                NBA opening night overreactions for each game: Wembanyama could be NBA's best player, Knicks fix huge problem\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFlagg looked most comfortable offensively in the third quarter, where he scored eight of his 10 points. Unsurprisingly, all of that production came with Wembanyama off the floor, which allowed the rookie to attack the rim -- what he's best at -- and get to his spots in the mid-range. His 10-minute stretch in the third quarter was the best snapshot of the type of offensive player he will be, and fortunately he won't have to go against Wembanyama 82 times in a season.\nHe was aggressive on the boards and held his own defensively, but the Mavericks will have to figure out how he fits in the starting lineup, because the Flagg-at-point-guard experiment might need to be shelved as soon as the next game. It was something the Mavericks toyed with in the preseason to some success, so Dallas coach Jason Kidd stuck with it for the season opener. Flagg's obviously not a natural point guard, and the decision was made primarily because of his defensive capabilities, but what we got was just an unorganized mess. He wasn't really involved on offense for most of the first half (just two shot attempts), and guys like Davis and Klay Thompson were playing iso ball. That's really just a criticism of how the Mavericks' offense looked, where there was little ball movement and everyone was settling for poor shots. That's also the reality of playing against Wembanyama, whose presence quite literally scares teams from even looking at the paint. Still, though, putting Flagg at point guard feels like the Mavericks are making things harder than they have to be.Yes, Kidd had success in the past with turning Giannis Antetokounmpo into a point-forward, but Flagg isn't the physical specimen who can just impose his strength on guys and charge towards the rim. If Kidd wanted to see if Flagg would sink or swim, then that's a fine test to give your rookie, but it doesn't seem like a viable long-term option with the way this team is constructed.\nIf the Mavericks had plans to tank this season, then sure, run Flagg at point guard -- let him just get the reps and don't worry about the wins and losses. The skills he'll develop at the position will certainly help him in the long run. But that's not the reality of this team. They traded Luka Dončić for Davis in hopes of winning a championship now. This isn't a roster built to tank, so balancing Flagg's development with the desire to compete this season is going to be a difficult tightrope to walk.The Mavericks signed D'Angelo Russell this past summer with the idea that he would be the starting point guard until Kyrie Irving got back, but Russell came off the bench on Wednesday. It was a bad night for Russell, just six points on 1 of 6 from the floor, but he's someone who can get things organized on offense. Having him in the starting lineup would take the pressure off Flagg, who could be that secondary ball-handler without having the sole responsibility of running the offense.Asking Flagg to be the point guard and play out of position feels like a massive ask for a rookie, especially on this specific team. He showed flashes in the third quarter of the type of player he can be, but the Mavericks have to put him in a position to succeed in order for him to put together more than a quarter's worth of a good game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 World Series will get underway on Friday night, when the Los Angeles Dodgers take on the Toronto Blue Jays. The Dodgers are looking to become MLB's first repeat champion in 25 years in what would serve as their third World Series win since 2020. The Blue Jays, conversely, are attempting to win their third title in franchise history, having previously won back-to-back championships in 1992-93.As part of CBS Sports' preview material, we asked our MLB staff for one bold prediction apiece. Do note that \"bold\" in this case does not mean something as (relatively) mundane as, say, Shohei Ohtani or Vladimir Guerrero Jr. recording a multi-homer game. No, these are supposed to be a little out there, a little aggressive. If you can't dream now, when can you?\nWith that in mind, let's have some fun together below.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2025 World Series bold predictionsR.J. Anderson: A walk-off ... caught stealing It's been 99 years since Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end a World Series on a busted hit-and-run play. Isn't baseball due for a sequel? Of course, neither of these teams is prone to running -- the Dodgers ranked 22nd in stolen bases during the regular season, the Blue Jays ranked 28th -- which is why I'll take this moment to remind everyone: \"bold\" is often another word for \"improbable.\" Maybe the Dodgers insert Justin Dean to pinch-run for Freddie Freeman or Will Smith, or maybe Toronto decides to send Myles Straw as part of a hit-and-run to leverage their high-contact ways. Whatever the case, my bold prediction is that one of the games in this series (and I hope there's seven in all) will end with a caught stealing.\nMike Axisa: The highest-scoring Fall Classic everI predict this will be one of the highest scoring World Series ever. It's two great offenses with a lot of power and also two shaky bullpens, which I figure means a lot of late-inning fireworks (good for impartial observers, bad for Blue Jays and Dodgers fans). Here are the highest scoring World Series:2002: 85 runs (Angels vs. Giants)1960: 82 runs (Pirates vs. Yankees)1997: 81 runs (Cleveland vs. Marlins)1993: 81 runs (Blue Jays vs. Phillies)1982: 72 runs (Brewers vs. Cardinals)The Dodgers' rotation could throw a wrench into this prediction, but that's what makes it bold, right? I think this will be only the fifth ever World Series with at least 80 runs scored between the two teams. If it goes the full seven games, that means we're talking at least 11.5 runs per game between the two teams.\n        \n            \n                World Series predictions: Expert picks for Dodgers vs. Blue Jays with MLB's Fall Classic finally set\n                \n                    Kate Feldman                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDayn Perry: The 27th out under further reviewI'll go with the MLB Doomsday Scenario being realized. By that I mean the final play of this World Series will be upheld on review. The result will be the same, but the celebration will be delayed while the review booth in New York has its look at things. The on-field call will stand as opposed to being confirmed, which will add a layer of ambiguity to it all. The awkwardness and the compromising of the championship moment will be subject to discourse and debate for much of the offseason in a most unwelcome manner. Ah well, such are the costs of doing business. \nMatt Snyder: A more conventional walk-offWe haven't had a walk-off clincher since 2001, when Luis Gonzalez singled up the middle against Mariano Rivera and the Yankees to seal the Diamondbacks' only World Series title. I've got the Dodgers in five, so let's say it happens again this year. In fact, of the 11 all-time series-clinching hits, only two have been home runs and I'll go with a third walk-off, World Series-clinching home run. Anyone remember the last one? Yep, it was the Blue Jays (Joe Carter in 1993; the other was Bill Mazeroski in 1960). This time, it'll come against the Blue Jays when the Dodgers walk the World Series off in Game 5 with a blast from Shohei Ohtani.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nearly 30 years ago, Steve Spurrier led Florida Gators to a national title. Now, the Gators are hoping the son of the \"Head Ball Coach\" can help the team's struggling offense for the remainder of the season. Florida interim coach Billy Gonzales told reporters Wednesday that Steve Spurrier Jr. will be more involved in the coaching of sophomore quarterback DJ Lagway in the lead up to the Gators' matchup with No. 5 Georgia on Nov. 1. Spurrier, who was hired as an offensive analyst earlier this year, will have a more hands-on role amid a staff reshuffling following the firing of Billy Napier over the weekend. \"What we're trying to do right now is tweak a couple things so we can put our players in a better situation to go out and make plays and perform at a higher level,\" Gonzales said, per The Associated Press. \"We all understand that's what we need to do. So that's the No. 1 goal for us as a coaching staff right now.\" \n        \n            \n                Steve Spurrier wants Florida coaching search focused on 'proven winner,' cites Lane Kiffin and Eli Drinkwitz\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe 54-year-old Spurrier's most recent coaching stops were at Tulsa (2023-24), Mississippi State (2020-22, Washington State (2018-19), Western Kentucky (2017) and Oklahoma (2016). He also spent a decade worker under his father at South Carolina in a variety of roles, including wide receivers coach, passing game coordinator and co-offensive coordinator. \nA wide receiver at Duke from 1989-1993, Spurrier was a graduate assistant under his father at Florida from 1994-98. During that span, the Gators went 54-8-1 that included a 12-1 record and national title in 1996. The younger Spurrier won his second national title in 2000 during his second of three seasons as Oklahoma's receivers coach under Bob Stoops. He then spent two years in the NFL while working on his father's staff in Washington before returning to the college coaching ranks. Spurrier will now try to help a Gators offense that is currently 105th in the nation in points per per game. He will specifically be tasked with helping Lagway, who has thrown nine touchdowns and an SEC-high nine interceptions during the Gators' first seven games. \n\"Whenever you're around one of the greatest offensive minds in history, it's obviously going to rub off on you as well,\" Gonzales said. \"He's been involved, but now he's going to have more of a role because he's going to be down there on the field with the quarterback looking in his eyes and getting a chance to talk to him and review the film that's being relayed. It's going to put us in a great situation to help DJ and the quarterbacks perform on the football field.\"The Gators improved to 3-4 with a 23-21 home win over Mississippi State last Saturday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Philadelphia 76ers rookie VJ Edgecombe got off to a historic start to his NBA career on Wednesday night in his team's 117-116 win over the Boston Celtics. Edgecombe finished with 34 points, seven rebounds and three assists and broke records previously held by LeBron James and Allen Iverson in the process. Edgecombe, the No. 3 overall pick out of Baylor, broke a 22-year-old record set by James when he scored 14 points in the first quarter. James previously had the record for first-quarter points in an NBA debut when he scored 12 back in 2003. And when Edgecombe scored his 31st and 32nd points with a bucket at the 5:37 mark of the fourth quarter, he broke the 76ers franchise record for most points scored in an NBA debut previously held by Iverson, who scored 30 in his first game in 1996.\"It was pretty good,\" 76ers coach Nick Nurse said. \"Opening night. I think that there was some space for him to shoot. ... I think he took some drives. Certainly a great start. There's tons of room and different things he needs to do. I'd like him to be a little more aggressive in the open floor. I think he really has that in his game. That's an amazing first-game performance. It really is.\"Edgecombe's 34 points were the most in an NBA debut since Wilt Chamberlain set the all-time record with 43 in 1959. Edgecombe is now third all-time for points scored in a debut behind Chamberlain's 43 and Frank Selvy, who scored 35 points in 1954.\n\"That's pretty good,\" Nurse said with a chuckle when learning where Edgecombe's performance ranks in NBA history. \"He has a good motor. He played a ton of minutes. We certainly needed the offense. He certainly looked pretty comfortable out there. I think that's probably what I've noticed the most about him. He seems to know what's going on out there for a young player. You don't see him making silly mistakes. He's just playing the right way. He's got a very good feel for the game. That's pretty cool, though. That's a neat list to get on.\"\nThe 76ers trailed by 11 points entering the fourth but surged back behind the efforts of Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey, who combined for 74 points in the win. However, it nearly unraveled when Edgecombe missed two free throws with 8.5 seconds remaining, allowing Boston to have a chance at the win. However, the Celtics weren't able to convert, and the 76ers held on for a dramatic win in their season opener. Edgecombe got the start on opening night next to Maxey in the backcourt along with Kelly Oubre Jr., Dom Barlow and Joel Embiid. The early returns for the 76ers new-look backcourt were promising. While Edgecombe was breaking records, Maxey also had a standout performance by scoring 40 points. That number tied Hal Greer for the most points scored in franchise history during a season-opener. Embiid, meanwhile, tallied only four points in 20 minutes and was not on the floor in the final minutes of the game. \nEdgecombe, a blue-chip recruit in the 2024 recruiting cycle, saw his draft stock soar during his first and only season at Baylor under Scott Drew. Edgecombe established himself as one of the most athletic players at the collegiate level and continued to improve throughout the season. The 76ers passed on Ace Bailey -- who was selected two picks later by the Utah Jazz -- and instead drafted Edgecombe with the third selection. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        While Aaron Rodgers took extra delight in beating the Jets back in Week 1, the Steelers quarterback has made it clear that the same energy doesn't apply to Sunday's game against the Packers, his other former team that he enjoyed a tremendous amount of success with during their 18-year partnership. \"I don't have any animosity toward the organization,\" Rodgers said. \"Obviously, I wish that things have been better in our last year there, but I have a great relationship with a lot of people still in that organization, and this is not a revenge game for me. I'm just excited to see some of those guys and be on 'Sunday Night Football.'\" Rodgers has a profound appreciation for his time in Green Bay and the things he and the Packers were able to accomplish. He does, however, wish that their time together had ended differently. After the Packers drafted his eventual successor -- Jordan Love -- in 2020, Rodgers responded with back-to-back MVP seasons while playing elite level ball. You could argue that Rodgers' play during that span was better than any quarterback in history, including his former teammate Brett Favre's impeccable three-year run from 1995-97 that included three consecutive league MVP awards. \nRodgers' success correlated to team success for the Packers, who won the NFC North both years as well as home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In the playoffs, however, Green Bay suffered heartbreaking home playoff losses to the eventual champion Buccaneers and the 49ers (Rodgers' childhood team), respectively. In 2022, Rodgers played all year despite playing most of the year with a broken thumb in his right throwing hand. Despite Rodgers' injury and a 5-8 record, the Packers won three straight games to put themselves in position to make the playoffs with a win over the visiting Lions in Week 18. The Lions won, however, eliminating the Packers from postseason contention in what was ultimately Rodgers' final game at Lambeau Field. \"Obviously would have loved to ride off in the sunset,\" Rodgers said. \"That's not the way the league goes sometimes. And you know, I knew the writing was on the wall when Jordan was picked. ... I knew at some point there would be a change, and if I wanted to play, it probably have to be elsewhere. So I understand the situation.\" \nWith the Steelers, Rodgers is on pace to have his best season since 2021, when he won his fourth and most recent league MVP as a member of the Packers.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Rodgers' desire to continue playing has led to Sunday night's showdown between his new team and his former one. For both teams, Sunday is a chance to keep their pole positions in their respective divisions. For Rodgers, he has a chance to become only the fifth quarterback in NFL history to beat all 32 NFL teams.A few years ago, Rodgers may have relished the chance to make history against the Packers. Now, however, the 41-year-old is simply appreciative of the fact that he gets to share the field with the team that he will be forever linked to one last time. \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" he said. \"I have a lot of great memories from my time. There lot of great interactions with fans over the years. You know, living in Green Bay, living in Suamico, living in Hobart, going to Chives, being out and about, seeing people at the Piggly Wiggly and I'm shopping for groceries.\n\"I grew up there. I spent 18 years there, from (age) 21 to 39. So I'm thankful for my time there.\" \n            ",

And what Wembanyama did next was, if you didn't actually see it with your own eyes, truly unbelievable. A 7-foot-5 human being took one dribble before launching into a cradling, up-and-under, damn-near double-pump reverse dunk ... in traffic ... on the opposite side of the rim. \"A figment of our basketball imaginations!\" was the early submission for call of the year from ESPN's play-by-play announcer Ryan Ruocco, and honestly, those are the only words that could have come close to sufficing in that moment. It was a perfect call for what might be an honest-to-god perfect basketball player. \nWords like \"unbelievable\" get thrown around in NBA parlance too easily. Usually it's not an actual unbelievable play that's being described -- at least not for athletes of this caliber. But let me tell you something, that was unbelievable. Frankly, Wembanyama's entire night was unbelievable. Dude went for 40 points on 15-for-21 shooting, plus 15 rebounds, three blocks and was a game-high plus-31 in just 29 minutes. \nOf course, we've seen numbers like that before on their own. Combined, however, is another story. Wembanyama is the first player since the 1977-78 NBA/ABA merger to record 40 points and 15 rebounds while shooting 70% from the field with zero turnovers. But forget the numbers. What we saw on Wednesday night can't be quantified on a stat sheet. This was, and is, athletic evolution personified, a human skyscraper snatching shots out of the air like a dinosaur picking fruit -- casually reaching over, and violently dunking on, some of the largest men on the planet as if they were schoolboys, pushing the ball in transition and whipping no-look passes to the corner, all while sinking step-back four-point plays and one-footed kiss shots off the glass and generally operating with the footwork and ball skills of a 6-foot point guard. Before Victor Wembanyama, film like this didn't exist. \nI don't even know where to begin with this, but perhaps I should've have started with the fact that he was doing this against Anthony Davis, maybe the best defensive big man in the world not named Wembanyama. Davis had four fouls in the first half trying to keep up with Wembanyama. He was helpless. If you watched the full highlight reel above then you already saw this, but just in case you didn't, look at this shake down Wemby put on Davis. \nCome on, man. You can't play better defense than that and it didn't matter one bit. I had Wembanyama ranked No. 5 in this season's Top 100 players and that already feels laughably low. It has always been a matter of time until Wembanyama becomes the best player in the world, of course, but nobody thought that time would come this soon. Maybe it hasn't. Maybe this was one game. But maybe not. In fact, I'd lean toward the latter. The marriage of this level of skill with this kind of size is a forgone basketball conclusion. I have never seen anything like this. Nobody has. I don't care if you grew up with Wilt Chamberlain or if you think Ralph Sampson would've been this had he come up in this era.However you slice it, this is entirely new. And the dude is only 21 years old. Unbelievable. Literally, unbelievable. Victor Wembanyama, man. The basketball world is yours. \n            ",

    "description": "\n        You really don't appreciate a point guard until you don't have one. Just ask the Houston Rockets, who lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 125-",
    "body": "\n        You really don't appreciate a point guard until you don't have one. Just ask the Houston Rockets, who lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 125-124, in double overtime on Tuesday in a game it felt like they would have won had Fred VanVleet been on the floor to organize composed, consistent offensive sets.   But they didn't have VanVleet, and they're not going to for the rest of the year due to his torn ACL. To whatever degree one game can be any sort of reliable future indicator, they're going to need to figure this out.   First, some qualifiers:  Despite their offense looking equals parts chaotic and cramped for the better part of the game, the Rockets still managed to convert enough tough buckets, and secure enough offensive rebounds (16!), to lead for most of the game against the defending champs. Alperen Sengun was out of his mind with 39 points. Kevin Durant made a bunch of highly contested shots look easy, as he does. Amen Thompson looked terrific getting downhill and initiating leveraged contact to create comfortable finishing space, especially when he was provided a runway. Jabari Smith Jr. made a number of high-stakes/bailout shots. The Rockets were playing against the best defense in the basketball world. Sure, Jalen Williams was out, but all that meant was more Cason Wallace, who is an absolute dog on the ball. Houston is not going to face this kind of pressure on a nightly basis, and as such, it surely won't look this out of sorts moving forward. It was the first game of the season (this warrants constant repeating) and they're trying to integrate a brand-new superstar in Durant, who likes the ball in particular places and in stationary positions that don't necessarily lend themselves to full-floor space creation. The Rockets are not going to be a great movement offense and will, generally speaking, have to do their damage ugly -- with sheer size and difficult individual shot-making. Still, Houston turned the ball over on an abysmal 22% of its possessions (24 total) and scored just 109.7 points per 100 possessions, per Cleaning the Glass, which would've ranked as the fourth-worst offense in the league last season. Starved for basically any breathing room all night, they found themselves operating out of a phone booth into which three people were seemingly crammed.   \tThis is why you need a point guards. They relieve their teammates of pressure they're generally not equipped to handle over the course of full possessions. They create initial advantages, forcing the defense into rotation out of pick-and-roll or just their own skillful ball-handling, and then the domino effect takes over as the defense finds itself, well, on defense.   \t\nWithout a point guard to get the car out of the barn and onto a clear stretch of road, a defense like Oklahoma City can turn offensive and start to attack the space of secondary ball-handlers forced into primary positions.   \tLook how much trouble Houston has simply getting a regular possession started in the clip below. Sengun, a 7-foot center, is the initial ball-handler, but as soon as Alex Caruso presses up on him in the backcourt, he can't get rid of it fast enough to Tari Eason. He looks totally overwhelmed by the pressure he's facing and nearly loses his dribble before flinging a desperate pass backwards to Reed Sheppard, who finds himself pinned on the half-court line.   \tBy the time Sheppard gets it back to Sengun 40 feet from the basket, the shot clock is at 10 seconds and they haven't even started the possession. From there, nothing gets any easier. Watch how hard Durant has to fight just to catch the ball at the 3-point line with Caruso suffocating every inch of space and just four seconds to figure out a way to pull a shot out of thin air -- which he does because he's Kevin Durant, but this is not a shot even one of the greatest shot-makers in history can survive on consistently.   \t\nIt's true, this is why the Rockets got Durant. To make shots like this. Which he's going to have to do plenty of on a Houston team that started two centers on Tuesday and generally lacks for shooters. Spacing is not going to be a luxury in Houston. Still, it can't be this hard to initiate basic offense. These guys are fighting for their lives just to wind up with a 27% 3-point shooter flinging up a corner 3 as the shot clock is about to expire.   \t\nSengun, as mentioned, was brilliant. And as big men go, he's a supremely skilled ball-handler. But he's not a point guard, and if you're going to ask him to handle the ball and create advantages at the top of the offense against good defensive teams off the dribble, you're going to end up with a lot of this.   \tMeanwhile, the aforementioned Sheppard is supposed to be one of the guys to step in for VanVleet, and he was having genuine trouble even getting the ball past halfcourt cleanly.   \t\nHere again, with less than a minute to play in double overtime and the game tied at 122, Sheppard dribbles from side to side without ever creating any forward progress. Finally, he's stuck 35 feet from the basket and has to lob a pass even farther from the basket to Durant, who is being mugged by Lu Dort. Turnover.   \tThis was literally the first pass of the possession. We're not talking about a situation where the ball moved side to side and a couple guys attacked closeouts and the OKC defense just kept rotating and moving its feet cutting it all off. This was the first pass. As an NBA team, if you can't even get a possession started, you're signing up for bailout shots at the end.   \tAnd again, Durant and Sengun are capable of making a lot of those. Durant can shoot over anyone and Sengun is a bull in a china shop against mismatches. The fact that they converted over 50% of their 40 combined shots in the opener, given the difficulty of their diet, bordered on miraculous. And the Rockets still functioned like a bottom-five offense.   \t\nIt bears repeating they were playing one of the best defenses ever, and a lot of the credit goes to the Thunder. But what happens when Sengun and Durant aren't rescuing these clunky possessions? It's early, of course. Houston is going to be very good and can probably use a lot of the regular season to figure some of this stuff out without compromising too much playoff positioning.But at the end of the day, barring a trade, the Rockets are without a natural point guard. And that could be a serious problem for a team that expects to contend for a championship.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Big 12 has been the most unpredictable conference in college football over the past several years, and the title race is once again up in the air. Prohibitive favorite Texas Tech lost a stunner against Arizona State, opening the door for several others.Heading into the month of November last year, there were nine Big 12 teams technically alive for the Big 12 title because of tiebreakers. Four teams tied for first place at the end of the year, with Arizona State beating out Iowa State for a Big 12 title and College Football Playoff appearance. It's worth noting the conference has produced a brand-new participant in the Big 12 Championship Game in seven of the last eight years. Four of the five teams with one or fewer losses in conference play would be first-time participants. The Big 12 chaos wheel keeps turning. Here's how we handicap every school in the Big 12 title race, from top contenders to bottom of the barrel. \n\n        \n            \n                CBS Sports 136: Texas A&M, Alabama rise into top five amid shakeup in college football rankings\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe top contendersTexas Tech (6-1, 3-1): Despite looking mortal in a loss to Arizona State last week, Texas Tech remains the team to beat in the Big 12. The defensive line has exceeded all expectations as linebackers David Bailey and Jacob Rodriguez both earned Midseason All-America honors. With quarterback Behren Morton healthy, this is still the best team in the Big 12, but he needs to get healthy. BYU (7-0, 4-0): The Cougars have played one of the easiest schedules in the Big 12, but a win over Utah last weekend vaulted them into the top group. There's a marquee matchup with Texas Tech on Nov. 8 and road trips to Iowa State and Cincinnati, but even 1-2 in those games should be enough to reach Arlington. Arizona State (5-2, 3-1): The Sun Devils' 2025 season is eerily similar to their 2024 campaign, down to losing big without quarterback Sam Leavitt in the lineup. However, Leavitt's 319-yard return against Texas Tech helps push them back towards the contender pile with only one loss. The schedule is tricky from here on out, but not impossible, and the tiebreaker against Texas Tech is huge. While Texas Tech remains the prohibitive betting favorite on FanDuel, the Sun Devils now have the second-best odds to win the Big 12.\nJust need one breakCincinnati (6-1, 4-0): The Bearcats have been the surprise team of the Big 12 season, and perhaps belong in the top group. Cincinnati was a near-comeback against Nebraska away from an undefeated start. The trenches have been the star of the show, led by All-American Dontay Corleone and FCS transfer Joe Cotton. Games against Baylor and Utah in the next two weeks can cement their contender status. Utah (5-2, 2-2): The Utes are a high quality team, perhaps third-best in the Big 12. The problem? The Utes have tiebreaking losses to both Texas Tech and BYU through the first seven games, along with a matchup remaining against No. 21 Cincinnati. Tiebreaker math just isn't on their side. Houston (6-1, 3-1): Willie Fritz wins everywhere he goes, but he has outdone himself with this instant rebuild at Houston. The Cougars have already clinched their first bowl trip since joining the Big 12, and have plenty of potential wins left on the schedule. That said, Houston has been a little streaky offensively, but there's another level there. \nIowa State (5-2, 2-2): After a fantastic start, the Cyclones lost head-scratching road games against Cincinnati and Colorado in recent weeks. Now, they play No. 11 BYU, No. 24 Arizona State and on the road against TCU in the next three games. It's a frustrating way to whiff on what could have been a historic season. Outside looking inTCU (5-2, 2-2): The Horned Frogs' inconsistency has reared its head over the past few weeks, including a 13-point loss to Kansas State on the road. The schedule ahead has many pitfalls, including at No. 11 BYU, Iowa State and No. 21 Cincinnati. The Frogs likely still control their own destiny, but it's a rough road. Baylor (4-3, 2-2): Baylor has underwhelmed after lofty expectations to start the year, and needed strokes of luck just to outlast SMU and Kansas State. A struggling defensive line has led to them ranking amongst the worst defensive units in college football, but a stacked offense at least gives them a chance every week. \nKansas State (3-4, 2-2): Beating UCF served as a get-right game, and the Wildcats have turned things on over the last three games. But the early season woes are still dragging Kansas State down, and a blocked 57-yard field goal against Baylor prevents them from having a realistic path to contention. Kansas (4-3, 2-2): Quarterback Jalon Daniels has been everything that was promised, but the defense has cost the Jayhawks games. There are plenty of 50-50 games ahead, but none are more important than the Sunflower Showdown against Kansas State this week. Working through thingsArizona (4-3, 1-3): Outside of a game against Oklahoma State, the Wildcats have played a brutal Big 12 schedule. Even still, they beat Kansas State in nonconference and played BYU and Houston to within six points. The Wildcats are a much more competent football team in 2025 under Brent Brennan, and the resurgence of Noah Fifita has been a welcome change. \nColorado (3-4, 1-3): The Buffaloes have been inconsistent, but the team has been well coached and given themselves a chance in every game. Colorado shocked Iowa State and took BYU to the wire. The schedule is brutal, but a bowl game could be in sight. UCF (4-3, 1-3): The Knights have shown some promising signs under first-year coach Scott Frost. The headliner was a 45-13 decimation of lowly West Virginia, but close games against Cincinnati and Kansas show that the program has clearly taken a step. Assuming a win against Oklahoma State, they just need to pull an upset against Baylor or Houston to return to the postseason. Battle for lastWest Virginia (2-5, 0-4): Rich Rodriguez got his revenge against Pittsburgh in Week 3, and the wheels have fully flown off since. The Mountaineers have been outscored by 111 points in four Big 12 games, including a 45-13 loss to UCF last week. If the Mountaineers finish winless, it will be the first such conference campaign for WVU since 1960. \nOklahoma State (1-6, 0-4): The Cowboys are comically bad, but the vibes have gone up tremendously under interim coach Doug Meacham. According to SP+, the Cowboys rank behind FCS Monmouth and just ahead of Division II Ferris State in quality. Neat! \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With nearly 30 shots, a goal from Jude Bellingham and a victory, a quick glance would make it seem like Real Madrid's 1-0 win against Juventus in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday was a simple job well done as their near-perfect start to the season continues. The actual 90 minute experience, though, was a mixed bag for Los Blancos, who swapped efficiency for unevenness in a performance that was ultimately a balance of lucky and unlucky moments.The good news for Xabi Alonso's side is that the manager's personnel choices paid off, even if the reward felt like something out of Carlo Ancelotti's version of Real Madrid than the new look Alonso is trying to instill. Vinicius Junior has almost been relegated to a secondary role for Los Blancos these days as Alonso rotates through his options but in the moment the team finally broke through and bagged the game's lone goal, it was because Vinicius' individual brilliance was on full display. He did not receive credit for a goal or an assist but he did just about everything else, expertly outmaneuvering a handful of Juventus defenders and finding a hint of space to take a nearly perfect shot that ended up hitting the goalpost. Bellingham pounced to ensure Vinicius' work was not in vain, and that the most excellent moment of the match was not wasted.\nIt might be enough for Vinicius to regain his status as a central figure in Real Madrid's attack in time for Sunday's Clasico, even if the honor of being the focal point has been reserved for Kylian Mbappe. His growing habit of turning up when Los Blancos need him most, though, is an important antidote to the team's overall performance on Wednesday, which was especially drab in the first half.\nJuventus' defense managed to shut out Alonso's side completely before the break as Madrid put just four of their 14 shots on target, the hosts' star-studded attack stringing together very few meaningful chances. Between Madrid's 14 shots in the first half and Juventus' three, only two of those opportunities were taken from less than 10 yards away from the goal, the extremes of the visitors' game plan apparent in the fact that Eder Militao led Los Blancos' in shots in the first half with four.The performance only reinforced the need for Vinnicius' individual brilliance to break things up, though the openness of the second half was something Juventus provided to Real Madrid rather than the other way around. With the score 0-0 at the break, Igor Tudor's side changed their approach completely – they went from three shots and 0.08 expected goals in the first half to 10 shots in the second. Naturally, it was a set-up that favored Alonso's side – 14 second half shots is not much better than Juventus' 10 but Madrid generated 1.74 expected goals along the way while the visitors were limited to just 0.51. The scoreline only favored Juventus as much as it did because goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio managed several impressive saves in the second half. Madrid did need Thibaut Courtois' help in the early stages of the second half, though, the teams sharing good luck and bad even if they did not share the points.\nEven in the midst of an uninspiring performance, there is a hint of good news for Real Madrid in the short-term – there is no scenario in which Barcelona pose the same threat as Juventus, the high line a fixture of Hansi Flick's style of play no matter the downsides. Wednesday's narrow win, though, may have just provided a blueprint for different teams to cancel out Real Madrid's all-star attack and hope the risk of an uber-defensive approach pays off for them, even if it did not for the Italian side in the Champions League.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys explosive linebacker DeMarvion Overshown is back... at practice. The 25-year-old, who tore his ACL in the 2023 preseason as a rookie and then his ACL again, MCL and PCL on Thanksgiving last year, returned to practice on Wednesday in a limited capacity. Overshown went through individual position drills and then more conditioning with him treating the practices right now as his version of training camp.  \"Ain't God good man. He is. He is. It's a blessing just to be out there. Been watching for 300-plus days now. So when you [are] a guy like me that football is more than just a game to you, it's a way of life, you play with a passion and that energy. When you're able to do it again, you never take it for granted,\" Overshown said.He plans to make his debut as the first Cowboy to wear the jersey No. 0 in a game after Dallas' bye in Week 11 at the Las Vegas Raiders on \"Monday Night Football.\"\"That game, I mean, that's what we're looking like. Monday night prime time. Zero will be making his debut. I'm excited for it. It's not going to be anything short of extraordinary,\" Overshown said. \"I'm ready to show truly how blessed I am. A lot of people claim that this knee injury is one of the worst of the worst and not too many people come back the same afterward. I'm ready to put that to the test.\"\nBelieve it or not, Overshown felt like he was capable of moving around and doing everything right as Cowboys training camp kicked off at the end of July. Now, his process is more general conditioning than it is physical therapy-specific workouts. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 8 NFL picks: Cowboys beat Broncos in shootout, Packers spoil Aaron Rodgers' revenge game\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Really before training camp. I kind of got an idea of where I should be just from the first knee injury. So once I got to that five, six-month period, it's like 'alright I should be doing a little bit of moving.' Once I start moving around, it's like 'I'm going to be good.' It's a confidence thing and [a] mind thing at that point,\" Overshown said. \"My knee is healed, now it's learning how to run again, learning how to be an NFL football player again. Because you know you don't just wake up and do that overnight after being on a walker. I feel like for about four months I've been comfortable with my knee. It's just been getting into football ready shape.\"Overshown is a player whose game is built around eye-popping athleticism, and he feels like his signature burst will be even better when he does take the field in a live game in November despite returning from a gruesome injury. \n\"I'm stronger, and we've got the numbers to prove it. But stronger, faster, jump higher, more explosive. You name it, I'm all of it. My game, it's not going to slow down. I think one of the worst things I heard over my rehab time was, 'Man, you've got to slow down. We need you to play a full season. You've got to slow down.' But that ain't how I play,\" Overshown said. \"I know how to play one way, and that's 100, full speed and that's all you're going to see. So the knee is stronger than strong.\"    \nThe energy Overshown has already shown in practice and throughout his rehab has caught the eyes of teammates, especially new Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens who can't wait to see Overshown in a game up close for the first time.\"D-Mo is another type of deal that I've never seen, especially at the linebacker position. He can do everything, so I haven't ever seen that -- let alone all the highlights,\" Pickens said Wednesday. \"I'm kind of ready to see it in real time. ... He's got different swag. I told you he's a different type of dude. I'm just waiting to see it in person because it's my first year here.\"\nHow Overshown could provide Parsons-like impact for Dallas' defenseDallas' defense hasn't been nearly as productive pressuring opposing quarterbacks, sacking opposing quarterbacks or in any defensive metric across the board than they have been in years past with All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons being traded away to the Green Bay Packers. The 2025 Cowboys defense under new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus ranks bottom five in the NFL in multiple defensive metrics including being dead last in total defense (401.6 total yards per game allowed), pass defense (260.3 passing yards per game allowed) and third down defense (51.6% third down conversion rate allowed). It's not entirely surprising given the Cowboys defense had the NFL's highest expected points added (EPA) per play when Parsons was on the field (0.08) from 2021-2024 and the NFL's lowest EPA per play when Parsons was off the field (-0.04) in the same span, per CBS Sports Research.Cowboys defense this seasonStatsNFL RanksPoints per game allowed29.4 29thTotal yards allowed401.6LastYards per play allowed6.130thPass yards per game allowed260.3  LastRush yards per game allowed 141.330thThird-down conversion rate allowed51.6% LastQB pressure rate39.9% 11thSacks15T-14thPasser rating allowed110.6 31stTakeaways6T-23rdZone coverage rate81.9% 4thMan coverage rate13.5% 29thBlitz rate25.4%21stHowever, the Cowboys could see a noticeable uptick in production with his electrifying athleticism back on the field. In Week 1 of the 2024 season at the Cleveland Browns, Overshown's first game back after his first ACL tear, he exploded to sack quarterback Deshaun Watson in 2.8 seconds and beat Parsons to the spot. That blew the All-Pro's mind and had him declaring big things about Overshown's future, saying he would become an All-Pro like him. \n\"I don't even know what happened,\" Parsons said last season. \"I'm going to tell you. I was like, 'Bro, you're gonna have people who think you're faster than me now.' I say, 'I can't take any more breaks. That's what those fresh legs are getting you.' He's [Overshown] so fast. He's explosive, though. I told him after the game how proud I was of him. ... He's coming downhill with intent with everything. He's one of the most exciting players that I've seen. I think he's going to be an All-Pro player.\"  \nSeeing what Overshown can be as a pass rusher, there's already a tried and true method for him to join Parsons in the All-Pro ranks. Like Overshown, Parsons began his career playing primarily out of the inside linebacker spot, 55.2% of his snaps as a rookie according to Pro Football Focus. Micah Parsons' Cowboys defensive snap alignment, 2021-2023202120222023Defensive Line41.3%81.1%87.2%Linebacker55.2%18.1%12.7%Defensive Back3.5%0.8%0.1%*Data according to Pro Football FocusIf Dallas were to ease Overshown into playing more as an edge rusher along the line of scrimmage, there's a chance that type of positional switch could lead to similar results to Parsons' given both have elite athleticism. Overshown also has enough knowledge of Eberflus' playbook after attaching himself at the hip to the DC and taking charge in team meetings. It's a change the Cowboys' edge rusher group needs: Dallas' top two leaders in quarterback pressures through seven weeks are their two defensive tackles, Kenny Clark (23) and Osa Odighizuwa (20).\"I'm just going to do what I know I can do. When I get in between those lines, the sky's the limit for me. I'm not saying that to be cocky or anything, but I know what I bring to the field,\" Overshown said. \"Hearing things and seeing like, 'Oh, we need D-Mo to be this when he comes back,' or 'We need D-Mo to do this,' I am not worried about [that]. I know what I bring to the table. I know what y'all saw last year and I know y'all going to get more of that. So it's really no stress and no pressure on me to go back out and do anything. I know what I'm capable of. Last year was still me just getting my feet wet, so still really [we] haven't seen what all I can do.\"\n            ",

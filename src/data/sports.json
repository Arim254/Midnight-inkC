    "body": "\n        The Mountain West and the MAC collide in the 2025 Frisco Bowl as the UNLV Rebels (10-3) take on the Ohio Bobcats (8-4). UNLV finished second in the Mountain West after losing to Boise State in the conference title game. Ohio, which has the second-longest active bowl win streak (6), finished tied for second in the regular-season MAC standings, but didn't hold the tiebreaker to qualify for the conference title game. Ohio dismissed head coach Brian Smith on Dec. 17 for what the school deemed \"serious professional misconduct\" and the Bobcats will be led by interim John Hauser in this game. Ohio was 6-6 against the spread this season, while UNLV was 7-6 ATS.Kickoff from Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas is at 9 p.m. ET. The Rebels are 6.5-point favorites in the latest UNLV vs. Ohio odds, while the over/under is 64.5, the highest total listed this college football postseason.

Hawaii (8-4) enters in off a 27-7 victory over Wyoming and is 5-4 all-time in its namesake bowl. The Golden Bears enter the 2025 Hawaii Bowl leading the all-time series between the programs, 2-1.

His counterpart, Micah Alejado, leads the Mountain West in passing yards per game and has 3 passing scores in five of his last seven games.

    "body": "\n        Eight 2025-26 college football bowl games and four playoff matchup are in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are more than 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 15.5-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday, Dec. 31. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5).

USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on injured reserve Tuesday, ending his 2025 season and potentially his tenure with the franchise. Fields missed the last three games with a knee injury that coach Aaron Glenn said did not heal in a timely enough fashion for the signal-caller to return to the field this year.Fields started for the Jets for the majority of the season before ceding his job to Tyrod Taylor. The latter has been dealing with a pair of injuries of his own, which opened the door for Brady Cook to make back-to-back starts the last two weeks. Cook, an undrafted rookie, projects to remain in the lineup for Sunday's divisional game against the New England Patriots.While Fields was inactive for the last three games, he was designated last week as the Jets' emergency quarterback.\"We're gonna put Justin on IR,\" Glenn said. \"We tried to see how we can get this to work, but it wasn't getting as better as we would like it. We want to make sure we get a focus on that to make sure we get him better.\"\nFields said last week that he underwent an MRI on the injured knee and that the imaging revealed an issue that would keep him out on a \"week-to-week\" basis. The injury occurred in practice ahead of the Dec. 7 loss to the Miami Dolphins.The IR designation closes the book on Fields' season and leaves him with a 2-7 record as the Jets' starter. It was an up-and-down year for the former first-round pick wherein the lows were tremendously low and the high points were few and far between. Fields threw for fewer than 55 yards in four of his nine starts and in Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills completed just three of his 11 pass attempts in one of the worst games by an NFL quarterback this season.Although he threw just one interception on the year, Fields was highly inefficient in completing 62.7% of his passes for 1,259 yards. He did make an impact as a ballcarrier, though, rushing for 383 yards and four touchdowns.\nWill Justin Fields return to the Jets in 2026?Fields signed with the Jets last spring on a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million guaranteed. While he remains under contract through 2026, it became clear this season that he is unlikely to be part of the team's long-term plans, and both sides could likely benefit from parting ways at the end of the year.Adding to the likelihood that Fields and the Jets break up before the 2026 season is the fact that New York will receive an early-first round draft pick and could use it on a quarterback. Unless they feel as though Cook could develop into a capable starter, the leader of their 2026 offense is probably not yet on their roster.The Jets would incur $22 million in dead cap space if they cut Fields after the season. Fields could command interest on the trade market as a backup, though, and still possesses upside as a potential post-hype breakout candidate in the right situation.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        While the Italian Serie A will be back on the weekend after the Christmas holidays, it's almost time to get into the 2026 winter transfer win",
    "body": "\n        While the Italian Serie A will be back on the weekend after the Christmas holidays, it's almost time to get into the 2026 winter transfer window. Most of the top Italian clubs are likely to explore options in the upcoming transfer window, especially given how difficult it usually is to find good opportunities in January. AC Milan have already secured a new striker, while Juventus need to find a solution for their striker in the new year, and Inter will look for a new right winger considering the injury and the contract situation of Denzel Dumfries. Let's take a look at five Christmas presents for five Serie A sides: AC Milan: The first signing of the windowAC Milan needed a striker as soon as possible and the Rossoneri have already signed Niclas Füllkrug from West Ham as the German player will be eligible to play the match against Cagliari on Jan. 2. Füllkrug joined the Rossoneri on loan with a $12 million buy option included in the deal, adding depth to the attacking unit coached by Massimiliano Allegri, which has been deeply affected by injuries in recent months. USMNT star Christian Pulisic, Rafael Leao, and Santiago Giménez have all dealt with fitness issues, with the Mexican striker in particular undergoing surgery in recent weeks and potentially leaving the club during the winter transfer window. AC Milan needed a central striker considering that Allegri is currently playing with two strikers, with Pulisic and Leao alternating with Christopher Nkunku, who joined AC Milan in the summer from Chelsea, and Füllkrug was the first and only option explored by the Italian club. AS Roma: Joshua Zirkzee back to Italy?While AC Milan signed a new striker before Christmas, AS Roma are also advancing in talks to sign Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee on loan until the end of the 2025-26 season, according to reports. The Giallorossi manager Gian Piero Gasperini expressed his concerns after the Juventus defeat over the last weekend regarding his attacking options, as both Evan Ferguson and Artem Dovbyk are not performing as he was hoping and needs a new striker to play alongside Paulo Dybala and Matias Soule. AS Roma, despite a promising start to the season under their new manager, have shown attacking struggles. They currently boast the best defense in Serie A but also share the worst attacking record among the top 10 teams alongside Lazio with 17 goals scored in 16 matches. This is why they need to improve their attacking options. \nInter: A new right wingerMeanwhile, Inter need a new right winger in 2026. This is why the future of the Dutch winger Denzel Dumfries is more than in doubt. Dumfries has a $25 million release clause valid in the summer and the expectation is that multiple European clubs will try to trigger it after the 2026 World Cup, where he's expected to be be one of the stars with the Netherlands. For that reason, Dumfries recently decided to change his agent, a move that often means that he's looking for either a new contract or a new club. On top of it, he's currently injured and after undergoing surgery on his ankle in London, and he will be out for at least two more months. In his absence, Luis Henrique, Carlos Augusto, and occasionally Andy Diouf will be tasked with filling the role. For this reason, should a good opportunity arise, Inter are likely to pursue a new signing in that role.Fiorentina: Happy with what you haveIf there is a team to watch in the next weeks, that's Fiorentina. The Viola are in a unprecedented and difficult situation as they are at the bottom of the Serie A standings with nine points and only one win in 16 matches. They are seriously risking getting relegated and have already replaced the manager, with Paolo Vanoli replacing Stefano Pioli earlier this season. This situation can lead some players to leave in the winter transfer window but Fiorentina need them to stay to avoid relegation. This is why the best Christmas gift for Fiorentina would be to keep all the best players at least until the summer. \nJuventus: A new contract for VlahovicLast but not least, Juventus need to solve the situation regarding their main striker in 2026. Dusan Vlahovic will be out of contract in the summer and there are now increasing chances to see him leaving as a free agent in 2026 unless something changes before then. Juventus struggled to find a solution last summer, failing to either sell him or reach an agreement on a new contract. There is no more time to lose; this is something they need to take care of as soon as possible, with the striker averaging 16.3 goals per season the last three campaigns. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson remembers his last trip to the Rose Bowl with the Crimson Tide fondly. Two years ago, a few days prior to Alabama's loss to Michigan in the College Football Playoff semifinal, Simpson recalls meeting with then-coach Nick Saban about his plan for the rest of his career following two seasons as a backup.Simpson was eyeing a potential jump to the transfer portal before Saban changed his mind the only way he knew how.\"He said, 'I get it if you want to leave, but I know you, and I know what you wanted in recruiting. If you want to create value for yourself and you want to be a first-round draft pick, this could be a great story for you. You could leave a legacy here,'\" Simpson said, referring to Saban, on the 'Bussin' With The Boys' podcast this week. \"I thought about it, prayed about it, and said, you know what? You're right. And the next thing you know, he retires. I'm sitting there, and I'm like, he just lied to me\"But also as a coach's son, I understand. I understand what was going on. I understand how he thought about it. We had a good conversation about it, and to this day, we laugh about it.\"\nSaban announced his retirement from Alabama 10 days after the Crimson Tide's loss to the eventual-national champion Wolverines, but Simpson skipped an opportunity to leave to stay with the team.Crowned the starter this season as a fourth-year junior in Kalen DeBoer's second year, Simpson has thrown for 3,500 yards and 28 touchdowns entering next week's showdown with unbeaten and top-ranked Indiana.Simpson's first spring with DeBoer in 2024 was reassuring that he made the right decision to stick around following Saban's retirement. \n\"Just got to play ball. It was free. It was offensive-minded and not defensive-minded,\" Simpson said during the podcast episode published Tuesday. \"Honestly, it probably was better for my development in a sort of way, just because it wasn't -- honestly, because I could just play. The only reps that I got was some in a game, some in the South Florida game, but it was all defensive-minded reps. I had to prove to myself that I could actually play. I knew I could do it, whether it was in high school or practice, or during a game or a live-action scrimmage, I needed to prove to myself that I could.\"Coach DeBoer, that's all we did during the spring. 'Y'all just go play man. Just go do you.' Honestly, I took a huge step.\"Simpson's \"steps\" thereafter have led to first-round buzz for the 2026 NFL Draft as one of the nation's top prospects under center. And according to DraftKings Sportsbook's latest odds, Simpson is at +1800 to go No. 1 overall.\nEarlier this season, Simpson said he met with Saban before Alabama's opener to help ease some of the anxiety brought with the pressure of being the Crimson Tide's QB1. And after losing the game at Florida State, Simpson led Alabama to wins in 10 of its next 12 games prior to the SEC Championship loss to Georgia and a last weekend's first-round playoff victory at Oklahoma.\n            ",

He finished the Week 16 win against the New York Jets with one pass for 38 yards and a touchdown, 12 carries for 42 yards on the ground and four receptions for 36 yards. The victory wasn't just significant because it put him in the record books, it could also be the last game he plays in New Orleans.Hill's contract is set to void this offseason and he faces an uncertain future following road games against the Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons to conclude 2025. \"My wife asked me that this morning,\" he said, before excusing himself as he began to get choked up, \"And I didn't really feel any type of way this morning, but as I was driving to the stadium today, you start to think about the last nine years, and what it's meant to me and my family and this city. I think for me personally you just try to take it all in. I've had a great experience here tonight. I don't know what the future holds for me but it was a special day for me and my family.\"\nThe undrafted player will hold a unique place in Saints history regardless of the future and while he wasn't focused on the record he broke, he admitted he was aware of it.\"Moments like these cause me to be reflective,\" Hill said. \"My overall feeling is one of gratitude. This organization, this city, has been so good to me.\"\nDespite a wide range of emotions and questions on his next move, Hill said the main focus is on the rest of the season, saying he will \"tackle the rest of that as we get down the road.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nIt wasn't long ago that the Los Angeles Rams repeating as NFC West champions seemed like a lock. But as the 2025 NFL season has proven time and again, situations can change in an instant.The Rams were rolling at 9-2 but squandered a fourth-quarter lead against the Carolina Panthers in Week 13 and dropped a 31-28 decision, ending their six-game winning streak. The Seattle Seahawks routed the Minnesota Vikings 26-0 that day to pull even with Los Angeles atop the division and both clubs won their next two contests, setting up a huge showdown in Week 16.Having already beaten the Seahawks at home in Week 11, the Rams could have taken a major step toward securing their 16th NFC West title by sweeping the season series. However, they let a 16-point lead with just over eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter slip away and were unable to stop Seattle after beginning overtime with a touchdown, allowing the Seahawks to post a 38-37 victory and climb into the driver's seat in the division.Los Angeles (11-4) still can capture the NFC West crown -- and even the No. 1 seed in the conference -- but it first will need help this Sunday from either the Panthers or Chicago Bears -- or both. Carolina hosts Seattle (12-3) and Chicago visits the San Francisco 49ers (11-4), who own the tiebreaker with the Rams. If the Seahawks and 49ers both win their Week 17 matchups, it would render Los Angeles' meeting with the Atlanta Falcons (6-9) at 8:15 p.m. ET on Monday Night Football meaningless when it comes to the division title.\nHowever, the door would remain open for Los Angeles with a loss by at least one of its division rivals. The Rams then would need to defeat Atlanta -- as well as the Arizona Cardinals in their regular-season finale -- and have whichever team won in Week 17 lose in the Week 18 showdown between Seattle and San Francisco.It may seem like a tall order, but the Seahawks are on the road Sunday against a Carolina team that is battling the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the NFC South title and the 49ers host a Chicago squad that may require a victory to clinch the NFC North and also is in contention for the No. 1 seed in the conference. With much at stake for both the Panthers and Bears, winning in Week 17 will be anything but an easy task for Seattle and San Francisco.On the other hand, while a win is never a given in the NFL, the Rams have a much easier job ahead of them. Atlanta has posted back-to-back victories after losing seven of its previous eight games, but one of those triumphs came against Arizona last week. That defeat was the seventh in a row and 12th in 13 contests for the Cardinals, who got off to a promising 2-0 start this season.Even if the Rams receive the help they need on Sunday, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team believes their outlook for a second straight NFC West title wouldn't improve a great deal with a victory on Monday Night Football. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, Los Angeles currently has about a 22% chance to win the division, and it would only improve by around 10% with a triumph over Atlanta.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC WESTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 17 WINWITH WEEK 17 LOSSDIFFERENCELos Angeles Rams22.1%32.4%0.0%32.4%Seattle Seahawks49.0%63.6%24.3%39.3%San Francisco 49ers28.9%44.9%7.0%37.9%The model also believes that the team that finishes first in the NFC West will be the top-seeded playoff team in the conference as well. CHANCES TO BE NO. 1 SEED IN NFCTEAMCURRENT ODDSSeattle Seahawks44.7%San Francisco 49ers25.1%Los Angeles Rams18.7%Chicago Bears11.3%Philadelphia Eagles0.1%The Rams pose a major problem for opposing defenses as they top the NFL in both total offense (396.7 yards) and scoring (30.5 points), rank second in passing (270.5 yards) and are fifth in rushing (126.3). They possess an aerial attack that is led by Matthew Stafford, who leads the league with 4,179 passing yards and 40 touchdown tosses, and includes wide receivers Davante Adams (first with 14 TD catches) and Puka Nacua (second with 1,592 receiving yards).Containing that trio is a tall order for any defense, even an Atlanta unit that is eighth in the NFL against the pass (195.1 yards allowed). The Rams own a 49-28-2 all-time record against the Falcons in the regular season and won the last two meetings between the teams, including a 31-27 home triumph in 2022 in which Stafford threw for 272 yards and three touchdowns.Los Angeles, which still has the No. 5 seed in the conference for which to play should the NFC West title and top seed be out of the question, is a 7.5-point favorite against Atlanta in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings. The ITL team's model is predicting a 30-21 victory by the Rams, which would keep them alive in the race for the division crown should Seattle and/or San Francisco lose in Week 17.\n            ",

American defender Chris Richards had to leave the EFL Cup quarterfinal with an injury as Crystal Palace drew 1-1 with Arsenal before being knocked out 8-7 in the penalty shootout that would follow. This comes after captain Tyler Adams tore his MCL and will be out for 2-3 months.Richards went down in the 73rd minute and had to be stretchered off for Palace before Arsenal forced an own goal via a shot from close range from Jurrien Timber as Maxence Lacroix scored what would seem like the game's only goal before another Palace center back got in on the action.\nDespite the result, all eyes will be on Richards. Coach Oliver Glasner said that Richards needed stitches on his foot, said he hopes it isn't too bad but did say he's not ruling him out for playing on New Year's Day. A key player for the Eagles as well as the United States men's national team, there is also the slight quirk of Richards being projected as a starter for the USMNT in a World Cup on home soil in 2026, and his place in the team is pivotal. A player who has captained the side at times under Mauricio Pochettino, Richards will be a critical part of the USMNT setup in an uncertain defensive pairing. Tim Ream has been starting next to Richards, but the Charlotte FC defender is 38, and if Pochettino opts for a back three, questions surround who would partner the duo during the World Cup.\nNow all eyes will be on the official severity of Richard's injury, though Glasner did not appeared too concerned, which is welcomed by the USMNT faithful. While the UMSNT won't play a game until March when they host Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta, Palace are right back at it hosting Tottenham on Dec. 28 and Fulham three days later on Jan. 1. With fourth through 10th in the Premier League only separated by five points, any time missed will push what manager Glasner is able to accomplish possibly jeopardizing what has been an excellent season so far. Richards is someone who will be needed with Palace still going in the FA Cup and the Europa Conference League while pushing for a top-four spot in the Premier League.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nWe're getting into the part of every season where we have to worry about motivation, and not just for teams out of the playoff race. Teams like the Eagles and potentially Steelers (if the Ravens lose on Saturday) will have to determine if they want to chase a slightly better seed or limit the risk of injury to key players over the final two weeks.The potential rest angle for certain teams allows us to play a few correlated parlays at this time of year. If the Ravens lose on Saturday, the Browns will certainly have a much better chance of beating the Steelers on Sunday, as starters could rest for some or all of the game. Throwing the Packers and Browns in a money line parlay should get you anywhere from +350 to +400, but you can also add the Bills for an additional potential rest angle.\nAnother potential correlated money line parlay involves the three NFC West teams, all of whom clinched a playoff berth in Week 16. The Rams' loss to the Seahawks could wind up being catastrophic as they may not even have a chance to play for a division title by Monday. If the favored Seahawks and 49ers both win their matchups, they'll be squaring off for the No. 1 seed in Week 18 and the Rams will have to consider resting starters for some or all of their game against the Falcons. Sean McVay has shown a preference for resting players in the past.Putting the Seahawks, 49ers and Falcons together in a money line parlay should get you even better odds than our previous parlay considering the Falcons are a massive underdog early in the week.\nI'll have several spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.Let's dive into our betting power ratings and highlight a few more teams of note.Week 17 power ratingsTeam1716151413LAR88767.5SEA6.566.566NE54443.5BUF54.54.54.54.5JAC53210SF4.53211PHI4.53244.5DEN44.52.51.52LAC41.5100HOU3.53.531.51DET33.54.53.55CHI2.51.5121GB1.5354.54PIT1.510-1.5-1.5BAL01.512.54TB0000-3CAR-1-2.5-2-2.5-4.5DAL-1.5022.51CIN-2-2.500-1.5ATL-3-3.5-3.5-3-3IND-3.5-4.5-52.55MIN-4.5-1-3-6-3NO-4.5-4.5-4.5-7-6.5TEN-5.5-8-8.5-9-8.5CLE-6-7.5-4.5-6-5.5ARI-6.5-4.5-3.5-2.5-3KC-7.5-2.52.556.5WAS-8-4.5-4.5-2.5-5.5NYG-8-5-3.5-4-2.5MIA-8.5-2.5-2-3.5-4LV-9-10-7-7-6NYJ-10   -9-8.5-7.5-7.5I'm still giving the Rams a clear edge over the Seahawks despite last week's result, which required an improbable fourth-quarter rally by Seattle just to send the game into overtime. The Rams might be on the road the entire playoffs and still wind up favored in every game.I have the Bills, Patriots and Jaguars grouped together in my second tier. Buffalo appears to have the weakest roster of the three overall, but the Bills also have the great equalizer at quarterback, and Josh Allen might run through the AFC playoffs winning games 41-38 if he has to. The Jaguars have done enough to be right alongside the best teams in the AFC after their dismantling of the Broncos, a team I finally started to believe in heading into last week. The Patriots may be getting a little bit of the benefit of the doubt, but they played well enough in their two games against Buffalo that I didn't want to have them slotted lower than the Bills.Next up comes the 49ers and Eagles, two teams that are getting healthier down the stretch and might be able to play up to their full potential in January. San Francisco is much like Buffalo with questions about the defense but an offense that is going to be hard to beat in a shootout, but I have enough confidence in the defense to make plays that I want to have them as clearly higher than the Lions, a team with a similar profile.The Broncos and Chargers slot in next, and I'm going to have a hard time not taking the Chargers in Week 18 with how hit or miss the Broncos have been this year. I'd play both over Houston, a much more hit-and-miss team that is hard to trust after an embarrassing effort against the Raiders.You could argue the Bears should be much higher than where I have them, behind a Lions team that is probably going to miss the playoffs, but they were down 10 at home with two minutes left to a team that lost its QB midgame. Kudos for pulling out the win, but with a point differential that sits 15th between the Chiefs and Steelers -- and I'm already putting Chicago ahead of Pittsburgh -- I don't know that I'm comfortable moving them much higher. That would certainly change if they can beat the 49ers in San Francisco.The ratings for the Ravens and Packers are up in the air with uncertainty around their QB situation, and I'm still putting the Bucs slightly ahead of the Panthers despite Carolina's win.Full Week 18 projected linesAwayHomeLookaheadConsensusPR SpreadNotesDALWAS+3.5+7+5Johnson expected for WASDETMIN+3.5+7+5.5Brosmer to start for MINDENKC+5.5+12.5+9.5Oladokun to start for KCHOULAC+1.5-2.5-1.5BALGB-3-2.5-3.5QB situation on both sides is fluidJACIND+5.5+6.5+7SEACAR+7.5+7.5+6ARICIN-5.5-7-6PITCLE+4.5+3.5+5PIT could rest players if BAL losesNOTEN+2+2.5-1NENYJ+9.5+13.5+12.5TBMIA+2.5+5.5+5.5NYGLV+3-1.5-0.5PHIBUF-3-1.5-3.5PHI could rest playersCHISF-2.5-3-4.5LAR   ATL   +8.5   +8+8   LAR could rest players if SEA, SF winThis is how I would set each game based on my power ratings and home-field advantage data for this week.

Congratulations if you are still alive. This will be the last week of my position preview; let's go get a championship! While there will be plenty of content for those trying to win it all this week, I look to also take a look ahead this time of year to 2026. So you'll still find waiver wire adds, numbers to know, and Week 17 DFS plays below like normal. But to start, I would like to offer a short overview as to what the position might look like in 2026.Tight end this year has been phenomenal, unlike any year I can remember. After all those false starts saying \"tight end looks deep this year\" and then looking foolish, it actually happened in 2025. Through Week 16, there are 12 tight ends averaging at least 11 PPR FPPG and another four averaging double digits. Off that pace are two guys who we expect to be better next year: Oronde Gadsden II and Colston Loveland. I am already excited about the options we are going to have next year.That being said, there are several tight ends who have been good this year who could disappear. At the top of the list is Travis Kelce, who would surprise no one if he chooses to retire. I have no idea if Darren Waller will come back either. And George Kittle won't retire, but he will turn 33, so we have to at least consider a dropoff. Jake Ferguson is probably in trouble if George Pickens comes back; he has had much less success when Pickens and CeeDee Lamb are available. And Dallas Goedert will be the posterboy for touchdown regression.With little doubt that the position will be deep, the question becomes about tier breaks. Are Brock Bowers and George Kittle in the same tier as Trey McBride? Just how big of a leap do we project for Tyler Warren, Harold Fannin, and Colston Loveland in Year 2? And what roles do Sam LaPorta and Tucker Kraft claim in their returns? These are the questions we will tackle this offseason. For now, let's go win a championship.Here's everything else you need to know about tight end in Week 17:\n\n        Week 17 TE Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            11 -- Harold Fannin is the 11th player to catch at least 70 passes and record at least 700 yards in his Age 21 season. He is the first tight end.16.46 -- Brock Bowers has averaged 16.46 PPR FPPG in his nine healthy games. He is most certainly elite and could be even better next year if the offensive environment is better.38% -- Dalton Kincaid played 38% of the offensive snaps in Week 16. He hasn't topped 40% since Week 5. It is very hard to trust a player playing that little; he clearly isn't healthy.19.1% -- Juwan Johnson has a 19% target share in Week 16. With Devaughn Vele out, Johnson is the clear number two option and a top eight tight end this week.31.8% -- Darren Waller has nearly a third of the Dolphins' end zone targets this season. He has played eight games.Week 17 Streamers (TE Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        JAC\n                    \n                         \n                        Jacksonville\n                    \n                                            • #85\n                                            \n                                            Age: 24\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        IND\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    JAC -6.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                27th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                13th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                58%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    37\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    49\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    434\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    9.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                I hope you don't have to stream tight end this week. There are so many fantastic options that are already rostered. But if you do, Brenton Strange is probably the best option. The Colts have given up the fifth most Fantasy points to opposing tight ends this season, but Strange only had 5.7 PPR Fantasy points when he played them earlier this month.

fallen far enough that I'm choosing him in what could be his last game at Arrowhead Stadium. I am not sure the Chiefs third string QB can get the ball to him consistently, but I expect him to try. Kelce had his best game of the season against this defense, catching nine passes for 91 yards and a touchdown in Week 11.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #85\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CIN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CIN -7\n                                    O/U 53.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                32nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                21\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                1st\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    109\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    148\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    1098\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    18.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                On the main slate, it is Trey McBride week.

And I don't really advise fading them. But if you want to get cute, I would play Brock Bowers. Bowers has averaged over 16 points per game since returning from his knee injury, and his team has their highest implied total in a month against the Giants. It could be another two-touchdown game at a very low roster rate.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 17 Fantasy football projections for every position is now available on SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        With just two weeks left to play in the NFL's 2025 regular season, only one division has been clinched so far, but that could change in Week 17. After the Eagles clinched the NFC East, the seven divisions that are still up for grabs could all be settled this week. It's also possible that every playoff spot could be clinched by the end of Week 17.So far, 10 of the 14 playoff berths have been accounted -- and the final four spots could be in the bag by the end of the weekend.So, what has to happen for each playoff spot to be clinched? Glad you asked. Let's check out all the clinching scenarios for Week 17.Denver BroncosThere's exactly one scenario that would see the Broncos clinch the conference's No. 1 seed and AFC West title:\n1. DEN win + LAC loss or tie + NE loss + BUF loss or tie + JAX loss or tieThe Broncos have a much simpler path to just winning the AFC West this week, though. For that to happen, they only need one of the two following scenarios to happen:1. DEN win + LAC loss or tie OR 2. DEN tie + LAC lossThe Broncos are at the Chiefs on Christmas Day before the Chargers host the Texans in a Saturday game.Jacksonville JaguarsThe Jags are on the cusp of clinching just their second division title in the past seven years. For that to happen, they need one of the following two scenarios to take place:\n1. JAX win + HOU loss or tie OR 2. JAX tie + HOU lossThe Jaguars travel to Indianapolis for Sunday's game while the Texans are at the Chargers.New England PatriotsThe Patriots could take the AFC East if with one of these two scenarios:1. NE win + BUF loss or tie OR 2. NE tie + BUF lossThis coming Sunday, the Patriots are at the Jets while the Bills host the Eagles.Pittsburgh SteelersThe AFC North race could be over this week if one of these two simple scenarios happens:\n1. PIT win or tie OR 2. BAL loss or tieThe Ravens play on Saturday against the Packers. A Baltimore loss would clinch the AFC North for Pittsburgh before the Steelers even take the field for Sunday's game at the Browns.Houston TexansThe Texans can't clinch a division title this week, but they can earn a playoff berth if any of the three following scenarios takes place:1. HOU win or tie OR 2. IND loss or tie OR 3. HOU clinches at least a tie in strength of victory tiebreaker over IND\nThe Texans must beat the Chargers on Saturday or have the Colts lose to the Jaguars on Sunday. That third clinching scenario involves the overall record of the teams that the Colts and Texans have each beaten.Seattle SeahawksThe Seahawks can clinch the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC this week, but there's only one scenario where that could happen:1. SEA win + LAR loss or tie + SF-CHI tieThe ONLY way the Seahawks can clinch the top seed is if the Bears-Seahawks game ends in a tie. That being said, Seattle does have a slightly easier path to clinching the NFC West:\n1. SEA win + LAR loss or tie + SF loss or tie OR 2. SEA tie + LAR loss + SF lossThe Seahawks play at Carolina on Sunday while the Rams head to Atlanta for Monday's game. As for the 49ers, they host the Bears on Sunday night.Carolina PanthersThe Panthers could lock up the NFC South, but there are only two scenarios where that could happen:1. CAR win + TB loss or tie OR 2. CAR tie + TB lossThe Panthers host the Seahawks on Sunday while the Buccaneers head to Miami.Chicago BearsThe Bears can clinch the NFC North this weekend if one of these three things goes their way:\n1. CHI win OR 2. GB loss OR 3. CHI tie + GB tieThe Bears face the 49ers on Sunday night, but they could clinch a spot before that if the Packers lose to the Ravens on Saturday night.Green Bay PackersThe Packers could clinch a playoff spot this week, and it could happen on Christmas Day. Here's what they need:1. GB win or tie OR 2. DET loss or tieThe Lions play the Vikings on Thursday, and a loss by Detroit would clinch a spot for Green Bay. If the Lions win, the Packers can punch their own ticket by beating the Ravens on Saturday night.\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at who's in and who's out so far:NFC1. Seahawks (12-3) -- NFC West leader2. Bears (11-4) -- NFC North leader3. Eagles (10-5) -- CLINCHED NFC EAST4. Panthers (8-7) -- NFC South leader5. 49ers (11-4)6. Rams (11-4)7. Packers (9-5-1)STILL ALIVELions (8-7)Buccaneers (7-8)NFC playoff spots clinched: Rams, Eagles, Seahawks, Bears, 49ersNFC teams eliminated: Vikings, Falcons, Saints, Commanders, Cardinals, Giants, CowboysAFC1. Broncos (12-3) -- AFC West leader2. Patriots (12-3) -- AFC East leader3. Jaguars (11-4) -- AFC South leader4. Steelers (9-6) -- AFC North leader5. Chargers (11-4)6. Bills (11-4)7. Texans (10-5)STILL ALIVEColts (8-7)Ravens (7-8)AFC playoff spots clinched: Broncos, Patriots, Jaguars, Bills, ChargersAFC teams eliminated: Chiefs, Dolphins, Bengals, Jets, Browns, Raiders, TitansThe Colts, Ravens, Lions and Buccaneers could all be eliminated this week. Tampa Bay is the only team that controls its fate: If the Bucs beat the Dolphins, they'll still be alive to clinch a playoff spot in Week 18. The other three teams could be eliminated, even with a win.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last time former No. 1 overall pick Ben Simmons suited up for an NBA game, he played under five minutes for the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 5 of their first-round playoff exit to the Denver Nuggets last season. He recorded zero points while recording one rebound and one block. It ended a season where Simmons played just 18 games for L.A. after being waived by the Brooklyn Nets in February, and signing a deal for the remainder of the season with the Clippers.He went unsigned as a free agent during the offseason, and while he's still working on an NBA comeback, the three-time All Star's focus has been on professional fishing as of late. Simmons told Andscape that he's been completing two-a-day basketball and strength and rehabilitation workouts six days a week, with hopes of making his return to the NBA. While there's no firm timeline for his return, and with no team there's certainly no expectations placed on him, the two-time All-Defensive player hopes to be healthy enough to join a team during the All-Star break, or perhaps next season. But he doesn't want to just be on a roster for the sake of it.\"I don't believe it's just [about] getting on a team,\" Simmons said. \"So, if I were to play right now, I think I'd fit right into the NBA just given what I can do. But I want to give everything I can to the game. I don't think there's any point in just wasting a spot just to be out there. I think that's a little selfish. And there are guys that do it now. But that's what it is, the business.\"In conjunction with workouts that Simmons says are \"exhausting,\" he's become an owner of a professional fishing team, the South Florida Sails. It's part of the Sport Fishing Championship league, which consists of 16 teams across 11 states. They compete in tournaments catching various fish, with a championship on the line at the end of a season.\n\"It's a very niche sport. And if you don't know, you don't know,\" Simmons said. \"But once you experience it and get out there and see what it's about, you're kind of in awe of what the sport is. And that's just something I've always been interested in in terms of the sport of fishing. The technique. And there's so much to it that people just don't understand. These guys are fishing on million-dollar vessels, and they're out for days at a time. So, it's tedious and gritty, but a lot of fun. It's one of those worlds where you just got to kind of experience it, get into it and see what it's about.\"Simmons isn't a member on the team, as he said he's \"not the best angler,\" but he's been incredibly committed to being involved from an ownership standpoint.\"I have a passion in helping these guys grow the sport because I really believe in it. So, for me to compete, it would be a little selfish. Maybe if I work hard enough to be a bit of an angler, maybe I'll put myself on the roster. But it's more so for me about building the community in Miami around the fishing. That's really important, and it's a responsibility that we have now.\"\nAs far as his NBA return goes, Simmons said he hasn't suffered any setbacks as he tries to rejoin the league. As encouraging as that is, Simmons hasn't played 60 or more games since his second season in the league -- which is pre-pandemic. He played 51 games last season split between the Nets and Clippers, but was still far away from the two-way floor general that earned him several accolades early in his career.In reality, Simmons might not ever return to that version of himself who was locking down the league's best offensive players on one end and dishing out some eyebrow-raising dimes on the other. But he still wants to try.\"We're human, we want to find out,\" Simmons said. \"I got to see. I don't think this story is over for me playing, but let's see where it goes. So as long as I put in that work and put the energy into doing that, then everything else will write itself.\"\n            ",

Cincinnati (4-9) and Baltimore (6-7) are both barely hanging on in the AFC North race with just four weeks to go, making this a crucial showdown for both.The Bengals won the Week 13 meeting -- a 32-14 domination in Baltimore on Thanksgiving Day -- but dropped a 39-34 decision to the Bills in Week 14. SportsLine projections currently give Cincinnati just a 3% chance to qualify for the postseason.The Ravens are slightly better at 24%, but that's certainly not where they want to be, and not where they were just two weeks ago. After a 1-5 start, Baltimore seemingly righted the ship with five straight wins. But back-to-back home defeats -- to the Bengals in Week 13 and then to the Steelers in Week 14, with the AFC North lead on the line -- have them with plenty of work to do, and potentially in need of some help.\n        \n            \n                Ravens lose to Steelers in controversial finish, but have no one to blame but themselves as season nears brink\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's how to watch this rivalry game plus odds, keys to the matchup and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Bengals vs. Ravens liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Paycor Stadium -- Cincinnati, OhioTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -2.5, O/U 52.5 (via DraftKings)Bengals vs. Ravens: Need to knowBoth Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow are looking to bounce back. Jackson had three turnovers in Week 12 against the Bengals (one interception, two fumbles lost) and threw a costly interception against the Steelers in Week 13. Overall, Jackson has just two touchdowns accounted for (one passing, one rushing) and five turnovers over the past four games. While he started to play better against the Steelers, he's yet to show his trademark explosiveness as a runner since returning from a hamstring injury. Burrow came back from his own injury -- a turf toe -- and threw two touchdowns in the win over Baltimore and four more against Buffalo. But he also had two game-defining turnovers in the second half, including a pick six, against the Bills.Can Bengals take advantage on the ground? Despite some moderate improvement over the past month or so, the Bengals still rank last in rushing yards allowed and 31st in yards per rush allowed this season. One would think that could lead to a big day from Derrick Henry, but Henry had just 10 carries against the Bengals in Week 12. They resulted in 60 yards, though, and Baltimore's ground game was better last week. Will Henry finally have a breakout game? He has gone three straight games without reaching 100 rushing yards.Ja'Marr Chase has been historically great against Baltimore. Last season, Chase had 457 receiving yards and five touchdowns against the Ravens. The 457 receiving yards were a single-season record against a single opponent. Then in Week 13, he had seven catches for 110 yards. Basically, he has been unstoppable against the Ravens, and with Tee Higgins (concussion protocol) potentially out, Chase should see a ton of passes thrown his way.Bengals vs. Ravens prediction, pick\nThe Ravens continue to find different ways to beat themselves, whether through turnovers, penalties or other issues. The defense could be in for a long day, but so, too, could a Cincinnati defense that remains one of the NFL's worst. Expect Jackson to play a vastly improved game compared to his Thanksgiving Day performance and Henry to get a larger workload because Baltimore won't be forced to play from behind as much.

    "body": "\n        The Indianapolis Colts pulled off a shocker this week when they decided to bring Philip Rivers out of retirement. The veteran quarterback had been out of the NFL since 2020 before being signed to Indy's practice squad on Wednesday. Rivers hasn't played a single snap in nearly five years, but there's a good chance that drought will end on Sunday when the Colts face the Seahawks. The 44-year-old Rivers, who is now the oldest active player in the NFL, could get the start in Seattle because the Riley Leonard is dealing with a knee injury. It's not often that you see a 44-year-old take the field in an NFL game, but we did just see it happen back 2022 with Tom Brady. The seven-time Super Bowl winner was actually 45 years old during his final season with the Buccaneers. Brady did an interview with Colin Cowherd this week and during their talk, the NFL legend was asked if he thought he could \"generate drives\" and help a team if he was asked to play on Sunday, and Brady didn't hesitate with his response. \"Yes, I certainly could,\" Brady said. \"I think the answer for me would be yes.\"Although Brady is confident that he could still help someone, he's actually prohibited from playing in the NFL right now due to league rule that was implemented in 2023. \n\"I'm not allowed to anymore because I'm a minority owner of the Raiders, so I can't unretire,\" Brady explained. When Brady first retired, it was possible for someone to own a team and still play, but for that to happen, 24 of the NFL's 32 owners would have had to approve it. However, as CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported last year, that loophole was closed in 2023. Under the new policy, employees are not allowed to have an ownership stake in a team and a player counts as an employee. Brady was approved as a Raiders minority owner in October 2024 and as soon as that happened, he became ineligible to play in the NFL. Brady could still sell his stake in the Raiders and look to make a return after that, but that isn't going to happen. As for Rivers, the 48-year-old Brady sounds pumped to see if the new Colts quarterback has anything left in the tank. \n\"I'm very excited to watch Philip play,\" Brady said. \"It speaks to how much he loves the game and really what he's able to do still.\"As long as Rivers can throw the ball and process what opposing defenses are doing, Brady thinks he'll have a fighting chance to succeed during his comeback. \"This game is about, for the quarterback, from the neck up,\" Brady said. \"That doesn't really go away. That's still up there. Do you still have the physical ability to still do it, take the hits, make the throws. If Philip has been practicing those things, then we're all going to see it on full display in Seattle on Sunday afternoon.\"\nRivers is the first player to come out of retirement at age 44 since Brady did it in 2022. The former Patriots and Buccaneers QB famously retired in February 2022 before returning after just 40 days. \"Who retires and then unretires and then is ultimately going to retire again? Who does that? That's ridiculous for Philip to do that,\" Brady joked to Cowherd. Rivers spent the past five seasons coaching high school football at St. Michael Catholic in Alabama, where his son, Gunner Rivers, has turned into a top QB prospect. With the high school season over for 2025, the elder Rivers thought it would be the perfect time to return to the field. \nRivers was drafted all the way back in 2004 and he'll be the third QB over the age 40 to start a game this year, joining Aaron Rodgers and Joe Flacco. In Indy, he'll be reuniting with Shane Steichen. Steichen started his NFL coaching career with the Chargers, where he spent eight seasons with Rivers, and that familiarity will likely serve Rivers well if he's forced to play on Sunday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Former Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore was handed three charges, including felony home invasion, by the Washtenaw County (Mich.) Prosecutor's Office on Friday, two days after he was fired by the university for engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Moore has been charged with home invasion in the third degree, stalking and breaking and entering or entering without breaking.The most serious of the charges is home invasion, which is punishable by up to five years in prison. Moore is accused of \"unlawfully entering the victim's residence to commit the crime of stalking and committing that crime while in the residence.\" The charges of stalking and breaking and entering are both misdemeanors, carrying maximum sentences of one year and 90 days in jail, respectively.\nMoore was arraigned regarding those charges on Friday, appearing via video in a small room while wearing a white jail-issued clothing, with prosecutors alleging that Moore broke into the victim's home before grabbing several butter knives, before finding kitchen shears. At that point, Moore is alleged to have threatened to kill himself, blaming the victim for \"ruining his life.\"According to the prosecutor, Moore said, \"I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to make you watch. My blood is on your hands. You ruined my life.\"\nMoore's lawyer stated that his client is not a danger to the community and that Moore was willing to wear a GPS tether as a condition of his bail, also stating that Moore had undergone two separate mental health evaluations since his arrest.Ultimately, the judge agreed to a $25,000 cash surety bond, continuation of mental health treatment and a GPS tether for Moore, making it clear that any contact with the alleged victim would be a violation of the terms of his bail. The defense agreed to waive the 14-day requirement for a probable cause conference, saying that calendars had been coordinated for Jan. 22, with the judge setting the date as such.Moore, 39, was fired with cause from his position on Wednesday, with athletic director Warde Manuel saying the termination was the result of an \"inappropriate relationship with a staff member.\" The shocking end of Moore's tenure after just two seasons as coach was just the start of the story, as he was in police custody mere hours later.\n\n        \n            \n                How the industry is reacting to Michigan firing Sherrone Moore: 'Didn't think it was actually going to happen'\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMoore was detained by the Saline (Mich.) Police Department before being turned over to Pittsfield Township police \"for an investigation into potential charges.\"The Pittsfield Township Police released a statement after the arraignment. During the investigation, it was alleged that the suspect, Sherrone Moore, was unarmed when he entered the residence through an unlocked door without permission and engaged in a verbal argument with the victim that escalated,\" the statement read. \"It was further alleged that during the argument, Moore picked up two butter knives and a pair of scissors from within the residence and threatened to harm himself. Moore left the residence before responding officers arrived and was located shortly thereafter in the area of Willis and Bishop Roads in Saline. Moore was taken into custody without incident. Moore was transported to a local hospital for evaluation. At the conclusion of the evaluation, Moore was lodged at the Washtenaw County Jail pending a review of charges by the Washtenaw County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.\"While the situation surrounding Moore's relationship with the staff member and subsequent firing was a surprise to the public, it was \"the worst-kept secret\" at Michigan, CBS Sports reported Thursday. One high-level Michigan booster told CBS Sports that \"everybody in the program has known this the last two seasons,\" and that Schembechler Hall was \"swarming with lawyers\" earlier this month.\nMoore was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach after Jim Harbaugh departed Michigan to coach the Los Angeles Chargers on the heels of the Wolverines winning the national championship. In two seasons at the helm, Moore led the Wolverines to a 16-8 record. Michigan finished the regular season with a 9-3 record and is set to play Texas in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31. Associate head coach Biff Poggi was appointed interim coach while the university looks for Moore's replacement.\n            ",

His dynamic play style earned him a spot as a Heisman Trophy finalist and propelled the Commodores to their first 10-win season in program history. But Pavia doesn't have the background typical of this sport's stars. He was an unheralded recruit out of high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and began his collegiate journey at the junior college level with New Mexico Military Institute. He almost took an entirely different path than the one that led him to Nashville. During a recent appearance on \"The Pivot Podcast,\" Pavia revealed that Deion Sanders offered him a scholarship at Jackson State after his two years at junior college. An interesting wrinkle prevented Pavia from enrolling with the Tigers. \"Coach Prime offered me at Jackson State,\" Pavia said. \"But he was so real. He was like, 'Hey, look. We're looking for a backup. You ain't playing over my son even if he gets hurt.' And I'm like, at least he's real, you know? So I took the offer to New Mexico State.\" \n\n        \n            \n                Heisman Trophy finalists 2025: Fernando Mendoza, Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin headed to New York\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBoth sides benefitted from Sanders' honesty. Deion's son, Shedeur, starred at Jackson State and followed him to Colorado, where he was the 2024 Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year. Sanders is now starting for the Cleveland Browns as a rookie. Pavia ended up signing with New Mexico State. After an up-and-down first year that saw him bounce between the bench and the starting lineup, Pavia was named the 2023 Conference USA Offensive Player of the Year after tallying 3,896 total yards and 33 touchdowns. With demonstrated success at the FBS level, Pavia took his chances in the transfer portal. Interest from other schools didn't reach the level he expected. \n\"When I hit the transfer portal, no one wanted me,\" Pavia said. \"It was like, my biggest offer was Washington State. No disrespect to Washington State, I thought I was better than that.\" That was until New Mexico State coach Jerry Kill -- who briefly retired following the 2023 season -- and offensive coordinator Tim Beck were hired onto Clark Lea's staff at Vanderbilt. Pavia initially committed to Nevada out of the portal. He was set on a future with the Wolf Pack until Kill called him from a boat in Mexico and informed Pavia of his decision to join the Commodores. That was enough to tip the scales in Vanderbilt's favor. \"I feel like I'm a loyal dude,\" Pavia said. \"You took a chance on me coming from JUCO to New Mexico State, with this opportunity, it's in the SEC, I'm going to take it.\" \nPavia had to return to New Mexico State and complete 21 extra credit hours so he could meet Vanderbilt's rigorous academic standards. The work, obviously, paid off. Pavia has won 17 games in two seasons as Vanderbilt's starter. He led the SEC with 27 touchdowns passing this season and his 826 yards rushing paced the conference's quarterbacks. \"I can win wherever I go. I just need a chance,\" Pavia said. \"I just need an opportunity. The NFL as well. Just give me a chance. I just want an opportunity. I can show you that I'm the player. That's just who I feel who I am deep inside. I'm a true competitor. At all costs, I'm going to beat you out. \n\"It don't matter who you are, what you do, where you came from -- I'm gonna win.\"   \n            ",

The Bears fell from the No. 1 seed in the NFC to the No. 7 seed after their 28-21 loss to the Green Bay Packers, while the Browns were handed their 10th loss of the season by the lowly Tennessee Titans, 31-29. The Bears had their five-game winning streak snapped in Green Bay, as Caleb Williams threw an interception in the end zone on what could have been a game-tying drive. However, SportsLine says Chicago still has a 24.7% chance to win the NFC North. The Browns may have what is statistically the No. 2 defense in the NFL, but they have now officially been eliminated from playoff contention, and allowed Titans running back Tony Pollard to put up a career-high 161 rushing yards last week. With this matchup being at home for the Bears, it could be a get-right game for Chicago. The weather forecast on Sunday is also calling for frigid temperatures in Chicago with a projected high of 12 degrees.Let's break down this interfconference matchup, but first, here's how you can watch:\nWhere to watch Browns vs. Bears liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Soldier Field -- Chicago, IllinoisTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bears -7.5, O/U 39.5 (via DraftKings)Browns vs. Bears: Need to knowSanders coming off a massive performance. Despite the loss, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders was fantastic last Sunday. He became the first player in Browns history to throw for 350 yards, three touchdowns and rush for a touchdown in a game. The only other rookie quarterback to accomplish this feat in NFL history was Joe Burrow. Sanders has grabbed ahold of the starting job, and has thrown a touchdown in all three of his NFL starts. Myles Garrett closing in on sack record. The official NFL record for sacks in a single season is 22.5, and Garrett is up to 20. He's recorded at least one sack in seven straight games, which is the longest streak of his career.Bears' playoff chances. As stated above, the Bears have a 24.7% chance to win the NFC North, but a comfortable 70% chance to make the playoffs. After Week 15, they host the Packers in a rematch, play at the San Francisco 49ers and then close out the season at home vs. the Detroit Lions.Caleb Williams and consistency. The former No. 1 overall pick has completed 57.8% of his passes this season, which ranks second-worst in the NFL among qualified quarterbacks. Only J.J. McCarthy of the Minnesota Vikings is worse. The Bears have the No. 2 rushing offense in the NFL, so imagine if this Chicago passing attack became more consistent. That may be key for the Bears putting together a deep postseason run.Browns vs. Bears prediction, pick\nWhile Sanders did cover the spread in his lone road start of the season, this Browns team is just not very good. Maybe you didn't bat an eye when they were thrashed by the 49ers, but Cleveland getting run all over by Tennessee was shocking. Chicago is 7-5-1 against the spread this season, while Cleveland is 5-8 against the spread. Give me the home team that leads the NFL in takeaways and turnover differential. Pick: Bears -7.5, Under 39.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Last June, Parma made a shocking announcement. Their new coach would be Carlos Cuesta, a little-known former Mikel Arteta assistant who had yet to even turn 30 years old. Back then, only a few had even heard of the Spanish manager, but it was just a matter of time. Cuesta, born in 1995, became the second-ever youngest manager in the history of the Italian Serie A, only a few months older than Triestina's Elio Loschi, who sat down for the first time on the Triestina bench at 29 years old in 1939, drawing 0-0 against Juventus. On Saturday, Parma will meet Lazio for a key Serie A game that will tell us more about their chances to avoid relegation, with Parma in good form. The team coached by Cuesta comes from two wins in the last three Serie A games and is in a good spot after a challenging start to the season. How to watch Parma vs. Lazio, oddsDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Ennio Tardini -- Parma TV: CBSLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Parma +255; Draw +224; Lazio +110Who is Carlos Cuesta? Cuesta, born in Palma de Mallorca on July 29, 1995, signed a two-year contract until June 2027 with Parma, with an option to extend it for the following season. Cuesta started his coaching career at Atletico Madrid, where he first volunteered for the academy, where he coached the Under-14 side before being promoted to oversee the whole youth sector. He then moved to Juventus in 2018, and became the assistant manager of the Under-17 team. At Juventus, he worked closely with Federico Cherubini, who, back then, was the director of the youth sector, working closely with Fabio Paratici, and today is the current CEO at Parma. For this reason, Cuesta speaks Italian perfectly thanks to his previous experience at the Italian giants. After his spell at Juventus, Cuesta moved to the Premier League, serving as Mikel Arteta's assistant at Arsenal from 2020 to 2025. This summer, he was contacted by his former Juventus director and appointed head coach of Parma, who were searching for a new manager following Cristian Chivu's move to Inter in June. Young managers in the Italian Serie ASerie A is historically known to be a league that is kind of reluctant when it comes to young managers, but things have drastically changed in recent years. It's not a coincidence that Inter, for example, have decided to appoint Chivu as their new coach despite the fact he only coached 13 Serie A games at Parma previously in the Italian top flight, while Como have embraced an attractive cycle under Cesc Fabregas and Atalanta hired Raffaele Palladino, one of the most promising coaches around Europe. Usually, it's easier to see former Serie A players on the bench, such as in the examples mentioned above, but the example of Cuesta reminds more of some others in the past, such as when Inter appointed Andrea Stramaccioni as a caretaker coach during the 2011-12 season before confirming him for the following season. Before that experience, Stramaccioni only coached the academies of AS Roma and Inter. \nCan Lazio turn things around? Elsewhere, Lazio had a difficult start to the season despite the comeback of Maurizio Sarri on the bench. The Italian side had some financial issues in the summer 2025 that prevented the team from being reinforced, as the same Italian manager admitted over the past weeks. \"This team needs to be strengthened. Only people who can improve us should come in,\" he said after the match against Bologna over the weekend. Lazio are currently sitting in 10th place with 19 points after 14 matches, and two wins in the last five Serie A games, but also eight points behind the top four. Sarri has the ability and experience to turn things around, but the match against Parma will be crucial in their attempt to close the gap on the European spots. Then comes the January transfer window, when they will be hoping for changes that can give the team a much-needed boost.\n            ",

Now the Tennessee Titans come to town after winning just their second game of the season last weekend.Following a very late bye week, the 49ers are healthier and gearing up for a playoff run. They're one game back of the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks in the division, and this weekend is an excellent chance for them to make up some ground. Prior to the bye, San Francisco seemed to be rounding into form with comfortable wins over a trio of inferior opponents. That trend may continue this weekend with the Titans in town.Tennessee got some relief from an otherwise miserable 2025 season with their 31-29 win over the Cleveland Browns last week. Granted, that did drop them from the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, but they have a chance to \"improve\" that position with a loss in Week 15. Tony Pollard ran all over Cleveland with 161 yards and a pair of touchdowns, and he'll get another very tough test against the San Francisco defense. The problem for the Titans may be keeping the 49ers out of the end zone.Here is everything you need to know about this inter-conference matchup.\nWhere to watch 49ers vs. Titans liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium -- Santa Clara, CaliforniaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: 49ers -12.5, O/U 44.5 (via DraftKings)49ers vs. Titans: Need to knowBrock off a bye. 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy has played two games off a bye in his career, and he has been nearly perfect in both. In those two games, Purdy has completed 71.0% of his throws for 324.5 yards per game, five touchdowns and zero interceptions. Given the state of this Titans secondary, Purdy has a very good chance to build upon those already impressive numbers.Titans going for two. Tennessee is looking for its second consecutive win, which has been a rarity for this franchise lately. The Titans haven't won back-to-back games since Weeks 10 and 11 in 2022. Even when they have won, the Titans have been completely unable to generate any momentum. Tennessee has lost 10 straight games following a victory, and there's a decent chance that streak continues in Santa Clara.49ers feast on rookie QBs. San Francisco has to be salivating at the idea of facing a rookie quarterback in Cam Ward. That's because the 49ers have absolutely feasted on rookie signal callers over the last five years. Dating back to 2021, San Francisco has faced rookie quarterbacks six times. Not only have the 49ers won all those games as favorites, but they've also covered the spread every time.49ers vs. Titans prediction, pick\nThe Titans managed to run the ball very well on a fairly stout defense last weekend, and that should give fans some hope they could move the ball on the 49ers. That said, San Francisco is coming off a bye, and it needs a win to keep pace in the NFC West. Throw in a long road trip for the Titans, and the circumstances are highly unfavorable for them. The 49ers should roll in this one. Pick: 49ers -12.5, Over 44.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Washington enters on an eight-game losing streak, while New York has lost seven straight. That makes this game just the second divisional matchup since the 1970 merger in which both teams have lost at least seven consecutive games.Still, there's plenty of intrigue, especially at quarterback. The Giants have dealt with issues at the position all season. After opening the season with Russell Wilson as the starter, the Giants moved onto first-round rookie Jaxson Dart, who has shown plenty of promise but also missed two games with a concussion. Dart then took plenty of hard hits in his return in Week 13, leading some, including commentator Troy Aikman, to wonder about his playing style. Dart said he'll continue to play his brand of football, though the Giants would certainly like him to finish the season strong and, more importantly, healthy.The Commanders will once again turn to Marcus Mariota after Jayden Daniels re-aggravated his dislocated left elbow. Though Daniels did not suffer any long-term setbacks, the team's doctors advised he sit out Week 15.Here's how to watch this matchup as well as betting information, keys to the game and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Giants vs. Commanders liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: MetLife Stadium -- East Rutherford, New JerseyTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Giants -2.5, O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings)Giants vs. Commanders: Need to knowWhat can Dart show after the bye? The start to Dart's career has been encouraging, especially considering some of the struggles around him. Even absent star wide receiver Malik Nabers and, more recently, running back Cam Skattebo, Dart has thrown for 11 touchdowns to just three interceptions and has 337 yards and seven touchdowns on the ground. His touchdown to interception ratio is seventh in the NFL, and he has shown a strong ability to avoid sacks and extend plays. Against one of the NFL's worst defenses -- the Commanders' 8.1 net yards per pass attempt allowed is last in the NFL and 10th-worst since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger -- he should be able to take another step forward.Can Abdul Carter finish strong? Dart wasn't the Giants' only 2025 first-round pick. Abdul Carter -- the No. 3 overall pick -- has been a disappointment this season, and he was benched for the start of New York's last game after being late to a team meeting. It wasn't the first time it's happened this season, either. Overall, Carter has just 1.5 sacks this season, though he did get his first one in that most recent game, against the New England Patriots.Commanders in search of any bright spots. It's been a nightmare season for the Commanders after reaching the NFC Championship last year, and somehow it got significantly worse in a 31-0 Week 14 loss to the Vikings. It was Washington's largest shutout loss since 1961. And not only did Daniels get hurt, but reliable tight end Zach Ertz tore his ACL. Washington would love to see some of its young players step up. That list could include right tackle Josh Conerly Jr., cornerback Mike Sainristil, tight end Ben Sinnott and others.Giants vs. Commanders pick, prediction\nThe Commanders have been unable to do much of anything defensively this season to disrupt opposing quarterbacks. Dart, meanwhile, has shown plenty of the talent that led to New York moving back into the first round to draft him. He should be in line for another strong performance. The same can't be said for a Washington team that looked completely uncompetitive against Minnesota. Pick: Giants -2.5, Under 47.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Jaguars bounced into first place in the AFC South with their 36-19 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, while the Jets were eliminated from playoff contention following a 34-10 loss to Tua Tagovailoa and the Miami Dolphins in Week 14. Jets quarterback Tyrod Taylor left Sunday's game with a groin injury, and was replaced by Brady Cook since Justin Fields was inactive with a knee issue. It remains to be seen who Aaron Glenn will start at quarterback this week.As for the Jaguars, they have won four straight games, and this offense has scored at least 25 points in six straight contests. That's tied for the longest streak in franchise history. Jacksonville has to be feeling good entering Week 15, as the Jags control their own destiny in the division while Lawrence is coming off one of his best performances of the season. The Jets on the other hand are trying to finish out the first year of the Glenn era strong. This season marks their sixth in a row with double-digit losses. Let's break down this matchup, but first here's how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Jets vs. Jaguars liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: EverBank Stadium -- Jacksonville, ForidaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Jaguars -13.5, O/U 41.5 (via DraftKings)Jets vs. Jaguars: Need to knowTrevor Lawrence heating up?: Despite the wet weather last week, the Jaguars quarterback turned in an impressive performance with 244 yards, two touchdowns and zero interceptions. Lawrence was consistent throwing the football downfield, and did not make any mistakes. In fact, last week marked the first time he threw two or more touchdowns and zero interceptions in back-to-back games since 2022. Jets QB injuries. Who are the Jets going to start at quarterback? That's probably something coach Aaron Glenn wants to keep a secret for as long as possible. Tyrod Taylor is dealing with a groin injury, while Justin Fields is nursing a knee injury. Brady Cook received some first-team reps this week. He completed 14 of 30 passes for 163 yards and two interceptions last week vs. Miami. New York's non-opportunistic defense. The Jets defense has recorded just two takeaways this season and zero interceptions. All other NFL teams have at least seven takeaways this year. New York ranks dead last in turnover differential (-15) and sack differential (-25).Jacksonville's No. 1 run defense. The Jaguars defense on the other hand is known for their ability to force turnovers, as they are tied for second in the NFL with 23 takeaways this season. But did you know the Jaguars' run defense ranks No. 1 in the NFL with 82.9 rushing yards allowed per contest? Breece Hall has a tough test in front of him.Jets vs. Jaguars prediction, pick\nThe Jaguars are favored by 13.5 points, which are the most points Jacksonville has been favored by since 2007! The Jaguars are 4-0 straight up and against the spread in their last four games, but this incredible run could be in danger of ending this week. This is a large number, and the Jets actually have a winning record against the spread (7-6). The Jaguars will win this game, but we'll see if they can cover. Pick: Jets +13.5, Over 41.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

DeMeco Ryans' squad is coming off a dominant 20-10 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, which moved them to 8-5, while the 3-10 Cardinals were blown out by the Los Angeles Rams, 45-17. The Texans have now won five straight games, and have an 86% chance to make the playoffs despite being one game back of the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC South. The Cardinals on the other hand have lost five straight games -- their second five-game losing streak this season. You won't be surprised to learn that Houston is a big favorite in this matchup, but the Texans can't afford a misstep this late in the year. Let's break down this Week 15 matchup, but first, here's how you can watch the game. Where to watch Cardinals vs. Texans liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: NRG Stadium -- Houston, TexasTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Texans -9.5, O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)Cardinals vs. Texans: Need to knowDon't mess with Texans defense. Houston has the best defense in the NFL, and it ranks No. 1 in scoring defense (16.0) and in total defense (266.3 yards) entering Week 15. No team in the Super Bowl era has ever missed the playoffs having the No. 1 scoring defense and No. 1 total defense. This unit held Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes to a combined zero touchdowns and six turnovers!An offensive dynamic duo? Houston may have a fantastic defense, but the Cardinals have an underrated dynamic duo on offense. Since taking over as the starting quarterback in Week 6, Jacoby Brissett leads the NFL in passing yards (2,459), while Michael Wilson leads all wide receivers in fantasy points (99.1 in PPR) over the last four games! In that span, he's caught 39 passes for 481 yards and two touchdowns. Another historical bounce-back. The Texans are not an old franchise, their first season was in 2002. However, they are on the verge of becoming the first team in NFL history to make the playoffs twice after an 0-3 start. Houston accomplished this in 2018, and is favored to do so again in 2025. Cardinals vs. Texans prediction, pick\nBelieve it or not, C.J. Stroud has never been favored by this margin before in his NFL career. That may give you pause as a Texans fan, but also consider that the Cardinals are 5-1 against the spread on the road this season, compared to 1-6 against the spread at home. However, getting this number at 9.5 is a lot better than 10 or 10.5, so I'll take the Texans at home. We know the defense will show up, but I truly believe the Texans offense is improving. \nAs for the total, the Texans are 10-3 to the Under this season -- which is the best mark in the NFL. According to CBS Sports Research, it's the best Under percentage in a season since the 2020 New York Giants. Pick: Texans -9.5, Under 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        As Syracuse produced a game-clinching stop in the final seconds of its ACC-SEC Challenge win over Tennessee on Dec. 2, a wave of cheers swept through Rupp Arena. Kentucky fans, in their seats before the Wildcats' 9:30 p.m. local tip against North Carolina, enjoyed the pregame entertainment of seeing their SEC rival falter on the arena's video board. Considering the Volunteers are a bitter border foe, the reaction was understandable, but it was a bit misguided. Results like Syracuse's win over Tennessee are becoming a problem for the rest of the SEC, including Kentucky. If the Wildcats are going to claw back from a horrific start and build an NCAA Tournament resume, they need their 18-game league schedule to include as many marquee matchups as possible. Just one year removed from a season of historic dominance, the SEC is grappling with its worst nonconference run of the post-pandemic era. Entering another big weekend, the SEC is just 27-38 against high-major competition, and that mark drops to 27-41 when factoring in the league's 0-3 mark against Gonzaga. By comparison, the SEC finished 60-19 against high-major teams/Gonzaga in regular season action last year. \nThe end result of the league's November and December of dominance was a historic March that featured a record-setting 14 teams making the Big Dance, including four who received No. 2 seeds or better. A repeat of last year's unprecedented selection Sunday flew off the table last weekend when the league posted an 0-8 mark against high-major competition/Gonzaga. But the extent to which the SEC can salvage its sloppy start will be determined before Christmas. That starts with a huge slate of games this weekend.  Massive weekend ahead Beginning with Friday night's tilt between Texas and No. 5 UConn, there are eight games on tap for this weekend between SEC teams and high-major foes. The headliner is Saturday night's battle in Birmingham between No. 1 Arizona and No. 12 Alabama. A gold-plated Quad 1 win would go a long way for both the Crimson Tide and the SEC. \nEntering Friday's action, the league is just 12-32 in Quad 1 games. A year ago, the SEC was 20-15 at this point in Quad 1 and had suffered just two losses across Quads 2-4 with none coming in Quads 3-4. This year, the league has already suffered 11 losses in Quads 2-4, including two in Quad 3. YearRecordSEC teams in NCAA Tournament2025-2627-38TBD2024-2559-1914 of 162023-2437-338 of 142022-2330-278 of 142021-2228-246 of 14Despite those bleak numbers, all is not lost for the SEC. Though its Quad 1 record is poor, the penalty for losing such contests is minimal. North Carolina made the NCAA Tournament last season out of the ACC with a 1-13 record in Quad 1 and a 22-1 mark across Quads 2-4. \nIf the season ended Friday, nine of the SEC's 16 teams would still make the field, according to CBS Sports Bracketology. None would be better than a No. 3 seed, and only Alabama would be better than a No. 5 seed. Nine is still a respectable tally, even for a 16-team megaconference. But the drop from 14 representatives would be significant for the league, and it would spell trouble for teams like Kentucky that are likely to face an uphill climb in league play. Here's one practical example of how the league's early struggles could impact Kentucky's hopes of building an at-large resume:   \nTennessee's losses to Syracuse and Illinois dropped the Volunteers out of the NET's top 30. If that's where they remain on Feb. 7, Kentucky's visit from the Volunteers will be a Quad 2 game instead of the Quad 1 game like it was last season. If it winds up as a Quad 2 game, Kentucky won't get as much credit for a win and will be punished to some degree for a loss. Those are little things, but they add up to make a difference for teams in bubble territory.  Can Vanderbilt and Georgia keep it up? The league is being propped up by two pleasant surprises, as Vanderbilt and Georgia are a combined 17-1 and both ranked inside the top 15 of the NET. While the Commodores – ranked No. 8 by KenPom.com and boasting wins over a trio of top-60 NET teams — appear to have some staying power, Georgia's legitimacy is up for debate. The Bulldogs (8-1) are 0-1 in Quad 1, and six of their wins are in Quad 4. UGA's best wins are against Xavier and Florida State, which are both led by first-year coaches and ranked outside the top 80 by KenPom. Barring an unforeseen fluctuation in the NET rankings, Georgia will enter SEC play against Auburn on Jan. 3 with zero Quad 1 wins. \nWhen regression comes for Georgia, it will come at a significant cost for the SEC. Right now, playing the Bulldogs would mark a Quad 1 game for everyone, regardless of the game's location. But if their fast start proves to be nothing more than a mirage facilitated by wide margins of victory against inferior competition, that will change quickly. Look no further than LSU for a cautionary tale. The Tigers were 8-0 and ranked No. 18 in the NET – firmly in Quad 1 status — until an 82-58 loss to Texas Tech dropped them 21 spots. Now, playing the Tigers at home would be a Quad 2 game. A similar reality check could be in store for Georgia when conference play starts. A season ago, 14 of Kentucky's 18 SEC games ended up being Quad 1 opportunities after the SEC's dominant nonconference run plated every SEC schedule in gold. The league dominated so significantly in November and December that it created a never-ending cycle for its teams of quality victories and losses that were virtually penalty-free. \nBut entering the weekend, just 10 of UK's 2026 league games are on track to be classified as Quad 1. That number would drop to nine if Georgia falls out of the NET's top 30. While this weekend's slate features a larger volume of games, next weekend's docket will also carry high stakes for the SEC. Kentucky will take on No. 22 St. John's in the CBS Sports Classic in Atlanta before No. 17 Arkansas and No. 7 Houston play at the Prudential Center in New Jersey. Also on tap for Dec. 20 is a showdown between No. 21 Auburn and No. 6 Purdue in Indianapolis. It may go against natural fan inclinations to cheer for conference rivals, but SEC hoops fans may want to swallow their pride the next two weekends. After a blockbuster 2024-25 campaign, the league's 2025-26 fate is hanging in the balance. \n            ",

The catalyst for Denver's success has been the play of second-year quarterback Bo Nix and a defense that is fourth in the NFL in points allowed. After a few hiccups, the Packers are back on track after winning their last three games. They supplanted the Bears as the NFC's top team after edging Chicago in a highly competitive game last Sunday at Lambeau Field. Like the Broncos, the Packers have enjoyed high-level play from quarterback Jordan Love and a defense that has been one of the stingiest in terms of points allowed. Here's how you can follow Sunday's action, already with a full breakdown and a prediction of how things might play out. \nWhere to watch Packers vs. Broncos liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, Colorado TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Packers 2.5, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)Packers vs. Broncos: Need to know Clutch Broncos. Eight of the Broncos' 10 wins during their winning streak were in one possession games. Each of Denver's last five wins were in one possession games, including last week's 24-17 win over the Raiders. Bo knows comebacks. Nix leads the NFL with six game-winning drives and five fourth-quarter comebacks. One of his secret weapons in the passing game has been rookie running back RJ Harvey, whose four touchdown catches trails only wideouts Courtland Sutton and Troy Franklin for the team lead. Mr. Clean. Nix has benefitted from an offensive line that has largely kept him upright. Nix has been sacked just 16 times and has the lowest percentage of sacks in the NFL on pass attempts. Mims the word. Wideout Marvin Mims has made an impact this season as a returner. He's averaging 16.4 yards per punt return and leads the NFL with 394 return yards. Sack artists. Nik Bonitto (12.5 sacks) leads a Broncos defense that has recorded a league-high 55 sacks. They're nine sacks from breaking their single-season team record, which was set last year. All you need is Love. Love has been extremely efficient this season with 22 touchdowns and just four interceptions. He's recently had a boost with the return of wideout Christian Watson, who has caught five touchdowns in Green Bay's last four games. Workhorse. While he hasn't rushed for 100 yards this season, Josh Jacobs has nonetheless been an indispensable part of the Packers' offense. He's rushed for a dozen touchdowns and has amassed 1,068 all-purpose yards. Parsons keeps rolling. Micah Parsons recently became the first player to record at least 12 sacks in each of his first five seasons. He saw his three-game streak with at least 1.5 sacks come to an end last week against the Bears. Packers vs. Broncos prediction, pick \nIn games as evenly matched as this, I typically give the edge to the team that has the better quarterback. That logic compels me to go with Love, who is currently playing at an MVP level. Love also has a better running game and a deeper receiving corps at his disposal. Pick: Packers -2.5, Under 43.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

But with their recent injuries at quarterback, the Colts felt compelled to ask Rivers if he had any interest in putting on the pads one last time. Rivers did, thus leading to the Colts signing him prior to Sunday's showdown in Seattle. Indianapolis (8-5) could certainly use some magic right now. After an 8-2 start, the Colts have lost three straight games and have slipped from first to third place in the AFC South standings. On Sunday, they'll face a 10-3 Seattle team that is neck-and-neck with the Rams in race to win the NFC West, if not have the best record in the conference.Here's how you can follow Sunday's action, already with a full breakdown and a prediction of how things might play out. \nWhere to watch Colts vs. Seahawks liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 14 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Lumen Field -- Seattle, Washington TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -13.5, O/U 42.5 (via DraftKings)Colts vs. Seahawks: Need to know Colts QB1? It'll be either Rivers or rookie Riley Leonard who will get the start on Sunday. Leonard's knee injury was one of the things that led to the Colts contacting Rivers, but if Leonard (who started the week as a full practice participant) is healthy, the safe assumption is that he will make his first career start in Seattle.  If grandpa starts ... It would be one of the most unique stories in NFL history. Currently a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Rivers would be the fourth-oldest starting quarterback in NFL history. He'll also join Hall of Famer Brett Favre as a NFL starting quarterback who was also a grandparent. Get Taylor going. If the Colts are going to have success, they're going to have to get a big game from Jonathan Taylor, the NFL's leading rusher. Taylor has averaged just 72.3 rushing yards per game since his 244-yard performance back in Week 10. Legion of Boom 2.0. Seattle's defense is once again one of the league's best. The Seahawks' unit is currently second in the league in points allowed, second in yards-per-carry allowed and third-down efficiency and sixth in red zone efficiency. Among the unit's top performers this season is linebacker Ernest Jones, who leads the team with 94 tackles and five interceptions despite missing two games. Can't stop Jaxon. Seattle is getting a career season from second-year wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba. The former Rose Bowl MVP currently leads the NFL with 1,428 receiving yards. He's caught at least seven passes in nine of the Seahawks' first 13 games. Steady Sam. Sam Darnold has picked up in Seattle where he left off last year in Minnesota. The former No. 2 overall pick is completing a career-high 68.1% of his passes with 22 touchdowns. Darnold has thrown 11 interceptions, but four of those came in one game. Colts vs. Seahawks prediction, pick \nIndianapolis is a good team, but its lack of stability at the quarterback position will continue to hurt them Sunday in Seattle. Unless either Riley or Rivers can pull off the unthinkable, the Colts will drop their fourth straight game while the Seahawks will pick up their fourth straight win. Pick: Seahawks -13.5, Under 40.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

It is as follows as noted from my esteemed colleague David Cobb:Every year since the 2003-04 season, college basketball's national champion has been ranked in the top 12 of the Week 6 AP poll. With more than two decades of precedent established, it's time to take stock of what that could portend for the 2025-26 season.Of the 12 teams in this week's Power Rankings, 10 also fit the criteria as top-12 AP-ranked teams. Only Houston and Alabama -- ranked 7th and 12th in the AP poll, respectively -- missed the Power Rankings. (And for posterity: Illinois, Nebraska and Virginia also narrowly missed the cut.)As always: The Power Rankings are a capsule in time to capture the hottest teams in college basketball. It is not a ranking of the best resumes nor a projection of how I'd rank current contenders. It's simply a ranking of how I'd order teams if I had to answer the question: Which teams are the hottest right now in the sport?Let's get to the rankings.\nWeek 1: Purdue | Week 2: Arizona | Week 3: Michigan | Week 4: MichiganCollege Basketball Power Rankings1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    Michigan remains at No. 1 for a second consecutive week after its dominant stretch continued with wins over Rutgers and Villanova this week by 41 and 28, respectively.

They face Alabama on Saturday with a chance to make a case it belongs back at No. 1.   Last week: 55\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    UConn won a big one Tuesday vs. Florida in a second-round rematch from March, 77-73. Don't let Florida's 5-4 overall record fool you: that is a high quality win vs. a good team. Huskies are 9-1 now with their final nonconference game upcoming Friday vs. Texas.   Last week: 86\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    In five games since its first and only loss of the season -- an 86-84 defeat to UConn -- BYU is 5-0 with wins over Wisconsins, Miami, Dayton, Cal Baptist and now Clemson. Its win over Clemson Tuesday inside MSG was an all-timer: BYU rallied from 22 down in the second half behind AJ Dybantsa's 22 second-half points and won at the horn on a  Rob Wright 3-pointer .   Last week: 97\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    Following its 40-point loss to Michigan in Vegas during Thanksgiving week, Gonzaga responded this week with wins over Kentucky and North Florida by 35 (!) and 51 (!!), respectively. The win over Kentucky was especially eye-opening as it handed the Wildcats their largest loss since 2008. Last week: 118\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    We may see Purdue play 25 more times this season and still not know why it no-showed last Saturday at home vs. Iowa State in an 81-58 loss. That moves it down two spots in the ranks but I'm still seeing it as a one-off outlier showing for now. Its 85-57 win over Minnesota on Wednesday is further proof this team still has the juice.  Last week: 69\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Michigan State slipped up for the first time this season on Saturday to Duke, 66-60. Sparty's still 8-1 entering the weekend with a resume that includes wins over Arkansas, Kentucky, UNC and Iowa.  Last week: 310\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    Backed by the fourth-highest scoring offense in college basketball, Vanderbilt improved to 9-0 this week with wins over Saint Mary's and SMU. It is one of eight undefeated teams remaining in the sport.  Last week: 711\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    That 89-80 win over Louisville on Dec. 3 is keeping Arkansas inside the rankings this week. It followed that win up with an 82-58 win over Fresno State on Saturday. Next up: a tough one Saturday vs. Texas Tech in Dallas.  Last week: 1912\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    Louisville's first outing since its first loss of the season (an 89-80 loss at Arkansas on Dec. 3) showed its mettle as it downed Indiana, 87-78, in wire-to-wire fashion. Cardinals, coming off a week of rest, are back up Saturday vs. Memphis at home.  Last week: 14\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The final week of the college football regular season has arrived, and several of Saturday's games will have playoff implications, including a heated SEC rivalry featuring the Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn Tigers at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Crimson Tide are 8-2 in their last 10 meetings against Auburn, but the Tigers are 5-1 against the spread in their previous six home games against Alabama. According to the latest Week 14 college football odds, the Crimson Tide are favored by 5.5 points on the road, while the over/under for Alabama vs. Auburn is 48.5. SportsLine's advanced computer model is backing Alabama, which is 5-0 in its last five games against Auburn, to cover the spread in 56% of simulations. The model is also backing Miami (-7) to cover the spread on the road against Pitt, while the Over (48.5) hits 63% of the time in North Carolina vs. NC State.

Auburn, meanwhile, is just 2-6 in its past eight games and 1-7 in its previous eight matchups against an SEC opponent. Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson, who's thrown for 2,934 yards and 22 touchdowns this season, has yet to throw an interception on the road, and SportsLine's model is expecting he'll lead the Crimson Tide to victory against Auburn. Alabama is projected to cover the spread in 56% of simulations on Saturday. Miami -7 vs. PittThe Miami Hurricanes need a convincing victory on Saturday to bolster their chance of making the College Football Playoff. The Hurricanes are coming off a dominant 34-17 victory on the road at Virginia Tech last week behind a strong showing from quarterback Carson Beck, who threw for 320 yards and four touchdowns. Miami has won 14 of its past 17 meetings against Pitt, a trend SportsLine's model is expecting to continue on Saturday. According to the model's projections, Miami secures a 35-26 victory, helping the Hurricanes cover the spread in 56% of simulations. Over 48.5 points in UNC vs. NC StateThe Tar Heels have disappointed in Bill Belichick's first season at the helm, entering Saturday's in-state rivalry with just four wins. However, the total has gone over in each of the past five meetings between these rivals. The total has also gone over in 13 of NC State's previous 18 games in ACC play. The Wolfpack have scored 48 or more points in two of their last three games at home, and SportsLine's model is projecting these teams will combine for 56 points on Saturday, helping the Over hit in 63% of simulations.Want more Week 14 college football picks?You've seen the model's Week 14 college football best bets for Saturday.

    "body": "\n        AUSTIN, Texas -- When No. 3 Texas A&M took the field at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium against rival No. 16 Texas for the first time in 15 years, they were greeted by chants from the home crowd. \"Overrated! Overrated!\" It may be a slight from Texas fans, but it was an unfamiliar one to the Aggies. The last time Texas A&M was ranked higher than the hated Longhorns in an AP-ranked matchup was 1985. The 2010 Aggies' win came in a year where Texas A&M was ranked and Texas missed a bowl. Simply, anytime Texas and Texas A&M have played meaningful football in the 21st Century, the Aggies have come in as underdogs. On Friday, the Aggies were the center of attention. They could cement their first SEC Championship Game appearance and first-round bye in the College Football Playoff. And perhaps more delicious, they could plant a dagger in the heart of the Texas playoff case. Instead, in a stunning 27-17 loss, the battered Aggies of old re-emerged. \n        \n            \n                2025 SEC Championship Game scenarios: Georgia clinches spot, Alabama and Ole Miss remain in contention\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We're going to drive to College Station for the next two hours and it's probably going to be really silent,\" linebacker Taurean York said. \"It hurts a lot.\" \nTexas A&M was resilient during its perfect 11-0 start, the first since 1992 in College Station. The program was defined by finding a way, whether it be through big plays from quarterback Marcel Reed or their star-studded defense. But against Texas, that confidence proved to be their undoing. The Aggies jumped out to a 10-3 lead at the half, and received the ball to start the third quarter. Texas A&M was 15-0 when leading at halftime under Mike Elko. A touchdown could have opened the floodgates. Instead, Texas A&M gave up one of its worst quarters of the season, a 17-0 run to Texas dominated by missed opportunities. There was a botched fourth-and-1 call that was called for a false start, forcing a punt. The secondary bit hard on an Arch Manning rushing attempt, leaving Ryan Wingo wide open in the end zone for a toe-touching catch. Texas running back Quintrevion Wisner took over for the second year in a row. \nTexas A&M fought back in the fourth quarter, but the damage was done. Quarterback Marcel Reed threw two bad interceptions -- including one in the red zone to safety Michael Taaffe. The collapse was on. \"We wanted to go to the SEC championship,\" York said. \"We're tired of losing to the same team in back-to-back years, tired of not winning that trophy.\" Across the season, Texas A&M lived on a razor's edge. They needed a magical fourth-down conversion to shock No. 8 Notre Dame 41-40 under the watchful eye of Touchdown Jesus. They outlasted Arkansas 45-42 and came from 27 points down in a 31-30 victory against South Carolina. \nIn big moments, Texas A&M has stood tall, but the on-field resume had some holes. The Aggies were 7-0 in SEC play, but the wins came against teams with a combined record of 11-41 in conference play. No. 16 Texas is the first team that Texas A&M played that was ranked in the committee's top 25 since Notre Dame in Week 2. Because of the mediocre resume, Texas A&M was the lowest-ranked of the remaining undefeateds at No. 3. Losing pushes them into the range of other one-loss teams. Certainly, No. 4 Georgia will jump them after outlasting No. 23 Georgia Tech. No. 5 Texas Tech will also have a chance if they win the Big 12 next week. With the disappointing loss against an up-and-down Texas team, will No. 6 Oregon factor in? Or No. 7 Ole Miss? And equally as disappointing, Texas A&M's conference title drought dates back to 1998. \nA rivalry game win is off the table, along with an SEC championship, but Texas A&M still has plenty to play for. The Aggies are a lock for the College Football Playoff with an 11-1 record in the SEC. A lone bright spot, the postseason could now head to Kyle Field if the Aggies fall out of the top four. \"There's a lot in front of us,\" Reed said. \"We've got a lot to work for, so we can't hold our heads down. We've got to get prepared for what's next.\" On a gloomy day in Austin, Texas A&M had a chance to silence critics and put the notorious Battered Aggie Syndrome behind them. Instead, once again, they came up short. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Stanford has hired Tavita Pritchard as its next football coach, the school announced Friday. Pritchard, who played quarterback for the Cardinal from 2006-09, is in his third season as the quarterbacks coach for the Washington Commanders after a long run at Stanford as an assistant. Pritchard will start in his role at Stanford immediately following the Commanders' game against the Denver Broncos on Sunday.Pritchard will be replacing interim coach Frank Reich, who took over the program earlier this spring after Stanford fired coach Troy Taylor amid an off-field controversy. Reich, the former head coach of the Indianapolis Colts and Carolina Panthers, has guided Stanford to a 4-7 record. The Cardinal closes out the 2025 season against No. 9 Notre Dame on Saturday.Pritchard started seven games in 2007 and all 12 games in 2008 before being replaced by Andrew Luck -- the current general manager of the football program who led the hiring process. \"Winning in college football today requires a leader of men who can build and motivate teams, recruit future stars, and develop and connect with talent,\" Luck said in a statement. \"Tavita Pritchard is exactly the right head coach at the right time to help us build on the foundation of this season and lead Stanford football to its next great era. Coach Pritchard is a culture builder, a teacher of football of the highest caliber, and a humble yet determined servant leader who is committed to the success of Stanford's student-athletes. I could not be more excited to welcome Tavita, Caroline and their family back to campus.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Wild coaching carousel enters final weekend: Where do Florida, Ole Miss stand? What's up with Auburn?\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPritchard began his coaching career with his alma mater in 2010 and stayed on in a variety of roles until 2022. He started as a graduate assistant and also worked as a defensive assistant before working his way up to several positions on the offensive staff -- running backs coach, quarterback and wide receivers coach and offensive coordinator/quarterback coach. Pritchard then joined the Commanders' staff in 2023 as the quarterbacks coach and oversaw the development of Jayden Daniels. Daniels, one of the league's brightest young quarterbacks, won NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year after helping guide his team to the NFC Championship game in 2024.\"Stanford is a place like no other and my family and I are full of gratitude to be returning home in every sense of the word,\" Pritchard said. \"I have a clear vision of the hard work, brotherhood and tenacity it will take to build a championship Stanford football program. I cannot wait to partner with Andrew and begin working with the best student-athletes in the world to achieve excellence on and off the field.\"\nHow did Stanford get here?Stanford hasn't had a winning season since 2020, when it went 4-2, and last played in a bowl game in 2018. Under Jim Harbaugh and David Shaw, Stanford had plenty of success during the 2010s, including 10 consecutive bowl appearances and three Pac-12 titles. Stanford won the Rose Bowl twice under Shaw (2012 and 2015) and won the Orange Bowl (2010) in Harbaugh's final season with the program before he left to coach the San Francisco 49ers.Stanford won at least eight games in Shaw's first seasons leading the program, but a downturn began thereafter. The Cardinal had a combined 14-28 record over Shaw's final four seasons and went just 3-15 in Pac-12 play across the 2021 and 2022 seasons. Under Taylor, Stanford went 6-18 -- 3-9 in both 2023 and 2024. Taylor's first year at the school was Stanford's final season as a member of the Pac-12. After the Pac-12 dissolved, the Cardinal moved to the ACC and have continued to struggle. Stanford went 2-6 against ACC competition in 2024 and is 3-5 this season under Reich. Since 2022, Stanford has had just one win over a ranked opponent. That came in 2024 against No. 19 Louisville.\nAnother reason for the recent decline is the use -- or lack thereof -- of the transfer portal. In large part due to Stanford's rigorous academic requirements, the Cardinal brought in just four transfers (per 247Sports) ahead of the 2024 season. However, that number went up to 18 this past offseason as the roster experienced significant turnover after Taylor's dismissal.Pritchard faces an uphill climb to bring his alma mater back to relevance and its glory days.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        AUSTIN, Texas -- As jubilant Texas fans floated their way out of Darrell K. Royal Texas Memorial Stadium, one burnt-orange clad spectator sai",
    "body": "\n        AUSTIN, Texas -- As jubilant Texas fans floated their way out of Darrell K. Royal Texas Memorial Stadium, one burnt-orange clad spectator said to nobody in particular: \"What a win, I don't even remember Athens, Georgia.\" That's the type of memory-erasing magic that comes with a victory in the Lone Star Showdown. The rivalry returned to Austin for the first time in 15 years with the century-old foes reuniting as members of the Southeastern Conference last season.Two years. Two Texas wins. Two heartbreaking SEC championship eliminations for Texas A&M. This game played out with a different cadence than the 2024 version. The No. 3 Longhorns led that 17-7 defensive showdown last season from start to finish. This time Texas trailed 10-3 at halftime to the No. 3 Aggies. \nBut like the 2025 Longhorns have done three other times this season in SEC play, they again got to again utter a variation of: \"They had us in the first half.\" Texas scored 17 straight second-half points to snatch the lead from A&M, closed things out with a pair of fourth-quarter turnovers and handed an 11-0 Texas A&M its first loss of the year. It's a victory that pushes Texas to 9-3 and gives the program an argument to be the first ever three-loss team to reach the playoff.\"These guys are so resilient,\" Sarkisian said. \"This team has been through a lot. When we lost (35-10) in Athens a few weeks ago most teams would have been dead and gone. They answered the bell.\" \nSarkisian rang the bell at halftime telling his team to show some pride, and the Longhorns responded by running with ruthless efficiency.Texas toted the ball 22 times for 157 yards on 7.1 yards per carry in the second half, almost double their average (3.77) on the season. Ahead of the game, Sarkisian showed Wisner a few clips of his 186-yard effort last season against Texas A&M. The Longhorns have struggled to run the ball this season and hadn't had a single game with a 100-yard ball carrier. Sarkisian wanted to create belief in his starting back.  Wisner answered with a season-high 155 yards, including a 48-yard scamper on Texas' opening offensive play of the second half. Sarkisian called inside zone. When Wisner saw the hole and all the green grass ahead of him, he compared it to seeing \"heaven\" open up. \n\"We controlled the game (with the run),\" Sarkisian said. Perhaps nobody responded Friday quite like Longhorn quarterback Arch Manning. A first-year starter labeled the sport's \"first flop\" midway through the year, every Manning throw has been dissected and his every move picked apart. He's played much better since Texas' Red River win over Oklahoma, but he struggled to throw the ball consistently against Texas A&M on a windy Friday evening in Austin -- finishing 14 of 19 for his fourth sub-50% throwing effort of the season. Manning found his accuracy late. He completed six of his final seven passes for 128 yards and a score.When Texas A&M cut Texas' 10-point lead to 20-17 with 9:15 remaining, Manning made the play. Sarkisian dialed up inside zone. Arch found the hole, made a linebacker miss on a shoestring tackle and ran to daylight for the game-clinching score. \n\"It got hard,\" Sarkisian said. \"(Arch) worked his way through it.\" It's a touchdown that led Texas All-American safety Michael Taaffe -- who had a game-sealing interception of his own on senior night -- to declare of Manning: \"The best player in college football, ARCH MANNING.\" People would have laughed at that statement midway through the year. Friday night, maybe with an eye toward 2026 when Manning is expected to return to Austin, it felt possible. After the game Texas A&M's Heisman candidate Marcel Reed, who threw a pair of fourth-quarter interceptions, pulled Manning aside and told him: \"Y'all deserve to be in (the playoff).\"\nThere will be no bigger talking point in Austin, and perhaps college football, over the next nine days than Texas' playoff case. The win over Texas A&M pushed the Longhorns to 9-3. But as every Texas coach and player who spoke postgame were eager to tell you, Texas isn't your usual three-loss team. Sarkisian came to the podium with stats:The Longhorns are the first team since 2019 LSU to beat three top 10 teams (Oklahoma, Vanderbilt, Texas A&M in the regular. \"Chew on that for a second,\" Sarkisian said.\nTexas' strength of schedule sits at 5th nationally per TeamRankings.comTexas played the No. 1 (Ohio State), No. 3 (Texas A&M) and No. 4 Georgia teams in the country Texas went 3-2 against top 10 teams in the regular seasonTexas is the only team to play No. 1 Ohio State to a one-score game this year.That Week 1 game against Ohio State might end up being the crux of Texas' case to the committee. Sarkisian hammered home the idea Texas didn't have to schedule Ohio State. It could have picked another Power Four game, won and finished 10-2. Taaffe went as far to say the Longhorns scheduled a game in Week 1 everyone enjoyed on national TV and the program shouldn't be penalized for it. \"What (message) do we want to send to the head coaches and athletic directors around the country?\" Sarkisian said. \"If we're a 10-2 team right now this isn't a discussion. We're in the playoff.\"I surely think we don't want us to punish us to do that. What are we going to do, we're going to go get out of these games like a lot of teams in the country have done, and they've got nice pretty records right now.\" \nOther teams would surely argue the Longhorns shouldn't have lost to a now 3-8 Florida team or have needed desperate comebacks against SEC bottom feeders Kentucky and Mississippi State. Either way, the committee will be forced to weigh Texas' candidacy because of its Lone Star Showdown statement. It's a victory that somewhat salvages a season that began with Texas ranked as preseason No. 1 for the first time in program history. No player defined that preseason hype (and the up-and-down nature of Texas' season) quite like the Longhorns' QB1. \nManning is just not quite ready to reflect on the season or a reality in which Texas doesn't get to keep playing into December.\"I think we're going to make the playoffs, I don't know why we wouldn't,\" Manning said. \"I'm not going to worry about.\" \n            ",

The seventh-round rookie teamed up with D'Andre Swift to help lead the Bears to a dominant 24-15 upset win over the Eagles on Friday. The biggest surprise was how easy the Bears were able to run the ball. Monangai rushed for 130 yards and a TD while Swift added 125 yards and a TD of his own on a day where the Bears totaled 281 on the ground. It was the most yardage the Eagles have given up on the ground since 2015. Going into Week 12, no team had topped 175 yards rushing against the Eagles this season. The win by the Bears capped a wild 48 hours for underdogs. There were three games on Thanksgiving and the underdog came out on top in each game with the Packers, Cowboys and Bengals all pulling off an upset. The Bengals, who closed as an 8-point underdog, pulled off the biggest upset of the weekend, but the Bears (+7) weren't too far behind. \nWith that in mind, let's get to our holiday grades.Chicago 24-15 PhiladelphiaGreen Bay 31-24 over DetroitDallas 31-28 over Kansas CityCincinnati 32-14 over Baltimore\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers missed last week's 31-28 loss to the Chicago Bears due to a fracture in his left wrist, but he will be back in the saddle for Pittsburgh's Week 13 matchup against the Buffalo Bills. Mike Tomlin told reporters on Friday that Rodgers was a full participant in practice, and carries no game designation into Sunday.\"It's all systems go,\" Tomlin said. Tomlin said Tuesday that they were optimistic Rodgers could return this week. The veteran signal-caller did not participate in practice on Wednesday, but returned as a full participant on Thursday and Friday. \"We'll start this week with great optimism although we certainly will limit him at the early portions of the week, provide opportunities for the other quarterbacks while preserving him,\" Tomlin said. \"But again, we're comfortable with the general trajectory, but I'll keep you updated in his level of participation and the quality of his participation over the course of the week will be the greatest indicator.\"\nTomlin told CBS Sports' Evan Washburn shortly before kickoff last Sunday that Rodgers did everything he could to put himself in position to start after suffering the injury during the Week 11 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals, but it was the \"prudent play\" to start Mason Rudolph. \"He fought his tail off all week, but that's the prudent play for us to make as a collective,\" Tomlin said on NFL Today+. \"He won't be playing this week. We'll let Mason start, and obviously, he's absorbed most of the reps this week.\" Rudolph completed 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards, one touchdown and one interception in his first start of the season. The Steelers out-gained the Bears 345 yards to 328, but 186 of Pittsburgh's total yards came on the ground.\nWhen it comes to Rodgers' return to the lineup, the wrist issue is not so much about pain tolerance as it is the ability for the veteran signal-caller to protect himself. The Steelers, now at 6-5, blew a 3.5-game lead in the AFC North to the Baltimore Ravens. However, the Ravens fell back to second place following their Thanksgiving night loss to Joe Burrow and the Bengals. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Four games over the course of Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday will limit the NFL DFS main slate on FanDuel and DraftKings, but there are still plenty of big names to consider on Sunday. Josh Allen, Christian McCaffrey, Puka Nacua and Trey McBride are some of the high-scoring options for NFL DFS lineups. Points, however, could still be at a bit of a premium with week with weather potentially impacting a few games and six games with an over/under of 41.5 scheduled for Sunday afternoon.How should all that factor into your NFL DFS picks this week, and who are the sleepers in the NFL DFS player pool that can help differentiate your lineups?

He's been one of the hottest players in the league recently, pilling up a whopping 390 scrimmage yards over the past two weeks. His 21 carries in Week 12 and 22 carries 11 were his two highest totals of the season, and he has remained a frequent target in the passing game as well. The Saints have given up the ninth-most rushing yards to opposing backs this season, making Achane a high-value play on Sunday. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Texans receiver Nico Collins at $6,700 on DraftKings and $8,100 on FanDuel. He had a quieter 3-55 receiving line last week on just three targets. That appears to be an anomaly, however, since he was targeted a total of 36 times over the prior three games and put up a 23-303-1 combined receiving line during that span. DFS players can confidently add him on Sunday against a Colts secondary that ranks 23rd in Fantasy points given up to opposing receivers. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 13 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        Luka Dončić led the Lakers to a 135-118 win against the Clippers Tuesday night, finishing with 43 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds. Despite the MVP-caliber night, Dončić made sure to note the safety hazard of the Lakers' neon yellow NBA Cup court, and asked for the league to change the courts altogether.\"Change the courts, please,\" Dončić said after the game. \"It's just slippery. It's dangerous. I slipped. I slipped a lot of times, and you could see a lot of players slipped. And that's dangerous, man.\"Later in the week, Dončić got his wish.The Lakers will not be using the yellow NBA Cup court in their group-stage finale on Friday. When L.A. hosts Anthony Davis and Dončić's former team, the Mavericks, the team will use a regular court. The Lakers' NBA Cup court was deemed \"unplayable\" by league court vendors, per ESPN, and was sent out for repairs.\nThis isn't the firs time Dončić has voiced concern about the NBA Cup courts. During the inaugural NBA Cup tournament in 2023 when he was still a member of the Mavericks, the All-Star guard called out the New Orleans Pelicans' court for being too slippery. Dončić said there were dead spots on the floor because of the court and that the Mavericks shouldn't have played on it because it wasn't stable.There is a difference between the Cup courts and the regular ones that are used for majority of the season. Because of the full-court designs and different colors, the entire court is essentially one big painted decal. On most of the Cup courts, there isn't a speck of wood grain showing through, which gives the players less traction when playing.Dončić noticed how slippery the court was during pregame warmups, and requested for it to be swept again. However, it didn't completely solve the problem.\nTraction problems aside though, Dončić clearly had no problem putting up massive numbers against the Clippers. He shot over 50% from the floor and 3-point range, though perhaps the reason he took 12 3-point attempts was because he didn't want to run the risk of slipping while trying to get to the basket. Either way, it didn't seem to impact his ability to put points on the board.\n            ",

I plan to use Shakir in plenty of my DFS lineups for this scoring period.Shakir is $5,500 on DraftKings and $6,300 on FanDuel, and he has the chance for a big game against the Steelers. Pittsburgh is No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and 13 guys have scored at least 15.3 PPR points against the Steelers this season.Shakir has at least seven targets in four of his past five games, and he scored at least 17 PPR points in two of those outings. In Week 12 at Houston, Shakir had eight catches for 110 yards on 10 targets.\nWe'll see if Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) can play this week for the Bills after missing the past two games, and we know Buffalo doesn't trust Keon Coleman, who has been a healthy scratch for the past two weeks. The Bills are so desperate for receiver help that they signed Brandin Cooks, 32, after he was released by New Orleans.Allen has one reliable receiver, and that's Shakir. And he should have the chance for another big game against the Steelers. \nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 13, click on this link to SportsLine.

Mayfield, who reportedly sustained a low-grade strain to his shoulder, was a limited participant Thursday but was back in practice Friday, leading to a more positive outlook for Sunday's game. \"He was very limited on Wednesday, he did a little more yesterday and he moved around perfectly today, so he's fine,\" Bowles said Friday.After Mayfield's initial injury in the first quarter of the Week 12 game, Mayfield re-aggravated his shoulder on a Hail Mary attempt in the second quarter. Mayfield did not play the rest of the game and spent the second half in a sling as Tampa Bay lost its third straight game. On Wednesday, Bowles said Mayfield was \"sore\" and his availability would come down to how he felt at the end of the week.\nThe Buccaneers (6-5) started the season 6-2, but this rough patch in recent weeks squandered their lead in the NFC South. Now tied with the Carolina Panthers at the top of the division, the Buccaneers are the No. 4 seed in the NFC with six games to play. Tampa Bay is gunning for its sixth straight divisional crown, but Mayfield's availability is paramount to reaching the postseason.Mayfield threw a touchdown pass and two interceptions in the first half of Sunday's loss in Los Angeles before exiting the game. He was among the league's leading MVP candidates through the first six games before the schedule stiffened.The Buccaneers host the Cardinals, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons over the next three weeks. Now in his third season with the Buccaneers, Mayfield made 45 consecutive starts and has not missed a game since 2022, when a high ankle sprain with the Panthers caused him to miss time. \nMayfield has thrown for 2,406 yards and 18 touchdowns this season with a 60.8 QBR, the second-highest rating of his career.\n            \n    ",

He recently served at the executive director for UCF's official NIL collective.\nTuohy's work background also includes being the assistant athletic director and director of football operations at Liberty, where the team finished the 2020 ranked 17th in the AP Poll. Prior to Liberty, Tuohy was the associate director of football operations and player personnel at Arkansas. \nA graduate of Loyola-Maryland, Tuohy played four seasons of college basketball and one season of football at SMU, where he earned his master's degree. Tuohy was portrayed by actor Jae Head in the 2009 movie \"The Blind Side\" that was based off author Michael Lewis' 2006 book which documented the Tuohy family's relationship with Oher, a future NFL offensive lineman, during his adolescence. In the movie, Tuohy is depicted as an energetic and knowledgeable young sports fan who helped Oher with his college recruiting. Sandra Bullock, who played the role of the family matriarch Leigh Anne Tuohy, won the Best Actress award at the 2010 Oscars.\nOher ultimately played at Ole Miss before being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played eight seasons in the NFL that included a Super Bowl win as a member of the 2012 Ravens.\n            \n    ",

Several conferences enter the weekend with crowded races at the top, and every kickoff has the potential to reshape who plays for titles as November winds down.The action begins Friday with a pair of midday showdowns. Kent State looks to finish a resurgent season on a high note, while Northern Illinois aims to preserve a home dominance in the series. Later, San Diego State travels to New Mexico in one of the weekend's most consequential games: a win sends San Diego State to the Mountain West Championship Game, while New Mexico needs both a victory and outside help to host the league finale for the first time in program history.You can bet college football games this week at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.

Later in the afternoon, Kennesaw State has a chance to reach the Conference USA Championship Game in just its second FBS season, heading to Liberty for a matchup that carries revenge potential after last year's meeting flipped the league narrative.\nThe nightcap features a rivalry with Mountain West stakes attached, as UNLV seeks both a win and multiple results across the conference to earn another shot at the league crown.

J.J. McCarthy will miss his sixth start of the season after he suffered a concussion last week in the 23-6 loss to the Green Bay Packers. McCarthy was injured during Minnesota's loss to Green Bay. He was on the field for the Vikings' final drive late in the fourth quarter and threw an interception to Packers defensive back Evan Williams that allowed Green Bay to run the clock out. It marked McCarthy's second interception of the game and 10th of the season. The 2024 first-round pick also threw for a season-low 87 yards and posted a passer rating of 34.2, the worst of his career. McCarthy has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns in four of his six starts this season. He entered the 2025 season as Minnesota's starter after the Vikings let Sam Darnold walk in free agency. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 13 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Bills bounce back vs. Steelers?

McCarthy returned on Nov. 2 and led the Vikings to a win against the Detroit Lions. The Vikings are 0-3 in their last three games with McCarthy leading the offense. McCarthy, who joined Minnesota as the 10th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, also missed all of his rookie season after tearing his meniscus in his first preseason game with the Vikings. \nWho is Max Brosmer?Brosmer, 24, found his way to the Vikings this offseason after going undrafted out of the University of Minnesota. In his lone season at Minnesota, Brosmer threw for 2,617 yards, 17 touchdowns and five interceptions while completing 66.8% of his attempts. Brosmer arrived at Minnesota after emerging as an FCS All-American at New Hampshire, where he started 34 games across four seasons. In his final season at New Hampshire, Brosmer threw for 3,464 yards and 29 touchdowns before using his final year of eligibility to transfer up to the FBS level. Despite a strong season at Minnesota, Brosmer went undrafted but caught on with the Vikings and made the team as the third-string quarterback behind McCarthy and Carson Wentz (who is also injured). In the preseason, Brosmer completed 60.3% of his passes for 364 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Brosmer has actually seen time in three games this season, completing 5 of 8 passes for 42 yards.\nAnd with McCarthy and Wentz now sidelined, Brosmer will make his first career NFL start on Sunday in Seattle. \n            ",

The format was once again altered this season, with the group stage of the tournament held somewhat inconsistently until the end of November. The week of Thanksgiving was instead stacked with three days of NBA Cup action to give fans with a bit more time on their hands some marquee basketball to watch.Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday all featured group stage games for the Cup, and Friday's slate concluded that round of the tournament.

After that, the final four shifts to Las Vegas for the semifinal and championship game. Those games are still to come, but for now, let's look at some of the big-picture winners and losers of the now-completed group stage.Winner: Orlando MagicIt's no secret that the beginning of the season was shaky for the Magic. The last thing anyone wants after trading four first-round picks for a player who has never made an All-Star Game in Desmond Bane is a 4-6 start that raises questions about the team's fit. The turning point came in Game No. 11, in which Bane hit a game-winning 3-pointer that sparked the turnaround. The Magic are 8-2 in their last 10, with Friday's win over the Eastern Conference-leading Detroit Pistons clinching their group and sending them to the knockout stage.\nA win like that can be validating. Yes, the first couple of weeks were tough for the Magic, but they've seemingly put those struggles behind them. They've had both a top-10 offense and defense in this 10-game stretch, a rarity for a Magic team that has spent 13 years in the bottom 10 offensively. Just getting to Vegas would be proof of concept for Orlando, a chance to show that this is a team built for big games. There aren't many of those this early in the season, but the Magic took their first on Friday, and now they have at least one more ahead of them.Loser: Milwaukee BucksA seventh-straight loss for the Bucks is obviously the bigger story. The feel-good vibes of their 8-5 start have seemingly passed, and a team that's desperate to win to appease Giannis Antetokounmpo ahead of his extension-eligibility is probably going to start feeling the heat soon.But that's not the only disappointment. The defending NBA Cup champion Bucks have now been eliminated from their repeat bid. Meanwhile, the 2023 champion Lakers stormed through their group with a 4-0 record. Now, the Lakers still have a long way to go as they seek a second Cup championship, but if they manage to win their next three tournament games, they'll have claimed two of the first three NBA Cups. If that happens, Milwaukee's 2024 trophy probably gets forgotten and the early stages of Cup history, much like overall NBA history, get written by the Lakers. \nWinner: Toronto Raptors and Phoenix SunsEvery NBA Cup features a breakout from a surprise team. The inaugural event was the world's introduction to Tyrese Haliburton as the Indiana Pacers went on a Cinderella run to Las Vegas that would eventually prove to be the beginning of something much bigger. A year later, it was the Houston Rockets bullying their way to Vegas and ultimately losing a semifinal rock fight to the Thunder before ultimately emerging as a Western Conference contender later in the year.We have two candidates this year: the Raptors and Suns. Toronto is 14-5 so far this season and won their group with an undefeated 4-0 record. The Suns pushed the Thunder to the brink on Friday and otherwise swept the rest of their group as they've emerged as as a far more balanced team than last year's star-driven disaster. Both have drastically exceeded expectations, but both come with real questions.The Raptors have tied for the NBA's sixth-easiest schedule thus far this year, and that doesn't include opponents' injuries that they've benefitted from. They've beaten Cleveland three times, for instance, but Darius Garland played in none of those games and Jarrett Allen played in one. The Suns have faced an even easier slate. In fact, only the Thunder had played worse opponents as of Friday. Both of these teams need some marquee wins against true contenders to earn real respect across the league. Well, the NBA Cup is a chance to do that. Make it to Vegas and suddenly you're playing top teams on the biggest regular-season stage available. So let's see it. If either of these teams is for real, let's see them get to Vegas like the Rockets and Pacers did.\nLoser: Houston RocketsThe Rockets have lost four games all year. Half of them have been in the NBA Cup. One was a road loss to Victor Wembanyama's Spurs. The other was a three-point loss to Nikola Jokić and the Denver Nuggets. That's all it took to knock Houston out. Tournaments like these always have a group of death. This year, it was West Group C, which also featured the plucky Portland Trail Blazers and the grizzled Golden State Warriors. There wasn't an easy win to be found in that group. Someone good was going to miss out -- it turned out to be Houston. Fortunately, the Rockets at least got their Vegas trip last winter. At this point, they're focused on a different trophy.Winner: Los Angeles LakersWe've already covered the concept of a possible Laker dynasty in the NBA Cup, but there's something a bit more meaningful to watch here. The Lakers haven't lost since LeBron James returned last week, but they haven't exactly faced a murderer's row of opponents. Two wins over Utah followed by victories over the Clippers and Mavericks feel more like a way to ease James back into the fold than any sort of meaningful statements.The Lakers need a measuring stick. The Spurs without Wembanyama may not qualify (more on them in a moment), but a trip to Vegas that would almost certainly include a date with the 18-1 Thunder certainly would. The last time the Lakers faced the Thunder, they got absolutely walloped. James didn't play in that game. He presumably would in a Vegas showdown. That's the best possible game this bracket can give us, and it's the best chance the Lakers will have to size themselves up against the competition early in the season. \nLoser: The NBALook, the NBA has no official preference when it comes to which teams advance in the tournament or in the playoffs for that matter. But before we even get into market-related conspiracies, we can at least acknowledge a league-wide desire for healthier teams to advance into these marquee games. This is the dilemma San Antonio's advancement has created.If Wembanyama were healthy, everyone would be thrilled to have the Spurs in the quarterfinals. Everyone wants to see him play high-profile games. But Wembanyama is sidelined with a calf strain. There is no telling at this point whether Wembanyama will be available to play when the quarterfinals commence a bit more than a week from now. The Spurs could obviously win without him -- they did against Denver on Friday. But come on, the world wants to see Wemby in Vegas, not the Wembyettes. Had Denver won on Friday, it would be the Nuggets advancing to the quarterfinals and setting up a fascinating Western Conference foursome featuring three title contenders and the upstart Suns. Instead, we're all left hoping that Wembanyama can make it back in time to face the Lakers. \n            ",

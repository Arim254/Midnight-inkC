    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs continue on Saturday with a two-game divisional-round slate. The Buffalo Bills travel to take on the Denver Broncos (-1.5, 45.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, followed by San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks (-7, 44.5) at 8 p.m. ET. Despite it being only a two-game slate, the NFL DFS player pool is still stacked with names like Josh Allen, James Cook, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Christian McCaffrey. Sam Darnold (oblique) is listed as questionable for Seattle, but told reporters he intends to play. Who are the best NFL DFS picks for Saturday, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel? Before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the divisional round on Saturday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Smith-Njigba as an anytime TD scorer (-110) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account.

In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the NFL divisional round Saturday DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for the divisional round on SaturdayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Saturday is McCaffrey. Arguably the most valuable all-around player in daily Fantasy football, McCaffrey, when healthy, has been a dominant force because of his ability to pile up stats as a runner and receiver. That continued on Wild Card Weekend when he piled up 114 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns against the Eagles. The Seahawks are stingy against opposing running backs, and they did a good job limiting McCaffrey in Week 18. He had 142 scrimmage yards against them in their first matchup, however, so there's plenty of evidence that he'll still be able to return value on the playoff slate. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet McCaffrey to go Over 50.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building around Bills quarterback Josh Allen. His passing stats have been down a bit this year largely due to struggles at wide receiver. He took matters into his own hands in the wild-card round, however, rushing 11 times, which tied his season high. He scored twice on the ground to add to his 273 yards and a score through the air. The Bills get a tough matchup against the Broncos, so you can expect Allen to use his feet again to move the ball. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet Allen to go Over 37.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set divisional round Saturday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Saturday. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Saturday, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Duke officials have growing concerns that star quarterback Darian Mensah could enter the transfer portal, multiple sources told CBS Sports.Mensah is one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the country after signing a multiyear deal last offseason that pays him $4 million annually, according to sources. His name has surfaced repeatedly this cycle as a potentially movable quarterback in conversations with industry sources, and that chatter has only intensified in the closing hours of the 2026 portal window as quarterback-needy programs look to add a proven passer.Mensah emerged as an all-ACC selection in his first year with Duke, finishing the 2025 season second nationally with 3,973 passing yards and 34 touchdowns.The 6-foot-3, 205-pound California native transferred to Duke last offseason from Tulane.\nWhy now for Mensah? Mensah and Duke were an ideal partnership during the 2025 season. Duke spent big to land him, and it led to an ACC championship. Meanwhile, Mensah emerged as one of the truly elite passers on the Power Four level, finishing in the top 10 nationally in almost every major passing category. There were even reports last month that Mensah decided to return to Duke for the 2026 season, passing on the NFL Draft to do so. At that time there were rumors Mensah could consider the portal. He was a popular potential name for several schools, but he seemed to shut all that down midway through December. \nBut in recent days Mensah's name began to pick up steam again talking with industry sources. There are several QB-needy teams without solutions to their quarterback issues, and no real answers to be found in the portal. The top 26 quarterbacks in the 247Sports portal rankings are all accounted for and the only quarterback in the top 50 with starting experience is EJ Colson, who is coming from Incarnate Word.Mensah, if he entered, would instantly be the most in-demand prospect in the portal. Duke is still trying to keep him, per sources, as it would be a devastating blow to lose him so close to the portal's shutdown at midnight on Jan. 16. \nIndustry sources also consider Mensah's contract language with Duke to be more stringent than those of other contracts across college football, which may make it more difficult for Mensah to get out of his deal. What would Duke do? If Mensah were to leave, it would put the Blue Devils in an extremely difficult position. There's only a few hours left in the 2026 transfer portal window and very few starter-quality players left on the board at quarterback. Duke's room has also experienced so upheaval during the portal window with backup QB Henry Belin transferring to Missouri State. \nThe Blue Devils did add North Alabama QB transfer Ari Patu, and they're optimistic about the future of true freshman quarterback Dan Mahan. Still, a starter, let alone an All-American candidate, leaving at the last moment would be devastating for Duke's hopes of repeating as ACC champions in 2026. Ari Patu \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Los Angeles Rams will face the Chicago Bears on Sunday afternoon in a fascinating NFL divisional round showdown that will feature even more intrigue due to the weather forecast in Chicago. The high in Chicago on Sunday is projected to be 21 degrees with the wind chill in the single digits at Soldier Field. On top of that, there's a 69% chance of light snow showers and 20 mph winds with gusts reaching 27 mph, per AccuWeather, as the Windy City will live up to its name. That will present a challenge for both teams, particularly in the passing game. Even with a pair of strong-armed quarterbacks in Matthew Stafford and Caleb Williams, throwing the ball down the field in 20-plus mph winds is exceedingly difficult. \n        \n            \n                Bears vs. Rams prediction: Can the Bears continue their magic by upsetting Matthew Stafford and the Rams?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Bears should at least be accustomed to playing in cold weather, even if it won't be ideal conditions for Williams, their second-year quarterback. The conditions figure to aid in their home field advantage against a Rams team from sunny Los Angeles that plays their home games indoors. \nLast year, the Rams lost 28-22 in the divisional round on a snowy evening in Philadelphia, and they may have to navigate similar cold and slick conditions on Sunday in Chicago. In that game, Matthew Stafford fumbled twice, losing one, and Kyren Williams also turned it over once with a fumble, with those two turnovers proving pivotal in a tight loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the eventual Super Bowl champions. Ball security will be paramount once again in frigid temperatures and potentially snowy conditions, and Stafford and the Rams will have to make some improvements on last year in that area if they are going to get the win. \nLos Angeles is a 3.5-point favorite on the road even with the forecast calling for extreme cold and winds, with a point total of 48.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook. \n            \n    ",

Realmuto and the Phillies are in agreement upon a three-year contract worth $45 million guaranteed the the chance to push the total value to $60 million. \nRealmuto, who's going into his age-35 season in 2026, is coming off a 2025 season in which he slashed .257/.315/.384 (91 OPS+) with 12 home runs in 134 games for the Phillies. For his career, Realmuto has an OPS+ of 110 across parts of 12 MLB seasons. Over that span, he's earned three All-Star selections and a pair of Gold Glove awards. While Realmuto's bat may be in decline, he remains a standout defender behind the plate, especially when it comes to controlling the running game. Realmuto has been with the Phillies since before the 2019 season, when they acquired him via trade with the Marlins. Realmuto first reached free agency following the 2021 season, but the Phillies re-signed him to a five-year, $115.5 million contract. He reached the market again this offseason before ultimately deciding upon a return to Philly. He'll enter the 2026 season, his eighth with the Phillies, with a career WAR of 38.7. That figure ranks 17th among primary catchers in the Integrated Era (i.e., since 1947). The retention of Realmuto marks a high point in what's been a mostly disappointing offseason for the Phillies. Most notably, lefty starter Ranger Suárez -- a key member of last year's rotation -- signed with the Red Sox, and then the Phillies lost out to the Mets in their vigorous bid to land free-agent infielder Bo Bichette. They did, however, re-sign slugger Kyle Schwarber on a five-year, $150 million contract.\nThe Phillies are coming off a 2025 campaign in which they won 96 games and the National League East title. However, they fell in the Division Series in four games to the Dodgers.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA trade deadline is just three weeks away, and the rumors are heating up. If this league has taught us anything, it's to expect the unexpected. Could a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade be this year's bombshell, or will the Milwaukee Bucks go in a different direction? It seems like teams are holding their cards close to the chest until we're a bit closer to Feb. 5, but until then there's no shortage of trade buzz to keep us intrigued.With that in mind, let's dig into the latest rumors and break down what we know.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Bucks searching for help for GiannisThe latest read on the Bucks and Antetokounmpo has been that Milwaukee isn't outwardly making him available via trades, and Antetokounmpo has said that he will never formally request a trade.So what we have is a situation where the Bucks now must do everything to get their franchise star help. Where that help comes from is unclear, but ESPN reports that the Bucks are expected to be \"major players\" ahead of the deadline. They have a first-round pick they can trade, but who are they targeting? Bucks general manager Jon Horst is reportedly \"looking for talent at basically any position,\" which tells you how desperate the situation is in Milwaukee.\nFortunately, it doesn't seem like Antetokounmpo is threatening to request a trade at this time, so the Bucks shouldn't feel pressured to make a short-sighted move just for the sake of it. But make no mistake, Antetokounmpo cares about winning above all else. The team's 17-24 record, which has them sitting outside the play-in, is not going to keep him patient.\n        \n            \n                Ranking the 10 likeliest NBA players to get traded at the deadline: Jonathan Kuminga, Michael Porter Jr., more\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Bulls could be active sellers on the trade market For years, the Chicago Bulls have peddled out the same mediocre team that is never good enough to seriously compete -- even in a weakened East -- but never quite bad enough to fully tank. Team vice president Arturas Karnisovas has been stubborn in the past about trading away pieces on this team, and as a result the Bulls have waited too long to get rid of some guys. That happened when they traded both Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, netting no draft capital in return. Their greatest asset, Alex Caruso, didn't even net a first-round pick, either. But now, after years of evidence suggesting this Bulls team should enter a full rebuild, it appears they're finally ready to do so.Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times reports that Karnisovas has reportedly been \"more transparent\" in trade talks with other teams and has been \"more realistic\" in asking prices for those players. That could result in the Bulls finally selling on some players they probably should've traded awhile ago, but better late than never.\nIt's unclear exactly who those players could be, but Coby White's name has come up in trade discussions in the past. CBS Sports' Sam Quinn suggested a mock trade that would send Ayo Dosunmu to the Houston Rockets to fill their need in the backcourt. In that deal, the Bulls would get a package that would include two second-round picks in addition to one of their own back.It's not the best package, but it would start a compiling of assets that the Bulls have been short on for years. It may be too late to tank for a top pick in next summer's draft, but this has been a long time coming for the Bulls. If they're finally ready to rebuild they certainly have options to help expedite the process along the way.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Heat's interest in Ja Morant has been 'overstated'Since it was reported that the Memphis Grizzlies are open to talking about trading Ja Morant, there haven't been many teams lining up to take him on. So far the Toronto Raptors and the Miami Heat have been listed as possible suitors, and Morant has been known to favor the Heat as a possible destination. However, ESPN is reporting that Miami's interest in Morant has been \"overstated\" as of late.\nInstead, the Heat have their eyes focused on the summer of 2028, and are avoiding taking on a bunch of contracts that extend into then as several major names are expected to be free agents by then. Guys like Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokić and Donovan Mitchell will all be unrestricted free agents, allowing Miami to take a run at a star.The reality of those players being viable options for the Heat is probably low, aside from Antetokounmpo, but that's assuming he's not traded somewhere else by then. Either way, it sounds like Miami has its eyes set on bigger fish than Morant.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Domantas Sabonis could be trade candidateThe Sacramento Kings are getting All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis back from a knee injury Friday after a 27-game absence, per ESPN. He's listed as questionable for Friday's game against the Washington Wizards, but is expected to play.\nThat's positive news for the 11-win Kings in more ways than one. Sabonis certainly elevates Sacramento's offense, but having him healthy also makes him a viable trade asset, which could be a possibility, as the Kings are expected to take trade calls on their \"high-priced veterans.\"That includes Sabonis, per ESPN, as well as DeRozan and LaVine. Sabonis would likely fetch the best package for the Kings, as LaVine is owed $96.5 million between this year and next. The Kings will be hard pressed to find a team willing to take on that much money for a player of LaVine's caliber. DeRozan's contract, while not as astronomical as LaVine's, is still difficult to move as he's owed $50.5 million between now and next season. DeRozan's age (36) doesn't help matters.Sabonis provides the best avenue to getting a worthwhile package in return, and now that he's back healthy, opposing teams can evaluate him again and make offers if Sacramento is willing to listen.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a funny thing about this game we play, Fantasy Football. The most important part of the NFL season, the playoffs, is largely irrelevant to most Fantasy Football managers. But for Dynasty managers, this is a time to watch for future value and there are still several players playing in the Divisional Round who could see their value spike or fall, based on the results of this weekend and the remaining playoffs.Unsurprisingly, most of the players on this list are guys who are younger and less proven. That makes sense, right? The less information we have, the more we should be open to changing our opinion based on a few games. But there is at least one veteran who could change perception, and for me, that is Sam Darnold. Darnold has put together back-to-back solid regular seasons. He's still just 28 years old. He is under contract through 2027. It feels like he should be a high floor QB2 at the very least. But he turned into a pumpkin in the playoffs last year, turned the ball over twice, and lost to the Rams in the Wild Card Round. And the Vikings moved on. This year, the Seahawks earned the top seed and a bye into the Divisional Round, so we're still waiting to see Darnold in the playoffs. If he repeats last year's performance we will have to wonder just how long his leash in Seattle is. On the other hand, if he leads the Seahawks to the Super Bowl, he should have multiple years of security as an NFL starter.In my early January Dynasty rankings update I had Darnold at QB25, behind Bryce Young, J.J. McCarthy, Baker Mayfield, Kyler Murray, Tyler Shough, and Matthew Stafford. He could pass several of those QBs in the next month. This week on FFT Dynasty I did a one-man mailbag answering your questions about 2026 rookie picks, Rashee Rice, and more. We are back to two episodes a week for the offseason and have a ton of great content planned for the Spring. Check it out:\nLuther Burden had a quiet start to the playoffs with three catches for 42 years in a win over the Packers. That came after he averaged 81 receiving yards per game in the final month of the regular season. He was one of the most polarizing wide receivers in the 2025 class and I am not sure his rookie season did much to change that. In truth I could have put any number of Bears in this article, but Burden seems to have the widest range of potential outcomes. After Week 18 I had him ranked as WR17 in Dynasty and a month from now anywhere from WR12-25 seems possible. One Bears rookie, Colston Loveland, has already secured his spot as a top five tight end heading into next year.Like Burden, Jayden Higgins had an uneven rookie season that wasw better in the second half than the first. Now he may get the playoff spotlight against New England without WR1 Nico Collins on the field. There are Dynasty analysts who believe Higgins has nearly as much upside as Burden, and there are others who believe he's a Dynasty WR3 at best. I have him at WR32 for the moment, but he could certainly change my mind with a big performance under the brightest lights against a difficult matchup.If you have read any of my Dynasty coverage this season, you know I am a big believer in TreVeyon Henderson. While it is hard to say he had a bad rookie season, with 1,132 yards from scrimmage and 10 TDs, it has been disappointing that he has been unable to wrestle more work from Rhamondre Stevenson. And Stevenson has been very good as of late. If that continues and Stevenson looks like he'll stay in New England next year I may have to reevaluate my RB8 ranking of Henderson in Dynasty. But if Henderson looks like the star I believe he is, you'll be hearing a lot more from me about him heading into 2026.\nRicky Pearsall isn't a rookie, but it feels like we may know even less about him than we do the rookies above. He has played 20 games in his two NFL seasons and he has played less than 60% of the snaps in six of those. Pearsall is fighting to play this weekend and has the potential to increase his value if he matches his production in his last two games, when he caught 11 passes for 181 yards. As of now, I have Pearsall as WR30, the perfect picture of a boom/bust WR3. That is probably where he stays unless he's able to give us multiple good performances in the playoffs.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Linebacker Devin White was able to double-dip on playoff money due to his four-game stint with the Philadelphia Eagles at the start of the 2024 season. He made $109,000 because the Houston Texans advanced to the AFC divisional round. White collected an additional $124,000 after Philadelphia won Super Bowl LIX.Compensation in the playoffs is much different than during the regular season. A majority of players take a sizable pay cut in the postseason because their salaries have no bearing on what they earn during the playoffs. Playoff money comes from a league pool instead of NFL teams. There is a specific amount for each playoff round, with each eligible player paid the same.Pay scaleRoundPlayer PayoutWild card round  -- other wild cards$53,500Wild card round -- wild card byes$53,500Wild card round – division winners$58,500Divisional playoff game$58,500Conference championship game$81,000Super Bowl -- losing team$103,000Super Bowl -- winning Team$178,000Players earn their base salary over the course of the 18-week regular season. For example, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, a 2025 first-team All-Pro, earned $888,889 per week from his $16 million base salary during the regular season. He made $53,500 for Los Angeles' wild-card playoff win over the Carolina Panthers, as did wide receiver Puka Nacua, a fellow 2025 first-team All-Pro, and the rest of their Rams teammates. For Nacua, the $58,500 he earned in the Rams' divisional playoff game represented a slight raise from his regular pay. Nacua earned $57,222 each week of the regular season from his $1.03 million base salary.The maximum a player can make in this season's playoffs from his current team is $376,000. To reach that total, the Super Bowl winner would have to be a division winner that participated in the wild card round. The only such teams remaining are the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots. It is $5,000 less for the other playoff participants. The remaining playoff teams whose players could make $371,000 are the Buffalo Bills, Denver Broncos, Houston Texans, Rams, San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks.\nFor a player like Texans long snapper Austin Brinkman, winning the Super Bowl would be more meaningful financially than for most of his teammates. Brinkman earned $850,000 in 2025 from his NFL contract. An additional $371,000 would amount to nearly 45% of what Brinkman earned playing football in 2025.\n        \n            \n                Ranking all 16 possible Super Bowl LX matchups as dramatic NFL playoffs reach the divisional round\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPayment eligibilityPlayers on the 53-man roster and injured reserve at game time receive payment for wild card and divisional playoff games.Practice squad players continue to get paid at their weekly rate for as long as their respective teams remain in the playoffs. That is $13,000 per week for most practice squad players. Longtime veterans make between $17,500 and $22,000 per week.\nTeams are allowed to expand the 53-man roster to 54 or 55 players by elevating up to two practice squad players for each regular-season or postseason game. The elevated players get paid like those on the 53-man roster and injured reserve for the first two playoff rounds. Nine-year veteran linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin collected $58,500 for the Bears' win over the Green Bay Packers to advance to the divisional round instead of $17,500 because he was elevated for the wild card game. He does not have to worry about that again after being signed to the 53-man roster to replace linebacker T.J. Edwards, who was placed on injured reserve after fracturing his left fibula against the Packers.Payment eligibility becomes more complicated for the conference championships and the Super Bowl. The payment requirements for those two playoff rounds are outlined below.\nFull amountPlayers on the 53-man roster when the game is played who have been on the roster for at least three previous games (regular season or playoffs).Veterans (at least one year of service) placed on injured reserve during the regular season who are still under contract when the game is played.Vested veterans (four or more years of service) placed on injured reserve during the preseason who are still under contract when the game is played.Players who are not on the 53-man roster at game time who spent at least eight games on the roster (regular season or playoffs), provided they are not under contract to another team in the same conference.The 49ers have perennial Pro Bowlers edge rusher Nick Bosa, tight end George Kittle and linebacker Fred Warner who are among the players eligible for payment through the second category. Warner could be activated from injured reserve for the NFC Championship Game if the 49ers beat the Seahawks in the divisional round.49ers edge rusher Keion White has the potential to double-dip in playoff money because of the last category. He is assured of $112,000 because the 49ers beat the Eagles in an NFC wild card game. White is entitled to a full share starting in the conference championship from the eight games he played with the Patriots before being traded to the 49ers, assuming New England gets that far. With both teams playing in the Super Bowl, White would get both the winners' and losers' shares for a total of $281,000. Thanks to the last category, the most White can make during this postseason is $555,000. That would require a 49ers-Patriots Super Bowl LX matchup.Cornerback Shaquill Griffin, who is currently on the Seahawks' practice squad, has a different quirky situation because of the last category. Griffin has been on Seattle's 53-man roster for eight games this season.\nGriffin would make $22,000 more than Seattle players on the 53-man roster for the final two playoff rounds because he would also get practice squad pay as long as he is not elevated for either of those games. For example, Griffin would get $103,000 for the NFC Championship game provided he is not promoted to the 53-man roster, while quarterback Sam Darnold, Seattle's highest-paid player, would make $81,000.Half amountPlayers on the 53-man roster when the game is played who have been on the roster for fewer than three previous games (regular season or playoffs).First-year players placed on injured reserve during the regular season who are still under contract when the game is played and signed a player contract or practice squad contract in a prior season.Non-vested veterans (one to three years of service) placed on injured reserve during the preseason who are still under contract when the game is played.Players who are not on the 53-man roster at game time who spent between three and seven games on the roster (regular season or playoffs), provided they are not under contract to another team in the same conference.Bears safety Chauncey Gardner-Johnson is in the same position White was in last season. He was released by the Texans three games into the regular season. Gardner-Johnson will receive no less than $117,000 in playoff money because of Chicago's wild card win over Green Bay. He stands to collect an additional $129,500 if Houston wins the Super Bowl.There is one more category that receives a one-quarter share for the conference championships and the Super Bowl: first-year players placed on injured reserve during the preseason who are still under contract when the game is played. They must also have been on a team's practice squad for at least eight games in a prior season or received one or two game checks while on a team's 53-man roster or injured reserve in a prior year to qualify for payment.\nPayments during the playoffs must be made within 15 days after a game is played.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Los Angeles Rams haven't had a lot of success against the Chicago Bears on the road, winning only 14 of their 37 regular-season games in the Windy City (14-31-2). Their only playoff contest in Chicago was a complete disaster as they racked up a mere 130 yards of total offense while getting trounced 24-0 in the 1985 NFC Championship Game.The fifth-seeded Rams hope for much better results when they visit Chicago to take on the No. 2 Bears in the NFC Divisional Round at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday at Soldier Field.Los Angeles (12-5) has lost its last four contests in Chicago, including a 24-18 setback last season in what was one of only six games in which Matthew Stafford did not throw a touchdown pass. The Rams dropped three of their final four road outings this campaign but went into Charlotte, N.C. last weekend and edged the Carolina Panthers 34-31 in the Wild Card Round as Stafford connected with Colby Parkinson for a 19-yard TD with 38 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to erase a four-point deficit.The Bears (11-6) won their first NFC North title since 2018 but entered their wild card matchup against the division-rival Green Bay Packers as 1.5-point underdogs. They trailed by 18 points at halftime but stormed back to score 25 in the fourth quarter and defeat the Packers 31-27 for their first postseason victory since 2010.Even though they made the playoffs as a wild card, the Rams are the second favorites at DraftKings to win Super Bowl LX at +320. They are behind only the NFC West champion Seattle Seahawks, who have +270 odds to capture the Lombardi Trophy.The Rams are 3.5-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 48.5 in the latest DraftKings NFL odds for Los Angeles vs. Chicago in the Divisional Round.Here is a look at the Rams vs. Bears matchup from a betting perspective.Rams vs. Bears odds\nOpening spread: Rams -3.5Opening money line: Rams -192, Bears +160Opening total: 51.5The line has not budged as the Rams have been 3.5-point favorites since it opened. Assuming nothing bizarre happens, they will join the 1976 Pittsburgh Steelers, 1977 Oakland Raiders and 2008 Philadelphia Eagles as the only teams since 1970 to play as road favorites multiple times in one postseason.Meanwhile, the Bears will be the fourth team in NFL history to be a home underdog twice in the same postseason. The 1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers upset Philadelphia their first playoff game but lost to the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, the 2008 Arizona Cardinals made it all the way to Super Bowl XLIII but lost to the Steelers and the 2017 Eagles beat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII. Chicago also will become one of only five teams to be a home underdog in the Divisional Round over the last 40 years.Rams betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 13-5 (including playoffs)ATS record: 12-6 (including playoffs)O/U record: 11-7 (including playoffs)The Rams were double-digit favorites against the Panthers in the Wild Card Round but didn't come close to covering, although they owned 14- and 10-point leads in the second quarter. However, all but one of their regular-season victories were by five or more points, including each of their five triumphs away from home.Los Angeles has covered the spread in two-thirds of its Divisional Round games since 1970, going 12-6. Last year, the Rams were seven-point underdogs against the Eagles and managed to cover as Stafford and Parkinson hooked up for a touchdown with less than three minutes to play in the fourth quarter of Philadelphia's 28-22 victory.Stafford, who is expected by many to win the 2025 MVP Award as he led the NFL in passing yards (4,707) and touchdown tosses (46), can match Aaron Rodgers' league record by throwing at least two TD passes in his ninth consecutive playoff game. The 37-year-old, who enters with a postseason-record four straight 300-yard passing performances on the road, also is one scoring pass away from joining Tom Brady and Peyton Manning as the only quarterbacks with two seasons in which they had a total of at least 50 regular-season and playoff touchdown tosses.Bears betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 12-6 (including playoffs)ATS record: 10-7-1 (including playoffs)O/U record: 9-9 (including playoffs)A cover by the Bears wasn't looking good last weekend as they trailed Green Bay 21-3 at halftime and were down 27-16 with just over 6 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter. But Caleb Williams connected with Olamide Zaccheaus for a touchdown and Colston Loveland on the ensuing two-point attempt with 4:18 remaining before throwing a 25-yard scoring pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 to play.Chicago hasn't done well against the spread in the Divisional Round since winning Super Bowl XX, going just 2-7. However, the club has had success against Los Angeles at home of late, covering in eight of their last 10 meetings at Soldier Field.Williams got off to a rough start in his postseason debut as he threw a pair of interceptions without guiding the Bears to a touchdown over the first three quarters against the Packers. But he finished with 361 passing yards and two TD tosses and can match the franchise record of seven consecutive games -- including playoffs -- with multiple scoring passes set in 1995 by Erik Kramer. Williams also can join Sid Luckman (two in 1941), Jim McMahon (three in 1985) and Rex Grossman (two in 2006) as the only QBs in Bears history to win multiple games in one postseason.Rams-Bears prop pick: Puka Nacua anytime TD scorer (-110)\nNacua found the end zone in nine of his 16 games during the regular season, including four of the final five. The 24-year-old wideout, who was the NFC Offensive Player of the Week twice in 2025, proved to be a double threat last week against the Panthers as he had a 14-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter and a 5-yard TD run in the second. It was the second rushing score of the campaign for Nacua, who has amassed eight touchdowns over his last six outings. The Bears allowed four different Green Bay receivers to score in their wild card win, so it doesn't seem likely that they'll be able to keep Nacua from doing so.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Denver Broncos have the No. 1 seed and a ferocious defense, but the Buffalo Bills have quarterback Josh Allen, so when the teams collide Saturday in the NFL Divisional Playoffs, it's tough to say which will win out. The Bills opened as 1.5-point road favorites in the Bills vs. Broncos odds at DraftKings, but now they are 1.5-point underdogs. Denver had the week off as the AFC Playoffs top seed, while Allen and the Bills battled to a 27-24 road victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars last Sunday. These teams met in an AFC Wild Card matchup last season, when Buffalo routed the visiting Broncos 31-7. Oddsmakers aren't expecting a repeat of that, but    There has been almost no movement on the spreads for the other games, but totals have seen some changes. After Broncos vs. Bills kicks of the NFL Divisional Round on Saturday at 4:30 p.m. ET, the Seattle Seahawks host the San Francisco 49ers at 8 p.m. ET. It's the third matchup of the season between the NFC West rivals, and top-seeded division champ Seattle is a seven-point favorite in the 49ers vs. Seahawks odds.On Sunday, the the Houston Texans visit the New England Patriots at 3 p.m. ET, and the hosts are favored by three points in the Texans vs. Patriots odds at DraftKings. The Chicago Bears are the only home underdog in the NFL Divisional Round, as the visiting Los Angeles Rams are 3.5-point favorites in the Bears vs. Rams matchup set for 6:30 p.m. ET. The Sunday games have the highest and lowest Over/Under points totals on the board, with Rams vs. Bears at 48.5 points and Patriots vs. Texans at 40.5.             Here, we will break down the NFL Divisional Playoffs odds and how they have been affected since lines first opened, with odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook. Bills vs. Broncos (Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET)\nOpen: Bills -1.5, O/U 46.5Now: Broncos -1.5, O/U 45.5Denver is covering in 51% of the SportsLine model's simulations. Bet the spread at DraftKings:\nAllen willed the Bills to victory last week, and the reigning league MVP is dead set on finally getting to the Super Bowl. He can make the AFC Championship Game for the third time in is career with a victory, but Denver is going to make him earn it. Denver led the league, by far, with 68 sacks in the regular season, and Allen was beaten up repeatedly in last week's victory. Buffalo was initially the favorite, but Denver's top seed and home-field advantage lured public money and the Bills will be without receivers Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers. The Bills are +650 in the DraftKings Super Bowl futures odds, just ahead of Denver (+700) and behind AFC top choice New England (+600). The Seahawks (+270) and Rams (+320) are the favorites.49ers at Seahawks (Saturday, 8 p.m. ET)\nOpen: Seahawks -7, O/U 45.5Now: Seahawks -7, O/U 44.5The Over is hitting in 57% of the SportsLine model's simulations. Bet the total at DraftKings:\nThe Seahawks stifled the 49ers in their 13-3 victory in San Francisco in Week 18, outgaining them 361-173, and now they're a touchdown favorite at home. The Lumen Field crowd is intense, and the Seahawks are coming in rested to face a 49ers squad that has been clobbered by injuries all year. Tight end and inspirational presence George Kittle is the latest major casualty with a torn Achilles, so it will be Christian McCaffrey or bust for the Niners. The star running back had just 58 total yards on 14 touches in the Week 18 matchup. Oddsmakers expect such a low-scoring game, but their opinions on the outcome haven't changed.      Texans at Patriots (Sunday, 3 p.m. ET)\nOpen: Patriots -3, O/U 41.5Now: Patriots -3, O/U 40.5 The SportsLine model has Houston winning 45% of the time, bringing value at plus money. Bet the Texans money line at DraftKings.\nThe oddsmakers and the public expect this one to be pretty low scoring, and about 80% of the handle and more than 70% of bets are coming in on the Under at DraftKings. That's because both defenses played great last week. New England sacked Justin Herbert six times, knocked him around many more and held the Chargers to 207 yards and a field goal in a 16-3 victory. The Texans allowed two field goals and just 175 yards and the defense scored twice in their their 30-6 victory against the Steelers. It also will be chilly, and there's a chance of some bad weather, depending on an approaching cold front.    Rams at Bears (Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET)\nOpen: Rams -3.5, O/U 51.5Now: Rams -3.5, O/U 48.5The Over is hitting in 52% of the SportsLine model's simulations. Bet the Over at DraftKings:\nThe Bears needed a lot to go right in last week's game against the Packers, and it did as Chicago scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to pull off a 31-27 victory. The Rams didn't have as easy a time against the Carolina Panthers as expected, winning 34-31 as 10.5-point favorites. The defenses are nothing special, and both offenses are capable, with the Rams No. 1 in total yards and scoring in the regular season and the Bears in the top 10. The Los Angeles pass rush could be the difference, as L.A. has 47 sacks, tied for seventh-most in the NFL, and is fourth in pressures.     \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Another chapter was added to the Mets' serialized frustrations of the 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason on Thursday night, when they lost out on their bid to sign top-ranked free agent Kyle Tucker. Tucker wound up signing with the reigning champion Dodgers, and that means Steve Cohen, David Stearns, and company had to move on to other names and other plans. Those plans were realized swiftly on Friday when the Mets agreed to terms with hard-hitting infielder Bo Bichette on a three-year pact worth $126 million. Just like that, some of those frustrations vaporized. The Bichette splash was a needed one in multiple ways for the Mets. Outside of the plain matter of roster needs, there had been an almost palpable frustration among Mets fans. Said frustration was in place after losing franchise home run leader and beloved Mets lifer Pete Alonso to the Orioles via free agency, then came the loss of lockdown closer Edwin Díaz (and his best-in-class closer entrance) to the Dodgers. Yes, Stearns did reasonably good work in approximating the outgoing value of Alonso and Díaz by signing Jorge Polanco, Devin Williams, and then Luke Weaver, but those names simply didn't resonate with paying customers, at least relative to the names \"Alonso\" and \"Díaz.\" The loss of Tucker was thus keenly felt after those disappointments. In that sense, the addition of Bichette -- our No. 3 ranked free agent in the 2025-26 class -- was made to order for the Mets. So while the Bichette addition eases the pressure to make a needle-moving addition this winter, the Mets presumably aren't done even as we enter the back half of January. Assuming that's the case, what might the Mets be plotting? Let's explore some options for the Mets and Bichette as the winter continues to unwind. Option 1: Pluck Cody Bellinger from the YankeesThe vigorous pursuit of Tucker of course suggests that the Mets are eyeing an outfield upgrade, and Bellinger certainly checks that box. He's coming off an impressive 5.1-WAR season with the crosstown Yanks, and over the last three seasons he has an OPS+ of 125. As well, Bellinger in 2025 played in 152 games, which is his highest tally since his MVP campaign of 2019. On the deployment front, Bellinger could slide into left field or center for the Mets, and he's also very much capable of manning first base should that post-Alonso role emerge as an acute need. If Bellinger supplanted Tyrone Taylor in center, one could argue that the Mets' lineup will skew too left-handed. That would mean it's essential for Stearns to assemble a bench with multiple options from the right side, but that's not a particularly heavy lift.\nBellinger is going into his age-30 season, which means there's decline risk to be considered if the contract he signs is a lengthy one. That, however, is often the cost of doing business when it comes to premium free agents, even as shorter-term, high-AAV deals like the one Tucker signed become more common. Bellinger for at least the next handful of seasons, though, projects as a highly valuable contributor. As well, the presently afflicted fan base would surely relish plucking yet another star outfielder from the clutches of the Yankees.Option 2: Add an aceThe Mets have an interesting rotation right now, and Nolan McLean has ace potential in the long-term. However, it's plainly light on known quantities who also provide frontline ability, and that's why the Mets may be best served to pursue rotation help. The prize, of course, is Tigers uber-ace and back-to-back AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal. It's far from certain that he's available in trade going into his walk year of 2026, but a Skubal blockbuster is very much within the range of offseason possibilities. To be clear, the Tigers should make a good-faith effort to sign him to an extension or, failing that, retain him in an effort to make the playoffs for a third straight year. If, though, Detroit does entertain serious trade talks about Skubal, then the Mets figure to be in the middle of them.\nSkubal's merits are plain to see. The 29-year-old lefty over the last three seasons has pitched to a 2.39 ERA with a 2.39 FIP to match, and he's struck out 31.5% of opposing batters -- a truly elite figure for a starting pitcher. The cost in trade will be high even with Skubal going into his walk year, but the Mets have the young talent to get it done. Freshly added to that pile of trade-able young talent is Brett Baty. Baty had likely been in line to be the Mets' regular third baseman this season, but that's now Bichette's province (with Francisco Lindor and Marcus Semien on the roster, Bichette won't be returning to the middle infield). Assuming willingness on the part of the Tigers to do such a deal, the Mets can cobble together an impressive package. Failing that, there's Freddy Peralta of the Brewers. Like Skubal, he's the 29-year-old walk-year ace of an upper Midwest club angling to keep their run of playoff appearances going. While he's not Skubal in terms of quality, Peralta has rather quietly become one of the best starting pitchers around. He's reached 200 strikeouts in each of the last three seasons, and Peralta is fresh off a 2025 campaign in which he put up an ERA+ of 154 in 33 starts and finished fifth in the NL Cy Young vote. Adding to his trade appeal is that he's owed just $8 million for 2026. Suffice it to say, Peralta would be a stabilizing presence at the front of the Mets' rotation, and there's indeed some reported interest on their part. There's also familiarity with Stearns, if that matters to either of them.\nIf, instead, the Mets turn to the free-agent pool to address their rotation needs, then Framber Valdez is probably the most alluring target. The 32-year-old port-sider is a sinkerball specialist who boasts some of the strongest groundball tendencies in the game today. That could pair well with a Mets infield defense that now features Semien at second base. The departure of Alonso may also help on that front. Valdez over the last four seasons has an ERA+ of 127, and he's averaged 191 ⅔ innings per campaign over that span. That's a bedrock arm and it's something the Mets can use. \nBefore moving on, let's note that Cohen has the financial wherewithal to land Bellinger and upgrade the rotation, even after springing for Bichette. Option 3: Let the kids play   In this scenario, the Mets would pull back from headline-grabbing market activity after landing Bichette and instead lean into their young talent base to complement the core of Juan Soto, Lindor, Bichette, and company. This broad approach would entail, among other possibilities, making McLean the Opening Day starter, shifting Vientos and his still-promising power bat to DH or first base (that's likely going to happen with Bichette now on board anyway), installing top prospect Carson Benge as an outfield regular, and turning to Jonah Tong and Brandon Sproat for rotation depth. There's also the very real possibility that young catcher Francisco Alvarez takes the next step in his development as a hitter. This, of course, is a risky approach and one that may not inspire Mets fans at the outset. If, though, the Mets received significant value from even some of those names above, then the fan base's tune would change and the Mets might find themselves back in the postseason with a brighter long-term future in tow. \nHowever, Cohen and Stearns decide to play it, the rest of the offseason in Queens will be a compelling one.  \n            ",

Moore. The Bears are the No. 2 seed and will get to host this game, but they are nevertheless underdogs in the contest.Los Angels staged a comeback victory of its own last week after previously having blown a large lead during the game. The Rams trailed twice in the fourth quarter against the Panthers, but came right back with a touchdown pass to take the lead and then ultimately win it. They were road favorites last week against Carolina and will be again this week in Chicago.Will the Bears continue their magical run, or will the Rams go into Soldier Field and win? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Bears vs. Rams liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 18 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Soldier Field (Chicago)TV: NBC/PeacockFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -3.5, O/U 48.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey storylinesCardiac Bears. Chicago has made a habit of comeback victories. The Bears have an incredible SEVEN wins this year in games where they trailed in the fourth quarter. They trailed the Raiders 24-19 before winning 25-24. They trailed the Commanders 24-16 before winning, again, 25-24. They trailed the Bengals 42-41 before winning 47-42 on a miracle touchdown pass with 17 seconds left. They trailed the Giants 20-10 before scoring back-to-back touchdowns to win 24-20. They trailed the Vikings 17-16 before kicking the game-winning field goal as time expired to win 19-17. And they had a pair of miraculous comebacks against the Packers, trailing 16-6 before winning 22-16 in overtime late in the regular season and then coming back from being down 21-9 to win 31-27 last week in the opening round of the playoffs.Matthew Stafford vs. Bears pass defense. Stafford is arguably the league's MVP. He completed 65% of his passes at an average of 7.9 yards per attempt during the regular season, throwing for a league-high 4,707 yards and 46 touchdowns while tossing only seven picks. Even while going through a cold streak during the game last week against the Panthers, he threw for 304 yards, three touchdowns (including the game-winner) and one pick. This week, he'll go up against a pass defense that led the NFL with 23 interceptions, but at the same time was extremely vulnerable against the pass. The Bears allowed opponents to complete 66.6% of their passes at an average of 7.6 yards per attempt, they got torched by the Packers in the first half a week ago. They clamped down after halftime, though, giving hope that they can do the same against Stafford and Co.Chicago's run game. After their Week 5 bye, the Bears had one of the most successful running games in the NFL. They tied for the NFL lead during that span with a 5.2 yards-per-carry average. They led the league with 2.16 yards per carry before contract, per Tru Media. They led the league with 45.6% of their rushes gaining five or more yards. They finished third in the league with 39 explosive runs. And their 47.4% rushing success rate was second in the league. Last week against Green Bay, though, the Bears didn't run the ball well. They had a 29.2% rushing success rate, their second-worst mark of the season behind only the season opener against the Vikings. D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai combined for 81 yards on 21 carries. The Rams allowed just 4.3 yards per carry this year, and gave up only 83 rushing yards against Carolina a week ago.Rams against the spread. As our John Breech noted, the Rams could be fighting against quite a bit of history if the spread on this game moves back to where it was earlier in the week. The line has dropped down to Rams -3.5, but it opened as -4.5, and as Breech noted, according to Pro Football Reference, there have only been 10 games over the past 50 years where a road team has been favored by four points or more in a playoff game, and it's been ugly for the favored team in that situation. They went 0-10 against the spread, including the Rams, who didn't cover against the Panthers. And they went 4-6 straight-up, with the three wins coming by an average of four points per game. If the spread moves back in their direction, this game will qualify for that list and the Rams would have to overcome some disadvantageous numbers.Prediction\nI picked the Rams to win the Super Bowl, so I'm obviously going to be picking them here. The Bears have been pulling rabbits out of their collective hats all season long, but I think that comes to an end against a team that looked like it was the best in the league for most of the year before stumbling a bit down the stretch. Chicago can't play as poorly as it often does for stretches of the game and expect to come away with a win against L.A. -- the Rams are too good on both sides of the ball for that, and we've seen that even if they do blow a lead, they have a trump card with Matthew Stafford and Co. In the end, I am again going to roll with the better quarterback's team to win. Especially in what should be a high-scoring game.Prediction: Rams 30, Bears 24\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

That defense is special, but we've seen teams with good quarterback play have success against them. Allen was good last week against the Jaguars. The Bills have run-defense issues, but the Broncos don't run it well. That means it's all about Bo Nix. Can he make the plays to win it? I think in the end, Allen will make the plays to pull off another tough road victory.Pick: Bills 23, Broncos 21San Francisco 49ers (+7.5) at Seattle SeahawksSaturday, 8 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a real challenge for the 49ers with all the injuries they've had to deal with, the latest being losing tight end George Kittle. The Seahawks beat the 49ers in the regular-season finale to lock up the top seed. That game was won by their defense. But left tackle Trent Williams didn't play in that one for the 49ers. That matters. I think Brock Purdy will keep the 49ers in this one, but the Seahawks will find a way to pull it out to advance to the NFC Championship.Pick: Seahawks 24, 49ers 20Houston Texans at New England Patriots (-3)Sunday, 3 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is all about the defenses. The Texans dominated the Steelers on Monday night, while the Patriots abused Herbert. The big edge goes to the Patriots offense. C.J. Stroud struggled against the Steelers, which is why Drake Maye has the advantage. Look for Maye to outplay Stroud as the Patriots win it in what should be a defensive-oriented game.  Pick: Patriots 23, Texans 17Los Angeles Rams (-3.5) at Chicago BearsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC\nThe Rams didn't look great in beating the Panthers last week, but they found a way. The Bears rallied to beat the Packers. The concern here is both defenses. They have had issues as of late. The Rams have secondary issues. The Bears do as well. But the Bears don't rush the passer either. This will be a day where Matthew Stafford lights that defense up. Look for the Rams to win a tough road game in a shootout against Caleb Williams.Pick: Rams 33, Bears 27\n            ",

In some ways that complicates the Power Rankings this week because of the emphasis I place on recent results, but in other ways it simplifies how the rankings shake out. The most obvious example of the latter is this: Arizona and Nebraska -- two of the three remaining unbeaten teams -- are 1-2 in this week's rankings.Arizona simply retained its spot at No. 1 after supplanting Michigan last week. But Nebraska moved from No. 6 to No. 2 after the chaotic week. The other unbeaten team, Miami (Ohio), moved up to its highest ranking of the season after its Tuesday win over Central Michigan advanced it to a perfect 18-0 entering the weekend. I punished the newly-imperfect teams in this week's Power Rankings but only marginally because, despite the emphasis on recent results, it's hard to justify putting Michigan, Vanderbilt or Iowa State outside the top-10. Because of my rankings criteria I do occasionally overcorrect.

A five-spot freefall puts the Wolverines in prime position to climb back into the top five soon with Indiana, Nebraska and Michigan State, among others, coming up the next two weeks. Last week: 28\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    The preseason No. 1 Boilermakers hold steady at No. 8 this week, though the gap between it and No. 4 is razor-thin. Now 16-1, this Purdue team is looking the part and finding a groove with the meat of Big Ten play on deck. Last week: 89\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    There aren't five teams in college basketball I'd bet as a national title pick over Houston. So admittedly having it at No. 10 feels borderline disrespectful. But as I noted above in the Purdue blurb, the gap between No. 4 and roughly No. 11 is so thin they are nearly interchangeable. Houston's wins over Baylor and West Virginia by 22 and 29 points this week, respectively, only solidifies that argument. Last week: 910\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    The first loss of the season for Vandy came Wednesday vs. Texas in a crash-and-burn that saw its typically high-flying offense muster a season-low 64 points. It has Florida and Arkansas up next in its next two outings. Last week: 311\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    Since Dec. 22 -- when Illinois began its current six-game winning streak -- no team is rated higher at BartTorvik.com than Illinois. That's right: Not Arizona, not Iowa State, not Nebraska, not Michigan. Its offense and defense are both rated fourth in adjusted efficiency at the site in that span and it has logged wins over Missouri, Iowa and Northwestern during that run. Last week: 1212\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Miami (Ohio)\n                    \n    \n    AP voters continue to disrespect Travis Steele's RedHawks by leaving his perfect (18-0) Miami (Ohio) team out of the top 25. I mean, what's a team gotta do to get some respect?! In this house, we respect perfection, and this RedHawks team is No. 12 this week, marking its highest spot in the Power Rankings all season. Last week: 1513\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    Gonzaga is ho-humming its way to another 30-plus win season and it extended its winning streak to 11 on Thursday by blasting Washington State by 21 points. It could be favored by double digits in every remaining regular season game in the WCC. Last week: 1014\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Sparty's won seven of their last eight -- with wins by 29 and 19 over USC and Indiana, respectively, since the calendar flipped to 2026. This team's defense and selfless offense is keeping it in the Big Ten title race and there are few teams who are a tougher matchup because of their physicality. Last week: NR15\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Virginia\n                    \n    \n    Doubt Ryan Odom's Cavaliers at your own peril. (Actually, no, don't. I can't in good faith advise you to doubt them at all.) They are very good. And they proved that again and again this week with wins over Stanford and at Louisville. This might be the best team in a top-heavy ACC. Last week: NR16\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Saint Louis\n                    \n    \n    The only blemish on Saint Louis' resume keeping it from perfection is a 78-77 neutral- court loss to Stanford the day after Thanksgiving. Josh Schertz's Billikens are 15-1 on the season with 10 consecutive wins. Last week: NR\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

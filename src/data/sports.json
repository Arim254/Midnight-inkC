In the past few days, we've seen the Cubs land Alex Bregman on a five-year, $175 million deal and the Red Sox sign Ranger Suárez to a five-year, $130 million deal. Heading into the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Bregman as the second-best free agent available while Suárez ranked No. 10. Hey, that's progress. Only four of the top 12 free agents still need homes, though it's six of the top 14 and that still feels like too many for Jan. 15. Movement is good and it sounds like we're about to see more. Tucker decision expected very soonThere is much reporting around free-agent outfielder Kyle Tucker that suggests his decision on where to sign will happen Thursday. Tucker was our No. 1 free agent heading into the offseason. The teams known to be heavily involved in the bidding: The Mets are said to have a \"four-year offer on the table,\" according to the New York Post. This deal would end up being a monster average annual value contract with something like $50 million per season and there's plenty of upside for Tucker in taking such a deal, only to hit the market again at age 32.The Blue Jays might be the home for Tucker if he prefers a much longer deal. \"The Toronto Blue Jays have really been the only team that has shown the willingness to go as deep as 10 years, potentially,\" ESPN's Jeff Passan said on Sportsnet. The Jays are coming off a trip to the World Series and already have a strong pitching staff and offense. The Dodgers have also been connected to Tucker (via the New York Post, for one). Many people tend to believe the Dodgers don't need anything else, but their current outfield has Tommy Edman in center and Andy Pages in left with Alex Call as a backup option. There's certainly room to add Tucker. At this point, any other team strongly in the Tucker bidding would be a surprise. \nRed Sox focused on bats nowAs noted above, the Red Sox have added Suárez to a great rotation headed up by Garrett Crochet, Suárez, Sonny Gray and Brayan Bello. As for the offense, it could probably use a little more thunder, particularly after losing Alex Bregman to free agency, and, sure enough, The Athletic reports that the Red Sox's focus is now adding a bat. The exploration for offense includes both free agency and trade. On the trade front, the Red Sox have a bunch of starting pitching depth right now and Bello was \"quietly shopped\" earlier this offseason. Maybe they go that direction again, only less quiet this time? Further, there is an extra outfielder on the team (Roman Anthony, Jarren Duran, Wilyer Abreu and Ceddanne Rafaela are all starting caliber and Masataka Yoshida is still around), so perhaps there would be a fit for Duran somewhere else. \nIf the Red Sox do go the route of free agency, Bo Bichette is still available and they could also make a run at Eugenio Suárez. Making a trade is always trickier, but Brendan Donovan of the Cardinals is known to be available and there have been rumors all offseason about the fit (plus, the Red Sox have already made two trades with the Cardinals this offseason in landing both Gray and Willson Contreras).\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

Buffalo defeated Denver in the postseason last year, while San Fran and Seattle split their two matchups this season.Your Sunday divisional round NFL bets would then center on Patriots vs. Texans at 3 p.m. ET and Rams vs. Bears at 6:30 p.m. ET. The Pats are on a 1-6 run versus the line when they have a rest advantage, with Houston coming off a Monday victory. Meanwhile, L.A. is the only Wild Card team that lost against the spread but won its game outright, as the Rams are 3.5-point road favorites in the latest divisional round NFL odds.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers in the Sony Open field as the first tee times in Round 1 come at 12:10 p.m. ET.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Russell Henley as the +1100 favorite. Matsuyama and Ben Griffin are at +1700, followed by Spaun at +1800. Morikawa joins Si Woo Kim and Robert MacIntyre at +2000, with Spieth a +4500 longshot. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Henley, the betting favorite who begins at 12:54 p.m. ET in Round 1 on Thursday, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: Ben Griffin, who is +1700, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. \"One of the best values on the board,\" McClure told SportsLine. \"My number is meaningfully shorter than the market, which is exactly what you want when laying a shorter outright.\" See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model's best bets also include five longshots of +3500 or higher in outright bets, including an enormous +40000 underdog. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 Sony Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        Russell Henley enters the new season as the odds-on favorite to win the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii. The American enters as the fifth-ranked golfer in the men's top 200. The former University of Georgia standout will be seeking his sixth PGA Tour win and ninth as a professional. His last win came at last year's Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay   Hill, Fla., in March. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 1:49 p.m. ET from Waialae Country Club in Honolulu. The tournament will be played on a par-70 course measuring 7,044 yards. Henley is the +1100 favorite (risk $100 to win $1,100) in the 2026 Sony Open odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. Other favorites include Hideki Matsuyama and Ben Griffin at +1700, J.J. Spaun at +1800, and Si Woo Kim, Robert MacIntyre and Collin Morikawa at +2000. Jordan Spieth, a three-time major winner, is a +4500 longshot. Before making any 2026 Sony Open picks, you need to see the 2026 Sony Open predictions and best bets from golf expert Brady Kannon. Kannon is an elite golfing handicapper with more than 30 years of experience in the industry. He's hit eight major outright winners since 2013. In the fall of 2022, he hit outright winners in three consecutive weeks: Russell Henley (40-1), Tony Finau (18-1) and Adam Svensson (150-1). Last season, he hit Hideki Matsuyama (22-1), Harris English (110-1), Ludvig Aberg (25-1) and Ben Griffin/Andrew Novak (25-1) in New Orleans. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nNow, Kannon has focused his attention on the 2026 Sony Open field and locked in his best bets and top sleepers. You can only see them here. Top 2026 Sony Open expert picks One of Kannon's 2026 Sony Open predictions: He's fading Tom Hoge, the 36-year-old TCU grad. He's +20000 in the outright market, and Kannon is staying away from him there and in bets like making the cut and head-to-head. \"The TCU Horned Frog has dipped to 99th in the OWGR and in five starts over the FedExCup Fall, Hoge missed the cut three times,\" Kannon said. \"In fact, dating back to the PGA Championship last May, Hoge has missed nine cuts over 15 starts on Tour. Hoge has played the Sony Open 10 times and despite a third-place finish in 2018, he has missed the cut four times. I am not banking on him returning to form just yet.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.\nAnother golfer that Kannon is fading is Tony Finau, who is +11000. The 36-year-old turned pro in 2007 and has earned six wins on the PGA Tour, one on the Korn Ferry Tour as well as two others. He registered his last win at the Mexico Open in April 2023.\"It has been a tumultuous past year or so for Finau, battling legal issues and a golf game that saw him finish top-10 just one time in 2025,\" Kannon said. \"Approach play, Scrambling, Greens in Regulation, Putting – you name it, Finau has dropped to 125th to 150th territory in the Tour rankings across the board statistically.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs continue on Saturday with a two-game divisional-round slate. The Buffalo Bills travel to take on the Denver Broncos (-1.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, followed by San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks (-7) at 8 p.m. ET. Despite it being only a two-game slate, the NFL DFS player pool is still stacked with names like Josh Allen, James Cook, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Christian McCaffrey.Who are the best NFL DFS picks for Saturday, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel? Before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the divisional round on Saturday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.You can also bet props like Smith-Njigba as an anytime TD scorer (-110) using the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the NFL divisional round Saturday DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for the divisional round on SaturdayOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Saturday is McCaffrey. Arguably the most valuable all-around player in daily Fantasy football, McCaffrey, when healthy, has been a dominant force because of his ability to pile up stats as a runner and receiver. That continued on Wild Card Weekend when he piled up 114 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns against the Eagles. The Seahawks are stingy against opposing running backs, and they did a good job limiting McCaffrey in Week 18. He had 142 scrimmage yards against them in their first matchup, however, so there's plenty of evidence that he'll still be able to return value on the playoff slate. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet McCaffrey to go Over 50.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building around Bills quarterback Josh Allen. His passing stats have been down a bit this year largely due to struggles at wide receiver. He took matters into his own hands in the wild-card round, however, rushing 11 times, which tied his season high. He scored twice on the ground to add to his 273 yards and a score through the air. The Bills get a tough matchup against the Broncos, so you can expect Allen to use his feet again to move the ball. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine, and bet Allen to go Over 37.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set divisional round Saturday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Saturday. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Saturday, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        New year, new golf ball, new set of irons ... same ol' Rory McIlroy. Beginning his 2026 campaign in Dubai as per usual, golf's latest grand slam champion got off to a fast start at the 2026 Dubai Invitational with an opening 5-under 66 to sit atop the DP World Tour event after Round 1.McIlroy leads David Puig and Connor Syme by a single stroke, while a cluster of competitors that includes Tommy Fleetwood, Shane Lowry and Patrick Reed occupy spots on the leaderboard at 2 under, three off the early pace.With new equipment in tow, McIlroy got off to a roaring start that saw four birdies fly onto his scorecard in his first five holes. From there, he was able to cash in three more around the turn and coast into the clubhouse at Dubai Creek Resort. The irons remained the top story as he continues to feel out his new set of P7CBs.\"If there's help to be had, I'll definitely take it,\" McIlroy said of the full switch to cavity backs. \"Yeah, I've been thinking about it for a while. And even in Dubai at the end of last year, I hit a couple of 5-irons that I misstruck slightly, and instead of it maybe coming up 5 or 7 yards short, it was coming up more like 10 to 15 yards short. \"So, I asked the guys at TaylorMade to build me up a set. And I actually went down to Australia with them, and with that firm turf down there, I felt like those irons were going through the turf better than the blades. And I practiced with them at home since. And I've got a new golf ball in play this week as well, the new 2026 ball. So overall, I like what I've seen at home, and today was a good test for it, and I felt like everything was pretty good.\"\nMcIlroy's move is not that surprising when analyzing his numbers from 2025. Though he won four times around the world and led the Europeans to a triumph at the Ryder Cup, his approach figures quietly dipped as the season progressed. By the end of the year, he produced his worst strokes gained approach season since his rookie year on the PGA Tour and was buoyed by the best putting numbers of his career.Notably, the 36-year-old particularly struggled with his mid irons. For all the talk of his wedge play and the improvements made last winter and spring, McIlroy fell off pace from 150-175 yards. He connected on less than 60% of greens in regulation from that distance -- roughly 15% less than the leader on the PGA Tour and 10% less than his previous year. Proximity and scoring experienced a drop, too.So, while this season may not be one ripe with motivational pillars like the last -- career grand slam aspirations, an Open in his home country and a Ryder Cup in the United States -- McIlroy suggests he may not need them as the work and the process of getting better is enough. If the first round in Dubai is any indication, he is well on his way.\n\"I like the work. I like the process. I enjoy doing challenging things,\" McIlroy said. \"And I think, if you can make that the important part, and you just make that routine, then you don't need motivation to do it. It's your lifestyle. It's what you do. And it's, I guess, who you identify as. And I identify as a hard worker and someone that likes to do those things, and I think the more and more you do that, the more it just sort of becomes who you are. And I've done it for so long now that if I didn't do it, it would feel pretty foreign at this point.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Throughout the offseason the CBS Sports MLB   experts will bring you a                                     weekly Batting Around roundtable,       breaking         down      pretty       much           anything.     The      latest   news, a      historical      question,          thoughts         about         the future  of         baseball,   all    sorts of     stuff. Last week we debated Freddy Peralta's future. This week we're going to do the same with Bo Bichette.    Where will Bo Bichette sign? Which team needs him the most?  R.J. Anderson: I think the Red Sox need Bichette the most. They just  lost incumbent third baseman Alex Bregman to free agency and there are  wide enough error bars on some of their internal options, at both second and  third, that there's a clear need for a more certain quantity. That  established, I think the Phillies are more likely to win a bidding war  between the two sides.   Matt Snyder: I agree that the Red Sox need him the most. Going back to last  offseason, that front office really botched things. Once they signed  Alex Bregman, they seemed to poorly handle the situation with Rafael  Devers (even if I have issues with how Devers handled it, the front  office isn't blameless here) and now they have neither player. Grabbing  Willson Contreras for first base and having extra outfielders doesn't  make up for the messy infield situation. Fortunately for the Red Sox,  youngster Marcelo Mayer looks like he can handle multiple infield  positions. There's room to add Bichette here to go along with Mayer and  Trevor Story to fill in the non-1B infield spots.   I'll say they get him.\nDayn Perry: I'll say the back-to-back champs, the Dodgers. Presumably  Mookie Betts is still the shortstop after his stellar defensive work  last season. Still, the Dodgers have infield needs. Hyeseong Kim is  really a bench player and not a starting second baseman, while Max Muncy  at third is going into his age-35 season and has played a total of 173  regular-season games over the last two years. More broadly, the Dodgers  could use a younger impact bat to go with their aging core. Bichette  checks all those boxes.   Mike Axisa: I'm going to go with the Yankees needing Bichette the most. They can put him at shortstop for a year, then slide him over to second base after Jazz Chisholm Jr. becomes a free agent. Anthony Volpe will miss the start of the season with shoulder surgery and hasn't given the Yankees a reason to keep him in the lineup no questions asked. The upgrade on offense will more than make up for the downgrade on defense. Also, the Yankees badly need to balance their lineup with a righty who gets the bat on the ball like Bichette. Their three best righty hitters are Aaron Judge (amazing), Giancarlo Stanton (hurt often), and Amed Rosario (bench guy). You've got to do better than that if you want to win the World Series.  \nAs for where Bichette will sign, I'm thinking he'll ultimately make his way to the Red Sox, which is a boring answer but I think the correct answer. They need an infielder (they needed an infielder even before losing Alex Bregman) and a righty bat, and the Ranger Suárez signing put them over the competitive balance tax threshold. Once you're over, you might as well keep spending. Go for broke or don't go at all, you know?  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        14 teams entered the postseason, and with a snap of a finger, nearly half have fallen into the abyss of the offseason after Wild Card Weekend. Soon enough, we'll be down to less than a handful of teams still vying for a trip to Santa Clara for Super Bowl LX. Before we get to that point, however, we still have the divisional round to watch unfold. As we gear up for another jam-packed weekend of playoff football, it's a fascinating time to take a snapshot of the remaining eight teams left in the race. Of course, each one of them is among the very best in the NFL, but who stands above the rest in this elite bunch? Below, you can find our rankings of the final eight playoff teams before the divisional round commences. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. San Francisco 49ersIf San Francisco were firing on all cylinders and healthy, they'd likely rival for the top spot on these rankings as opposed to being at the bottom. That's just not the case, however. The Niners have been snakebitten all season with injuries, and were just dealt a crushing blow on offense as tight end George Kittle went down with a torn Achilles against Philadelphia. Among the playoff teams this year, San Francisco has endured the most player games missed due to injury (including playoffs). Kyle Shanahan has put together an impeccable coaching performance to persevere through these injuries to this point, but the talent on the roster is starting to become remarkably thin. While Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey will spearhead the offense, Purdy will now have to throw to the likes of Demarcus Robinson and Jake Tonges to advance beyond the divisional round.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Chicago BearsIf we just told the Bears that every quarter was the fourth quarter, they'd be No. 1. For whatever reason, Chicago really only seems to come alive just when their backs are pressed firmly to the wall. Ben Johnson has pulled the strings of his team masterfully to get them atop the NFC North and to the divisional round, but there are some cracks. Caleb Williams has, at times, made throws that I'm not sure any other quarterback could make, including a sensational fourth-down pass to Rome Odunze that went for 27 yards to help spark the comeback against Green Bay last week. Then there are some moments where he badly misses a layup throw, which is puzzling. The biggest concern for Chicago's prospects to move beyond the divisional round, however, comes on defense. Lost in the glory of the comeback over Wild Card Weekend was Jordan Love throwing four touchdowns to four different pass catchers. As Chicago faces greater offenses -- like this week against the Rams -- the more those deficiencies on defense could be highlighted. Or they simply do what they always do and bend but not break en route to a chaotic comeback. The Bears are truly a roll of the dice. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Houston TexansHouston's defense is top-notch, and its dominance was on full display on Monday night against Pittsburgh. Taking away anything that the Texans offense did in that playoff matchup, the Houston defense won, 13-6, thanks to two turnovers going back the other way for touchdowns. The fact that one side of the ball can singlehandedly win you a game is a scary proposition for the rest of the league, particularly after a regular season where they allowed 17.4 points per game (second-lowest in the NFL). We stop short of putting the Texans inside the top-five remaining playoff teams, however, because of an array of questions on offense. Because Houston was superb defensively on Monday, it shaded how poorly C.J. Stroud played. The third-year quarterback was completely out of sync and had five fumbles on the night (two lost). He also had a brutal interception in the red zone, giving him three turnovers over the contest. The defense bailed him out and allowed just three points off of those turnovers, but that type of play is not sustainable for a deep playoff run. Houston may also be down top wideout Nico Collins due to a concussion for the divisional round, which would hurt the offense even further.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Buffalo BillsJosh Allen is the great equalizer of these NFL playoffs. While Buffalo may be ranked fifth on this list, it wouldn't be shocking to see them in the winner's circle and with a Lombardi Trophy in their hands when it's all said and done. Why? Because they have the best quarterback left in the playoffs in Allen, who can seemingly will his team to victory at a moment's notice. Against the Jaguars, it felt like Jacksonville had them in the crosshairs. That was until Allen put on the Superman cape in the fourth quarter. He completed 9 of his 11 pass attempts in the final period for 103 yards through the air, one passing touchdown, and added 21 yards and another score on the ground. When you have a quarterback capable of that, the sky is the limit. That said, the rest of the roster still does have some questions. James Cook is a strong running mate for Allen in the backfield, but the pass-catching group is lacking, needing to lean on the likes of Brandin Cooks, who arrived in late November. Defensively, Buffalo is weak against the run, which could be their undoing at some point as well.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Los Angeles RamsThe Rams offense has been on an absolute heater. Since Week 7, L.A. leads the NFL in points per game (34.3), total yards per game (405.8), and passing yards per game (269.8). That's large in part thanks to Matthew Stafford playing at an MVP level over that stretch and Puka Nacua continuing to put himself atop the conversation as the best receiver in the NFL. The wideout was once again clutch in the Rams win over the Panthers on Wild Card Weekend, catching 10 balls for 111 yards and two touchdowns (one rushing and one receiving). Nacua's 108.3 receiving yards per game average in the playoffs is the most all-time (min. four games played). With that kind of firepower and Sean McVay pressing the button on the sideline, the Rams are as scary as it gets this time of the year. \nOne aspect of Los Angeles that prevents them from vaulting much higher, however, is questions on defense. While they have a formidable pass rush headlined by Jared Verse, you can throw against them when given enough time in the pocket, as evident in Bryce Young posting 31 points last week, along with Jalen Coker and Tetairoa McMillan combining for 14 catches, 215 yards, and a touchdown. That requires Stafford and Co. to be perfect on offense. For the bulk of the season, they have been, but if they're knocked off kilter, it could be disastrous for the Rams hopes of another Lombardi Trophy. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Denver BroncosDenver enters the playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the AFC and boasts one of the best defenses in the NFL. This year's unit notched a franchise record 68 sacks, which is tied for the fifth-most in league history. They also had the third-highest pressure rate among teams this season. With that elite play on the defensive side of the ball in their back pocket and the comfort of playing at Mile High through the AFC Championship, thanks to earning the top seed in the conference, Denver doesn't need to ask its offense to do too much other than not turn the ball over. That said, Bo Nix has been able to make plays, particularly when falling a bit out of structure. The Broncos second-year QB has the most completions out of the pocket (80) since Patrick Mahomes in 2018. He was also 11th among all quarterbacks this season in EPA per dropback, so we're looking at a signal-caller knocking on the door of being top-10 in the league. Denver's rushing attack will need to improve with RJ Harvey, as they've struggled in the aftermath of losing J.K. Dobbins, but there are enough pieces in place for the offense to put up enough points and carry the baton from the defense. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England PatriotsNew England checks a lot of boxes for a team that can advance far in the playoffs, if not win it all. Drake Maye is a legit MVP candidate and is coming off a regular season where he led the league in completion percentage, yards per attempt, and passer rating. Meanwhile, Mike Vrabel is among the top coaches remaining in the playoffs and has orchestrated a remarkable turnaround with New England now 15-3 this season (including playoffs) after a 3-14 campaign under a previous regime in 2024. While New England has the coach and quarterback combo necessary for playoff success, maybe the biggest development in their hopes of a Super Bowl trip came on Sunday night when the defense ignited. The unit was not bad throughout the regular season, but it certainly leveled up to elite status over Wild Card Weekend, holding the Chargers to a mere field goal and sacking Justin Herbert six times in the contest. If that is what New England's defense is evolving into, it's the third pillar to a bona fide championship contender. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle SeahawksSeattle is the betting favorite to win Super Bowl LX at DraftKings Sportsbook, and for good reason. The Seahawks defense is second-to-none, ranking first in the NFL in points per game allowed (17.2), yards per rush allowed (3.7), and third down efficiency (32.1 conversion rate allowed). They were also second in the league with 4.6 yards per play allowed. That's the type of play defensively that Seattle has seen get to Super Bowls in the past. Meanwhile, the offense has been humming under offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, who is among the hottest head coaching candidates this cycle. Seattle averaged 28.4 points per game over the regular season, which ranked third in the league. Sam Darnold does provide a little bit of uneasiness when thinking about their championship aspirations due to his history, but the Seahawks quarterback has been largely stellar this year.  He was top-10 in the NFL in completion percentage (67.7), passing yards (4,048), and passing touchdowns (25) during the regular season. He has one of the top receiving weapons at his disposal in Jaxon Smith-Njigba and a backfield duo of Keneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet. With that defense holding it down on the other side, there is enough offense to make them the Super Bowl favorite. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        And then there were eight. The divisional round doesn't have the glitz and glamor of the Super Bowl or Championship Sunday, nor does it have the \"finally the playoffs\" feel of the wild card round.But it might just be the best weekend of the NFL's calendar -- a terrific combination of quantity (four total games, including the No. 1 seeds getting their first test) and quality. If you've made it here, you're legit. There are no pretenders left.\n        \n            \n                NFL divisional round picks: Our experts face off on Bills at Broncos, 49ers vs. Seahawks and more\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast year, we saw the Philadelphia Eagles just barely hold off the Los Angeles Rams in this round. We saw the Buffalo Bills rally past the Baltimore Ravens, with a Mark Andrews collapse spurring Buffalo's win. We saw the Washington Commanders continue to crash the party, thumping the top-seeded Detroit Lions.Saturday and Sunday will be filled with drama. Wins will be greeted with a few hours of jubilation before a return to \"What's next?\" Losses will be greeted with questions big and small.\nConsidering it all -- the quality of the teams, the star power, the potential for drama and entertainment value, the legacies and bigger-picture questions on the line -- we've ranked the four contests. Without further ado ...\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. 49ers at SeahawksSaturday, 8 p.m. ET on FoxThe bar here is really, really high. This is a fascinating divisional showdown. Can the 49ers keep their magical run going even after losing yet another star? (George Kittle tore his Achilles.) Can Sam Darnold really be the quarterback of a Super Bowl winner? He's never won a playoff game, and the only one he played in, he threw an interception, lost a fumble and took nine sacks in an unmitigated disaster of a performance.But really, the biggest reason this game lands here is we have proof of concept: Less than two weeks ago, the Seahawks beat the 49ers 13-3 to win the NFC West and earn the NFC's No. 1 seed. It was, obviously, an important game, but not a particularly exciting one. The Seahawks scored on their second drive and had the game in a stranglehold from there, with the defense absolutely dominating. San Francisco's 173 yards were its fewest all season by 50 yards.\nThe Seahawks can ride this formula, perhaps even all the way to a title. No Seahawks fan would complain. But from a neutral point of view, it's not necessarily the most enticing.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Texans at PatriotsSunday, 3 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABCI'll admit, there's a chance that this one is sloppy. Did you watch either of these teams' wild card games?The Texans led the Pittsburgh Steelers just 7-6 at halftime before the defense powered a 30-6 blowout. Still, C.J. Stroud had five fumbles (two lost) and an interception. The Texans' offense can be a rough watch. One night earlier, the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Chargers 16-3 despite Drake Maye throwing an interception, losing a fumble and taking five sacks.\nSo yes, it could be ugly.It could also be awesome.Maye can be a superhero, and he might need to be against Will Anderson Jr., Danielle Hunter, Derek Stingley Jr. and a monstrous Texans defense. There's a real chance for a back-and-forth affair between the potential MVP and the NFL's most dangerous defense. And while last week was ugly, don't discount Stroud, who made some really impressive downfield throws, nor a Patriots defense that dominated Los Angeles. This is a heavyweight battle, and either Maye takes an impressive next step, or the Texans continue to show their defense can carry them, even against high-level offenses.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Rams at BearsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBCThe Bears could rank highly in any matchup simply given their propensity for drama. Including last week's 31-27 comeback win over the Green Bay Packers, the Bears have played 12 one-possession games this season. They have an NFL-record seven wins in games they trailed in the final two games. That's drama. And let's not sleep on the Rams' flair for the dramatic, either. They needed a late game-winning drive to beat the Carolina Panthers 34-31.Matthew Stafford and Caleb Williams have two of the most talented arms in the sport. We'll see some truly \"wow\" throws from both. Puka Nacua has blossomed into a superstar, and the Bears will have their hands full trying to limit him. Davante Adams has tormented Chicago before, too, going back to his days with the Packers.\nThen you add in the spectacle. Soldier Field was absolutely rocking last week, and it will be again. The temperatures are expected to dip into the single digits. It's going to be cold. It's going to be physical. It's going to be a whole lot of fun.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Bills at BroncosSaturday, 4:30 p.m. on CBSLast week, I wrote that while this might look like Josh Allen's best chance to win a Super Bowl given the relative lack of established star quarterbacks in the playoffs, it also might be his hardest given the surroundings.Then he delivered: 273 yards and a touchdown on 80% (28 for 35) passing plus two more scores on the ground. He put the offense on his back with the Jacksonville Jaguars shutting down James Cook.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL wild card overreactions: Josh Allen is the biggest X factor of playoffs; A.J. Brown done in Philly?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHe may have to do it again, this time against the Broncos' excellent defense, one that led the NFL in sacks and boasts last year's Defensive Player of the Year, Patrick Surtain II, in the secondary.There's plenty for Bo Nix and the top-seeded Broncos to prove, too. Denver went 14-3, but the offense was a rollercoaster, one that usually finished on the upswing: Nix's seven game-winning drives led the NFL this season. Can he be more steady in the postseason? Does he even need to be?There will be questions about Allen's legacy (some unfair) until he wins a Super Bowl. There will be questions about Nix until he proves it on the playoff stage. This is what the playoffs are all about.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Thursday marks the open of MLB's 2026 international signing period,  one   of two ways major-league teams acquire amateur talent each year.  The annual July draft covers players born in   the United States,   Canada,  and Puerto Rico. Players from everywhere else in the world fall   into   international free agency.              Roughly 30% of current MLB players originally signed as international amateur free agents. That group includes superstars like Ronald Acuña Jr., Vladimir Guerrero Jr., and José Ramírez. Perennial contenders like the Dodgers and Yankees, teams that typically pick late in the draft, use international free agency to add high-end prospects to their farm system.   Future    All-Stars   will sign during the international free agency  window.  Maybe  even a future Cy  Young winner or MVP. A player who signs Thursday could even one day find himself in Cooperstown. Here's   everything  you  need to know going into the open of  the 2026 international signing   period.      Format   International free agency remains free agency because MLB and the MLB    Players Association did not agree to an international draft during  collective bargaining agreement talks in 2022. MLB  has pushed for an  international draft for decades, but the union has   resisted because it would strip players of  the freedom to pick their   team, not to mention limit their earning  potential. The collective bargaining agreement expires in December. Expect MLB to once again push for an international draft during labor talks.   \nThe international signing period used to run from July 2 to June 25,   but the start of the 2020-21 signing period was pushed back  to Jan. 15   because of the COVID-19 pandemic and that change was later made permanent. The  signing  period is now neatly confined  to a single calendar year, running from  Jan. 15 to Dec. 15. To be  eligible to sign, players must be  at least 16  years old and turn 17 by  Sept. 1 of the following year.  This year's  newly eligible players were  born between Sept. 1, 2008,  and Aug. 31,  2009.      Bonus pools   International bonus pools, the money teams can spend on players, are    tied to revenue and market size. Generally speaking, small-market  teams  get the  biggest bonus pools and large-market teams get the  smallest.  There  are  bonus pool penalties  for signing major-league  free agents  who declined the qualifying offer, and teams can trade for  an   additional 60% of their original bonus pool. The bonus pools are a  hard  cap. You cannot spend more than you're allotted.   Here are the 2026 international bonus pools as reported by Baseball America:   $8,034,900: Cardinals, Diamondbacks, Guardians, Orioles, Pirates, Rockies, Royals$7,357,100: Athletics, Brewers, Mariners, Marlins, Rays, Reds, Tigers, Twins$6,679,200: Angels, Braves, Cubs, Dodgers, Nationals, Phillies, Rangers, White Sox$5,940,000: Blue Jays, Padres, Red Sox$5,440,000: Astros, Giants, Mets, YankeesThe Blue Jays (Anthony Santander), Padres (Nick Pivetta), and Red Sox (Alex Bregman) each forfeited $500,000 in bonus pool money to sign a qualified free agent last offseason. The Astros (Christian Walker), Giants (Willy Adames), Mets (Juan Soto), and Yankees (Max Fried) each forfeited $1 million because they exceeded the competitive balance tax threshold.   \nBonuses of $10,000 or less do not count against  the bonus pool.  Players who get bonuses that small usually aren't great  prospects,  though every so often one breaks through and reaches the big  leagues.  Houston signed both Cristian Javier and Framber Valdez to $10,000 bonuses as amateurs, for example. The Tigers signed Eugenio Suárez for $10,000 way back in the day. International   players younger than 25 can sign minor-league contracts only.  Teams  cannot  entice these players by offering to put them on the 40-man   roster. Yoshinobu Yamamoto was posted out of NPB at age 25 and thus wasn't subject to the international bonus pools, allowing him to sign his  record $325 million contract. Roki Sasaki was posted at 23 and was subject to the bonus pools.      Top prospects   As good as scouts are these days and as much data as teams have, it is really difficult to project ahead when you're talking about players this young. A player who looks like the best prospect today could get lapped by several others in a few months time. It is the nature of the beast. Here are a few of the top prospects for the 2026 international signing period, listed alphabetically.   \nSS Wandy Asigen, Dominican Republic: Perhaps the most famous player in this year's international free agent class, Asigen has the defensive chops to remain at shortstop long-term, and MLB Pipeline praises his \"special left-handed swing.\" Asigen is expected to sign with the Mets after backing out of an agreement with the Yankees.   C Fernando Graterol, Venezuela: Graterol is the top backstop available in international free agency this year. \"Graterol's offensive profile centers around his big-time raw power ... Equipped with a cannon of a throwing arm, Graterol fits the bill of what clubs look for from a teenage catching prospect,\" writes MLB Pipeline. Graterol has been linked to the White Sox.   SS Luis Hernandez, Venezuela: The consensus No. 1 prospect of the signing period, Hernandez is touted as the best international prospect in several years. \"Gifted with immense physical projection and a laundry list of impressive  tools ... (he) also earns plus marks for his  work ethic and all-around baseball IQ,\" writes MLB Pipeline. Hernandez has been connected to the Giants.   \nLHP Andri Hidalgo, Dominican Republic: In a down year for international prospect arms, Hidalgo is considered the best pitcher available. MLB Pipeline says he has an \"extremely high ceiling\" thanks to a promising fastball/slider/changeup package. The Orioles have been connected to Hidalgo more than other teams.   OF Francisco Renteria, Venezuela: Renteria is the top power-hitting prospect available this year. He held his own during a brief stint in the Venezuelan Major League last summer and MLB Pipeline says he's earned comparisons to Pirates prospect Konnor Griffin, one of the best prospects in the minors. The Phillies has been most tied to Renteria.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The co-main event of UFC 324, featuring Kayla Harrison defending the women's bantamweight title against Amanda Nunes, has been postponed, CBS Sports has learned. Harrison underwent surgery on Tuesday to address herniated discs in her neck, according The Eagle Tribune, which first reported the postponement.The Harrison-Nunes fight was considered by many to be the biggest bout in the history of women's mixed martial arts. The matchup will be moved to a later date that has yet to be determined. Sean O'Malley vs. Song Yadong will now serve as the co-main event in the bantamweight division. Plus, Rose Namajunas vs. Natalia Silva at women's flyweight was moved from the featured prelims to the main card.The main card now reads as follows:Paddy Pimblett vs. Justin Gaethje, interim lightweight titleSean O'Malley vs. Song Yadong, bantamweightsWaldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Derrick Lewis, heavyweightsNatalia Silva vs. Rose Namajunas, women's flyweightsJean Silva vs. Arnold Allen, featherweightsHarrison, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in judo, won the bantamweight title with a second-round submission of Julianna Pena last June. The fight was Harrison's third in the Octagon after fighting the rest of her career in the PFL. Harrison has won all three of her UFC fights, with two wins by submission, clearing doubts many had that she would not be able to safely and consistently cut to bantamweight with her large frame. Harrison had fought at featherweight and, predominantly, lightweight during her PFL career.\nNunes is near unanimously considered the greatest female fighter in the history of the sport. She won the bantamweight championship at UFC 200, and after three successful defenses, moved to featherweight to win that title. Nunes moved back to 135 for four more successful title defenses before a shocking upset loss to Pena at UFC 269. Nunes won the rematch with Pena at UFC 277 and, after defending the title one final time against Irene Aldana at UFC 289, announced her retirement from the sport.Nunes entered the Octagon after Harrison's win over Pena, signaling a return from retirement to set up a massive fight that will now have to wait.In her career, Nunes holds 10 wins over women who have held UFC championships.\nUFC 324 takes place Saturday, Jan. 24, from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The event is the first in the landmark media rights deal between UFC and Paramount. It will stream live on Paramount+ and is included with the price of a subscription as the deal also marked the end of pay-per-view UFC events.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the most common things players and coaches talk about is winning one-on-one assignments. Yes, football is an 11-on-11 sport, but really, it's a series of one-on-ones. Lose too many of them, and the math is immediately against you. Win most of them, and your advantages grow exponentially.With the NFL down to just eight teams, there are a ton of the league's best players prepared to shine on the biggest stage -- to turn the math in their team's favor. It may be just a key play here or there. It may be an advantage a team tries to capitalize on over and over. Either way, these are five of the most important individual battles to watch as the field narrows from eight teams to four.(Note: All stats are from the regular season unless otherwise noted.)Patriots OT Will Campbell vs. Texans EDGEs Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle HunterCampbell (No. 4 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft): Six sacks allowed, 4.7% pressure rate allowed (seventh among 35 tackles)Anderson: 12 sacks (T-8th in NFL), 70 hurries (first), 21% pressure rate (first)Hunter: 15 sacks (third in NFL), 59 hurries (fourth), 17.7% pressure rate (10th)There's an argument about the \"best\" defense in the NFL, but the Texans have a straightforward path to being declared the \"scariest,\" and it starts with Anderson and Hunter. We saw it in Houston's 30-6 wild card romp over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Anderson had a half-sack and forced fumble on Sheldon Rankins' scoop and score that broke the game open, and Hunter had a sack as well. They combined for 11 pressures.\nCampbell has been mostly solid as a rookie blindside protector -- no easy task -- but he had a rough go of it in the Patriots' wild card win over the Los Angeles Chargers: five pressures and one sack allowed. It was just his second game back from a late-season knee injury, but that won't earn him any sympathy from Anderson and Hunter, who switch sides of the formation a decent amount and will be the toughest test this offensive line as a whole has faced. Drake Maye took five sacks against the Chargers.\nRams WR Puka Nacua vs. Bears CB Jaylon JohnsonNacua: 129 receptions (first in NFL), 1,715 receiving yards (second), 666 yards after reception (third)Johnson: 47.9 passer rating allowed as primary defender (16th in NFL); 0 rec TD allowed; PFF's No. 67 CB (out of 113)This section could really read \"Nacua vs. any Bears cornerback,\" considering how much Sean McVay moves his star wide receiver around. He'll line up on the right side, the left side and in the slot. It's an enormous challenge for Chicago.Johnson will take on at least some of that challenge. A Pro Bowler in 2023 and 2024, Johnson played in just seven games this regular season after suffering two different groin injuries, including one that required surgery. His return has been up and down, as the numbers above indicate. He's given up a lot of big plays, but he's also made some of his own. Nacua will be his toughest test yet, not just in a coverage sense but in a tackling sense, too.49ers WR Demarcus Robinson vs. Seahawks CB Devon WitherspoonRobinson: 22 receptions, 276 yards, one touchdown (regular season); six receptions, 111 yards, one touchdown (playoffs)Witherspoon: 8.9 yards per completion allowed (third out of 107 CBs); Pro Football Focus' No. 1 CBThat Robinson, a journeyman veteran on his third team in four years, is even on this list speaks volumes about the 49ers' injury issues. It's also a testament to both Robinson and the 49ers. Robinson showed impressive explosiveness and route running downfield, beating Eagles All-Pro Quinyon Mitchell multiple times.\nOf course, Mitchell had plenty of success as well, picking off Brock Purdy twice. Purdy is willing to push the envelope on what he can and can't get away with, meaning there could be opportunities for Witherspoon. The second-team All-Pro will line up on both sides of the field, and Robinson has emerged as San Francisco's top non-running back target with Ricky Pearsall, Brandon Aiyuk and now George Kittle out.Robinson and Witherspoon matched up just four times in the regular season. Robinson caught his only target against Witherspoon, but Witherspoon actually won the rep, stopping Robinson for a 1-yard gain on a crucial third-and-2.Bills RB James Cook vs. Broncos EDGEs Nik Bonitto and Jonathon CooperCook: 1,621 rushing yards (first in NFL), 12 rush TD; 1,912 yards from scrimmage, 14 TD scored; 39 rushes of 10-plus yards (second)Bonitto: 14 sacks (fifth in NFL), 19.4% pressure rate (second); PFF's No. 42 rush defense EDGE (out of 65)Cooper: 8.0 sacks; PFF's No. 24 rush defense EDGE (out of 65)Bonitto and Cooper are one of the NFL's premier pass-rushing duos, but the more important aspect Saturday could be how they hold up in the run game. The Bills are going to want to lean on their running game as much as possible, not only to limit Denver's fearsome pass rush but also to avoid having their underwhelming pass-catching group face a terrific secondary (more on that in a bit).\nCook has been terrific this season. He gashes teams between the tackles and outside of them. Cook had 149 carries out wide (behind the tackles or around the edges), the most in the NFL, and his 45.6% success rate on those carries was fourth-highest (minimum 100 carries).Denver, meanwhile, ranked just 19th in defensive rushing success rate from Weeks 11-17. Bonitto and Cooper aren't weak run defenders by any stretch of the imagination -- Cooper in particular is active against the run -- but it's not their main strength, either. If they can hold up against the run, though, they'll get opportunities to attack Josh Allen.Bills TE Dalton Kincaid vs. Broncos LB Alex SingletonKincaid: 39 receptions, 571 yards, five touchdownsSingleton: 135 tackles, 1.0 sack; PFF's No. 31 coverage LB (out of 66)It'd be easy to drop in Patrick Surtain II against a Bills wide receiver here, but the Bills are so injured at wide receiver that it's not a fair fight. Right now, it looks like it'd be 32-year-old Brandin Cooks vs. the 2024 Defensive Player of the Year. Cooks has had some nice moments, but pinning the responsibility of \"winning\" the matchup vs. Surtain isn't relevant. The Broncos' secondary is going to have a huge advantage pretty much across the board.\nRather, Kincaid vs. Singleton could be a more telling matchup. Kincaid battled a variety of injuries throughout the season, but he's a big, fast athlete who provides a vertical element to the Bills' passing game and can line up in a variety of spots. He and Dawson Knox could be the focal points of the passing attack; they combined for six catches for 58 yards and a touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars.It remains TBD how the Broncos will deal with this. Could they move Surtain onto Kincaid when he lines up as a wide receiver? Or slot cornerback Jahdae Barron? Singleton has been the Broncos' most-targeted primary defender against tight ends, though, so for now, we'll settle there. He's solid in this aspect and showed impressive range and recovery speed on this deep ball to Zach Ertz earlier this season.\n            ",

We've got a lot going on in the sports world right now as we wait for another round of the NFL playoffs. The MLB hot stove is still burning, college stars are making their NFL Draft decisions and college basketball is providing some jaw-dropping moments.Let's get right into it, shall we?  💰 Five things to know Thursday Giants working to finalize a deal with John Harbaugh. New York put on the full-court press to land Harbaugh, and it seems like that aggressive strategy has paid off. The Giants are finalizing a contract that will make Harbaugh their next coach. Since Tom Coughlin's firing in January 2016, the last six coaches in New York have combined for a 55-109-1 record. Harbaugh, who went 180-113 in 18 seasons with the Ravens, should bring competency and stability to the sideline.Ranger Suárez has signed a $130 million deal with the Red Sox. After missing out on Alex Bregman, the Red Sox needed to make a big splash, and they did just that on Wednesday. Boston signed Suárez to a big $130 million contract, and he will bolster an already deep starting rotation. Suárez is coming off a 2025 season with the Phillies in which he posted a 3.20 ERA and 151 strikeouts.Oregon quarterback Dante Moore is returning for the 2026 season. One of the most highly-anticipated NFL Draft decisions belonged to Moore, and he'll be staying in Eugene for one more season after leading the Ducks to the College Football Playoff semifinals. In a rather shallow quarterback draft class, Moore could have been a top-five pick, but that possibility wasn't enough to pull him away from Oregon. With 3,565 passing yards, 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, Moore will be one of the best returning players in the country next fall.Kentucky stunned LSU, 75-74, with a buzzer-beater to complete an 18-point comeback. The Wildcats were in desperate need of a big win, and the got one in dramatic fashion on Wednesday. Down 38-22 at halftime in Baton Rouge, Kentucky trailed by as many as 18 points in the game. The Cats roared back in the second half, posting 53 points, and the last two came on a buzzer-beater from Malachi Moreno as the clock hit zero.Real Madrid suffered a stunning 3-2 loss to Albacete in Copa del Rey. In a shocking result from the world of soccer, Albacete eliminated Real Madrid from Copa del Rey with a 3-2 win. Albacete currently plays in LaLiga 2, and the club is closer to being relegated again than it is to gaining a promotion to LaLiga. The Alvaro Arbeloa era just began for Real Madrid, and things couldn't have gone much worse. 🏈 Do not miss this: Top 50 NFL free agents \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            There are still seven games left in the NFL season, but for 24 teams, the offseason is already underway. Their attention has turned to improving in 2026 and beyond by way of free agency and the NFL Draft. Our Garrett Podell has highlighted the top 50 players in the 2026 free agent class, and more than a few players made themselves a lot of money this past season. The most high-profile of those players is Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens, who proved that he has what it takes to be a true No. 1 option in this league. \nPodell: \"George Pickens exceeded all expectations in his first season with the Dallas Cowboys. The Pittsburgh Steelers gave up on him because of his public displays of frustration and traded him to Dallas for a 2026 third-round pick and a late-round pick swap. Pickens then erupted with career highs in nearly every receiving metric for the first Pro Bowl selection of his four-year career, and was named to the 2025 All-Pro second team.\"Other big-ticket players include Bengals defensive end Trey Hendrickson, Colts wide receiver Alec Pierce and Jets running back Breece Hall. One team that could be in the market for a quarterback is the Jets. (Again.) With Oregon quarterback Dante Moore returning to school, the Jets are still trying to find an answer at the most important position in sports.  ⛳ 2026 PGA Tour season predictions, picks \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            The 2026 PGA Tour season gets underway at the Sony Open on Thursday, and our experts have everything you need to get ready for another year of golf in one extensive preview. \nI'll give you all one guess as to who the unanimous pick for Player of the Year was -- no spoilers here -- but the discussion about which players are locks to win a major championship were interesting. Patrick McDonald is calling his shot with 45-year-old Justin Rose, who he thinks will dig deep for a little more major magic. McDonald: \"He will be 120 years old, and yet, I will still have faith in him winning a major. This should really go to Scottie Scheffler; it could go to Rory McIlroy. But they are free spaces at this point, and you're looking for a little something extra, so why not the 45-year-old Englishman? We know what he can do at the Masters. He won his lone major championship in Philadelphia, where the PGA Championship is being played. He is a past U.S. Open winner, and he can never be doubted at The Open, either.\"As the players get set to tee it up in Hawaii, check out our Sony Open preview. Not only do we have odds for the favorites, but we also have winner picks for the people.  🏀 NBA Power Rankings: Embiid leads surging 76ers \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The NBA season is full of ups and downs, and the 76ers seem to be riding a wave upward. They're now 6-3 in their last nine games, and they've reached fifth place in the Eastern Conference. Perhaps more importantly -- for our purposes -- they're up to No. 7 in our latest NBA Power Rankings. \nThe two players dragging Philadelphia up the standings are Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid. As Brad Botkin writes, the Sixers are going to need Embiid to be at the top of his game if they're going to do any real damage in the postseason. Botkin: \"Tyrese Maxey or Joel Embiid has led the team in scoring in the last 13 games. That's how it has to be if the Sixers are going to make real noise, which it's starting to look like they might be able to do in the East. Embiid is back to dominating.\"Because the weekend is almost here -- and I'm in a good mood -- here's a sneak peek of the top 10: 6. Suns (-2) 7. 76ers (+7) 8. Spurs (-3) 9. Clippers (+1) 10.

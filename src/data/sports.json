    "body": "\n        The NFL Week 12 matchup on 'Sunday Night Football' pits NFC contenders as the Los Angeles Rams host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Rams (8-2) are tied with Philadelphia for the best record in the conference and are riding a five-game win streak. L.A. knocked off Seattle, 21-19, in Week 11. Tampa (6-4) sits atop the NFC South but has dropped three of its last four, most recently falling to Buffalo, 44-32. The Rams have won eight of the last 10 matchups between the teams. The Bucs have ruled out Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot), while receiver Chris Godwin (fibula) is active for the first time since Week 5.Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The Bucs won the last matchup, 16-13, back in 2022. The latest Buccaneers vs. Rams odds have Los Angeles as 7-point home favorites. The over/under for total points scored is 49.5 via SportsLine consensus. L.A. is at -368 on the money line (risk $368 to win $100), with Tampa at +290 (risk $100 to win $290).

Despite the outcome versus Buffalo last week, Tampa did put up 32 points on the scoreboard, which is its second-most of the season, despite not having Godwin, and the Buccaneers could take advantage of a slumping pass for rush the Rams. L.A. hasn't recorded a defensive sack in back-to-back games and has just one QB takedown over its last three games. Los Angeles also gave up its second-most rushing yards of the year (135) last week versus Seattle, so there are defensive holes that Tampa's top-10 scoring offense can exploit. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Rams can coverRecent spread results favor L.A. which is 4-1 ATS during its five-game win streak, while Tampa is just 1-3 ATS over its last four. Recent on the field results also tilt in favor of the Rams, who have won eight of the last 10 meetings between the teams, including in the postseason. This year, Matthew Stafford is the MVP favorite as he leads the NFL in passing touchdowns (27) for a Rams team which is well balanced on both sides of the ball. L.A. has the No. 6 scoring offense and the No. 2 scoring defense, making it one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. The Rams also boast the second-best turnover differential (+10) in the league and have the second-best ATS record at 7-3. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Buccaneers vs. Rams picksSportsLine's model has simulated Rams vs. Bucs 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Top-10 scoring offenses meet on 'Sunday Night Football' when the Los Angeles Rams host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at SoFi Stadium at 8:20 p.m. ET. It should be a fertile setting for offense with Los Angeles averaging 27.2 points per game, while Tampa Bay averages 25.2 points. The NFL DFS player pool for this showdown slate includes big names like Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua, Baker Mayfield and Emeka Egbuka.Injuries are a factor, especially for Tampa Bay, with Mike Evans (collarbone) and Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot) both out. However, Chris Godwin (fibula) is active for the first time since Week 5, though he is expected to be on a snap count. How should that impact your NFL DFS lineups? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Buccaneers vs. Rams, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

One of the top receivers in the league, the third-year pro out of BYU has put together a 73-850-4 receiving line thus far despite missing a game due to injury. He's found the end zone in four of his past six games, and the Rams added a new wrinkle last week as he took two carries as well, and he already ran for a 45-yard touchdown earlier this season. The Bucs rank 21st in Fantasy points given up to opposing receivers, setting up a golden opportunity for Nacua to return value in this spot. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Bucs tight end Cade Otton. He had a quiet day last week against the Bills, but he's just two weeks removed from a big 9-82 day against the Patriots. He hasn't been targeted less than five times in his past six games, and with Mike Evans still on injured reserve, Otton will likely continue to be a big target that Mayfield can lean on, especially since the Rams have allowed three TE touchdowns over the last three weeks. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Buccaneers vs. RamsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Sunday Night Football'.

Now Todd Bowles is indicating that Bucky Irving (foot) and Chris Godwin (leg) are ramping up at practice and could be available as early as Sunday night. Having either back would be a huge morale boost, but Mayfield and Egbuka alone could pose problems for a Los Angeles pass defense that ranks 21st in the NFL. The model predicts that Tampa Bay covers in 58% of simulations.Under 49.5 pointsDespite the fact that teams have been able to move the ball through the air against the Rams, Los Angeles ranks second in the NFL in scoring defense. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers defense is struggling of late but the Rams are also coming off one of their worst offensive performances of the season against the Seahawks. The Under has hit in four of five Rams game and the model predicts that it hits in 55% of simulations for Sunday Night Football.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        In Week 12, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 13 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Dylan Sampson, RB, BrownsThe Browns haven't decided on a starting quarterback for Week 13 just yet, but it would be unlikely they don't stick with Shedeur Sanders. That is great news for Sampson. One thing the Browns are going to focus on with Sanders at quarterback is providing him with easy outlets in the pass game. Sanders has taken very first first-team reps and he hasn't seen many plays at NFL speed (preseason isn't the same speed). Screen passes and designed quick hitters to Sampson will serve as an extension of the run game they intend to lean on. Sampson has proven himself an explosive playmaker from earlier this season and I have a sneaky suspicion he might become a player with a role in a Sanders-led offense. I'm stashing him this week in 12-team leagues or deeper.Shedeur Sanders, QB, BrownsSanders' raw stat line looks a lot better than his EPA per play, but raw stats play in Fantasy Football and as long as he can hit a few explosive plays each game then he is at the very least worth monitoring. I'm waiting for this week to confirm it on the All-22, but it feels pretty obvious Sanders should have been starting over Dillon Gabriel weeks ago. I say that as someone skeptical of Sanders' ceiling. It's more of an indictment of Gabriel. But Sanders does do a few things that are Fantasy friendly. He can create off script throws downfield because he keeps his eyes up when he's breaking pocket. He is also a lot more accurate than Gabriel which will lead to more plays like the long gain to Jerry Jeudy where he broke pocket, reset his feet and then relied on his mechanics to deliver the ball accurately downfield. I've watched Gabriel miss these throws all season. Sanders has enough on offense and a budding rapport with Sampson. I wouldn't add him in leagues that start just one quarterback just yet.\nCam Ward, QB, TitansWelcome to the Fantasy Football world Mr. No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward! We've seen flashes before this season, but Ward put together a strong second half and it translated to his breakout Fantasy performance of his rookie season. Ward racked up 256 passing yards and a touchdown and he ran more. Ward finished with six carries for 37 rushing yards and a touchown. He was the fifth-highest scoring Fantasy QB heading into Sunday Night Football. Ward may have some late season value in 2QB and SuperFlex leagues. John Metchie, WR, JetsIt's the Tyrod Taylor era for the Jets -- at least for now -- and he certainly likes to get Metchie involved. Metchie finished Week 12 with six receptions on seven targets for 65 yards and a score. For now, he's just a stash. Metchie could work his way into the WR3 range in specific plus matchups if he can continue to build his rapport out with Taylor. \nDarnell Mooney, WR, FalconsThis one only applies to shallow leagues, but if Mooney is still on your waiver wire, fix that. He is and has always been a favorite of Kirk Cousins. Their rapport will continue to grow with more practice reps. Mooney is a threat to score on any touch. Cousins can still get the ball out on time -- well at least some of the time -- despite some of the physical traits dropping off.\n            ",

But given a week of preparation, Sanders looked much more prepared and poised. He completed a 52-yard pass to Isaiah Bond earlier in the game, a completion that had been Cleveland's longest of the year before the pass to Sampson above.With the touchdown pass, Sanders also went over the 200-yard passing mark.\nCrucially, Sanders has for the most part avoided mistakes. After throwing an interception and taking two sacks in just one half of action last week, Sanders had one interception and just one sack at the time of his touchdown throw.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are now 90 minutes from their first MLS Cup appearance in their history after defeating FC Cincinnati 4-0 at TQL Stadium on Sunday. As has been the case during the playoffs, the Herons have been able to lean on their talisman in Messi, who opened the scoring with a header in the first half before he added a hat trick of assists, being involved in all four goals. That's his sixth goal of the MLS Cup playoffs so far, but this game was far from a solo effort by the Argentine. \nWith Luis Suarez available following his suspension, manager Javier Mascherano was left with an important choice of putting him back in the lineup or continuing on with 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti. Mascherano continued with Silvetti, and he put in a professional performance, assisting Messi's opening goal before adding to Miami's lead with a lovely finish of his own to make it 2-0. With only six appearances for Inter Miami following his move from Newell's Old Boys in August, you would've thought that Silvetti was leading the line the entire season with how his movement synced up with Messi and Tadeo Allende while Suarez looked on from the bench.As Suarez is 38, we could be seeing the future of the nine for Inter Miami taking hold in the playoffs now. Silvetti already has a goal and two assists in two playoff appearances, and it'd be hard for Mascherano to take him out of the XI with the Eastern Conference final on the line. Miami have yet to win a trophy this season, so capping things off with an MLS Cup title would be a sweet way to end the season, and there's a chance that they may be able to continue things at Chase Stadium to also close the stadium out on a high with the new Miami Freedom Park set to open in 2026.\nIf New York City FC defeat the Philadelphia Union on Saturday night, Miami will not only host the Eastern Conference final, but they'll have hosting priority for the remainder of the playoffs due to having more points in the Supporters' Shield standings than any of the remaining teams outside of the Union. If the Union win, they'd host the final.Playing home or away hasn't been an issue for the Herons, who have found their balance during these playoffs. New the end of the season, Mascherano gave Rocco Rios Novo the starting job at goalkeeper over Oscar Ustari, and he has run away with it, and when it has mattered, key decisions by the manager have made the difference. Miami have gone more than 200 minutes without conceding a goal during the playoffs, and changes such as Rios Novo are the reason behind that.\n Messi may be what powers this team, evident by being invovled in every Miami goal this postseason, but for the supporting cast to keep him in the playoffs, Mascherano has done an excellent job responding to adversity. This win also extends the careers of Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, who will retire at the end of the season, while giving Evander and FC Cincinnati a long offseason to think about the opportunities missed during this playoff run. But Miami will march on with nothing but winning the MLS Cup on their minds. With Messi's supporting cast on all cylinders, they just may get there too.\n            ",

Against Boise State, he threw for a season-high 293 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw three interceptions while completing just 56.5% of his passes in his first collegiate start. \nWorse than that, he was caught spitting on Boise State defensive end Jayden Virgin-Morgan after one of his interceptions. \nWortmann -- who has started all 11 games at right guard this season -- spent just one season with Colorado State after spending four seasons at Division II Central Missouri. His season has also come to an abrupt end after he was also caught spitting on a Boise State player. It's been a tough season for the Rams, who fired former head coach Jay Norvell after a 2-5 start. The Rams, who have dropped their last four games, are currently 126th in the nation in points scored and 107th in points allowed. \nColorado State will finish the season against an Air Force team that is also hoping to end what has been a forgettable season on a high note. The Falcons are 3-8 after a 1-6 start to the season. \n            \n    ",

According to ESPN Research, Wilson and Campbell were only the second rookie duo to open a season as starters at left guard and left tackle since 2000. Veteran tackle Vederian Lowe and veteran guard Ben Brown came in to replace the injured linemen.\nThis year, the Patriots have remained relatively healthy and started the same offensive line for 10 of their 11 games.

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders have fired offensive coordinator Chip Kelly following Sunday's 24-10 loss to the Cleveland Browns. The loss dropped the Raiders to 2-9 on the season. \"I spoke with with Chip Kelly earlier this evening and informed him of his release as offensive coordinator of the Raiders,\" Raiders coach Pete Carroll said in a statement. \"I would like to thank Chip for his service and wish him all the best in the future.\" Kelly, 61, was on the job for less than a year. Sunday's game marked the sixth time this year that the Raiders' offense failed to score at least 20 points. Over its past three games, Las Vegas scored just 7, 16 and 10 points, respectively.Kelly is the second assistant coach the Raiders have fired this season. The team parted ways with former special teams coach Tom McMahon following their Week 10 loss to Denver. Sunday was largely a microcosm of the Raiders' offense this season. Against the Browns, the Raiders had just 268 total yards, were 4 of 17 on third down and had just one trip inside Cleveland's 20-yard line. Quarterback Geno Smith was sacked a whopping 10 times, while first-round pick Ashton Jeanty was held to 50 yards on 17 carries. \nThe Raiders' offense entered Sunday's game ranked 30th in the NFL in scoring, 25th in passing, 30th in rushing and in red zone efficiency, and 21st in third-down efficiency. While Kelly surely deserves some blame, it wasn't like he and the Raiders' offense was set up to have much success this season. In fact, the team traded one of their few proven skill players -- wideout Jakobi Meyers -- before the trade deadline. The Raiders have also continuously received spotty play from Smith, who despite his struggles has continued to get the support of Carroll. Kelly was fresh off of winning a national title with Ohio State before returning to the NFL. Prior to the Raiders and Ohio State, Kelly was UCLA's head coach from 2018-23. He was the Eagles' head coach from 2013-15 before spending one season as the 49ers coach. \nKelly's coaching breakthrough occurred at Oregon, where he spent two years as offensive coordinator before being promoted to head coach. He led the Ducks to a Rose Bowl victory in 2011 and a Fiesta Bowl win in 2012.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- It was one thing for new Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens to go off for 144 yards and a touchdown on nine catches in the team's Week 11 \"Monday Night Football\" victory over the Las Vegas Raiders.It's another for Pickens to top that effort with 146 yards receiving and a touchdown with catches on all ninw of his targets to help power the Cowboys back from a franchise-record 21-0 hole to upset the defending Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 like he did in Week 12. Of his total yards receiving, 133 came after the Eagles took the 21-0 early in the second quarter. \"Well, I'll tell you George has been such an integral part of our story. He has his story to a degree, and that's our story. I'm so proud for him,\" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said. \"Everybody on this team is, and he certainly has absolutely been the difference as we've played over the last two weeks. … It's something when you've got 88 [CeeDee Lamb] and Pickens.\"He is now up to 1,054 yards receiving (the second-most in the NFL), eight receiving touchdowns (the third-most in the NFL) on a career-high 67 catches (the eighth-most in the NFL). Pickens' 15.7 yards per catch rank as the fifth-most in the league, and his eight receiving touchdowns are tied for the second-most by a Cowboys player in his first 11 games with the franchise.\n\"Really just grinding. I just kind of always [knew] what I was capable of,\" Pickens said. \"I used to have 100-yard games in college all the time. Just definitely, as a team, keep going because I've seen the downs of it as well. Just keep going and get as many wins as we can.\"Not a bad value for the Cowboys with all they had to give up to get the 24-year-old in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers this past offseason being a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick.\"We are proud we've got him. I don't know if anyone has helped his team any more to win this year,\" Jones said. \"So the good times we've had, Pickens has had his hand in for the most part. … Of course, we are proud to have him, and I don't even want to play games with[out] him. We'd love to have him on the team. By the way, I'd love to have 88 on the team. I know what we're asking around here, but we like the way the combination is letting us execute on offense.\"\nQuarterback Dak Prescott knew he was getting another No. 1-caliber wide receiver this season, but now the 10-year vet, who is now Dallas' all-time passing yards leader, views the peak for Pickens as \"limitless.\"\"It's hard for me to say [he] exceeds my expectations. My expectations for him are limitless, and he'll tell you that he's not from here,\" Prescott said. ... \"He's not from here, he's not from this planet and so, I'm not going to put limitations on him. He went out there and did what he's done in games when he has that opportunity,  in practice as well. The guy loves the game. He stays focused. Just the communication, as I've said before, to other guys  in the huddle about staying focused and keep doing what you're doing. We lucked out with getting a guy like that. We have to make sure that we can keep him here. He's a hell of a player turning into a leader, and he's special.\"\nThe electricity he provides for Dallas was especially apparent in the fourth quarter on Sunday. With Dallas trailing 21-14 and driving to try to tie the game, Prescott heaved a play-action deep shot from his own 46 up to Pickens despite two Eagles cornerbacks, Cooper DeJean and Sydney Brown draped around. Pickens made the catch to push Dallas all the way down to the 11. Two plays later, the game was tied at 21 with the Cowboys scoring on an 8-yard scramble from Prescott with 11:48 left to play. \n\"Definitely the energy,\" Pickens said of what he feels after his explosive catches. \"I'm an energy guy myself, so that's why you probably always see me do the crazy celebrations, get really hyped, because I know it's a big turning point. And I know defenses, when you've got the momentum or you make a splash play, that demoralizes them.\"  \nEarlier this week, Lamb made it clear how much he and Dallas' teammates have gone out of their way to embrace Pickens, and he's feeling the love. That's perhaps one of the driving forces behind Pickens' All-Pro-caliber season in Year 1 as a Cowboy. \"The guys I'm doing it with honestly. I feel like the guys I'm doing with it are some amazing guys: Dak, CeeDee [wide receiver Ryan] Flo [Flournoy],\" Pickens said. \"Even some guys on defense. Just the guys I'm doing it with.\"\nPickens' Dallas futureJones was asked about Pickens' future as he finishes the last year of his rookie deal in 2025, and he signaled the Cowboys front office would continue to let things play out. That may come back to bite them come negotiation time in the spring because Pickens' production has him angling to be one of the highest-paid wide receivers in football. \"We can let it come as well. It's something when you've got [Lamb] and Pickens,\" Jones said. ... \"I don't just try to spend my day messing with agents as you well know. I'm proud he's having the season he is having. It exceeds anything we could have hoped for.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas – The Dallas Cowboys' 2025 season was on life support after falling behind 21-0 with 11:32 left in the first half on Sunday.However, Dallas' defense shut out the Philadelphia Eagles (8-3), who entered Week 12 as the NFC's No. 1 seed, the rest of the way, which allowed the offense to rip off 24 consecutive points en route to a 24-21 win -- tying a franchise record for the biggest comeback in the process.How monumental was this victory? Dallas owner and general manager Jerry Jones felt it was future-altering weeks after Jones decided to be a buyer at the trade deadline by acquiring All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and veteran linebacker Logan Wilson.That support, along with linebacker DeMarvion Overshown and cornerback Shavon Revel returning from injury, gave quarterback Dak Prescott (354 yards, two touchdowns, one interception and one rushing touchdown), wide receiver George Pickens (146 yards receiving, one touchdown, nine catches on nine targets) and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb (75 yards receiving on four catches) a boost that could carry them the rest of the season and beyond.\n\"This day had such meaning for our season. This day had such meaning for our future. Earlier, this year, we had a chance to go down a couple of roads. We took one of the roads, and we did it because we were fortunate to have Dak [Prescott] in the future. But the other road, we needed to do some recalibrating,\" Jones said postgame. \"Fortunately, we were able to do that earlier than I thought after we couldn't make the trade we wanted [trading for Williams] in training camp, but we got it [the deal for Williams] back. We got a defense, really really impressive tonight. … I think we can look forward to this kind of solidness in our defense, but … what you're seeing on defense is different than what we would have seen coming out of training camp.\"Fresh off a 33-16 Week 11 \"Monday Night Football\" road win at the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas had legitimate momentum entering Week 12. The Eagles entered Week 12 with a league-average offense (23.4 points per game, 16th in the NFL) with wide receiver A.J. Brown making sure the world knew he's not happy with Philadelphia's passing offense. Early on, instead of capitalizing on the Eagles zombie-walking of late, the Cowboys continuously made self-inflicted wounds that dug a hole that was near-impossible to climb out from.\"I don't know when we've ever, early, worked any harder to have a team hand us a loss, but to this team's credit, I'm so proud of that defense, and when you really look at what that defense helped overcome for us, you've got to be excited about what we've got out here,\" Jones said. … \"In four days, we'll be playing again, and they [the players] can't wait. I can't wait to play again.\"\nHere's a look at the Cowboys' laundry list of unforced errors:  Prescott couldn't connect on a fourth-and-3 checkdown throw to running back Javonte Williams after he missed locating an open Jake Ferguson up the seam after Eagles linebacker Zack Baun fell down attempting to cover Dallas' tight end. Cowboys wide receiver Ryan Flournoy missed blocking a punt and then linebacker Marist Liufau was called for roughing the kicker after Dallas' defense got a stop. After the Liufau penalty, edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney was called offsides on a third-and-10 in which Hurts threw an incomplete pass. On the next play, Hurts hit Brown over the middle for a 21-yard gain. Hurts finished the drive with a 7-yard rushing touchdown to put Philadelphia up 14-0. Wide receiver KaVontae Turpin fumbled without being touched thanks to getting caught up by the turf monster, and then the Eagles marched down the field on six-play drive to tush push Hurts into the end zone to put the Eagles up 21-0. Prescott threw an end zone interception on a target to Lamb that Eagles safety Reed Blankenship picked off on a diving grab. Kicker Brandon Aubrey missed a 51-yard field goal, just his second miss (18-for-20) of the entire season. Dallas failed to score on third-and-goal and fourth-and-goal from the 1.Plus, the Cowboys' defense functioned as quarterback Jalen Hurts' and the Eagles' offense's slumpbuster early. Brown had spoken about how people who have him in fantasy football should get rid of him because of year-long struggles for Hurts and the Eagles offense to find him. Hurts had no problem finding Brown early, hitting him for three completions, 31 yards and a touchdown on his first three targets on the opening drive. He finished the game with 110 yards and a touchdown on eight catches. Hurts was also able to connect deep with wide receiver DeVonta Smith on a 41-yard bomb down the right sideline, and Smith finished with 89 yards receiving on six catches. What really made the difference defensively was how Dallas was able to bottle up 2024 NFL Offensive Player of the Year running back Saquon Barkley. Barkley had just 22 yards rushing on 10 carries, including just 11 yards after Philadelphia went up 21-0. That's why Jones made the trade for Williams: he entered Week 12 with a 47% run stop win rate, which led all NFL defensive tacklers per Next Gen Stats. Williams himself said postgame that one person can't change everything, but that's exactly what's happened since his arrival.\"We had to have something at this level of excellence on run stopping that he brought to the table. We had to have that,\" Jones said. \"We didn't need to give up pass rush to get it, and we knew since before we left training camp that he could do that.\"\n\"Just appreciating the way he's [Williams] coming in with the energy and confidence, speaking life into the defense, into the D-line room,\" Cowboys defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa said. \"It's very much needed and very much appreciated.\"The Cowboys overcame all of the errors to steal a victory from the jaws of defeat because their offense was able to get going once their defense began slowing things down on the other side of the ball. Both Pickens and Lamb made catches of over 40 yards to reignite Dallas' offense. Pickens caught the first Cowboys touchdown of the day, a 1-yarder in the front of the end zone off a play-action pass, at the end of the first half. Prescott then followed up that score with a 4-yard play-action touchdown pass on a play-action rollout to tight end Brevyn Spann-Ford, the first touchdown of his career, before scrambling and diving in for the game-tying score from 8 yards out with 11:40 left to play. Cowboys edge rusher Sam Williams forced a Barkley fumble at the end of a checkdown catch-and-run, and Dallas linebacker Kenneth Murray recovered the loose ball for the takeaway. Dallas had an opportunity to take their first lead of the day with 7:38 left to play. However, a holding penalty by rookie right guard Tyler Booker derailed the drive.\nThen, Dallas was immediately gifted another shot with a first-and-goal from the 7 after a fumble on the Eagles' ensuing punt return was recovered by Cowboys long snapper Trent Sieg. After reaching the 1, the Cowboys turned it over on downs following Prescott's consecutive incompletions to Lamb and Ferguson. The third-and-goal pass to Lamb could have and should have been a catch as he had the ball on his forearm before it popped up and fell harmlessly to the turf. Instead of kicking a chip shot field goal for the lead, coach Brian Schottenheimer went for the touchdown, and his decision backfired. Yet, the Cowboys still got the football back with a chance to win the game after Odighizuwa came up with a third-down sack of Hurts. They got the football back on their own 27 in a 21-21 game with 1:35 left to play and two timeouts. Pickens' catch-and-run of 24 yards down to the Eagles' 22 put Dallas in a prime position to line up Aubrey for the game-winning field goal from 42 yards out, which he drilled through the uprights.Dallas has the offensive firepower with Prescott, Williams, Lamb and Pickens to move the football up and down the field. Defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' zone-heavy scheme is taking hold with the Cowboys' personnel being upgraded. The Cowboys find themselves in the hunt for postseason football for another week. \n\"It was needed. Never blinked, never had any doubts and 1000% believed from the beginning. ... We believed long enough and got ourselves back in this game and now you have to know. That's just a testimony to this brotherhood, sticking together,\" Prescott said. \"Going down 21 to the defending Super Bowl champs in a division game is tough. I'm sure there were fans thinking this game was over, and they're [the Eagles] were going to run off.\"Defense, I can't give them enough credit. We wouldn't have won this game without the opportunities they gave us over and over again. ... It was just a continuation of what we did last week and just sticking together. Like I said, it's about the brotherhood. Once again, we're always going to do it for Marshawn Kneeland and he was felt tonight. I'm sure he was right there playing alongside with us.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Shedeur Sanders stepped into the Cleveland Browns' lineup in Week 12, and delivered a 24-10 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders. It was a historic win, as Sanders became the first Browns quarterback since Eric Zeier in 1995 to win his first career start, and the first since the franchise relaunched in 1999. Previously, Browns quarterbacks were 0-17 in their first career starts. Sanders completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards, one touchdown and one interception. His first career touchdown was a fourth-quarter swing pass out to fellow rookie Dylan Sampson, who ran 66 yards for the score. Myles Garrett and the Browns defense was the main reason the Browns won their third game of the season. After all, they recorded 10 sacks in a game for the first time in franchise history since 1984. But, Sanders managed the game and escaped Sin City with a W.When Sanders spoke with CBS Sports' Tiffany Blackmon after the game, he was understandably excited. He admitted that the past six or seven months had been hard on him after falling in the draft and ending up third string on the depth chart, but that he didn't feel any nerves prior to kickoff. \"I think I showed a couple of great pieces, and there's some things I wish I could get back,\" Sanders said. \"But man, a win is crazy. It's amazing. You know? Off of one week of practice. This is one week of practice! So imagine what a full offseason look like! It get dangerous!\"\nIn his postgame press conference, Sanders said he was \"very relaxed.\" That was because he prepared as well as he could, and knew that he had God on his side. \nNot only was Sanders relaxed, but he was also confident. He told reporters that he was aware of the copious amount of detractors as one of the more polarizing players in the NFL. But, he wasn't going to fail. \"A lot of people want to see me fail and ... it's ain't gonna happen. It ain't gonna happen,\" Sanders said.\nIt's true that Sanders was not the MVP of this game, and that his lone touchdown pass was thanks to Sampson's ability after the catch. However, Sanders did make an impressive throw downfield to fellow rookie Isaiah Bond in the first half to set up Cleveland's second score of the game. As you can see from the video below, even Garrett was impressed. \n\"I'm just like wow,\" Garrett said. \"There's not many guys in the league that can make that throw. So that was a hell of a throw. I hope he can continue to grow and develop from making plays like that and he'll take it from there.\"\nWhile Sanders was solid in his first career start, it's unclear if he did enough to steal the starting job from Dillon Gabriel, who is currently in concussion protocol. When Browns coach Kevin Stefanski was asked if Sanders would start next week against the San Francisco 49ers, he said he wasn't \"going to get into that.\"\n\"Proud of him, and proud of this offense and there are a ton of things to learn from, but I'm just going to worry about today,\" Stefanski said, via ESPN. Sunday was a win for the Browns in more ways than one. But it's fair to say there's a bit of a quarterback controversy brewing in Cleveland. \n            ",

They're behind the Philadelphia Eagles in the race for the conference's top seed by virtue of a head-to-head loss, but they are tied for the best record in the NFC.

The Bucs remain banged up, with Mike Evans and Bucky Irving, among others, still out for this game and with no firm timeline for their respective returns.

The Bucs are second in opponents' rushing success rate, via Tru Media, and only 20th in passing success rate. With Puka Nacua in the slot and Davante Adams on the outside, the Rams have two obvious passing-game mismatches. This game sets up well for Stafford. Bucs looking to bounce back: Tampa has lost two in a row to AFC East opponents, falling in back-to-back games to the Patriots and the Bills. When you go back to before their bye, they have lost three of their last four, with the lone win during that stretch coming against the Saints. (They also lost to the Lions.) They have wins over the Seahawks and Niners this year, but of late they have struggled against the high-level teams. They have a chance to reverse that trend here before moving into a stretch run where they won't be tested with nearly as tough of matchups. Important injuries: Not only are Mike Evans and Bucky Irving out for Tampa, but Quentin Lake is out for Los Angeles after suffering a dislocated elbow and heading to injured reserve. The Bucs could also be without both Jamel Dean and Haason Reddick, so they're not just banged up on offense.\n        \n            \n                Week 12 NFL QB Power Rankings: Broncos' Bo Nix nears top 10; Browns' Shedeur Sanders debuts\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRams vs. Bucs pick, prediction\nThe Buccaneers always seem to find a way to score -- even against the best defenses, of which the Rams are one. But their own defense is a significant pass funnel (i.e., it's easier to throw against them than it is to run), and that's dangerous against a team with Matthew Stafford playing at as high a level as he's hit in nearly every game this year. I think the Rams win this one, but the Bucs, as is their wont, either keep it close or find a way to backdoor cover. Prediction: Rams 31, Bucs 26\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        In 2016, Dak Prescott succeeded Tony Romo as the Cowboys' starting quarterback. Ten seasons later, Prescott has surpassed his former teammate as the franchise's all-time passing leader. The milestone came on a nine-yard completion to George Pickens in the third quarter against the Eagles on Sunday. With that throw, Prescott, 32, further cemented his place in Cowboys lore.Cowboys' all-time passing leaders NameYears PlayedPassing YardsDak Prescott2016–202534,184+Tony Romo2004–201634,183Troy Aikman**1989–200032,942Roger Staubach**1969–197922,700Danny White1976–198821,959** -- Pro Football Hall of Famers \nThere are few positions in pro sports as glamorous as being QB1 of \"America's Team.\" It's been that way since Don Meredith led Dallas to consecutive NFL Championship Games in the late 1960s. Roger Staubach took it to even greater heights in the 1970s, when he captained Dallas to its first two Super Bowl titles.Fittingly, the Cowboys' return to glory during the 1990s included Hall of Fame–level play from quarterback Troy Aikman, who became the first starting quarterback in history to win three Super Bowls in a four-year span.\nWhile Aikman remains the Cowboys' last Super Bowl–winning quarterback, he has been surpassed by Romo and Prescott on the team's career passing list. Romo broke Aikman's record in 2014 and held the mark for nearly 11 years before Prescott passed him.While Prescott's place on the Cowboys' all-time passing list is secure, here's where he ranks among the greatest quarterbacks in franchise lore. 5. Tony Romo A former undrafted rookie, Romo was a Pro Bowler during three of his first four years as the Cowboys' starting quarterback. He was named to his fourth and final Pro Bowl during his age-34 season.\nIn addition to winning over 61% of his regular-season starts, Romo also helped the Cowboys snap their 14-year drought without a playoff win during the 2009 postseason. Five years later, he and the Cowboys won another playoff game before coming up just short of ending the franchise's ongoing NFC title game drought.Romo edged out Danny White -- whose career included a Pro Bowl berth and three consecutive NFC Championship Game appearances -- for the fifth spot on this list.4. Dak Prescott A little low? Maybe, but Prescott still has time to move up on this list.As it stands, he's actually in a strong spot. Prescott ranks ahead of Romo and several other notable Cowboys quarterbacks, including White and Craig Morton -- a 10-year Cowboys veteran who led Dallas to its first Super Bowl appearance before later facing the team in Super Bowl XII as a member of the Broncos.\nPrescott parlayed his breakout rookie year into a highly successful run as Dallas' QB1. The 2016 Offensive Rookie of the Year, he has since been selected to three Pro Bowls. In 2023, he became the first Cowboys quarterback to lead the NFL in touchdown passes. Earlier this season, he passed Romo in career victories and now trails only Staubach and Aikman on the franchise's all-time list.He may soon add Comeback Player of the Year to his resume, too. Prescott is in the midst of another Pro Bowl-caliber campaign less than a year after suffering a season-ending hamstring injury.3. Don Meredith Meredith was transformational for the Cowboys. He helped elevate Dallas from a struggling expansion team to one of the NFL's upper-echelon franchises.\nA Pro Bowler in each of his final three seasons, Meredith received the 1966 Bert Bell Award, given annually to the NFL's player of the year. He's on the Hall of Fame ballot this year and would most likely already be in Canton had he not retired before his 31st birthday.2. Troy Aikman On most franchises, Aikman would be No. 1. A six-time Pro Bowler, he became the first quarterback to win three Super Bowls before his 30th birthday. Not bad for a former No. 1 overall pick who went 0-11 during his first season in Dallas.A surgeon on the field, Aikman routinely dissected the NFL's top defenses during his heyday. In Super Bowl XXVII, he carved up the Bills' formidable defense for 273 yards and four touchdowns on 22 of 30 passing, earning Super Bowl MVP honors as Dallas cruised to a 52-17 win.\nA first-ballot Hall of Famer, Aikman owns the highest Super Bowl completion percentage in history (70%) among quarterbacks with more than 60 attempts. His 94 regular-season wins are still a franchise record.1. Roger Staubach Captain America is still No. 1 as far as Cowboys quarterbacks are concerned.A member of the NFL's 100th Anniversary All-Time Team, Staubach enjoyed a career that was nothing short of iconic. Remarkably, he didn't become the Cowboys' full-time starter until age 29.He immediately made up for lost time. Staubach went 13-0 during his first season as Dallas' QB1, highlighted by an MVP performance in the team's 24-3 victory over Don Shula's Dolphins in Super Bowl VI — the franchise's first Super Bowl win.\nOver the next eight seasons, Staubach won a Super Bowl, played in two others and was part of some of the most memorable games and plays in NFL history. His aura was largely built on his ability to engineer improbable comebacks. He recorded 15 fourth-quarter comebacks and 23 game-winning drives during his Hall of Fame career.Staubach's most memorable comeback was his game-winning touchdown pass to Drew Pearson against the Vikings in the 1975 playoffs. After the game, he said he recited a \"Hail Mary\" before launching the ball downfield — inspiring the phrase that became part of NFL lore and further cementing his legacy.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Brandon Aiyuk hasn't suited up for the San Francisco 49ers in over a year, and his future with the franchise took a major turn recently.According to CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones, the 49ers voided Aiyuk's guaranteed money for the 2026 season during training camp, citing the wide receiver did not meet the requirements of his four-year, $120 million contract extension signed in August 2024.Saturday, coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed the team had voided the guarantees.\"It takes a lot of things to get a contract voided,\" Shanahan said. \"I've never dealt with that in my career and been in any building that's had that. It was unusual. But that's stuff that I can't get into right now.\"Aiyuk tore his ACL in Week 7 of last season. He has not been ruled out for this season, but the recent reports on his contractual changes certainly put his future in San Francisco in doubt.\nStill, Aiyuk is only 27 years old and just two years removed from a 1,342-yard, seven-touchdown 2023 season that earned him second-team All-Pro honors. As such, he'd be an intriguing -- and potentially quite popular -- free agent if he is indeed one in the 2026 offseason. Here are some potential suitors.\n        \n            \n                Shedeur Sanders becomes first Browns QB to win first career start since 1995\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWashington CommandersThe Commanders are enduring a disappointing 2025 season after breaking through for an NFC Championship Game berth in 2024, but there are plenty of connections here. Aiyuk played his college football at Arizona State, where he was current Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels' teammate. In fact, last summer, Aiyuk and Daniels talked during Aiyuk's contract dispute. Furthermore, Washington GM Adam Peters used to be in San Francisco.The Commanders' lack of wide receiver depth has been on display this season as Terry McLaurin has dealt with a quad injury. Deebo Samuel -- a former 49er -- is in the final year of his deal. Washington is projected to have ample salary cap room and could look to add a wide receiver opposite McLaurin to bounce back in 2026.\nBuffalo BillsThe Bills have struggled to find a top wide receiver to pair with Josh Allen ever since they traded Stefon Diggs after the 2023 season. Last year's second-round pick, Keon Coleman, has been a healthy scratch each of the last two weeks, and in Week 12's loss to the Texans, no Buffalo wide receiver could do much downfield.The Bills are very much in their Super Bowl window, and Aiyuk could be a strong fit in what has been a major team need.Pittsburgh SteelersNo matter who is playing quarterback for Pittsburgh -- a seemingly annual question ever since Ben Roethlisberger departed -- wide receiver is a significant need. The Steelers traded for and extended DK Metcalf this offseason, but opposite him, it's been a mishmash of younger players who haven't delivered.\nThe Steelers were reportedly interested in acquiring Aiyuk during the 2024 offseason. Perhaps two offseasons later, they could make it work.Jacksonville JaguarsNew GM James Gladstone certainly hasn't been shy, and beyond Brian Thomas Jr. and Travis Hunter -- whose rookie season ended with a knee injury and whose position remains up in the air -- the rest of Jacksonville's wide receivers are scheduled to be free agents.Aiyuk and Thomas Jr. could form a promising outside wide receiver group, and given Gladstone's willingness to make bold moves to improve Trevor Lawrence's surroundings, Aiyuk could be a fit.\nThe non-playoff contendersSeveral teams who don't project to be playoff contenders in 2026 could also be suitors. That includes ...Titans -- It's been a rough debut year for Cameron Ward, but rookie wide receivers in Elic Ayomanor and Chimere Dike have flashed, and Aiyuk would be a big help.Raiders -- The Raiders are in for a lengthy rebuild and will be looking for a new quarterback. Coach Pete Carroll knows Aiyuk well from his time as Seahawks coach, and adding Aiyuk to Brock Bowers could jump-start the passing offense.Saints -- The Saints could be looking for a new quarterback, and adding Aiyuk to the mix would be a major help. Chris Olave is one of the league's most under-appreciated wide receivers, and pairing him with Aiyuk would create a strong ecosystem for any quarterback.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 3 Michigan made a statement on Friday with an 83-71 win over No. 7 Michigan State to move into sole possession of first place in the Big Ten standings. The Wolverines were coming off a win over Nebraska -- one of three unbeaten teams in Division I basketball -- before moving to 5-0 against AP Top 25 opponents with a victory over their in-state rival.The Wolverines (20-1, 10-1 Big Ten) have now won six consecutive games since dropping their only game of the season against Wisconsin earlier this month. Michigan is now 7-0 against Quad 1 opponents, and 17 of its 21 wins have been by at least 10 points. \nMichigan State (19-3, 9-2) entered the week 12-6 overall against Michigan when both programs were ranked and had won seven of the last nine matchups against its in-state rival. The Wolverines had only three wins in their last 25 meetings when playing at the Breslin Center. Friday marked Michigan's first win over MSU on the road since 2018 in one of the most anticipated matchups in the No. 197 meeting between the programs.\nMichigan star forward Yaxel Lendeborg led the charge by finishing with 26 points and 12 rebounds. The former UAB star recorded his fourth double-double of the season in the victory, while fellow transfer guard Elliot Cadeau scored nine of his 17 points in the second half.Mara continues to be one of the best transfer portal additionsPart of what made Michigan such a difficult matchup last season was the two-big lineup that May deployed with Wolf and Goldin both starting in the frontcourt. May kept a similar style this season, with a frontline of Lendeborg, Morez Johnson Jr. and Aday Mara that gives opposing teams headaches.Mara, a former blue-chip recruit in the 2023 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, is averaging 2.6 blocks per game despite logging just 22.9 minutes per game. The former UCLA big man was underused during his time with the Bruins. Case and point? Mara logged at least 20 minutes in just 11 games combined during his two seasons with the program.\nUnder May at Michigan, Mara has become one of -- if not the best defenders in college basketball. He's shooting 68.9% from the field and is also one of the best outlet passers in the sport. Mara is one of the best transfer portal additions in the sport.Mara finished with eight points, five rebounds and three blocks in 21 minutes.A tale of two halvesMichigan State was a completely different team in the second half. The Spartans shot 7 of 26 (2 of 12 from the 3-point line) in the first half, but the final 20 minutes were a different story. Michigan State knocked down 15 of 34 shots (44.1%) in the second half and was able to chip away at the deficit.It all started when MSU opened the second half on a 15-4 run. However, what hurt MSU was the 3-point shooting. As a team, Michigan State was just 4 of 23 from downtown. Michigan State took its first lead of the game with 7:27 remaining, but Michigan proceeded to knock down six of its next seven shots to regain the lead for good.\nMichigan State, per KenPom.com, allows the lowest offensive rebounding percentage (21.4) in the sport. The Spartans had only allowed double-digit offensive rebounds once (against Arkansas) entering the night. Michigan secured 11 offensive rebounds, and six of them came from Lendeborg.When Michigan defeated Texas A&M in the second round of the NCAA Tournament last spring, the Wolverines were able to advance by beating the Aggies at their own game: on the offensive glass. Tonight was more of the same. Michigan created second-chance opportunities in the first half. The Wolverines outscored the Spartans 14-6 in second-chance points.Michigan's path to the Big Ten regular-season titleIn CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections, Michigan remained a No. 1 seed alongside Duke, Arizona and Nebraska. With the NCAA Tournament less than two months away, the Wolverines still have time to add to their resume to potentially secure the No. 1 overall seed in the Big Dance.\nAfter picking up a win over Michigan State, the path to a Big Ten regular-season title is also clearer. Notable games in conference play the rest of the season include a matchup on the road against Purdue, home games against UCLA and Michigan State and another road game against No. 9 Illinois. Another game on the schedule (that obviously isn't part of conference play) is a matchup against Duke on Feb. 21. That game could have major stakes as a resume builder for both teams.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology Snapshot: Key games worth monitoring this weekend\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMichigan's last regular-season Big Ten title came in 2021. The Wolverines have captured the Big Ten regular season title three times since the turn of the century. Michigan won the Big Ten tournament title and reached the Sweet 16 last season during Dusty May's first season at the helm. It was one of the best year-to-year turnarounds in college basketball history.This version of Michigan might be just as good as last year. That's saying a lot after May rebuilt a majority of this roster via the transfer portal and high school recruiting. Michigan is a legit national title threat. The Wolverines have everything it takes to be the final team standing in Indianapolis in April. This game was a prime example of why.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Sports Commission is currently investigating LSU for potential unreported NIL deals in violation of rules governing player compensation, per an email obtained by The Athletic. In that email sent on Jan. 15 to LSU athletic director Verge Ausberry, the CSC's head of investigations, Katie B. Medearis, informed the school that they were investigating whether they \"failed to report one or more third-party Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals,\" and requested a phone call with Ausberry or the LSU compliance staff. While the timing suggested it could be related to LSU's active transfer portal activity in football, where Lane Kiffin and the Tigers put together the No. 1 class in the country, NOLA.com reports the investigation is not related to the football program. This is the first known investigation by the CSC, which was formulated by the power conferences last year to govern revenue sharing and verify NIL deals under the new rules set by the House settlement in 2024. \nThe CSC issued a brief statement to The Athletic, confirming they have reached out to multiple schools regarding investigations.\"As previously indicated, the CSC has reached out to several schools to inform them of investigations into unreported NIL deals,\" a CSC spokesperson said. \"We will not comment further at this time.\"The specifics of the CSC's investigation into LSU are unknown, as nothing in their email to LSU detailed what players, sports or deals may be under scrutiny. \nThere remains a question of how much teams will cooperate with CSC investigations, and LSU figures to be the first -- and biggest -- test case for the commission. Their first task will be finding firm evidence to confirm any unreported NIL deals, but what the college sports world will really be looking at is what punishment they're able to levy if they do. LSU released a statement to NOLA.com stating they expected the investigation to be resolved quickly. \"We have been in regular communication with the CSC since the organization's formation and appreciate their ongoing collaboration and guidance,\" LSU spokesperson Zach Greenwell said in a statement. \"We anticipate this specific inquiry will be resolved shortly. We will not comment further on regulatory matters.\"\n            ",

Wilson hit .311/.355/.444 (121 OPS+) with 26 doubles, 13 home runs, 63 RBI, 62 runs, five stolen bases and 3.0 WAR in his 125 games. He started the All-Star Game at shortstop for the American League. The deal buys out the remaining pre-arbitration years and all arbitration years in addition to two years of free agency, as Wilson wasn't set to hit the open market until after the 2030 season. He's now locked up through 2032. This deal comes on the heels of the A's locking up left fielder Tyler Soderstrom to a seven-year, $86 million deal. It's interesting to note these two moves together because the A's tore this ballclub down to the studs before leaving Oakland and now appear to be gearing up for their hopeful move to Las Vegas. For the time being, they'll continue to play in a minor-league ballpark in Sacramento. \nThe A's were 76-86 last season, a seven-game improvement from 2024. They had winning records, however, in July, August and September, respectively, and were 35-29 after the All-Star break.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nAfter his sprightly cameo against Kairat Almaty on Wednesday night, Kai Haverz is available for selection again for Arsenal, the German's return boosting an attack that finds itself under the microscope despite the team's strong position. The most intriguing question right now for Mikel Arteta might be who, if anyone, Havertz is best placed to replace.Havertz scored one and assisted another in the first 45 minutes of a 3-2 win over the Kazakh side and Arteta confirmed on Friday that the German international is available for consideration for the trip to Leeds United, which could be his first start of the Premier League season. \"He is ready,\" said Arteta. \"Obviously he started the other day, it's been a long period and now we need to manage that load and the games that we're going to select for him to start.\"There was no reaction to that, I think it was super positive, you could see straightaway the impact that he can have in the team. So yes, he's ready.\"Arsenal have certainly missed Havertz, who has played just 137 minutes of football since suffering a major hamstring injury in early February. He had barely returned from that before suffering a shock knee injury on the opening day of this season, forcing Arteta to place an enormous burden on new signing Viktor Gyokeres. That should ease before too long although there may be those who question whether the Swede should be the one to make way.After all -- and this should come with a bold, all caps caveat that *THIS WAS AGAINST KAIRAT* -- Gyokeres and Havertz dovetailed quite nicely last time out. Anyone who saw the latter in a Bayer Leverkusen shirt will have no doubt that he can excel playing off a center forward and plenty who have seen Arsenal lately would be quite taken with the idea of playing two strikers when they are struggling to score with one. Havertz too did not plan on playing center forward when he left Chelsea for Arsenal. Might a deeper role be one that gets the Gunners sparking after a three game winless run in the Premier League?How to watch Leeds United vs. ArsenalDate: Saturday, Jan. 31 | Time: 10 a.m. ETLocation: Elland Road -- Leeds, United Kingdom TV: USAOdds: Leeds +450; Draw +290; Arsenal -182It is an idea that Arteta is evidently open to. Asked how Havertz might help his other strikers, the Arsenal manager said: \"More than the competition, which I understand, we have different characteristics with the nines. But Kai can also play in different positions. His main quality is that he makes you better, the way he moves, communicates with you, gives you information, moves around. He's a very difficult player to mark and especially he opens up a lot of spaces for the rest of the players, so I think they're going to be very happy to have him around.\"The other night, we saw a lot of positive things. Obviously, it will depend on the opponent and how they behave, what formation they use, but there are options that are really, really positive to the team. Whether he plays as a nine, as an attacking midfielder, and the other combinations, whether it's at the start or throughout the game, I think it's something very good and it can impact the game in a really powerful way.\"Those comments are worth considering given that the only player to have come under the microscope in a more sustained fashion that Gyokeres is Martin Odegaard. It is worth stating that Arteta would have no truck with such a debate. Asked for the second press conference in a row about his captain's form he said, \"I have no doubt that that will come.\"Still Odegaard has been a polarizing figure since the start of last season and is one of a string of attackers who could do with upping their goal output, with just one in the Premier League so far. Waiting in the wings, Eberechi Eze has had few chances since an off day away to Aston Villa and Havertz has now played two of his three post-injury games in the sort of spots his skipper might occupy.A bigger worry for Odegaard might be the two chances created in his last three Premier League games, all of which ended early for him through substitutions. Equally, the four before that he looked back to his old self, two assists and 13 chances created. As has so often been the case with Arsenal this season, it can be hard to take a long view of things, to not view every mini run of games as the new normal in north London.The same is true of Havertz's return to Premier League contention. It is undoubtedly nice to have and could well make Arsenal a better side. But Havertz is not riding to his team's rescue. Arsenal don't need that.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Business is booming for the NFL. And if you need any evidence of that, just look at how rapidly the salary cap has increased over the last decade. Ahead of the 2026 season, the salary cap will break $300 million for the first time, NFL Network reported Friday, as the league's financial explosion continues.The NFL has informed its clubs that the 2026 salary cap will land anywhere between $301.2 million and $305.7 million next season. That will be an increase of more than $20 million from one season to the next, and that hasn't been unusual in recent years. The cap has increased nearly $100 million since 2022, when it was set at $208.2 million.Going back over a decade, the NFL salary cap has risen exponentially with the only period of contraction coming during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the cap dipped from $198.2 million to $182.5 million, but the numbers have ballooned in each subsequent season.\nYou can thank the NFL's lucrative TV rights deals with its broadcast partners for these huge upticks, this trend doesn't seem like it'll stop anytime soon. This increase should only help teams who are up against a cap crunch, and it will provide more ammo to teams who already are loading up the money cannon in anticipation of free agency.\nPerhaps no one is happier about seeing the salary cap cross the $300 million mark than this year's crop of pending free agents, headlined by players like George Pickens and Trey Hendrickson who are set to command massive paydays.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic is set to return to the lineup on Friday against the Los Angeles Clippers after missing the last month with a hyperextended left knee, ESPN's Shams Charania reports. Jokić, listed as questionable on the team's injury report, has been out since suffering the injury against the Miami Heat on Dec. 29.Jokić, who was initially ruled out for at least four weeks, sat out 16 games in all -- the most he's ever missed in a season in his career. With Jokić sidelined, the Nuggets managed to go 10-6 and currently have a 32-16 record, good for third place in the Western Conference. A three-time MVP, Jokić will be eligible for NBA awards and All-NBA honors provided he reaches the 65-game threshold. He's played in 32 games this year and the Nuggets have 34 regular-season games remaining -- giving Jokić a thin margin to reach his 65th game. Jokić is also expected to suit up for Sunday's showdown against the Oklahoma City Thunder, the defending NBA champions. Jokić is averaging 29.6 points, 12.2 rebounds and 11.0 assists per game. He leads the NBA with 16 triple-doubles. He has the second-best odds to win MVP (+550) at FanDuel, behind Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, a heavy favorite at -340.\nNBA MVP outlook with Jokić backWith Jokić returning to the lineup against the Clippers, he will still be in the mix to earn All-NBA and MVP honors. While Gilgeous-Alexander is the clear betting favorite entering the weekend, Jokić can make things interesting down the stretch. However, if Jokić misses two more games the rest of the season, he would be ineligible for those awards.Gilgeous-Alexander has missed just two of OKC's 49 games this season. Los Angeles Lakers star Luka Dončić, who is third in MVP odds (+1700) behind Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokić, has appeared in 38 of the Lakers' 46 games this season. Further down the odds board are Cade Cunningham (+2700) and Jaylen Brown (+5000) with Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Maxey all listed at +25000 at FanDuel. \nDenver gets a boost at the perfect timeThe news of Jokić's return comes at an ideal time for the Nuggets, who have dealt with an array of injuries throughout the season. On Thursday, the Nuggets announced that forward Aaron Gordon will miss at least the next month with a right hamstring strain. Gordon will be re-evaluated in four to six weeks, which sets him up to potentially return in March, just ahead of the regular season's home stretch.\n        \n            \n                Aaron Gordon injury: Nuggets forward (hamstring) facing another extended absence in latest blow for Denver\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Nuggets have kept the ship afloat with several deep reserves seeing significant action -- but reinforcements appear to be coming.Denver coach David Adelman said this week that he hopes Jokić, Christian Braun and Cameron Johnson will all return before the All-Star break. Braun (ankle), who recently signed a five-year extension, has played in just 14 games this season. Johnson, who was acquired in the offseason in a deal centered around Michael Porter Jr., has played in just 28 games. Gordon has appeared in 23 games, while Jokić has played 32. The Nuggets face the Clippers, Thunder, Detroit Pistons and New York Knicks before the All-Star break.\nOne of the reasons Denver has managed to stay at the top of the standings is the play of star guard Jamal Murray, who is averaging career bests in points (25.9), assists (7.3) and rebounds (4.3). Additionally, Peyton Watson, a first-round pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, is in the midst of a breakout season. Watson is averaging 14.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.9 assists. Watson has started 35 games this season (45 appearances) after starting just 24 games during his first three years in the NBA.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens are expected to hire Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Declan Doyle for the same role on new coach Jesse Minter's inaugural staff, sources tell CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. Doyle, who mentored Bears quarterback Caleb Williams to a career year on Ben Johnson's staff in Chicago in 2025, now gets to work with another top NFL signal caller in Lamar Jackson. Doyle, just 29, is expected to handle primary play-calling duties on Minter's staff. The 2025 season was Doyle's first as an offensive coordinator, as he joined Bears coach Johnson's first staff in Chicago. Johnson, who spent three seasons as the offensive coordinator of the Detroit Lions, was the primary playcaller for the Bears. Doyle helped develop the game plan and studied film with Johnson as the Bears climbed out of the NFC North cellar and into the postseason for the first time since 2020. Now he will become the youngest offensive playcaller in the NFL.Under Johnson and Doyle's guidance, the Bears finished sixth in the NFL in total offense (369.2 yards per game) and ninth in scoring offense (25.9 points per game). Chicago's 144.5 yards rushing per game also ranked third in the league, behind only the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore. Williams, a former first overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, threw for a career-high 3,942 yards and 27 touchdowns on 6.9 yards per attempt. Chicago's offensive line also took a big step forward, as it went from allowing a league-worst 68 sacks in 2024 to just 24 in 2025. \n\n        \n            \n                Ravens introduce Jesse Minter: What we learned about new Baltimore coach's plans for Lamar Jackson, more\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMinter is taking over in Baltimore for John Harbaugh, who was fired after 18 seasons. Minter was a former assistant on Harbaugh's Ravens staff and is coming off a two-year stint as the defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers under Jim Harbaugh, John's brother. With Minter a defensive coach, Doyle will take on a significant role in the direction of the Ravens' offense on the heels of an injury-plagued season for Jackson, a two-time MVP. The Ravens went 8-9 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2021, taking a big step back on offense in the process. Due in large part to Jackson's injuries, the Ravens finished 27th in the league with just 175.6 yards passing per game. Baltimore missed out on the NFL playoffs for the first time since 2021. \nDoyle, a former student assistant at Iowa, broke into the NFL in 2019 as an offensive assistant with the New Orleans Saints. He reunited with Sean Payton in 2023 as the tight ends coach of the Denver Broncos, a role he served in for two seasons before he was hired by Chicago. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers have officially signed coach Matt LaFleur to a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Friday. Terms were not disclosed. The extension comes after reports that LaFleur's future in Green Bay was uncertain following a 31-27 wild-card loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFL Playoffs.The Packers also announced multi-year contract extensions for general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of football operations Russ Ball. Gutekunst joined the Packers in 1999 and worked his way up to general manager in 2018. Ball has 38 years of NFL experience, including the last 19 with the Packers. \"We are excited to extend our commitment to Brian, Matt and Russ as the leaders of our football operations. Their steadfast dedication, passion and collaboration have remained constant in our drive to compete at the highest level,\" Packers president and CEO Ed Policy said. \"While we are all disappointed with the way this season ended, we remain aligned in purpose and have spent considerable time over the past weeks collaborating on a path forward. I am exceedingly confident we have the right people to achieve our goal. The entire Packers organization looks forward to supporting every effort to bring our community and fans another championship that they very much deserve.\"LaFleur is 76-40-1 in Green Bay with six postseason appearances in seven years -- with a 3-6 overall record in the playoffs. The coach said after the loss in Chicago that he wanted to remain with the Packers. Green Bay conceded an 18-point lead in the second half despite four touchdown passes from franchise quarterback Jordan Love.LaFleur was adamant that he wanted to remain with the Packers. \n\"Of course [I want to return]. This is one of one,\" LaFleur said. \"I love this place. I love the people. As much as you guys drive me nuts sometimes, I love you guys. I love our players, the locker room, everybody in our organization. I mean, this is a unique place. The community has been outstanding.\"Love gave LaFleur his seal of approval after the Packers' ill-fated fourth quarter against the Bears, who scored 25 points in the final frame to win.\"Yeah, I definitely think Matt should be the head coach. I've got a lot of love for Matt. I think he does a great job. And that's it,\" Love said.\nLaFleur is currently the Packers' fourth-winningest coach with 76 victories, trailing only Vince Lombardi (89), Mike McCarthy (125) and Curly Lambeau (209). His 76 regular-season wins are tied for the second-most by a coach in his first seven seasons in NFL history, along with Hall of Famer Paul Brown.\n            ",

Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of the Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.\"The Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers have been owned by the estate of Paul G. Allen since the former owner of both franchises died of cancer in 2018. His sister, Jody, has controlled the teams in the years since his death.The Trail Blazers are in the midst of being sold as Allen's sister, in August 2025, reached an agreement to sell the team to Carolina Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon from Allen's estate. Closing date and sale terms were not disclosed at the time, though ESPN reported that the Blazers were worth an estimated $4 billion.\nIf the Seahawks are indeed put for sale after the NFL's championship game, it would mark the first time in the Super Bowl era that the entirety of a team that played in the title game would be up for sale shortly after its conclusion.A sale could reach between $7 billion and $8 billion, per ESPN, which received that estimate from an executive with another franchise. That would set a new NFL record. The Washington Commanders currently hold the mark after going for over $6 billion to the Josh Harris-led group in 2023.Some of the largest team sales in North American sports have come during the 2020s. Harris and company broke the record that was set in 2022 when the Walton-Penner group purchased the Denver Broncos for $4.65 billion. Mat Ishbia, the CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage, purchased the Phoenix Suns and the Phoenix Mercury for $4 billion.\nThis past summer, the Los Angeles Lakers were sold for a reported price tag of $10 billion, the largest sale in NBA and North American sports history. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Minnesota Vikings fired general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah on Friday, just eight months after signing him to a multi-year contract extension.\"Following our annual end-of-season organizational meetings over the last several weeks and after careful consideration, we have decided it is in the best interest of the team to move forward with new leadership of our football operations,\" co-owners Mark and Zygi Wilf said in a statement. \"These decisions are never easy. We are grateful for Kwesi's contributions and commitment to the organization over the past four years and wish him and his family the best in the future.\"Executive Vice President of Football Operations Rob Brzezinski will oversee the Vikings' front-office operations through the 2026 NFL Draft, after which the team will begin its search for a new general manager.\"Rob brings tremendous credibility and experience, understands our roster and has the ability to build consensus and rely on the expertise of our personnel and coaches,\" the Wilfs said. \"Building a team that can contend for championships drives us every day, and we look forward to bringing our fans the success they so deserve.\"\nThe move came as a shock around the NFL, as the Vikings signed Adofo-Mensah to an extension in May after Minnesota's 14-3 campaign in 2024. The Vikings took a step back in 2025, going 9-8 and missing the playoffs after opting not to re-sign Sam Darnold. Minnesota instead chose to move forward with 2024 first-round quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who had injury problems and struggled, as many young quarterbacks do, when he was healthy. Darnold, meanwhile, has led the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl LX, where they are the favorites to hoist the Lombardi Trophy against the New England Patriots. Why the Vikings fired Adofo-MensahIn the four years with Adofo-Mensah as general manager, the Vikings went 43-25 with a pair of playoff appearances. His work in building the 2024 team was widely praised, but his draft record and the Vikings' cap sheet spelled trouble going into 2026. \nIn four drafts with Adofo-Mensah at the helm, the Vikings struggled to acquire the impact players they hoped for. His five first-round picks in that span -- Lewis Cine, Jordan Addison, McCarthy, Dallas Turner and Donovan Jackson -- have produced mixed results. Cine was cut after two seasons, Jackson anchored an underwhelming offensive line this year, and Addison has struggled to stay on the field because of injuries and off-field issues. Turner emerged as a bright spot with eight sacks, but the biggest issue for Adofo-Mensah was going all-in on McCarthy.The Vikings traded up to take McCarthy in the 2024 draft, giving up a pair of mid-round picks to jump from No. 11 to No. 10 overall. The plan was always for Darnold to serve as a bridge to McCarthy -- who missed his rookie season with a knee injury -- but when he led Minnesota to a 14-3 record, the Vikings had to give the decision serious thought.\nThey ultimately stuck with the plan and turned things over to McCarthy, who struggled in 10 games this season. He completed 57.6% of his passes for 1,632 yards, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in his first year as a starter. While the Vikings went 6-4 with McCarthy under center, much of their success hinged on an elite (and expensive) defense.That's what made choosing McCarthy over Darnold so controversial. The Vikings had a defense ready to contend now, but even the most optimistic view of McCarthy involved a young quarterback with considerable talent who would need time to reach his potential. That put the offense and defense on different timelines, and the result was a 9-8 season.Now Minnesota enters 2026 with a cluttered cap sheet, nearly $49 million over the limit, per Over the Cap. Only the Kansas City Chiefs face a more dire cap situation, and the next Vikings GM will have a tall order in figuring out how best to proceed. Whoever takes over will be tasked with getting Minnesota back into the hunt in the highly competitive NFC North, where the Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers all have playoff aspirations for 2026. And they'll have to do it without many clear avenues to upgrade the roster and likely needing to shed money.\nThe McCarthy decision now facing Minnesota's next GM\nA new regime in Minnesota could mean changes at quarterback sooner rather than later. We'll find out exactly how much belief coach Kevin O'Connell has in McCarthy, as Adofo-Mensah was clearly a strong believer in the young quarterback. A new GM, however, won't have the same ties to him.As such, one of the first major evaluations for whoever steps into the general manager role will be whether they view McCarthy as the franchise quarterback of the future.Given the Vikings' cap situation, it wouldn't be surprising if McCarthy gets another year to show what he can do. Minnesota likely won't be in the market for a high-priced free agent, and this year's draft class isn't highly regarded beyond Fernando Mendoza, who is the favorite to go No. 1 to the Raiders. Without a clear path to a replacement, a new Vikings GM may opt for an evaluation year with McCarthy.\nThe 2026 season was always going to be important for McCarthy's development, but with a new general manager in place who didn't draft him, it will be even more critical. He won't just need to show growth -- he'll need to take a major leap into becoming a quality starter if he wants to keep the job long-term.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                CBS Sports Graphic\n            \n            \n    \n        Everybody knows we're down to just two undefeated teams remaining in the sport: Arizona and Miami (OH). But do you realize how close we are to still having three or maybe even four?Of the six one-loss teams, Duke and Saint Louis are the two whose only loss came by a single point. Duke (19-1) lost to Texas Tech 82-81 in December, while Saint Louis (20-1) lost to Stanford 78-77 in November. And in that one-point loss to Stanford, the Billikens actually led by 15 points before losing on a 3-pointer at the buzzer. So Saint Louis is quite literally just a Benny Gealer miss from being 21-0, and Gealer misses 3-point attempts exactly 56.9% of the time.Anyway ...I'm telling you this because the Billikens will return to the court Friday night when they host Dayton at Chaifetz Arena. The game is scheduled to tip a little after 8 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network. It'll be the first contest for Saint Louis since Robbie Avila buried a game-winning 3-pointer in Tuesday's 79-76 victory over George Washington that stretched the Billikens' winning streak to 14.The view from the crowd was awesome.\nSaint Louis is No. 20 in Friday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Arizona remains No. 1 for the 20th consecutive day. For what it's worth, KenPom.com currently lists the Billikens as favorites in every remaining regular season contest and is projecting them to win the Atlantic 10 by three games with a 16-2 record.\nSLU has not won a conference championship since Jim Crews guided the program to the A-10 title in 2014. In that season, the Billikens finished one game ahead of Shaka Smart's VCU Rams.

    "body": "\n        CBS Sports is assessing the NFL's financial landscape through awards for the 13th straight year now that the Super Bowl LX matchup is set. These awards differ from traditional NFL honors because they take an economic perspective, emphasizing 2025 veteran acquisitions.Players acquired via trades or free agency can have a tremendous impact on an NFL team's fortunes. These awards do not consider rookies because their salaries are dictated by draft position and the rookie wage scale. The same applies to players who sign restricted free agent tenders, since the NFL's Collective Bargaining Agreement sets those amounts. A runner-up is named when warranted.Most Valuable Acquisition\nThe Seahawks pivoted to Sam Darnold after contract extension talks with Geno Smith stalled prior to his trade to the Las Vegas Raiders in March. Darnold signed a team-friendly three-year, $100.5 million contract in free agency that averages $33.5 million per year and can reach $115.5 million through incentives. If Smith had been willing to accept a Darnold-type deal, he would still be Seattle's quarterback.The contract was structured to give the Seahawks a small window to get out after this season if Darnold didn't play well. Of the $27.5 million he's scheduled to make in 2026, $17.5 million is guaranteed for injury and becomes fully guaranteed five days after Super Bowl LX on Feb. 13. If Seattle parts ways with him in 2026, it would carry $25.6 million in dead money -- a salary cap charge for a player no longer on the roster -- while Darnold would collect $37.5 million for one year.\nA quick exit isn't a consideration for the Seahawks after they advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 years. Darnold showed his 2024 Pro Bowl season wasn't just a product of Minnesota Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell's offensive brilliance. He earned another Pro Bowl nod, and Seattle secured the top seed in the NFC with a 14-3 record.Darnold completed 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, posting a 99.1 passer rating. He is reshaping his reputation for \"choking\" in big games. Darnold went 25 of 36 (69.4%) for 356 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions for a 127.8 passer rating in Seattle's 31-27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game.Runner-up: Micah Parsons, EDGE, PackersLeast Valuable Acquisition\nThe Raiders dealt a 2025 third-round pick to the Seahawks for Geno Smith in March. They acquired Smith to provide the quarterback stability the franchise had lacked, with six different players starting at the position since releasing Derek Carr following the 2022 season. \nShortly after the trade, Smith received a two-year, $75 million contract extension that averages $37.5 million per year and includes $50.5 million in guarantees, with $42.5 million fully guaranteed at signing. Incentives and salary escalators can push the deal's value as high as $84 million.The trade reunited Smith with Pete Carroll, whom the Raiders hired as head coach last January. Carroll coached Smith during the first five years of his six-year run in Seattle.Smith didn't resemble the player who won the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year award in 2022 this season. He led the league with 19 interceptions, and his 84.7 passer rating ranked 30th in the NFL. The Raiders went 2-13 in the 15 games Smith started.\nThe Raiders fired Carroll after finishing 3-14, one more loss than in 2024. The team is expected to select Indiana University Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza to replace Smith after securing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.Runner-up: Justin Fields, QB, JetsOffensive Signing of the Year\nThe 49ers' decision to give Mac Jones a two-year, $8.41 million contract worth a maximum of $12.91 million through incentives to back up Brock Purdy was viewed as little more than a blip on the NFL radar when he signed last March. Jones proved far more valuable than expected, keeping San Francisco afloat during the eight games Purdy missed with a turf toe injury.The 49ers won five of the eight games Jones started. He completed 69.6% of his passes (201 of 289) for 2,151 yards with 13 touchdowns and six interceptions, posting a 97.4 passer rating over that stretch.\nRunner-up: Sam Darnold, QB, Seahawks\n        \n            \n                Five potential NFL trades that could go down during Super Bowl week: Will Mac Jones be the next QB revival?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDefensive Signing of the Year\nConventional wisdom suggested Micah Parsons would become the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback at some point before the regular season started. Most expected that deal to come from the Dallas Cowboys. Instead, a bitter contract dispute with owner Jerry Jones led to Parsons being traded to the Green Bay Packers at the end of August for a 2026 first-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick and defensive tackle Kenny Clark.As part of the trade, Parsons received a four-year, $186 million contract extension with $136.007 million in overall guarantees, including $123.107 million fully guaranteed at signing. His $46.5 million per year and $123.107 million fully guaranteed at signing are non-quarterback records.Parsons recorded 12.5 sacks in 14 games before tearing the ACL in his left knee. According to NFL Next Gen Stats, he led the league with 83 quarterback pressures (combined sacks, quarterback hits and quarterback hurries) through 15 weeks when he got hurt. Parsons generated 37.9% of Green Bay's pressures and 29.9% of its sacks. Only Cleveland Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett accounted for a larger share of his team's pressures (43.4%) and sacks (27.2%). Parsons earned first-team All-Pro honors and is a finalist for the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year award.\nThe Packers didn't win another game after Parsons went down. They allowed 20.1 points per game with him and 27.5 after his ACL tear over the final four games, including a wild card playoff loss to the Chicago Bears. The attention Parsons drew with double teams and offensive line slides on passing downs also created opportunities for teammates. Green Bay averaged 2.4 sacks per game with Parsons and just one per game without him.Biggest Steal\nThe Bears had no idea Nahshon Wright would play such a prominent role on their defense when they quickly signed him to a one-year deal at his $1.1 million league minimum after the Vikings released him in April. He spent the 2024 season on Minnesota's practice squad after the Vikings acquired him that preseason from the Cowboys for cornerback Andrew Booth.Wright seized an opportunity created by multiple injuries at cornerback and put together a breakout season. He earned NFC Defensive Player of the Month honors for November and led the NFL with eight takeaways (five interceptions and three fumble recoveries).\nLate in the season, Wright said he would like to remain in Chicago. The Bears already have significant financial commitments at cornerback, though. Jaylon Johnson is in the second year of the four-year, $76 million deal he signed in 2024 that averages $19 million per year. Kyler Gordon signed a three-year, $40 million extension in April that averages $13,333,333 per year.Best Use of a Contract Year\nGeorge Pickens had worn out his welcome with the Pittsburgh Steelers because of his attitude and immaturity despite his immense talent. The Steelers trading the equivalent of a second-round pick to the Seahawks for wide receiver DK Metcalf in March -- and giving him a four-year extension averaging nearly $33 million per year -- spoke volumes about their frustrations with Pickens.The calculated risk the Cowboys took by trading a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick to the Steelers for Pickens and a 2027 sixth-round pick last May paid big dividends. Pickens posted career highs with 93 receptions, 1,429 receiving yards and nine touchdowns while averaging 15.4 yards per catch. The 2022 second-round pick ranked in the NFL's top 10 in each of those categories this season. He earned a Pro Bowl nod and second-team All-NFL honors for the first time in his career.\nAbsent a new deal before early March, Pickens will receive the franchise tag. The deadline for teams to use the franchise or transition tag is March 3 at 4 p.m. ET.The 2026 non-exclusive franchise tag for wide receivers projects to 9.016% of the 2026 salary cap, up from 8.581% in 2025. If the 2026 cap is set at $300 million -- a 7.45% increase over 2025's $279.2 million figure — the wide receiver tag should come in at $27.047 million.Patience could work in Pickens' favor. His best deal could come from letting Nico Collins and Puka Nacua, who will be in contract years in 2026, further define the wide receiver market, provided their respective deals with the Houston Texans and Rams are done before the July 15 deadline for franchise players to sign long term. Seahawks wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba could also factor into the equation, as the 2023 first-round pick is now eligible for an extension.\nRunners-up: Devin Lloyd, LB, Jaguars and Kyle Pitts, TE, Falcons\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: George Pickens, Breece Hall and others cashing in during contract years\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWorst Use of a Contract Year\nCam Robinson signed a one-year, $12 million contract worth a maximum of $14.5 million through incentives as part of the Texans' wholesale offensive line overhaul. The assumption was he would replace Laremy Tunsil, who was traded to the Washington Commanders in March, at left tackle.However, a minor left knee injury during training camp opened the door for 2025 second-round pick Aireontae Ersery to win the starting job. Robinson had started all 101 games he played over his first eight NFL seasons prior to this campaign.The Browns losing starting left tackle Dawand Jones to a season-ending knee injury in Week 3 prompted a trade for Robinson. The Texans acquired a 2027 sixth-round pick in exchange for Robinson and a 2027 seventh-round pick. Robinson was a healthy scratch in his final game with Houston against the Titans in Week 4 before the deal.\nRobinson validated Houston's decision to move him while he was with the Browns. After the trade, only Stone Forsythe allowed more than the eight sacks Robinson gave up in his 13 games in Cleveland, according to Pro Football Focus.Runner-up: Haason Reddick, EDGE, BuccaneersBest Contract Extension (for a team)\nThe Bills signed James Cook to a four-year, $46 million extension in August after contentious negotiations. The deal averages $11.5 million per year and includes $30 million in guarantees, with $15.28 million fully guaranteed. Salary escalators can push the contract's value as high as $48 million. The signing came after the 2022 second-round pick skipped voluntary offseason workouts and staged a hold-in during training camp because of his frustration with contract talks.Cook's chances of landing the $15 million per year he sought disappeared once Kyren Williams, a fellow 2022 draft pick, signed a three-year, $33 million extension with the Rams that averages $11 million per year about a week earlier. Cook was coming off a 2024 season in which he rushed for 1,009 yards while averaging 4.9 yards per carry. He also shared the NFL lead with 16 rushing touchdowns.Cook delivered a 2025 season nobody saw coming. After averaging 64.6 rushing yards per game over his previous two years as a starter, he made a massive jump by leading the league at 95.4 yards per game on the ground. Cook paced the NFL with 1,621 rushing yards while averaging 5.2 yards per carry, the league's second-best mark. He scored 14 total touchdowns (12 rushing, two receiving) and earned first-team All-NFL honors from the Pro Football Writers of America.The Bills would have been forced to use the franchise tag if Cook had played out his rookie deal with this type of season. The 2026 non-exclusive franchise tag for running backs projects to 4.723% of the 2026 salary cap, down slightly from 4.886% in 2025. If the 2026 cap is set at $300 million, the running back tag should come in at $14.171 million.Cook's asking price surely would have climbed beyond $15 million per year, and he would have been positioned to benefit from a changing running back market. 2023 first-round picks Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs are now eligible for extensions.It's conceivable Robinson could become the NFL's highest-paid running back ahead of Saquon Barkley, who signed a two-year, $41.2 million extension last March that averages $20.6 million per year, before the 2026 season begins. Robinson led the NFL with 2,298 yards from scrimmage (combined rushing and receiving yards) for the Atlanta Falcons.Gibbs could also benefit from the Detroit Lions' aggressive approach to extending core players on rookie contracts. He will likely aim to join Barkley in the $20 million-per-year running back club.Runner-up: Nik Bonitto, EDGE, BroncosWorst Contract Extension (for a team)\nDaron Bland became the first beneficiary of Parsons being traded to the Packers. He signed a four-year, $90 million extension three days after the deal, with $50 million in guarantees, including $36.346 million fully guaranteed at signing. Salary escalators can push the contract's value to $92 million. At $22.5 million per year, Bland is the NFL's sixth-highest-paid cornerback.Jones appears to have jumped the gun with Bland after dragging his feet on other extensions in the past, including quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and Parsons. Bland was limited to seven games in 2024 because of a left foot fracture that required surgery, and his play was uneven after returning from the injury.Bland earned the extension largely on the strength of his 2023 breakout season, when he secured first-team All-Pro honors after leading the league with nine interceptions. His five pick-sixes set an NFL single-season record.Bland didn't regain his All-Pro form this season. Opposing quarterbacks completed 67.1% of their passes (51 of 76) for a 108.9 passer rating when targeting him, according to PFF. Bland also surrendered five touchdowns in coverage in the 12 games he played. The Cowboys finished with the NFL's worst pass defense, allowing 251.5 yards per game.Bland underwent left foot surgery a couple of weeks ago after finishing the season on injured reserve. He is fortunate he isn't headed into free agency in March after two injury-plagued seasons that make his 2023 All-Pro campaign look more like an outlier. Bland could find himself on the chopping block if he doesn't bounce back in 2026 under new defensive coordinator Christian Parker.\n            ",

This weekend features a little bit of everything, including a prospect matchup for the ages, John Calipari facing his old team and Gonzaga and Saint Mary's squaring off for one of the final times as conference foes.The fun begins in Blacksburg, Virginia, when Virginia Tech hosts No. 4 Duke. The Blue Devils are at the top of the ACC standings heading into the weekend with a perfect 8-0 record, while Virginia Tech is 5-4 against conference opponents.No. 14 Kansas will host No. 13 BYU in a matchup of two of the best prospects in the 2026 NBA Draft. Kansas' Darryn Peterson and BYU's AJ Dybantsa are expected to go off the board with the first two picks in the draft this summer. This will be a prospect matchup that college basketball fans haven't seen in quite some time.\n        \n            \n                Darryn Peterson vs. AJ Dybantsa is prospect matchup for the ages -- and Super Bowl for tanking NBA teams\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOne of the most anticipated games of the season will take place at Bud Walton Arena later in the day when No. 15 Arkansas hosts Kentucky. Calipari will be facing his old team for the second time since departing Kentucky during the 2024 offseason. Arkansas won the lone matchup between the SEC foes last season at Rupp Arena.\nThe matchup between Saint Mary's and Gonzaga has become appointment television over the last decade as one of the best rivalries on the West Coast. However, this will mark one of the final times the programs face off as conference opponents before Gonzaga joins the revamped Pac-12 later this summer. Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook | All times below Eastern         No. 4 Duke at Virginia Tech              \nNoon on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Since losing to Texas Tech last month, Duke has been on a roll. The Blue Devils have won eight consecutive games, with the last six by at least 10 points. This will be the first time Duke has played on the road since a road trip to the West Coast earlier this month against Stanford and Cal. I expect Duke to roll to another double-digit win.

Utah State won both of these matchups last year, but San Diego State shot just 28% from the field against Utah State's zone in the first matchup compared to 45% in the second duel, per Synergy. That's a notable difference that could rear its ugly head again. San Diego State is also down two starters, as freshman guard Elzie Harrington (leg) and shot-blocking big man Magoon Gwath (hip) have both been ruled out. The Aztecs have terrific depth, but they are unfailingly inconsistent from 3-point range. If Utah State's zone can coax SDSU to shoot a few more triples than normal and the Aggies hold up on the glass, Utah State will be in good shape. Pick: Utah State -6 -- Isaac Trotter\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UTSU -6\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n             No. 13 BYU at No. 14 Kansas            \n4:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): This could be a game college basketball/NBA fans look back on years from now and remember.

A win over Calipari's Razorbacks has a chance to flip the season around. Kentucky keeps this close and covers the spread.

Outside of that, the Zags have been dominant. Since suffering a loss to Michigan, Gonzaga has won its last 11 games. Eight of those wins have been by at least 10 points. Although this rivalry often creates chaos every time these teams play, I expect Gonzaga to win this game by at least 10.

The event will take place on April 4 from the 02 Arena in London.\"The Bronze Bomber\" will be looking to win back-to-back fights for the first time since 2019, as the once undefeated heavyweight champion has gone 2-4 in his last six fights. Wilder did pick up a knockout win over Tyrrell Anthony Herndon back in June, bouncing back into the winner's circle after losses to Joseph Parker and Zhilei Zhang. Chisora enters the bout on a three-fight winning streak, defeating Gerald Washington, Joe Joyce and Otto Wallin in his three most recent fights. The 42-year-old \"War\" Chisora is among the most experienced heavyweights still fighting and has faced many of the biggest names in the division over the past two decades. Of his 13 losses, many are to former world champs, including Tyson Fury (three times), Joseph Parker (twice), Oleksandr Usyk and Vitali Klitschko. \nThis fight will be important for both men as they look to re-establish themselves as contenders in the heavyweight division. \nWilder and Chisora's bout sets up a big April for the heavyweight division. Tyson Fury, the former champ with five combined wins over Wilder and Chisora, will end his latest retirement and return to the ring one week later on April 11 in a fight with Arslanbek Makhmudov in the United Kingdom. That fight could be the precursor to a highly anticipated bout with Anthony Joshua, although Joshua's future in the ring remains in question after sustaining injuries in a fatal car crash in Nigeria in late December. \n            \n    ",

Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's roundup just below. Yankees interested in Williams reunion\nRighty reliever Devin Williams in his lone season in the Bronx was plagued by inconsistency and prolonged periods of struggle, but beneath it all the two-time All-Star still had strong underlying fundamentals. That's why the Yankees may be interested in bringing back Williams, who's a free agent this winter.Indeed, the Athletic reports that the Yankees and Williams' representatives have indeed been discussing an agreement that would keep him in pinstripes for 2026 and perhaps beyond. The 31-year-old right-hander will enter next season with 86 saves and a career ERA+ of 172. In his 297 ⅔ career innings at the highest level, Williams has struck out 465 batters. \nBraves acquire Dubón from AstrosThe Braves and Astros swung a trade of infielders late Wednesday, as Mauricio Dubón heads to Atlanta in exchange for Nick Allen. Dubón, 31, is coming off a 2025 season in which he batted .241/.289/.355 with seven home runs in 133 games for Houston. For his career, he owns an OPS+ of 85 across parts of seven MLB seasons. Defensively, Dubón is a two-time Gold Glove winner as a utility player and he's spent meaningful time at seven different positions. With the Braves, he figures to be their primary shortstop in 2026. Dubón will be eligible for free agency after the 2026 season. \nAs for the 27-year-old Allen, he has a 55 OPS+ in 1,176 career plate appearances spread over four big-league seasons. He's spent most of his time at shortstop, but he's also capable of playing anywhere else in the infield. He'll enter the 2026 season with between two and three years of MLB service time and figures to fill a bench role for Houston. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Throughout the offseason the CBS Sports MLB   experts will bring you a                               weekly Batting Around roundtable, breaking         down      pretty       much           anything.    The latest   news, a      historical      question,         thoughts    about         the future  of         baseball,   all   sorts of   stuff. Last week we discussed teams that most need Kyle Tucker. This week we're going to tackle the prospect of a Nolan Arenado trade.Will the Cardinals trade Arenado this offseason? Where will he go?Dayn Perry: I do think he gets dealt out of St. Louis this offseason.  Arenado experienced further decline at the plate this past season, but  he remains a top-tier defender at third base. This time around, Arenado  has said he's willing to approve a trade to more destinations than he  was last offseason and, most critically, Cardinals ownership has said  they're willing to kick in more cash than they were in past trade  discussions. It's not hard to see Arenado as a 2 WAR-ish kind of player  across a full season, and I think the Cardinals will pay enough of his  remaining salary to make him moveable on the market. I'll guess he lands  with the Phillies. R.J. Anderson: Yeah, I assume Chaim Bloom will find a way to move Arenado to another  team, albeit probably not until after the new year. I think Dayn's  Phillies prediction is a sensible one. I'll go in a different direction  and say the Tigers if they again fail to land Alex Bregman. Detroit  could use an upgrade at the hot corner and I assume the Cardinals will  be willing to eat most of Arenado's contract to facilitate a move. A  discounted Arenado, though not the splashiest or best move on the table,  would make Detroit a better team.  \nMatt Snyder: Where there's a will, there's a way. The Cardinals seem  pretty desperate to unload Arenado at this point and he's expressed a  willingness to be more open this time around to waiving his no-trade  clause. He shouldn't be counted on for a ton of offense at this point in  his career, but a contending team looking to shore up third base  defensively will show interest. I agree with R.J. on the Tigers. Would the  Mariners take a look? Maybe the Mets? I'm just spitballing here, but I  do think Arenado is wearing a new uniform come Opening Day in 2026.Mike Axisa: Yeah, I think Arenado goes. It feels like there's no putting the toothpaste back in the tube after the farewell ceremony this year. The Angels could make sense. They need a third baseman and Arenado's a Southern California guy, though I assume winning is his priority and the Angels have lost the benefit of the doubt there. If they contend in 2026, it'll be a surprise.\nI'll go (slightly) off the board: Diamondbacks. Jordan Lawlar has not impressed in his limited big league team and the D-backs haven't given him the same runway they've given other struggling young players (e.g. Alek Thomas), which leads me to believe they don't want to pencil him into a starting spot next year. Blaze Alexander and Tim Tawa are platoon guys more than everyday players. A heavily subsidized Arenado could be a nice little two-year stopgap for Arizona team that has an opening at third base and could contend for a postseason berth.\n            ",

He was a distant second to Chubb on the depth chart early in the year, worked his way into a timeshare after a few weeks, and has recently surged ahead of the veteran. In the last two games, he's out-touched Chubb 35-9 and he's scored four touchdowns in his last seven games while Chubb has scored once during that span. The model predicts that Marks scores 0.61 touchdowns on average, while these odds imply a 44.4% chance to score. Use the latest bet365 bonus code to find this price and get $150 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.Gabe Davis, Bills (+425, DraftKings)Davis refamiliarized himself with the fans in Buffalo last week with three catches for 40 yards in his season debut against the Buccaneers. He had 27 receiving touchdowns in four seasons with the Bills before spending one season in Jacksonville last year. After returning to the Bills this offseason, Davis began the year on injured reserve but played 41.1% of the offensive snaps in last week's 44-32 win. He's familiar to Allen, and he could be in line for more snaps this week, which is why the model predicts that he scores 0.27 touchdowns on average, while the odds imply a 19.1% chance to score. Get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins and three months free NBA League Pass.Jayden Higgins, Texans (+500, FanDuel)The second-round pick out of Iowa State has 23 catches for 256 yards and three touchdowns over his first 10 games. However, his recent usage is worth noting, as he's been targeted seven times or more in three of Houston's last four games. He's caught touchdown passes from C.J. Stroud and Davis Mills during that span, so it appears as if there's generally more trust in the rookie at this stage as opposed to a rapport with one or the other. The model predicts that he scores 0.34 touchdowns on average, while these odds imply a 16.7% chance to score. Use the latest FanDuel promo code to find this price and get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins.Want more Thursday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Bills vs. Texans.

    "body": "\n        I've been doing the Top 25 And 1 every morning during the season for lots of years, and I can count on one hand how many times I've moved an undefeated team out of the No. 1 spot.It's rare. I don't like doing it.But, sometimes I think it's appropriate to reward aggressive non-league scheduling followed by excellence, especially when the alternative is to cling to preseason thoughts that might prove to be accurate but are mostly just preseason thoughts. And I guess that's my way of telling you that I've moved Arizona to No. 1 in Thursday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings after the Wildcats secured another huge victory Wednesday night, specifically a 71-67 win at UConn.Arizona is now 5-0 with a neutral-court win over Florida, a win in the greater Los Angeles area over UCLA and a road win over UConn. Put another way, Arizona is undefeated and now owns victories over the programs that produced the sport's past three national champions (UConn, Florida) -- plus another over the program that's won more men's basketball titles than any other (UCLA). Put another way, Arizona is undefeated and now owns victories over the teams that were ranked third (Florida), fourth (UConn) and 12th (UCLA) in the preseason AP poll.And then there's also this: According to CBS Sports research, Arizona is just the third team in the past 30 years to open a season with at least three of their first five wins coming against top-15 opponents.\nWhat we're watching is rare stuff.\n        \n            \n                Arizona already has wins over Florida, UCLA and UConn; the Wildcats are undeniably college hoops' No. 1 team\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCredit goes to Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd for being unafraid to put his team in so many high-profile games so early. Credit goes to Arizona's players for meeting the challenge, among them senior guard Jaden Bradley, who finished with a team-high 21 points against UConn and is now averaging a team-best 16.8 points in 29.4 minutes per contest.\"I don't think JB gets enough credit for his work and how much he's improved,\" Lloyd told CBS Sports' Matt Norlander late Wednesday. \"And that's not to say that he wasn't always really good, but he's really worked on his game and honed his game and fixed some weaknesses and accentuated some strengths. He just has a quiet confidence and belief in himself that rubs off on his teammates.\"[He's] just really special.\"\nArizona jumping from No. 5 to No. 1 in the Top 25 And 1 caused Purdue and Houston to be pushed down one spot each, no fault of their own. The Boilermakers and Cougars are now No. 2 and No. 3. UConn is down to No. 4. And BYU rounds-out the top five after also being pushed down one spot because of Arizona's ascension.

The Texans are coming off their second straight victory, a 16-13 win against division rival Tennessee Titans, while the Bills emerged on the right side of a 44-32 shootout with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It will be Davis Mills under center again for the Texans, as C.J. Stroud will miss a second straight start due to his concussion. Mills is 2-0 this season as a starter and is averaging 283 passing yards per game. He's scored four total touchdowns, thrown one interception, but also been sacked six times in those contests. The Bills got back to their winning ways last week in a game that featured nine lead changes, but they are still 1.5 games behind the surprising New England Patriots in the AFC East. Between facing a backup quarterback and a bottom-10 rushing attack, this is a big opportunity for Buffalo.It's probably safe to say that another six-touchdown outing is probably not in the cards for Allen, but the NFL's reigning MVP does have an 8-0 record on Thursdays. Six of those victories have come on the road, although Houston has not been kind to Allen who is 0-3 when playing deep in the heart of Texas.\nLet's break down this week's edition of \"Thursday Night Football,\" but first, here's how you can watch the game. Where to watch Bills vs. Texans liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 20 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: NRG Stadium -- Houston, TexasStream: PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -5.5; O/U 43.5 (via FanDuel)Bills vs. Texans: Need to knowDavis Mills struggled in his one start vs. Buffalo. While Mills has been winning as of late, his one career start vs. the Bills back in 2021 was a disaster. He completed 11 of 21 passes for 87 yards, zero touchdowns and a career-high four interceptions in a 40-0 loss. Josh Allen has bad luck in Houston. Allen has an 83-37 record as a starter in the regular season, but he's had bad luck in H-Town. The Bills have lost on walk-off field goals in Houston twice when Allen has started.Bills run defense is an issue. The Bills have the No. 2 pass defense in the NFL, allowing 169.7 yards per game. However, the run defense is a major problem. Buffalo allows the second-most rushing yards per game with 153.0, and has allowed six rushing touchdowns of 30 or more yards this season -- which are tied for the most through 10 games in NFL history.Best defense in the NFL? Many believe the Denver Broncos have the best defense in the NFL, but that title may belong to the Texans. Houston allows a league-low 258.1 total yards per game, and are the stingiest when it comes to putting points on the board at 16.3 per game. And that 16.3 is the fewest allowed through 10 games by a team without a winning record since 2003! Houston has allowed fewer than 20 points in seven of 10 games this season.Not-ready-for-prime-time players? The Bills are 2-2 in prime time this season, but have lost their last two night games. The Texans on the other hand have lost both of their prime-time matchups this year. Bills vs. Texans prediction, pick\nAllen may not love playing in Houston, but he certainly likes playing on Thursdays. Allen has the best Thursday record (8-0) by a starting quarterback since 1950. He's scored 290 total touchdowns in his career, which are the most all-time by a player 30-years-old or younger, and has the most total touchdowns in the NFL this season with 28. All that to say, he's good enough to rise above this vaunted Texans defense. \nThe Texans mounted an impressive comeback against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 10 and found a way to win in Tennessee last Sunday despite not scoring a single point in the first half, but the Bills are a different kind of test. Buffalo covers the spread in prime time. Pick: Bills -5.5; Under 43.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        CHICAGO -- Illinois center Zvonimir Ivisic has the kind of go-go gadget arms that look … different. The 7-foot-2 big man is well on his way to posting better shot-blocking numbers than any Illinois player has in the internet era. Alabama's Labaron Philon made it obvious to all 18,000 in The House that Jordan Built that he isn't scared of giants.The sophomore guard and top-20 NBA prospect erupted for 24 points, including four straight ice-cold buckets in a do-or-die stretch in the final three minutes, to help No. 11 Alabama outlast No. 8 Illinois, 90-86. Try as he might, Ivisic's skyscraper reach couldn't scrape Philon's feathery 3-pointer that gave Alabama a six-point lead with 77 ticks left.\"I knew I was gonna shoot the last one,\" Philon said in the bowels of the United Center with an all-knowing grin. \"Just coming off that screen, I feel like (Ivisic) gave me a lot of space and Coach Oats trusts me to go out there and make plays. So I didn't really second-guess it. Just let it go. Let it go, he did. To the bottom of the net, it sank. It proved to be the killshot to an Illinois team that a notoriously straight-shooter like Oats prognosticated would be in the mix to compete for the national championship.\nThe jury is still out on just how good this Alabama club will be, but the run-and-gun barrage was a burr in the saddle of Illinois -- just like it was with St. John's -- and Philon has put the college basketball world on notice that he is a flat-out dude.While other SEC Player of the Year hopefuls have stumbled in the early going, Philon is flourishing in a situation constructed with him in mind. Philon is stamping himself as a legitimate First Team, All-American candidate.\"He's super talented,\" Oats said. \"I told him our team's gonna go as he goes a lot.\"\nInside Philon's last-second returnJust six months ago, Philon believed his days in an Alabama uniform were over. He told reporters at the NBA Draft Combine that he had closed the book on a return to college basketball and that he had informed Oats and the Alabama staff of his inclination.On the eve of the NBA Draft stay-or-go deadline, the status quo remained. Alabama was in the thick of trying to recruit USC transfer Desmond Claude or other top portal prospects to fill its lead guard role, but when Oats got a ring from Philon on Deadline Day, his attention perked up. \"We knew he was late first (round), early second,\" Oats recalled. \"He had a guarantee in the early second. He called me late in the afternoon and said, 'Coach, what if I told you I always wanted to come back?' I said, 'Shoot, Roll Tide. Let's go win one.' He's a great kid. He's an Alabama kid who wants to take Alabama to places it's never gone before. We were able to make the Final Four the year before he got here. We got beat in the Elite Eight last year. He came back to compete for a national championship, and I think we got a team that can do it.\"\nPhilon kept his decision so under wraps that even some Alabama staffers were caught by surprise when the news trickled out less than 90 minutes before the 11:59 p.m. deadline. Those well-made portal plans? Yeah, they got tossed in a hurry. Alabama didn't need to find a star anymore. It had one charting back to Tuscaloosa.\"When I first made the decision, I called all the coaches and told them, you know, I wanted to come play for a championship team with a higher standard and come be a leader,\" Philon said. \"Come back and do things that, you know, I didn't have the chance to do last year. Take more sacrifices. I've just been learning as I go.\"Philon got a front-row seat to Mark Sears being the one Oats so routinely leaned on to take game-altering shots in enormous moments. Sometimes, the ball went in, like when Sears splashed a floater to beat hated Auburn on the road. Make or miss, Philon observed the cross a star has to carry.\nAfter 25 points in Madison Square Garden against St. John's and 24 more at the United Center, consider those lessons learned. Philon's days of playing in NBA arenas are so clearly right around the corner as he builds his stock from fringe Day 1 candidate to potential lottery prospect, but he may have a few more giants to slay first. \"He's a pro,\" Illinois coach Brad Underwood said succinctly. \"Sometimes good players just have the ability to take over a game like that, and he did that tonight.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        At last year's RSM Classic, Joel Dahmen rolled in a 6-foot par putt on the 72nd hole to retain his full-time playing privileges on the PGA Tour. The one-time PGA Tour winner, who has become more well-known for his role in Netflix's \"Full Swing\" than his on-course playing, eked inside the magic number amid an emotional week on St. Simons Island.It was a feel-good story. Dahmen is a popular figure in the game thanks to his outgoing personality, and while his golf has perhaps not yet reached a similar level, it has generally kept him on or around the bubble of being a full-time PGA Tour member.But it almost did not happen.Dahmen made another 6-foot par putt earlier in the week, this time on Friday, to make the cut. He started his final round on the Seaside Course at Sea Island Golf Club on the back nine and turned in 30 thanks in large part to a hole-out eagle. The only footage of the shot came from a shot link tower, and the video was grainier than some Bermuda grass runoff areas that are deadly enough to cause golfers to wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat.All of this pushed Dahmen into a share of 35th place in the RSM Classic, 124th in the FedEx Cup standings -- one slot inside the top 125, all of whom earn full-time PGA Tour status.\nThis year, Dahmen arrives at the RSM Classic in a familiar position despite being inside that key number. The 37-year-old is No. 117 in the FedEx Cup standings -- a place that would have been safe 365 days ago -- in need of a massive week to squeeze his way inside the magic number yet again. This time, however, that number has tightened and shifted to the top 100.With the PGA Tour making a concerted effort to trim the fat via fewer full-time PGA Tour cards, fewer Korn Ferry Tour graduates receiving PGA Tour cards, smaller fields and the elimination of Monday qualifiers, this week's RSM Classic has become even more cutthroat.Someone like Dahmen needs 100 FedEx Cup points, a shot and a prayer to climb inside the top 100. At the same time, he needs to maintain his place inside the top 125 to secure conditional status, although that is not without some caveats as well.\n2026 PGA Tour Priority RankingHow playing opportunities are divided among those who earn exempt status. Those who meet categories in bold receive PGA Tour cards in 2026, while those in italics have conditional status.CategoryDescriptionTournament winnersIncludes multi-season exemptionsTop 70Through the FedEx Cup PlayoffsNos. 71-100Through the RSM ClassicDP World Tour Top 10Top 10 finishers, not otherwise exempt, in Race to DubaiKorn Ferry Tour Top 20Q-School Top 5PGA Tour UniversityNo. 1 in rankings and AcceleratedTop 70 non-memberNon-member with FedEx Cup points greater than or equal to No. 70 in 2025 FedEx CupTop 30 (Year 2)Top 30 in 2024 FedEx Cup, not otherwise exemptCareer moneyTop 25 and 50Life memberNos. 101-110Through the RSM Classic300 career cuts3x Korn Ferry/DP World Tour winnerMajor medical extensionNos. 111-125Through the RSM ClassicNon-exempt medical extensionBeyond No. 150Past champions and veterans beyond No. 150 in FedEx CupPast championSpecial temporary memberVeteran memberWhile discussions this time of year are rightfully around the top 100 and those earning full-time playing privileges, the secondary cut-off point beyond that number is just as intriguing. Those who finish Nos. 101-110 at the end of the RSM Classic will find themselves much better off than those who finish Nos. 111-125, even if both tiers are only obtaining conditional status.So for someone like Dahmen, a move from No. 117 to, say, No. 109 holds weight. It's more attainable. Less outside help is required. Fewer starts than he made in 2025 may be the result, but an upward movement would give him more starts in 2026 compared to if he stays in the same position. With this in mind, let's look at some of the names at all of those cut-off points -- Nos. 100, 110 and 125 -- at the onset of the final PGA Tour event of the 2025 season.Players on FedEx Cup bubbles1\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Takumi Kanaya\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nEarning his PGA Tour card via his third-place finish at Q-School, Kanaya has been boom-or-bust with his latest boom coming at last week's Bermuda Championship. Finishing T3 -- his second top-five finish of the fall -- the man from Japan jumped from No. 120 to No. 99 in the season-long race and is on the inside track to retain his full-time playing privileges.&#xA0;2\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Matt Wallace\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nThe Englishman has enjoyed a solid fall on both the PGA Tour and DP World Tour. A runner-up result at the European Masters at the end of August preceded a top-10 finish at the Baycurrent Classic at the beginning of October. His game looks much sharper now compared to the early spring, and it will need to show up on Sea Island where his best finish has been T37 in four appearances.3\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Beau Hossler\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nWild to think this was Hossler's eighth year playing on the PGA Tour as his run at the Olympic Club, and his time as a Texas Longhorn seem like just yesterday. His missed cut at the Bermuda Championship was ill-timed as he dropped from No. 98 in the FedEx Cup standings, but the good news is the golf has been improving over the last handful of months. Hossler has six top-20 finishes in his last 15 starts dating back to the PGA Championship.4\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Joel Dahmen\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nDahmen and this time of year have become synonymous at this point. He got off to such a great start in 2025 with a T9 at the Farmers Insurance Open and T6 at the Mexico Open. It was all trending in the right direction ahead of the Corales Puntacana Championship, where with only a few holes left in the tournament, Dahmen was in the driver's seat for his second PGA Tour win. Ultimately not meant to be and settling for a runner-up finish, Dahmen has been the same since. He has missed 10 of his last 16 cuts.5\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Frankie Capan\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nThe buzz around Capan's name has not translated into rookie-year success, but there are signs of promise forming. The 26-year-old finished T6 at the Sanderson Farms Championship and was in the hunt last week at the Bermuda Championship with a real chance to win before finishing T3. The result pushed him up 18 spots in the FedEx Cup standings, and something similar could go a long way for next season.6\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Harry Higgs\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nSimilar to Dahmen, HIggs had his chance to win on the PGA Tour this season, but it slipped through his grasp. A loser to Ryan Fox in the playoff at the Myrtle Beach Classic, the 33-year-old has notched no other top-20 finishes in 2025. This campaign comes just one year after winning twice on the Korn Ferry Tour in back-to-back weeks to reclaim his PGA Tour card.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 12 commences with the Buffalo Bills visiting the Houston Texans on 'Thursday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud (concussion) has been ruled out. With Stroud out, those involved in NFL DFS contests will gravitate towards making a Josh Allen and James Cook NFL DFS stack with the Bills being top-heavy, while under-the-radar options include Khalil Shakir and Ty Johnson. As for Houston, its top daily Fantasy football pick is Nico Collins, who has thrived no matter who has thrown him passes, but the Texans' running back pairing shouldn't be overlooked.Veteran Nick Chubb may not be what he once was, but he can still move the chains and is a nice complement to Woody Marks. The rookie back is a good bet for double-digit touches every week, and he also won't set back your NFL DFS salary cap too much, thus allowing you to still include higher-priced players in TNF DFS lineups.

The reigning MVP nearly single-handedly won many NFL DFS contests for whomever rostered him last week with 317 yards and three touchdowns through the air, plus 40 yards and three scores on the ground. Allen has multiple total touchdowns in all but one game this season and leads all quarterbacks in Fantasy points for the fourth time in his career. While Houston has an elite defense, it is susceptible on the ground to quarterbacks as each of the last three it faced had at least 33 rushing yards, despite each being less mobile than Allen. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Texans tight end Dalton Schultz. He's come on strong as of late with Davis Mills under center. Schultz has at least six catches and 51 yards in each of the last three weeks, with one total touchdown. He's averaging 60.5 receiving yards over his last six games and is on pace to have career highs in both catches and yards this season. Buffalo hasn't faced many top-tier TEs this season, but Travis Kelce -- who has fewer targets and catches than Schultz in 2025 -- had 66 yards and 2-point score versus the Bills in Week 9. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Texans vs. BillsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.'

    "body": "\n        Thursday Night Football's matchup between the Bills and Texans might not feature two elite quarterbacks, because C.J. Stroud is out for a third straight week due to his presence in the concussion protocol. But the stakes aren't any lower -- it's the start of Week 12 and both of these teams are battling for playoff position. Houston is rolling out Davis Mills and hoping to win their third game in a row with a backup quarterback starting. The Texans are currently the first team out on the AFC side of the bracket. The Bills find themselves in relatively unfamiliar territory, staring way up at the Patriots in the division. Buffalo isn't dead in the AFC East, but has very little wiggle room, especially with New England being gifted the one of the softest schedules in league history.We've got a low total for this game, and it's a Thursday night featuring two teams that would love to run the ball a bunch, so be cautious with your prop bets in this one -- offense might be at a premium. That being said, we can still find some spots that are juicy enough for us to attack. Let's build on last week's 3-1 record and try to hit some touchdown props.Click here to bet on Bills vs. Texans at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first bet wins, along with three months of NBA League Pass:\nIf you're new to NFL betting or need a refresher, make sure to check out our NFL betting guide with the season underway. Also make sure to check out the SportsLine Projection Model's forecast for the entire Bills versus Texans game.Top straight bet (spread, money line or total)Texans +5.5This line has come down despite the news C.J. Stroud is not going to play for Houston on Thursday night. That's pretty surprising, especially since Josh Allen decided to go nuclear last week and combine for six total touchdowns in what eventually became a blowout win over the Buccaneers. Houston is a different beast, however. I can't believe I wrote that about a Davis Mills-led team, but it's true. The Houston defense is a top-five unit in the NFL and I wouldn't expect the Texans to hemorrhage points at home in primetime in what is pretty close to a must-win game for them.The Texans sit at 5-5 and badly need a victory here to stay on pace with the Jaguars for the final wild-card spot, especially with the Chiefs lurking. Working in their favor is a Bills defense that's been just mediocre this season, thanks in large part to injuries. Buffalo's only held three teams -- the Jets, Saints and Panthers -- under 20 points this year. If the Texans can prevent Buffalo from topping 25 points here (Buffalo's team total is 24.5 juiced to the Under, so it's reasonable), they've got a very good chance at staying within this number. You can bet on the Texans to cover the spread at BetMGM, where new users get up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if their first bet doesn't win:Bills vs. Texans player propsNico Collins Over 5.5 receptions (-122)Mills is an obvious downgrade from Stroud, but we can still roll with Collins here and feel pretty comfortable about it. Despite the Texans trotting out a backup quarterback the last two weeks, Collins is still getting fed. Over Houston's last two games, Collins has 25 targets and has totaled 16 catches and 128 yards with one touchdown on those looks. His ATD number is plus money and I certainly considered that, but it feels like this is a safer bet, largely because the Bills should be able to do something on offense, forcing the Texans to throw more than DeMeco Ryans might like. We're also getting a discount from the rest of the market on this price at FanDuel. Collins is an absolute alpha and Mills isn't flinching when it comes to looking his way. When the Texans need to move the ball through the air, it's headed Collins' way more often than not. Khalil Shakir longest reception Over 17.5 yards (-114)Buffalo had a funky wide receiver rotation last week, with no one playing more than 54% of the offensive snaps and Shakir and Tyrell Shavers tied for the lead in that department. Gabe Davis and Josh Palmer both saw more than 40% of the snaps as well and it's possible the Bills continue to mix and match skill guys while funneling the offense through Josh Allen and James Cook. Given that and Shakir's lack of production, I'm a little nervy about this number, even though FanDuel has a much lower longest reception total by two yards than the rest of the market.Shakir has the dad strength narrative going in this one, it's primetime, he's hit this number in three of his last four games and we don't need a ton of volume here. He also profiles as a receiver who isn't a great matchup for this stingy Texans defense because of where and how he works on the field.  Dalton Schultz Over 4.5 receptions (+110)My initial look was to Jayden Higgins here, but his prop is set at 2.5 receptions and is seriously juiced up everywhere. I really like it as a parlay piece if you're so inclined, but instead let's roll with Schultz and a significantly bigger number at a much better plus price. The Texans passing offense is highly-concentrated over the last two games. Mills has 86(!) passing attempts in that span, and 59 of those attempts have gone to Collins, Schultz and Higgins. Schultz, specifically, has 20 targets in his last two games, which makes sense. When a backup quarterback is under center, they're usually pretty likely to feed their safety blanket over the middle and Schultz is just that. If Houston falls behind at all, I'd expect Schultz to get peppered with targets and he should still be a key factor in just about every third-down playcall. TNF anytime touchdown scorer propsJosh Allen -115Great news: SportsLine subscribers who turned on alerts for my bets would have gotten at a much cheaper price when it was widely available at -115 or better. Even better news: after steaming down to -130 in some spots, this number is now back to -115 on Thursday morning, at least at FanDuel. Grab it now, because it probably dips again before kickoff. The reason Allen's price plunged -- and it's still bettable to -125 in my opinion -- is because of what Allen did last year and then last week. In 2024, Allen propelled himself to the MVP award with superhuman play down the stretch, specifically by using his legs to produce touchdowns. From Week 10 through Week 17 (which included the Bills' Week 12 bye, so seven games), Allen scored an absurd nine rushing touchdowns. Last week, in Week 11 of 2025, he found the end zone three times with his legs. The Bills are fighting an uphill battle to win the AFC East and are jockeying for playoff position. Allen is going to activate his legs again in all likelihood and will put his body on the line when the Bills get into the red zone. It wouldn't be stunning if we saw him rip off a streak of touchdowns akin to what he did last year once again. Against a robust defense like Houston, he'll be extremely aggressive. Woody Marks +130 (FanDuel)Before Week 11, Ryans remarked there are \"no rookies\" anymore, meaning the Texans are in crunch time and everyone involved in the Texans offense needed to step up with Houston missing its starting quarterback. This applied to Marks, who has become the primary back for this Texans offense. Marks has 32 carries the last two weeks, with one of those games coming in a serious negative gamescript.It's possible the Texans find themselves trailing here if Josh Allen goes Superman, but the Houston defense should keep them in this game early on, which means lots of Marks. And when the Texans get down to the goal line, I'd expect Marks to get fed as well. The Bills rush defense isn't great: they've given up 12 (!) rushing touchdowns over their last six games, including three to Sean Tucker and Baker Mayfield last week. The Bills also rank 31st in yards per carry allowed (5.1) and have been even worse (5.4) over the last three weeks.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe've reached Week 12 of the 2025 NFL season, and we have a pretty good idea of who the good and bad teams in the league are by this point. If we've figured that out, so too have sportsbooks, and we're seeing some pretty sizable point spreads this week. NFL betting expert Jeff Hochman has identified a betting trend involving underdogs that he's shared for Week 12, and it involves games with lower totals, or the over/under. Here, Hochman breaks down the criteria for this trend while sharing which games qualify this week. NFL underdogs with low totals (over/under 42 or less)Win Rate: 205-150-10 ATS (57.7%)Sample Size: Since 2018Criteria: Underdogs of 6.5 or more points with a total of 42 or lessEdge: Weeks 10 through 15Why this worksMy job involves researching the best NFL systems that have a proven track record of generating profits. I focus on systems with a win rate of at least 60%. There were no such systems this week, but I did find one that's close.When the total is 42 points or lower, the betting market expects a defensive battle or limitations in offensive performance. However, sportsbooks often do not adjust point spreads to reflect this lower scoring expectation. A larger point spread in a game with a total of 42 points or less represents a significantly greater percentage of the expected final score compared to a 6.5-point spread in a game with a total of 50 points. The betting market prices in the favorite's superiority as if normal scoring will occur, but the low total constrains how many points the superior team can actually generate. This has always been one of the sharpest NFL betting systems for underdogs, especially as the season progresses.Week 12 qualifiersTennessee Titans +13.5 vs. Seattle Seahawks | Confidence: 3 out of 5Following a tough road loss to the Los Angeles Rams in which Seattle committed four turnovers and recorded only 272 total yards, the Seahawks now risk underestimating a historically struggling Titans team. This marks Seattle's first back-to-back road games of the season, and the Seahawks have gone 5-0 against the spread in their last five games. Teams on an ATS winning streak of five or more that then play their second consecutive road game as double-digit favorites have always been a profitable spot to take the home underdog.I am not going to try to sell you based purely on all the predictive metrics. They all point to an easy win and cover for the road team. While this is a double-digit underdog, the ultra-low total of 40.5 creates a system edge. Games with totals this low rarely produce the wide margins the spread suggests. Even though the Titans are inferior talent-wise, the defensive slugfest nature of this matchup makes the 13.5 points difficult to cover. Do the Seahawks have enough incentive to pour it on late if they are up by 7-13 points in the fourth quarter? I am not so sure. My confidence level would go up to 4 if this line jumps to 14, which is entirely possible. The sportsbooks will desperately need the Titans to cover the spread, and it's always better to side with the bookmakers over the long haul.Minnesota Vikings +6.5 at Green Bay Packers | Confidence: 1 out of 5The Vikings are catching 6.5 points on the road in a divisional game with an ultra-low total. Green Bay is just 3-7 ATS this season despite its 6-3-1 overall record, representing consistent market overvaluation. The low total suggests a defensive struggle where the Vikings' defense can keep this competitive enough to cover. I can't get there at the current number. A big reason why is a complete mismatch in QB play.Jordan Love operates under far less pressure than J.J. McCarthy. Love completes 67.7% of passes (ranked ninth) while being sacked just 4.88% of the time (eighth), suggesting elite pass protection around him. His 230.5 passing yards per game (11th) come on quality attempts, generating 7.8 yards per pass (sixth). Love throws interceptions at just 0.96% (fifth best). He's been terrific despite numerous injuries at the skill positions.Conversely, McCarthy's efficiency metrics paint a different picture. He's been sacked 9.6% of the time, leading to rushed decisions. His completion percentage sits at 52.9%, which would rank dead last if he qualified. He has started only five games, and the most concerning is his interception rate of 4.1%. Under pressure, McCarthy's completion rate drops to 48.9% with a catchable-ball rate of just 38.7%. Although the sample sizes are small, the eye tests indicate that McCarthy requires more repetitions as his rookie season progresses. The Packers' secondary has allowed just 21 completions of 20+ yards all season (fewest in NFL). I like the Packers in this spot as McCarthy makes his first career start at Lambeau Field.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are running out of time. Every season seems to fly by, but the end of the 2025 regular season snuck up on me this year. It wasn't until last week that it dawned on me we only had two full Saturdays of action left. Now we're down to one.With Thanksgiving next week, we'll see a heavy slate of Black Friday games, which waters down the Saturday schedule. Where did the year go? Where did The Six Pack's money go? Well, that last question is easy to answer: down the drain. We couldn't even go 3-3 last week, though we would have if Bill Belichick and Jake Dickert hadn't gotten into a timeout battle at the end of their game that led to Wake Forest scoring a touchdown with 22 seconds left instead of kneeling the clock out.Hey, maybe we'll go 12-0 these next two weeks and get out of the hole before bowl season. Games of the Week\nTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (free), Paramount+ Premium\nNo. 15 USC at No. 7 Oregon: An absolutely massive matchup in a weekend short on them. USC is in a spot where its only realistic hope of reaching the College Football Playoff is winning out. It also has a path to a Big Ten title if it does so, though it'd need help elsewhere. The Ducks are not in a position where they have to win out, but a loss to either USC or Washington next week would put them in a precarious position. One they almost certainly want to avoid.So we know that we're going to get everything both teams have in this one. The problem is that both teams have been dealing with injuries, and we don't know who will be available, and we don't know how healthy they'll be if they do play. The good news for Oregon is that, if they remain without Dakorien Moore and Gary Bryant Jr. this week, they've proven they're just as happy to pound the rock in the run game. This is a team that's second in EPA per rush nationally and fifth in explosive rush rate.They'll be facing a USC defense that has not been solid against the run. The Trojans' defense ranks 119th nationally in success rate against the run and 126th in EPA per rush allowed. So even if Oregon is healthy, I expect a heavy dose of Jordon Davison and Dierre Hill Jr. here. \nThe other problem facing USC is that, for all the focus on how physical they are, they've struggled mightily on the road all year. The drop-off on the defensive side of the ball hasn't been too drastic, but offensively, this is a different team outside The Coliseum. Jayden Maiava has struggled in particular, so going on the road to play at Autzen Stadium, I don't have the utmost confidence in Maiva to make the plays necessary to do what the Trojans need to pull off the upset. Still, in the end, the spread feels a little too large. So, given I expect Oregon to lean on its rushing attack and that the USC offense will struggle, I'd rather make a play on the total, which feels a bit too high. The Pick: Under 59.5 (-112) at Draftkings\nNo. 22 Missouri at No. 8 Oklahoma: The Oklahoma offense did not play well in last week's win over Alabama, but the Sooners didn't need it to. The defense carried the load, as it has most of the season, and that will likely continue this weekend. The Sooners will be happy to return home knowing they only need to win these final games of the season to get to the playoff. They'll be facing a Missouri team that could have Beau Pribula back in action for the first time since the Vanderbilt loss a month ago.I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing for Missouri. Pribula was carted off with a serious ankle injury. If he's back, he's coming in cold against what might be the best defense in the nation, and if he's in any way limited by his ankle, you're limiting a part of what makes Pribula dangerous as a quarterback. That said, while Eli Drinkwitz has been complimentary of Matt Zollers' performance in Pribula's stead, I don't have to be as polite. He hasn't been good, and given how he performed against a Mississippi State defense that's been one of the SEC's worst, he isn't likely to tear the Sooners apart.\nAll of which leads me to believe the Tigers won't score many points here. But I'm not all that confident in Oklahoma's offense, either. The Missouri defense may not be at the same elite level as Oklahoma's, but it's pretty damn good itself, and if it can limit the Oklahoma rushing attack, it stands a strong chance of turning this one into an ugly affair. Which is what I think happens. The Pick: Under 42.5 (-110) at FanduelLock of the Week\nWashington State at James Madison: The CFP selection committee sent a loud message to James Madison this week. They'd rather have Tulane, a team with a 22-point loss on its resume, in the field than a one-loss Sun Belt champion. I'm not here to argue whether they're right or wrong in the assessment. What matters for our purposes is that James Madison knows that the only way it's going to earn any respect from the committee is if it continues winning and blowing teams out in the process.The Dukes have a chance to do that here. Washington State has plenty to play for. It's 5-5 and needs another win to earn bowl eligibility. It's also been a pain in the butt in these situations already this year. The Cougars made cross-country trips to Ole Miss and Virginia in consecutive games, but while they lost both, the two losses came by five points combined. The difference this week is that I don't know how focused on the Cougars either the Rebels or Cavaliers were in those games (Ole Miss had Georgia on deck, while Virginia had a big road game against UNC). James Madison is locked in here.\nAlso, Wazzu has a home game against Oregon State next week in the second leg of the Pac-12 Championship. They lost the first. I don't think Washington State punts on this game, but I do think if the Cougars fall behind early, we could see them pack it up and get ready for next week. And even if both teams go all out for four quarters, I think the Dukes can cover. The Pick: James Madison -13.5 (-110) at FanduelUnderhogs of the Week\nArkansas at No. 17 Texas: Is Arkansas the best two-win team in the country? I certainly think so. One of my favorite stats of the season so far is that the Razorbacks are 2-8 on the year, but have a point differential of +18 on the season. And that includes their 43-point loss to Notre Dame! The Hogs are 0-6 in the SEC, but haven't lost any conference game by more than nine points. Their average losing margin has been 4.2 points. They don't win, but they score enough points to hang around against everybody, which makes them extremely dangerous.And they're dangerous here against a Texas team reeling from a 25-point loss at Georgia last week. I can't overlook the fact that this Longhorns defense has allowed at least 31 points in its last three games for an average of 34.7 per game. Arkansas' offense has some similarities to Mississippi State's, and the Bulldogs put up 38 on the Horns. I expect we see a much better offensive performance from Texas this week than the one we saw last week, but I also think Arkansas does that thing where it just hangs around. The Pick: Arkansas +8.5 (-108) at Draftkings\nRock Fight of the Week\nMinnesota at Northwestern: These are two of the slower-moving teams in the country. In fact, according to my pace metrics, nobody is slower than Minnesota. Furthermore, both of these teams have been moving more slowly as the year goes on. That's just how things work in the Midwest as fall begins to turn into winter. The days get shorter, and so do the games. Neither team moves quickly, nor do they produce many explosive plays. They kind of just plod down the field, and while they can reach the red zone, when they get there, they don't score nearly enough touchdowns. Both rank outside the top 80 when it comes to points per red zone possession. Finally, the rosters are similar. They're just a good matchup for one another! This will be another of those 1-0 pitchers' duels at Wrigley Field, where the only run scored comes via two errors and a wild pitch. The Pick: Under 40.5 (-110) at DraftkingsUpset of the Week\nNo. 18 Michigan at Maryland: The Six Pack has been getting killed on the Upset of the Week this year. It's 1-11, and if we removed it from the column entirely, we'd be 32-28 overall and only down 1.19 units. Still not good, but a whole hell of a lot better than where we are.\nSo if we're going to make up some ground, we need to take bigger swings, but ones that are realistic. This one is far more realistic than you might realize. I do think it's important for Maryland that Mike Locksley's future has been settled. There's no more mystery. He'll be back next season, and that could help settle the locker room. There's also the fact Michigan has been a bad team on the road this year.You might remember the Wolverines turned the ball over five times and needed a last-second field goal to beat Northwestern at Wrigley Field last week. You may also remember their road losses to Oklahoma and USC, as well as a close call against Nebraska. I know Maryland isn't as good as any of those teams, but the other thing we have to consider here is next week. That's when Michigan plays Ohio State. We all know how important that game is to the Wolverines, and how they'd love nothing more than to beat Ohio State again. This wouldn't be the first time we saw a team get caught looking ahead to its rival now, would it? Finally, Maryland needs to win out to get to a bowl game. If they win this one, Michigan State at home is extremely winnable next week, too. You're going to get a home run effort from the Terps here. Michigan better deliver the knockout early, because if it doesn't, this one could be dicey down the stretch.

    "body": "\n        Darnell Washington's recent demolition of the Bengals' secondary was so notable that it actually led to the NFL giving him an award. That's right. Washington, the Steelers' massive tight end, was the recipient of the 2025 NFL Way to Play Award for Week 11 for his 31-yard catch and run that saw him stiff-arm one defender, run through another and then knock over yet another Bengal before stepping out of bounds. \"Three levels of defenders,\" executive vice president of NFL operations Troy Vincent said. \"Watch his effort at every level. Look at the first stiff arm. Not illegal. Great distance between him and the tackler.\"He goes to the next level and runs through a second defender. Then he keeps eating. He gets the defensive back who wants no part of this.\n\"Last time I saw something like this you were looking at videos of Jim Brown back in the day. Excellent job, Darnell.\"\nAnytime you're mentioned in the same sentence as Jim Brown, that's a pretty good day's work. But in Washington's case, he is in a class all by himself. Built like a tackle, playing tight end\nAt 6-foot-7, Washington is among the tallest tight ends in NFL history. And based on what he said recently on the St. Brown Podcast, he might be the heaviest tight end in league history, too. \n\"I'm gonna keep it a buck. I'm 311,\" said Washington, who is listed at 264 pounds. Because Washington is officially listed at 264 pounds, the heaviest tight end to catch a pass in NFL history is technically former Cowboy Kendell Watkins, who was listed at 305 pounds. Watkins caught just one career pass, which came from Troy Aikman during the Cowboys' 1995 Super Bowl-winning season. Washington's size has essentially made him a pass-catching offensive tackle. He's two inches taller than Steelers starting left tackle Broderick Jones, who also tips the scales at 311 pounds. \nThe most prominent big tight end in NFL history was 295-pound Brandon Manumaleuna, who caught 115 passes during his 10-year career. A weapon unlike anything in today's NFLA 2023 third-round pick, Washington is in the midst of a breakout season. His 18 receptions is just one off his single-season high of 19 catches from last year. Against the Bengals, he caught four of his five targets for 67 yards while helping Pittsburgh (6-4) stay ahead of second-place Baltimore (5-5) in the AFC North standings. Why the uptick in production? The biggest reason is Aaron Rodgers, who compared him to former Packers teammate Marcedes Lewis shortly after he signed with the Steelers. Rodgers quickly worked to build a rapport with his new tight end; he threw a series of red zone passes to Washington during their first practices as teammates as the two continued to work on their rapport throughout the summer. \n\"There was a lot of conversation about, is he in the right position?\" Rodgers said earlier this season. \"He's definitely in the right position, because he's so big and so athletic for a man of that size. To be that skilled in the passing game, is pretty impressive, not to mention what he does on the line of scrimmage.\" Washington's ability as a receiver -- and the mismatches it can create -- has also been embraced by Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, who earlier this season made a Shaquille O'Neal reference when discussing Washington's potential as a red zone threat. \nWashington has parlayed his unique skillset into a productive season for a Steelers team that has at times had to lean on his ability as a pass-catcher given their lack of depth at receiver. \n\"I don't know that he's physically gotten better,\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin recently said of Washington. \"We might just be discovering him. Some of the freakish things that you see him do in stadium I saw him do on Georgia tape. Some of the freakish things that I've seen him do this year I saw him do last year. He had a unique run after, certainly, the other day that kind of ignited our collective offensively and defensively. He had a similar play, I remember, in Indianapolis last year when we were kind of, you know, running in place offensively and he made a play and it kind of ignited us.\"He's a special athlete. He has unique talents. He's certainly a tough guy to deal with in one-on-one tackle circumstances, and it makes him a force to be reckoned with.\"Could he redefine the position?While Washington's success this season has been surprising to most, former teammate George Pickens said during their rookie training camp that Washington has the potential to be the greatest tight end of all-time. \nWhen asked about Pickens' comments, Washington offered his perspective on what success would mean for him at the NFL level. \"Really, just playing in the league as long as possible,\" he said. \"Giving it my all, leaving no regrets on the field, if that's practice or in the games. Just finding a rhythm and continue on that rhythm and continue to put in that work and make plays or whatever it may be.\"It's easy to forget that there were rumblings not too long ago that Washington was possibly going to follow in former All-Pro Larry Brown's footsteps in terms of moving from tight end to offensive tackle. Brown, who caught the game-clinching touchdown pass in Pittsburgh's first Super Bowl win, was the team's starting left tackle when they successfully defended their title a year later against the Cowboys in Super Bowl X. \nBut instead of following in Brown's footsteps, Washington is continuing to thrive in his natural position, much to the delight of his quarterback. \"They're getting scared of him, for sure,\"  Rodgers said Wednesday while referencing Washington's big play against the Bengals. \"Which they should be. He's a mammoth. \"I'm just so proud of him. Just his approach. Really, the growth I've seen since training camp is that he's continued to get his body in shape, get his mind in shape. He's a guy you don't worry about the details at all. He's very detailed-oriented, super smart player. ... He's faster than people probably think because he's so tremendously large, and he's also shifty. ... He's consistently, most of the season, made those (game-changing) plays.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We should've seen this coming. After pointing out how we've turned a corner in the past two weeks, entering Week 11, we cratered. I was on the wrong side of a couple of heartbreakers over the Sunday slate that led me to a 4-11 ATS record (8-7 straight up) overall. Gross. The Commanders couldn't do us a favor and hang on to pull off the upset over Miami in Madrid, the hook burned us with our Packers -7.5 bet, and both Houston and Baltimore laid eggs against inferior competition (albeit fending off the outright upsets). That leaves a bitter taste, but it wasn't as dire when it came to my five locks of the week, as I went 2-3 ATS overall. Not great, but not catastrophic either. All we can do now is pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, leave those losses in the past, and dial up some winners in Week 12. We'll start, as always, by highlighting my five locks of the week, which feature two rookie quarterbacks -- including Shedeur Sanders -- pulling off outright wins. Teams on bye in Week 12: Denver, Miami, Los Angeles (Chargers) and WashingtonNFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.

While the defending NFL MVP is certainly capable of putting together a similar performance at a moment's notice, he'll likely face much tougher sledding in this head-to-head against Houston. The Texans boast arguably the best defense in the NFL, leading the league in points allowed (16.3 points per game) and total yards allowed (258.1 yards per game). They've also allowed less than 20 points in seven of their 10 games in 2025, creating a difficult path forward offensively for Buffalo. On the other side, Davis Mills (filling in again for the injured C.J. Stroud) won't face as difficult a unit in the Bills defense. Sean McDermott's defense has given up at least 30 points in back-to-back games and has one of the worst run defenses in the NFL, allowing teams to average 153 yards per game on the ground (31st). Buffalo is 1-3 ATS in prime time this season, and expect another closely contested game again here as we begin Week 12 on Thursday night. \nProjected score: Bills 24, Texans 20The pick: Texans +5.5Atlanta Falcons at New Orleans SaintsSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)The Falcons are in a bad way at the moment. The club is coming off back-to-back overtime losses (one in Germany) over the last two weeks, extending its losing streak to five games. To make matters worse, the Falcons placed quarterback Michael Penix Jr. on IR due to a knee injury, and will now have to start Kirk Cousins going forward. Cousins looked old coming in under duress last week, and the team is averaging just 20.2 points per game with him as the starter, dating to last season. If that persists -- particularly with wideout Drake London (knee) likely not going in this game -- and the Falcons defense continues to surrender 27.8 points per game and 399.6 total yards of offense as they have during this losing skid, New Orleans has a lane to its third win of the season. As for the Saints, Tyler Shough played well last time out and will be coming off a Week 11 bye, so he's had time to prepare for this divisional matchup.  Projected score: Saints 23, Falcons 21The pick: Saints -1.5Cleveland Browns at Las Vegas RaidersSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)The big storyline in this game is Shedeur Sanders getting his first career start after Dillon Gabriel landed in concussion protocol last week. Sanders didn't look good when he came in for Gabriel last week, but this pick isn't really about who is or is not under center for Cleveland. Instead, it has everything to do with the Raiders, who look lost. Offensively, they are 30th in total yards per game and tied for 30th in points per game. Now, they are expected to move the ball against a Browns defense that is second in the NFL in total yards per game allowed. Not only that, but Geno Smith currently leads the NFL with 13 interceptions this season and will face a Cleveland defense that has recorded 10 takeaways over the last four games. Their knack for creating turnovers will likely continue against Smith, which should make life wildly easier for Sanders and the offense to put up points with short fields. Projected score: Browns 20, Raiders 16The pick: Browns +3Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay PackersSunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox | Fubo, try for free)If you've followed along this season, you'll know that I'm not the biggest believer in the Packers. They've consistently played down to their competition, which has made games much closer than they should be. While that has me dubious on their chances of making a strong push in the playoffs if/when they get there, I think they're a safe bet against the number in Week 12. Why? Because for as much as I am skeptical about Green Bay, I'm even more so when it comes to J.J. McCarthy. There were points last week in Minnesota's loss to Chicago where it felt like McCarthy could end up being benched. He's completing just 52.9% of his passes this season and is the first quarterback since Zach Wilson (not great company) to have an interception in five straight games to begin his career. \nThat's a long way of saying that I don't expect much from the Vikings offense, especially against a defense that is allowing the third-fewest yards per play (4.7) this season. Projected score: Packers 27, Vikings 17The pick: Packers -6.5New England Patriots at Cincinnati BengalsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)I don't see how Cincinnati keeps up. New England is riding an 8-game winning streak, and Drake Maye is playing at an MVP level, leading the NFL in completion percentage (71.9%) and passing yards (2,836) entering Week 12. Now, he'll face off against a Bengals defense that is giving up 33.4 points per game this season. That's not only the highest in the league in 2025, it's the most points per game allowed in a season since the 1966 New York Giants. They've also given up at least 27 points and 340 yards of offense in nine straight games (longest streak in the NFL since 1970). As the Patriots are projected to dominate on offense, the Bengals offense will have another hand tied behind their back with Ja'Marr Chase suspended for this game after spitting on Jalen Ramsey. This feels like a double-digit win and a ninth consecutive victory for Mike Vrabel's club. Projected score: Patriots 30, Bengals 20The pick: Patriots -8.5Rest of the bunchColts at ChiefsProjected score: Colts 27, Chiefs 24The pick: Colts +3.5Giants at LionsProjected score: Lions 30, Giants 17The pick: Lions -10.5Jets at RavensProjected score: Ravens 33, Jets 16The pick: Ravens -13.5Steelers at BearsProjected score: Bears 24, Steelers 20The pick: Bears -3Seahawks at TitansProjected score: Seahawks 30, Titans 14The pick: Seahawks -13.5\nJaguars at CardinalsProjected score: Cardinals 27, Jaguars 24The pick: Cardinals +2.5Eagles at CowboysProjected score: Eagles 30, Cowboys 20The pick: Eagles -3.5Buccaneers at RamsProjected score: Rams 24, Buccaneers 23The pick: Buccaneers +6.5Panthers at 49ersProjected score: 49ers 33, Panthers 24The pick:  49ers -7\n            ",

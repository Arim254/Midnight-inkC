    "body": "\n        Scottie Scheffler makes his season debut as the odds-on favorite to win the 2026 PGA American Express golf tournament. The world's top-ranked golfer is looking to win his 20th PGA tournament since turning pro in 2018. Scheffler, 29, last won at the Procore Championship last September in Scottsdale,  Ariz. He won by one stroke over fellow American Ben Griffin. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 11:30 a.m. ET from La Quinta Country Club in La Quinta, Calif. Scheffler, who tees off in a pairing with Justin Rose at 12:14 p.m. ET, is the +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300) at FanDuel Sportsbook. Other favorites include Ben Griffin at +2000 and Ludvig Aberg and Russell Henley both at +2200. Before making any 2026 American Express picks, you need to see the 2026 American Express predictions and best bets from golf expert Brady Kannon. Kannon is an elite golfing betting handicapper with more than 30 years of experience in the industry. He's hit eight major outright winners since 2013. In the fall of 2022, he hit outright winners in three consecutive weeks: Russell Henley (40-1), Tony Finau (18-1) and Adam Svensson (150-1). Last season, he hit Hideki Matsuyama (22-1), Harris English (110-1), Ludvig Aberg (25-1) and Ben Griffin/Andrew Novak (25-1) in New Orleans. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nNow, Kannon has focused his attention on the 2026 American Express field and locked in his best bets and top sleepers. You can only see them here. Top 2026 American Express expert picks One of Kannon's 2026 American Express predictions: He's completely fading Wyndham Clark, who is going off to 80-1. He's avoiding him in outright bets and advises to go against him in head-to-head bets as well.\"Clark did not play in Hawaii and missed the cut in his last regular Tour start back in early November,\" Kannon said. \"He finished 13th here at the Amex in 2022 but otherwise hasn't been better than 39th and missed the cut here last season. He is losing strokes both off the tee and on approach in each of his last five starts. Last season, Clark ranked 154th on Tour in Strokes Gained: Approach and 160th in Driving Accuracy. I also wonder if Clark's feelings of frustration regarding Brooks Koepka's return to the PGA Tour could still be a lingering distraction as he makes his season debut. I did find one head-to-head matchup with Clark as an underdog to J.T. Poston and yes, I would play the favorite against our fade player of the week.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.\nNew users can also check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $200 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:How to make 2026 American Express picksKannon has revealed his best bet, and it's a surprising golfer going off at nearly 100-1.

After skipping the one-week Hawaii Swing, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is set to make his debut as part of The American Express 2026 field. The four-time major winner hasn't played particularly well in this event, however, recording just one top-10 finish in five tries. The first tee times come at 11:30 a.m. ET, with Scheffler beginning at 12:14 p.m. ETThe 2026 American Express odds list Scheffler as the +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300). Ben Griffin, ranked No. 8 in the world, is next on the PGA odds board at +2000, with Ludvig Aberg and Russell Henley at +2200. Before locking in any 2026 American Express picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its golf betting picks since that point, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 American Express predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at The American Express 2026: Sam Burns, one of the favorites at +2500, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to avoid at La Quinta this week. Burns had some highlights in 2025, including finishing T7 at the Tour Championship after a strong playoff run. There were also some low points as well like going nine straight tournaments without a top-20 finish, including three straight missed cuts in that run. He has a pair of top-10 finishes at The American Express, but no top-5s, and he finished T29 last year, so the model doesn't like him as a top contender this week. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Matt Fitzpatrick a top-four contender this week despite being a +3500 longshot. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. This will be his debut at The American Express, but he finished 2025 strong with four top-10 finishes in his last six events. He finished the season 34th in Strokes Gained: Total and 30th in Strokes Gained: Putting, making him a golfer to target with slightly longer odds this week. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 American Express picksThe model is targeting six total longshots with odds of +4000 or higher in its outright bets. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 American Express, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Flores was on an expiring contract after serving as Minnesota's defensive coordinator for the past three seasons and recently interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers for their head jobs. If he's not hired to lead one of those teams, Flores will return to the Vikings.\"Brian has a unique ability to connect with players, understand their skill sets, and put them in positions to maximize their impact on the field,\" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell said. \"The identity of our defense is a reflection of his leadership and preparation. On a personal level, I've really valued the relationship we've built over the last three years, and that shared trust, alignment and high standard will continue to be critical to our success.\"Flores, 44, spent 15 seasons on Bill Belichick's staff with the New England Patriots. He won four Super Bowls with the Patriots, including one as the team's de facto defensive coordinator. Flores was credited with helping the Patriots hold the Rams to just three points in Super Bowl LIII. \nFlores parlayed his success in New England into his first head coaching opportunity with the Miami Dolphins, who hired him ahead of the 2019 season. After losing his first seven games in Miami, Flores guided the Dolphins to five wins in their final nine games. He was fired two years later despite leading the Dolphins to back-to-back winning seasons. Shortly after his firing, Flores sued the NFL, the Dolphins, New York Giants and Denver Broncos alleging racial discrimination. He then spent one season with the Pittsburgh Steelers as linebackers coach before becoming the Vikings' defensive coordinator. \nFlores was added to O'Connell's staff in Minnesota ahead of the 2023 season. In 2024, his defense finished fifth in the NFL in points allowed as the Vikings went 14-3 during the regular season. The Vikings allowed the seventh-fewest points in the league in 2025. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time since 2021, a numbered UFC event will not air on pay-per-view in the U.S. this Saturday when UFC 324 comes to Las Vegas in the first event of a new broadcasting era for the MMA worldwide leader. UFC's new seven-year media rights deal with Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS Sports) takes the product off of PPV domestically and onto the streaming network Paramount+. Bet UFC 324 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:In the main event, which emanates from T-Mobile Arena, Justin Gaethje and British star Paddy Pimblett will square off for the interim lightweight championship while top-five bantamweights Sean O'Malley and Song Yadong meet in the co-main event (after an injury to women's bantamweight champion Kayla Harrison postponed her superfight against former two-division champion Amanda Nunes). \nPlus, powerful heavyweights are set to collide when veteran and fan favorite Derrick Lewis returns to take on fast rising contender Waldo Cortes-Acosta. Former women's strawweight champion Rose Namajunas also looks to hold on to her position in the women's flyweight division when she takes on Natalia Silva. And the opening fight on the main card is sure to produce fireworks when Jean Silva takes on Arnold Allen at featherweight.Subscribe now to Paramount+ to get access to UFC 324 for just $8.99 per monthLet's take a closer look at the biggest storylines entering this weekend.1. Can Paddy Pimblett become the early face of the Paramount era? The flashy and charismatic 31-year-old from Liverpool, England, is certainly positioned to give it a try after lightweight champion Ilia Topuria's personal issues in the aftermath of his divorce left him unable to headline the first Paramount event. The biggest challenge for Pimblett, as he prepares to face all-action veteran Justin Gaethje for the interim 155-pound title, is that he will need to prove once and for all that he's an elite fighter. \"Paddy the Baddy\" might be 7-0 inside the Octagon since his 2021 UFC debut, but he has had some ups and downs along the growing process, including a highly disputed 2022 win over Jared Gordon and a history of heavy weight fluctuation between fights. The good news for Pimblett is that marriage and fatherhood seem to have matured him over the past two years and made him a more tactical and focused fighter as evidenced by back-to-back stoppage wins over veterans King Green and Michael Chandler. Should the Paramount era recharge the casual MMA audience by taking numbered events off of PPV, Pimblett's ability to talk on the microphone could bring quasi Conor McGregor flashbacks to general sports fans who haven't checked in on the product in a while. And an eventual matchup between them, should it take place at the White House, for example, could become a passing of the torch for popularity. But none of that matters if Pimblett can't back it up inside the Octagon. 2. Justin Gaethje enters his last shot at cementing his unforgettable legacyAlready the greatest action fighter in MMA history (seriously, debate me on that) and a former interim lightweight champion and symbolic \"BMF\" champion, \"The Highlight\" has already authored a future Hall of Fame career worth being proud of. But nothing in combat sports sure stamps all-time greatness like becoming an undisputed divisional champion, which is something that has eluded Gaethje throughout his nine years in the Octagon despite two chances already. At 37, with a strong track record of late having won three of his last four, Gaethje said publicly over the past year that he would only continue fighting if it was for a title. And his longtime coach, Trevor Wittman, said recently that Gaethje will retire if he loses on Saturday. Even though he's fighting Pimblett for the interim belt and not the full title, recent interviews suggest Gaethje is all in on leaving it all inside the Octagon to try and fulfill his longtime dream of becoming champion. And for a fighter so beloved for his willingness to entertain and brazenly welcome danger, an upset of Pimblett would put him in prime position for a storybook ending.\n3. Let the auditions for the next bantamweight title challenger begin!Petr Yan's upset of Merab Dvalishvili in their rematch in December didn't just snap an incredible 14-fight win streak for the former champion, it turned the division upside down. And while it's certainly possible Dvalishvili could be rewarded for his activity (he attempted a record four title defenses in 2025) by being given an immediate trilogy, Saturday's card offers a pair of top-10 bouts at 135 pounds that will likely serve as further auditions for Yan's first title defense. Former champion Sean O'Malley will look to rebound from a pair of title losses to Dvalishvili by facing Song Yadong. Umar Nurmagomedov, who lost a close decision to Dvalishvili in their UFC 311 title bout last year, will also face former two-time flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo. O'Malley might ultimately have the edge (should he defeat Yadong) not just because he's the most marketable fighter of the four but because he defeated Yan via split decision in their non-title meeting in 2022. But Nurmagomedov, the younger cousin of former lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, is undoubtedly the most skilled among them and a fighter who many critics believe is inevitably going to raise the gold. Either way, one of the sports most consistently deep and competitive divisions is going to be fun to follow in 2026.  4. Natalia Silva is closing in on a shot at flyweight goldA 7-0 record in the UFC since her 2022 debut and a win streak that has reached 13 consecutive overall has the Brazilian striker atop the women's flyweight rankings at 125 pounds. And if her thorough decision win last May over former champion Alexa Grasso wasn't enough to stamp her ticket to a title shot, it's very likely that a victory over former two-time strawweight queen Rose Namajunas on Saturday would seal the deal. The 28-year-old Silva, who also owns victories over former strawweight champion Jessica Andrade and Jasmine Jasudavicius, will get a nice close-up after her bout was elevated onto the main card following the postponement of Harrison-Nunes. But it's expected to be anything but an easy fight against Namajunas, 33, who is 4-2 since moving up in weight from 115 pounds in 2022 with her losses coming in competitive fights against top contenders Manon Fiorot and Erin Blanchfield. Namajunas hasn't looked completely comfortable at 125 pounds as of yet but has a history producing career-best performances just when it looks like her career is lacking momentum. 5. Don't sleep on the rise of middleweight Ateba GautierAt 6-foot-4 with an 81-inch reach, the 185-pound slugger known as \"The Silent Assassin\" has made a ton of noise in a short time period after debuting inside the Octagon last March. A native of Cameroon, Gautier (9-1) is just 23 and remains one of the most attractive prospects in the promotion following a knockout victory in his 2024 \"Dana White Contender Series\" bout that set up a trio of first-round knockouts to officially begin his UFC career. The muscular Gautier, who will take on Russian Andrey Pulyaev (10-3), has connected on 60% of his strikes through three fights and has many predicting he will enter the top 10 of the middleweight rankings before the new year is over. Gautier is also nearly a 10-to-1 betting favorite to defeat Pulyaev. Watch his rise closely. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA still does not have a CBA, but it does have a 2026 schedule. On Wednesday, the league announced the full schedule for its historic 30th season, which will run from May 8 through Sept. 24. The 2026 playoffs will begin on Sept. 27. There will be a two-week break in early September to accommodate the FIBA Women's World Cup. Once again, each team will play 44 games. Last season was the first time that teams played 44 games, which was an all-time high. Additionally, this season will feature the debut of two expansion franchises, the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, which will bring the league to 15 teams. Overall, there will be 330 total games, which will be a league record. A full broadcast and streaming schedule will be released at a later date. \"As we prepare to tip off the WNBA's historic 30th season, this schedule reflects both how far the league has come and the momentum that continues to drive us forward,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a press release. \"From welcoming two new organizations in Toronto and Portland, to honoring our history with marquee matchups that connect the league's first game to today's stars, the 2026 season will celebrate the WNBA's past, present, and future. With a record number of games, growing global reach, and unprecedented momentum, this milestone season will help define the next chapter of the WNBA.\"How does the schedule release affect CBA negotiations?The number of games in a season is collectively bargained, so it was a surprise to see the schedule released without a new CBA in place. However, the league had no intention of going beyond 44 games -- the number that was played last season -- in 2026 due to the FIBA Women's World Cup. \nIt's possible that the two sides could agree to play more games in future seasons, but with neither side looking for an increase this season, the league was able to put the 2026 schedule in place. Doing so as soon as possible was an important step to allow teams, players and broadcast partners to begin preparations for the summer, including securing arena dates, arranging travel and selling tickets. \"Releasing the 2026 schedule is a key step as we prepare for the WNBA's 30th season and allows teams, partners, broadcasters, and fans to begin the essential planning for the year ahead,\" a WNBA spokesperson told CBS Sports. It remains unclear when a new CBA will be in place, though the schedule release suggests that real progress is being made. \n\n        \n            \n                WNBA free agency: How are continued CBA negotiations affecting offseason schedule?\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere are the highlights from Wednesday's schedule release:Opening weekendOnce again, opening night is slated for a Friday, which will set up an action-packed opening weekend. All 15 teams will be in action over the three days, which will feature 11 games, including a Finals rematch between the Phoenix Mercury and Las Vegas Aces and the home openers for Toronto and Portland. Here is the full opening weekend schedule (All times ET):Friday, May 8Connecticut Sun at New York Liberty, 7:30 p.m. Washington Mystics at Toronto Tempo, 7:30 p.m. Golden State Vakyries at Seattle Storm, 7:30 p.m. Saturday, May 9Dallas Wings at Indiana Fever, 1 p.m. Phoenix Mercury at Las Vegas Aces, 3:30 p.m.Chicago Sky at Portland Fire, 9 p.m.Sunday, May 10Seattle Storm at Connecticut Sun, 1 p.m. New York Liberty at Washington Mystics, 3 p.m.Las Vegas Aces at Los Angeles Sparks, 6 p.m. Atlanta Dream at Minnesota Lynx, 7 p.m. Phoenix Mercury at Golden State Valkyries, 8:30 p.m.Commissioner's CupThe Commissioner's Cup is back for a sixth consecutive season. This year's competition will run from June 1-17, with the championship game scheduled for June 30. Each team will play every other team in its conference once during the group stage. The conferences are currently imbalanced, so Eastern Conference teams will play six games, while Western Conference teams will play seven games. The team from each conference with the best winning percentage in group stage games will qualify for the championship. The team with the best overall winning percentage will host the championship. \nAnniversary of first-ever gameThe New York Liberty and Los Angeles Sparks, two of the original six franchises, faced off in the league's first-ever game on June 21, 1997. In honor of the league's 30th anniversary, the Liberty and Sparks will meet again on the same day, June 21, in Los Angeles. All-Star GameAll-Star Weekend will return to Chicago this summer, with the Sky hosting for the second time in franchise history. All-Star Friday Night, featuring the Skills Challenge and 3-Point Contest is set for July 24 at Wintrust Arena (home of the Sky). The All-Star Game will follow on Saturday, July 25 at the United Center (home of the NBA's Chicago Bulls). \nWorld Cup breakThe 2026 FIBA Women's World Cup is set for Sept. 4-13 in Germany, so the WNBA will go on pause from Aug. 30 through Sept. 16 so that players can represent their countries. The regular season will resume on Sept. 17. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        If the Denver Broncos are going to play for a Super Bowl, it will be without quarterback Bo Nix, who recently underwent ankle surgery following his season-ending injury during the final moments of Denver's AFC divisional round win over the Buffalo Bills. As his team prepares for Sunday's AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots, Nix summed up his emotions in a lengthy Instagram post. Nix called the injury \"some of the most devastating football news\" he's ever received. And while he is struggling with the notion of not being on the field with his teammates, Nix is confident the Broncos are still capable of winning with backup Jarrett Stidham leading the offense. The last few days have been hard to put into words. What started as one of the most exciting games I've ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I've ever received. This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it. I can't express how much this team and organization mean to me and how much I believe in them. I couldn't be more proud of our guys. I couldn't be more confident in Jarrett. And I couldn't be more excited for what's next. Thank you all for the kind words, love and support over the last few days. Thankful for my trainers, Beau, Vince and Dr. Waldrop for taking great care of me. God never says oops, and he is always good. He has big plans for this team. We're not finished, as a matter of fact we're just getting started. We're just going to keep climbing higher. Go Broncos.Nix's injury halted what would have been an intriguing showdown between two of the league's rising young quarterbacks with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye on the other sideline. Members of the 2024 NFL Draft class, Maye and Nix have enjoyed fast starts to their careers. Nix helped the Broncos snap their 10-year drought without a playoff appearance as a rookie. This past Sunday, he led Denver to its first postseason victory since its win over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50. \nWhile his team didn't have much success in 2024, Maye did earn Pro Bowl honors after completing an impressive 66.6% of his passes. This year, he led the NFL with a 72% completion percentage while leading the Patriots to their first 14-win season since 2016.  \nWhile Nix and Maye won't get the chance to match wits on Sunday, there is another point of intrigue in Stidham trying to join the surprisingly long list of backup quarterbacks who have led their teams to the big game. That list includes Jeff Hostetler, the former New York Giants quarterback who helped Bill Parcells win his fourth Super Bowl with Big Blue. \nBroncos coach Sean Payton -- a Parcells disciple -- is hoping to emulate his former boss by becoming the latest coach to win it all with a backup quarterback.\n            ",

Patterson, 65, led the TCU program from 2000 to 2021 and most recently worked as a special assistant to Texas coach Steve Sarkisian in 2022 and a consultant at Baylor in 2024At USC, Patterson would replace D'Anton Lynn, who left Lincoln Riley's staff in December for the same position at his alma mater, Penn State. Patterson, known as a defensive guru, went 181-79 at TCU and is the winningest head coach in program history. The Horned Frogs went undefeated and won the Rose Bowl under Patterson in 2010 and just missed out on a College Football Playoff bid in 2014 -- the first year of the four-team era. Patterson guided TCU's transition from Conference USA to the Mountain West and into the Big 12, winning at least a share of the conference crown in each of those leagues. In all, he led the Horned Frogs to 17 bowl games, six top 10 finishes and 11 seasons with double-digit victories before the school relieved him of his duties in October 2021 amid a four-year stretch of uneven play. \nIn November 2023, Patterson said he had an itch to return to the sideline in the future.\"I still have a lot of ballgames left in me,\" Patterson said. \"If I ever get a to a place, everything in place you'd have a chance to play in the playoffs and win a national championship ... I've keep my eyes open. I took great notes when I was at Texas. With Sark being in the NFL and being with Coach (Nick) Saban, I went down there to learn. There were things I felt like that we did better at TCU than maybe they did there, but not that anything was bad. To Xs and Os, to recruiting, to NIL, portal, you name it. I'm rested. The key for me is to find the right place that would want Gary Patterson, but also to understand I'm looking for the right place, too.\"Patterson is set to join the USC program ahead of Riley's fifth season on the job. Riley was hired away from Oklahoma to push the Trojans back into the top tier of the sport. So far, he has under-delivered with a 35-18 record across his four seasons. The Trojans won 11 games in Riley's first season before dropping to 8-5 in 2023 and 7-6 in 2024, USC's first year as a member of the Big Ten. \nThe Trojans finished 9-4 in 2025, a season that ended with an Alamo Bowl loss to TCU. They were placed at No. 11 in CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello's way-too-early top 25 for the 2026 season. \n            \n    ",

Transversing two courses at PGA West and La Quinta Country Club, players will be forced to make birdies in bunches as a strong field embarks on this three-course rotation that will feature a cut at the 54-hole mark.Leading the way is the man who was forced to miss the festivities last season: world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. Named PGA Tour Player of the Year each of the last four seasons, Scheffler looks for more of the same as he gets his 2026 season underway. But how can a man who seems to do no wrong get even better?Scheffler looked at his 2025 season, which consisted of 20 top 25 finishes in as many starts plus six trophies and identified the start of his campaign as an area to improve. Not quite 100% by the time he returned from his hand injury, Scheffler has taken a conscious effort regarding his endurance and appears ripe for a fast start to the new year.If it starts in any way like his 2025 ended -- six victories in his last 12 PGA Tour starts -- the rest of the world will be up against a monster yet again. Scheffler headlines the action, which includes his good friend Sam Burns and fellow U.S. Ryder Cup team members Patrick Cantlay, Russell Henley and Ben Griffin.\nA large European contingent finds itself in the field as well with Ludvig Åberg, Matt Fitzpatrick, reigning champion Sepp Straka and Justin Rose all rearing to go. While all these players hope to mirror the success of last season, there are others like Rickie Fowler, Will Zalatoris and Max Homa who will attempt to put the past behind them and kick off their years in memorable fashions.2026 American Express scheduleDates: Jan. 22-25Location: Pete Dye Stadium Course — La Quinta, CaliforniaPar: 72 | Yardage: 7,210 | Architect: Pete DyePurse: $9,200,0002026 American Express field, oddsOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook\nScottie Scheffler (5/2): In five appearances, Scheffler has notched four top 25 finishes at the American Express. While some may be concerned that the low-scoring nature of the event breathes life into the rest of the field, let's not forget Scheffler boat raced the competition at the CJ Cyo Byron Nelson by reaching 31 under for the tournament. He's added some speed and remains the clear-cut best player in the world. The only question entering the year is whether he can putt as well as he did in 2025. If he does, he will continue to roll.Ben Griffin (20-1)Sam Burns (25-1): It has been more than three years since Burns has won a stroke-play event on the PGA Tour. Still ranked inside the top 25 of the Official World Golf Rankings, the free-wheeling right-hander starts his season at a comfortable spot as he has collected four top 20 finishes in six starts. Even for his high standards, Burns' putter was red hot throughout the 2025 season and hid a lot of deficiencies in his game.Ludvig Åberg (25-1): In the blink of an eye, we have arrived at Åberg's fourth season on the PGA Tour -- albeit his third in a full-time capacity. The 26-year-old has taken steps every season from playing himself onto Ryder Cup teams, winning on the PGA Tour, contending in major championships and winning a signature event last season. He hit a lull in the middle of the year as his course management was questionable at times, but he found his stride late and looked a lot like the robot we have all grown accustomed to seeing.Russell Henley (28-1)Robert MacIntyre (28-1): MacIntyre is the sixth-ranked player in the world at the moment, and not a lot of people are keen on it. The Scotsman started his year in beautiful fashion thanks to a top-five finish at the Sony Open that included a closing 63. He mentioned his attitude was not up to par throughout the tournament and revealed that he even snapped his putter late in the second round due to frustrations on the greens. In his five worldwide starts since October, the left-hander has a win and three other top-10 results.Patrick Cantlay (30-1)Si Woo Kim (35-1)Matt Fitzpatrick (40-1): A winner at the DP World Tour Championship to cap off his 2025, Fitzpatrick found the culmination of all his hard work come to fruition in the Middle East. In what looked like a lost campaign early in the year, the former U.S. Open champion flipped a switch at the PGA Championship in May and never looked back. Fitzpatrick's iron play really found a groove during this portion of the schedule and was key to sparking this surge.Taylor Pendrith (40-1)2026 American Express picks\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Patrick Cantlay\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nWinner (30-1): The last time Cantlay entered the winner's circle, the biggest members of the PGA Tour were gathering in Delaware to figure out the future of the league. That feels like ages ago, if not longer. The former FedEx Cup champion called upon Phil Kenyon to help with his putting late in 2025, leading to some success, including a runner-up at the Tour Championship. He has been known to take it deep and has four top-10 finishes in his last six appearances at this tournament.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Nick Taylor\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nContender (90-1): A first-round leader in his title defense at the Sony Open, Taylor ultimately fell off the pace and settled for a T13 finish. Still, the Canadian showed plenty of positive signs as he ranked second in greens in regulation and rolled the rock with some consistency. Taylor finally figured out this rotation last year with a T12 finish (the best of his American Express career) and has shown an affinity for golf in the desert.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Matt McCarty\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nSleeper (110-1): He is a player I like to take a step in the right direction in 2026, and he looked close last week in Honolulu. Upended by his short game and some uncharacteristic misses on the greens, McCarty will find the flat stick at a tournament that was once labeled a putting contest. Stretching back to the FedEx Cup Fall, the left-hander has been finding the center of the club face with much more consistency.Who will win The American Express 2026, and which longshots will stun the golfing world? Visit SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 16 golf majors heading into the weekend, and find out. \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

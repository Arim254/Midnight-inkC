    "body": "<div>\n<p>The 2025-26 NBA season tips off later this month, meaning 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts are already on the clock. While everyone wants to find those undervalued Fantasy basketball sleepers or breakouts, just as much part of nailing your drafts is by avoiding selecting a 2025 Fantasy basketball bust. How will the likes of Kevin Durant, Kristaps Porzingis, Myles Turner and Michael Porter Jr. produce with their new squads? Then there's the likes of Jaylen Brown, Pascal Siakam and Shaedon Sharpe, who will have bigger roles due to injured teammates and could make for great Fantasy basketball 2025 picks.</p><p>Speaking of potential 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts, Cooper Flagg will be top of mind for many when they go on the clock after the No.1 overall pick averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.4 blocks at Duke. But given the star power already on Dallas, there could be other rookies in more advantageous positions to produce. What do the latest 2025 Fantasy basketball projections forecast for this year's rookie class? Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine</a>.</p><p>SportsLine's proven model simulates each season 10,0000 times. This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Any time an injury occurs or there's a change on a roster, the team at SportsLine updates its cheat sheets. </p><p>Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game on CBS despite being the 87th guard off the board on average.</p><p>The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well. Anyone who followed the model's Fantasy basketball advice on them could have been well on their way to making a deep postseason run.</p><p>Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings</a>.  </p><h2> Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers  </h2><p>One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr. After spending the 2023-24 season out of the league, Porter joined the Clippers last season before being acquired by Milwaukee at the trade deadline. He proceeded to become one of the Bucks most consistent players, averaging 11.7 points and 3.7 assists in just 19.9 minutes, and over his last five games of the season, Porter put up 20.2 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 2.8 steals. Porter should see a huge jump in playing time this year with the injury and subsequent trade of Damian Lillard.</p><p>Porter is penciled in to be Milwaukee's starting point guard, and outside of Giannis Antetokounmpo, no other player on the Bucks' 2025-26 roster averaged more than 2.9 assists last year. Thus, the team will need both his ball-handling and playmaking skills, and Porter has already shown he can produce when given ample minutes. In the 2022-23 season with Houston, he was one of just five NBA players to average at least 19 points, five rebounds, five assists and 1.4 steals per game. He is someone whose production should far exceed his 2025 Fantasy basketball ADP of 72. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here</a>.</p><h2> Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts  </h2><p>One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier. The No. 1 ranked prospect in the Class of 2023, Collier starred at USC for one season before being the 29th overall pick by Utah in 2024. He began as a backup but then wrestled the starting job away from Keyonte George, who was an All-Rookie selection the year prior. Collier really hit his stride towards the end of the season and averaged 15.9 points and 7.1 assists over his final seven games of his rookie year.</p><p>Already one of the league's youngest teams, Utah then jettisoned vets Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and John Collins in the offseason as it has fully embraced a youth movement. Thus, the 21-year-old Collier should have no shortage of opportunities, and he plays in an offense conducive for lots of stats. The Jazz ranked fifth in pace last season as they want to utilize those young legs to their advantage. The model slots Collier ahead of Norman Powell and Bennedict Mathurin in its 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings, despite Collier being drafted multiple rounds later on average. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here</a>.</p><h2> Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts </h2><p>As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole spent last season as the No. 1 option on the Wizards but will have much more competition for shots in New Orleans. Zion Williamson and Trey Murphy III were both 20-point scorers a year ago, while New Orleans returns three additional players who put up double-figures. Plus, the team used the No. 7 overall pick on Jeremiah Fears, who plays the same position as Poole, so Fears could cut into Poole's opportunities.</p><p>Poole is also a bit of a one-trick pony as while he put up over 20 points a game a year ago, he had middling stats elsewhere with 4.5 assists, 3.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals. That one trick will be diminished with other mouths to feed in New Orleans, plus a potential midseason return from Dejounte Murray (Achilles) could further reduce Poole's role. The model ranks Poole outside the top 20 Fantasy point guards and not worthy of his current Fantasy basketball 2025 ADP of being a seventh-round pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well</a>.</p><h2> How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings </h2><p>SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts. This player is a top-3 Fantasy option at his position and is ranked ahead of stars like Kevin Durant and Paolo Banchero. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings for every player, at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So which 2025-26 Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which forward shocks the NBA as a top-3 player in positional rankings? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nba/cheat-sheets-and-rankings/?ttag=09242025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_basketball_nba_model_cheatsheetscombined\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get 2025-26 Fantasy basketball cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that's nailed its Fantasy basketball picks</a>, and find out.</strong></p>\n            </div>",

Fantasy hockey managers are familiar with McDavid's prowess on the ice, and the three-time Hart Trophy winner is expected to go off the board early in 2025 Fantasy hockey drafts. The same can be said about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/TB/tampa-bay-lightning/\">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2094594/nikita-kucherov/fantasy/\">Nikita Kucherov</a>, who has increased Fantasy hockey value after he led the NHL with 121 points (37 goals, 84 assists) in 78 regular-season games last season.</p><p>You can't talk about Fantasy hockey without talking about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2076027/nathan-mackinnon/fantasy/\">Nathan MacKinnon</a>, who is one of several <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/COL/colorado-avalanche/\">Colorado Avalanche</a> players expected to be drafted early in Fantasy hockey pools. Should you select MacKinnon or one of his teammates early in your Fantasy hockey draft? Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy hockey picks, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-hockey-rankings-2025-26-projections-from-proven-computer-model/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_hockey_nhl_model_FantasyHockeyRanking2025\" target=\"_blank\">check out the Fantasy hockey rankings 2025-26 from the proven computer model at SportsLine.</a></p><p>The model was created by Mike McClure, a predictive data engineer and professional daily Fantasy player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He's used his prediction model to simulate the entire 2025-26 NHL schedule 10,000 times and identify the top Fantasy hockey sleepers, breakouts and busts. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-hockey-rankings-2025-26-projections-from-proven-computer-model/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_hockey_nhl_model_FantasyHockeyRanking2025\" target=\"_blank\">Head to SportsLine now to see them</a>.</p><h3>Top 2025-26 Fantasy hockey picks</h3><p>One of the 2025-26 Fantasy hockey sleepers SportsLine has identified: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/NSH/nashville-predators/\">Predators</a> forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/1628816/steven-stamkos/fantasy/\">Steven Stamkos</a>. The 35-year-old got off to a slow start in his first campaign with Nashville and only scored 53 points (27 goals, 26 assists) in 82 games, his lowest numbers since his rookie season. However, the model was encouraged by Stamkos' late-season push and thinks he has more Fantasy hockey value than his ADP suggests.</p><p>The two-time Stanley Cup winner scored 20 points (10 goals, 10 assists) in his last 24 games of the 2024-25 season, which included five power-play goals and one game-winning marker. Teaming up alongside youngster <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/26802557/fedor-svechkov/fantasy/\">Fedor Svechkov</a>, he can help the second-year centerman take on a larger role and get the Predators more offensive zone time. McClure's model values Stamkos at No. 24, which greatly exceeds his ADP of 105.</p><p>Another surprise: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/DET/detroit-red-wings/\">Red Wings</a> defenseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/3130090/moritzandnbspseider/fantasy/\">Moritz Seider</a> is one of the top Fantasy hockey breakouts this season. The German blueliner, 24, has flown under the radar in his first few years in the NHL given Detroit has spent the last decade-plus in a rebuild. His improved play last season encourages the model that he will have a big 2025-26 campaign.</p><p>Seider was forced to take on a bigger role last season when the Red Wings traded fellow defenseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2879989/jake-walman/fantasy/\">Jake Walman</a>. Even with more responsibilities, Seider improved on defense -- a career-low minus-5 -- as well as on special teams -- a career-high 24 power-play points -- while averaging a career-high 25:04 minutes per game. His ADP is over 110 but the SportsLine model values him at No. 46, making him an intriguing player to consider for Fantasy hockey managers. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-hockey-rankings-2025-26-projections-from-proven-computer-model/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_hockey_nhl_model_FantasyHockeyRanking2025\" target=\"_blank\">See the full rankings right here</a>.</p><h3>How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy hockey rankings</h3><p>The model has also made a surprising call on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/NYR/new-york-rangers/\">Rangers</a> goalie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/2831871/igor-shesterkin/fantasy/\">Igor Shesterkin</a>, who faced a league-leading 1,751 shots against last season. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-hockey-rankings-2025-26-projections-from-proven-computer-model/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_hockey_nhl_model_FantasyHockeyRanking2025\" target=\"_blank\">You can only see the latest Fantasy hockey rankings 2025-26 here</a>.</p><p><strong>So what's the exact value of every NHL player in the 2025-26 Fantasy hockey rankings? <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-hockey-rankings-2025-26-projections-from-proven-computer-model/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_fantasy_hockey_nhl_model_FantasyHockeyRanking2025\" target=\"_blank\">Visit SportsLine now to get Fantasy hockey rankings, all from a DFS pro who has won more than $2 million in his career and has simulated the entire NHL season 10,000 times</a>, and find out.</strong> </p>\n            </div>",

In that contest, Mahomes became the fastest player to reach 250 career touchdown passes (116 games), and a good chunk of those have come on Monday nights. He owns a 27:8 TD:INT on Monday Night Football and has torched the Jaguars to historic proportions.

Under first-year defensive coordinator, Anthony Campanile, Jacksonville has the No. 4 run defense, the No. 5 scoring defense and ranks sixth in redzone defense.</p><p>On offense, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> has been sacked just three times, which is the fewest of any qualified quarterback. The former No. 1 overall pick has also risen to the challenge of being an underdog as he is 5-2-1 against the spread as an underdog over the last two seasons. He's complemented in the backfield by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809206/travis-etienne/\">Travis Etienne</a>, whose 6.1 yards per carry lead the NFL as the Jags have the No. 4 rushing offense. Their commitment to the run and the ability to produce on the ground game could eat up the clock and keep Mahomes and company off the field. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/chiefs-vs-jaguars-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-5-monday-night-football/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_ChiefsJaguarsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>. </p><p><em>Check out the latest </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/betmgm-promo-code/\"><em>BetMGM promo code</em></a><em> CBSSPORTS, where new users can </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=betmgm&c=sport\"><em>get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>How to make Chiefs vs. Jaguars picks</h2><p>For Jaguars vs. Chiefs on Monday Night Football, the model is leaning Under the total, projecting 45 combined points.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>With a pair of Game 2's in the National League Divisional Series and the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Jacksonville Jaguars on Monday Night Football, there are plenty options for <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/\" target=\"_blank\">online sports betting</a> today. No one will debate the more popular team nationally between the Chiefs and Jaguars, and you would have been hard-pressed to find any NFL fan projecting the Jaguars to have a better defense heading into this matchup. The Jaguars entered the week with a top-five defense, allowing 18 points per game this season, and due to that upper-tier defense, the SportsLine model projects the Jaguars to cover as 3.5-point underdogs against Kansas City in one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.</p><p>With the latest <strong>DraftKings promo code</strong>, new users can get <strong>$200 in bonus bets </strong>if your first $5 bet wins. The model recommends playing the Jaguars against the spread on Monday Night Football to potentially secure the bonus. The model also has a pair of MLB best bets, backing the Phillies to defeat the Dodgers to even the series at 1-1, while projecting the Brewers to take a 2-0 lead over the Cubs in the NLDS as part of its Monday best bets at DraftKings.

The model is on a sizzling 39-20 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. It also enters the 2025 MLB playoffs a profitable 34-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season. Anybody following its <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/nfl/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL betting</a> picks and <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/mlb/\" target=\"_blank\">MLB betting</a> picks at <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">sportsbooks</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/best-betting-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">betting sites</a> could have seen strong returns.</p><h2>Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook</h2><ul><li>Jaguars (+3.5) vs. Chiefs (-110)</li><li>Phillies (-102) to defeat the Dodgers</li><li>Brewers (-137) to defeat the Cubs</li></ul><p>Combining the model's three picks into a Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +620 (risk $100 to win $620). <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=draftkings&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet it at DraftKings here</a>:</p><h2>Jaguars (+3.5) vs. Chiefs (-110)</h2><p>This year's version of the Kansas City Chiefs have only resembled last year's AFC Champions once through four weeks, and after two games, they have as many losses as they had all of last season. Patrick Mahomes is averaging a career-low 234.8 passing yards per game, as he's limited in pass-catching options with Rashee Rice (suspension) out and Xavier Worthy, who has only played 46 snaps, downgraded to questionable on Sunday with a shoulder injury he suffered on the third play of the season. Future Hall of Fame tight end Travis Kelce, who turned 36 on Sunday, has seemed to slow down as well. The Jaguars have the No. 5 scoring defense in the league, and the model doesn't expect Kansas City to have an elite offensive performance against Jacksonville, projecting the Jaguars to cover the spread in 54% of simulations.</p><h2>Phillies (-102) to defeat the Dodgers</h2><p>The Phillies had the best home record in baseball this season, going 55-26 (.679) in Philadelphia, and after dropping Game 1 to the Dodgers in Philadelphia, the model doesn't expect that to occur in consecutive contests. The Phillies only lost consecutive games to the same team at home once all season, which occurred late May into June, as a dominant team in front of their home fans. Phillies starter Jesus Luzardo went 8-2 with a 1.12 WHIP in Philadelphia this season. Dodgers starter Blake Snell has pitched well since his return from a shoulder injury, but the 32-year-old only made 11 starts this season. At -102 odds, the model sees value in backing the Phillies to even the series, projecting Philadelphia to win at home in 55% of simulations.</p><h2>Brewers (-137) to defeat the Cubs</h2><p>The Brewers are keeping their pitching plans tight-lipped, although reliever Aaron Ashby will start but likely won't pitch deep into the game. Regardless of how long he pitches and who comes next, the model has faith in the Brewers, who led baseball with 97 wins behind the second-best ERA (3.58) in the sport. The Brewers had the No. 6 bullpen ERA, and the best of any team left in the postseason, at 3.63 this season. Meanwhile, the Cubs are starting Shota Imanaga, who had a 6.51 ERA in five September starts before allowing two runs in four innings against the Padres in the Wild Card round. The model projects the Brewers to win in 54% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more NFL picks and MLB picks for Monday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Monday best bets. Now, <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/picks/\" target=\"_blank\">get against the spread, total and money-line picks for Monday Night Football, along with the 2025 MLB playoffs and every Week 6 NFL game</a>, all from the model that's simulated every game 10,000 times. </strong></p>\n            </div>",

Kickoff from EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville is at 8:15 p.m. ET. The game features a loaded NFL DFS player pool, with some of the biggest names in the sport like Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Xavier Worthy, Trevor Lawrence, Travis Etienne and Brian Thomas Jr. leading the way. Rashee Rice (suspension) remains sidelined for Kansas City. </p><p>Finding undervalued players at a cheap price is still the key to building a winning NFL DFS strategy in Showdown contests -- especially with this matchup featuring so many big-name players.

The former Texas Tech standout remains an elite fantasy asset with one of the highest scoring floors among all NFL quarterbacks. In 2024, he threw for 3,928 yards with 26 touchdowns. </p>\n<p>In 2025, he's off to a strong start with 939 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and just one interception through the early portion of the season, ranking among the most efficient quarterbacks in fantasy scoring. Over his career, Mahomes has earned three Super Bowl titles, three Super Bowl MVPs, two league MVP awards, and multiple First-Team All-Pro and Pro Bowl selections. If he maintains his current efficiency and red-zone production, Mahomes should remain a top-tier QB1 across all fantasy formats. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-chiefs-vs-jaguars-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=10052025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_ChiefsJaguarsDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Jaguars running back Travis Etienne. The former first-round pick out of Clemson is one of the premier all-purpose backs in the NFL. In 2024, he recorded 150 carries for 558 rushing yards and two touchdowns while adding 39 receptions for 254 receiving yards, which was a noticeable dip from his early career production. </p><p>In 2025, he's bounced back with 65 rushing attempts for 394 yards and two touchdowns through the early stretch, averaging over six yards per carry and remaining active in the passing game. Over his career, Etienne has surpassed 1,000 rushing yards in multiple seasons and established himself as one of the NFL's most explosive dual-threat backs. He's also gained at least 73 scrimmage yards in his last two games versus Kansas City, scoring a touchdown in a playoff contest versus the Chiefs. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-chiefs-vs-jaguars-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=10052025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_ChiefsJaguarsDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><h2>How to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Chiefs vs. Jaguars</h2><p>Kaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Monday Night Football.

If you come into our city and commit violence, we'll use all the tools at our disposal to hold you accountable,\" Indianapolis police chief Chris Bailey said. \"As we move forward, [our] PD will continue to maintain our strong, visible presence in downtown on those high-visibility, high-traffic weekends at major events to make sure our community is safe. I continue to urge our community to respect one another. As the prosecutor said, this did not need to happen; it did not.\"</p><p>Sanchez told the detective, Christopher Edwards, that he did not remember anything involving the incident while hospitalized.</p>\n<p>Mears touched on the state's self defense laws and said those factors will be addressed at trial.</p><p>\"Well, certainly, Indiana has some of the robust self-defense laws in the nation, and that's always going to be part of the equation when you evaluate cases like this and try to determine exactly what took place,\" Mears said. \"It will certainly be at the center of this particular trial as well when we have conversations about were people acting reasonably or not. Those are all things you need to consider in terms of when you make that initial charging decision and those facts have been evaluated. Self-defesne laws will be raised at trial.\"</p><p>Sanchez allegedly advanced toward the man, who claims he thought, \"This guy is trying to kill me.\" That's when the man pulled his knife and stabbed Sanchez \"two or three times\" as Sanchez was still coming towards him. </p>\n<p>The driver then alleged that he was thrown against a dumpster and believed he was in a life-or-death situation. An eye witness told police that they saw two men using cellphones to record each other before an altercation ensued, according to court records.</p><p>Sanchez was in Indianapolis to call Sunday's game between the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Las Vegas Raiders</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a> at Lucas Oil Stadium. </p>\n            </div>",

Chourio had to leave Game 1 Saturday due to a right hamstring injury, suffered in the second inning when Chourio legged out an infield hit, his third of the contest.</p><p>\"If he gets in a situation where he feels it, we're going to take him out,\" Murphy said before the game Monday. \"If he gets in a situation where he doesn't feel like he can do the job, we're going to take him out.\"</p><p>On Sunday, Murphy said preliminary testing on the hamstring was inconclusive and the team would further evaluate the situation before determining if Chourio could play in Game 2. Clearly they liked what they found.</p><p>\"I can't give you a definitive, but I know that we're going to test some things today. He's going to be out there today,\" Murphy said Sunday. \"I don't know that he'll do much, but the MRI came back and it's inconclusive and it's not a serious hamstring strain, but it's not necessarily something that won't limit him.</p>\n<p>\"We're going to kind of see how he feels. He's going to go through some testing, and if he feels anything, we're going to shut it down.\"</p><p>The concern had been a re-aggravation of an injury from the recent past. Chourio missed nearly all of August with a strained right hamstring, going on the IL Aug. 1 and coming off it on Aug. 30. </p><p>In the regular season, Chourio hit .270/.308/.463 (112 OPS+) with 35 doubles, four triples, 21 home runs, 78 RBI, 88 runs and 21 steals in the regular season.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3158249/isaac-collins/\">Isaac Collins</a> replaced Chourio in left field on Saturday and he's plenty capable if the need arises. He had a 118 OPS+ and 2.1 WAR in the regular season. Having a player like Collins available to replace an injured Chourio is a testament to the Brewers' depth. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

With the victory, the Dodgers gained a 2-0 advantage in the best-of-five series, putting them one away from advancing to their fourth NL Championship Series in the past six years. </p><p>The Dodgers can credit Game 2's outcome to a variety of factors -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2006996/blake-snells/\">Blake Snell's</a> outstanding start; some timely hitting; and the continued struggles of the top of the Phillies lineup -- but one aspect became the talk of postgame media availability: the successful wheel play Los Angeles ran in the top of the ninth to record the first out of the inning.</p><p>Or, as manager Dave Roberts said after the game: \"[For] me, that was our only chance, really, to win that game in that moment.\"</p><p>For those who didn't see, the Dodgers entered the ninth inning leading by a 4-1 margin. The Phillies quickly cut into that lead thanks to three consecutive hits by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942960/alec-bohm/\">Alec Bohm</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1947839/j-t-realmuto/\">J.T. Realmuto</a>, and Nick Castellanos. Just like that, the Phillies had the tying run on second base with none out. With lefty-swinging infielder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117910/bryson-stott/\">Bryson Stott</a> due up, the Dodgers went to their bullpen, replacing right-hander <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1953420/blake-treinen/\">Blake Treinen</a> with lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2933171/alex-vesia/\">Alex Vesia</a>.</p>\n<p>That's when the Dodgers infield, and shortstop <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2106654/mookie-betts/\">Mookie Betts</a> in particular, suggested to Roberts that they run the wheel play -- that is, a defensive alignment where the third baseman will charge the ball, the shortstop will cover third, with the first baseman trucking it to second and the second baseman taking over at first base -- in the event that Stott lay down a bunt toward third.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, the Phillies had Stott push a bunt with a 1-0 count toward third base, as a means of advancing Castellanos to third base and setting up a potential sac fly situation. That's not how things played out, however. Instead, third baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2106304/max-muncy/\">Max Muncy</a> and Betts combined to nail the lead runner, changing the entire dynamic of the inning.</p><p>\"There's things you do in Spring Training that never come throughout the regular season,\" first baseman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1630079/freddie-freeman/\">Freddie Freeman</a> said. \"And the wheel play that we pulled off on that bunt, that was picture perfect by Max and Mookie. I want to throw that out there. I know we might overlook that. But that was huge getting that guy out.\"</p>\n<p>The Phillies' win expectancy was halved on that play: dropping from 45.1% to 21.5%, according to FanGraphs. That effect was felt by the players, even if they may have been unaware of the exact probabilities. </p><p>\"That changes everything that inning,\" Muncy told reporters.</p><p>Thomson, for his part, said that he decided to have Stott bunt because of the left-on-left matchup, among other factors. </p><p>\"I liked where our bullpen was at based on, as compared to theirs,\" he explained. \"We play for the tie at home.\"</p>\n<p>The Phillies would see the batter after Stott, pinch-hitter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211761/harrison-bader/\">Harrison Bader</a>, deliver a single in an attempt to rekindle the rally. A fielder's choice put runners at the corners with two down for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2135249/trea-turner/\">Trea Turner</a>. Alas, Turner grounded out to end the game, closing out a Dodgers win and preserving a spot in the highlight reel for their well-executed wheel play.</p>\n            </div>",

Both the Dodgers and Brewers took commanding 2-0 series leads on Monday night. L.A. won its second game in a row in Philly, holding off the Phillies despite a ninth-inning rally. The Brewers, meanwhile, slugged a pair of three-run home runs to push the Cubs to the brink of elimination.</p><p>In the American League, the Blue Jays have the Yankees on the ropes after two big wins in Toronto. Meanwhile, the Mariners and Tigers are knotted, 1-1, as the series moves to Detroit. ALDS Game 3s are on Tuesday night.</p><p>The Brewers, Blue Jays, Phillies and Mariners all earned first-round byes this season, but the Cubs, Yankees, Dodgers and Tigers all needed to win Wild Card Series to get here. The Dodgers completed a two-game sweep of the Reds, while the Cubs, Yankees and Tigers all needed three games to advance and knock out the Padres, Red Sox and Guardians, respectively.</p><p>The best-of-five League Division Series could run through Oct. 11 and the 2025 World Series begins on Oct. 24.

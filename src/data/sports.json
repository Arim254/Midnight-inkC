    "body": "\n        With six Super Bowl wins, the Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the most successful franchises in NFL history. But despite all their success, there is one thing they've never been able to pull off, which they'll have a chance to do in Week 7: Win a Thursday night road game against a divisional opponent.  The Steelers have played a total of eight divisional Thursday games on the road in franchise history, and they've gone 0-8 in those games, which includes going 0-6 under Mike Tomlin. The Steelers had a chance to end the streak last year but ended up losing a 24-19 shocker to the Cleveland Browns in a game where Pittsburgh was favored by 3.5 points.  The Steelers will have a chance to end their inexplicable losing streak when they travel to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals in a Thursday game where Pittsburgh is favored by 5.5 points, per Caesars Sportsbook.\nThe streak started in 1980 with a loss to the Houston Oilers, and it's now been going on for 45 years.Opponent \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tScore \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tDate \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOilers (AFC Central) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOilers 6-0Dec. 4, 1980 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tJaguars (AFC Central) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tJaguars 20-6Dec. 2, 1999 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns 13-Dec. 10, 2009 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRavens (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRavens 22-20Nov. 28, 2013 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRavens (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRavens 26-6Sept. 11, 2014 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns 21-7Nov. 14, 2019 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns 29-17Sept. 22, 2022 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns 24-19Nov. 21, 2024 \t\t\t\tThat's 0-8 straight up and 1-7 against the spread. This streak has been going on for so long that the Steelers have played two divisional games against opponents who aren't even in their division anymore (Jaguars and Oilers/Titans). It's not just divisional games, though, Thursday nights have generally been a nightmare for the Steelers. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, the Steelers are 3-15 in Thursday road games, which is the worst winning percentage of any NFL team in that span. Here's a look at the three teams that have been the worst in Thursday road games since 1970 (via CBS Sports Research): 1. Steelers: 3-15 (.167)2. Browns: 2-8 (.200)3. Jets: 3-11 (.214)The fact that the Browns and Jets are on that list isn't a surprise to anyone, but seeing the Steelers lumped in there is definitely shocking. Overall, the Steelers are 12-18 on Thursdays in franchise history. If you look at just the games played since Tomlin was hired, the numbers don't get any better. The Steelers coach is 2-9 on the road in Thursday games, including 0-6 against divisional opponents. Since the start of the 2019 season, the Steelers are 1-5 on Thursday night. \nIf anyone can help the Steelers snap this streak, it's Aaron Rodgers. The four-time NFL MVP has won 11 Thursday night games in his career, which is the second-most in league history. (He has a Thursday record of 11-5.) The only QB with more Thursday wins is Tom Brady, and Rodgers could tie him with a win over the Bengals. It's almost fitting that Rodgers could tie Brady because he'll be tying another Brady mark as soon as he takes the field in Cincinnati. The matchup between Rodgers and Joe Flacco will mark just the second pairing ever of two quarterbacks over the age of 40. The only other time it happened came in 2020 when Brady and Drew Brees played each other three times while playing for the Buccaneers and Saints. Brady also has the most wins of any QB ever against the Steelers with 12, which is worth noting because Flacco is right behind him. If the Bengals pull the upset, not only will Pittsburgh's nightmare losing streak continue, but Flacco will tie Brady for the most wins ever over the Steelers. \n            ",

The firing of James Franklin could provide a psychological boost to a PSU squad that's been in a malaise for the last few weeks, while QB Drew Allar's season-ending injury should put more of Penn State's offensive focus on its run game. That's not a bad thing to lean on with a pair of future NFL running backs in Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton. Iowa just allowed a season-high in rushing yards, and the Hawkeyes' offensive struggles are well documented as they haven't had a touchdown pass in three straight games. SportsLine's model has Penn State outgaining the Hawkeyes on Saturday and covering well over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Missouri (-1.5, 43.5) covers against Auburn in over 70% of simulations Saturday at 7:45 p.m. ET. Mizzou suffered its first loss on Saturday, falling to Alabama, but the Tigers still covered and are 4-2 ATS this season. The Tigers of Auburn have covered just once over their last five games and have winless versus the spread at home (0-3). Missouri has incredible balance, with QB Beau Pribula leading the SEC in completion rate, while RB Ahmad Hardy tops the conference in rushing yards and touchdowns. Meanwhile, Auburn ranks 92nd in FBS in scoring as both its two lowest point totals and yardage totals have come in the last two games. With that Mizzou is projected to win outright by more than a touchdown, and the Over hits nearly 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 8The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 8, and it's calling for multiple upsets, including a double-digit underdog outright winning. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which double-digit underdog wins straight up?

    "body": "\n        Dwyane Wade is one of the best basketball players of the last 25 years. In fact, he ranked 11th in our CBS Sports' top 25 players of the 21st century. He's a three-time champion, 13-time All-Star first-ballot Hall of Famer and a member of the NBA's 75th anniversary team. And that's just a small snapshot of his accolades. He's six years removed from throwing on his iconic No. 3 jersey and has since started a career as a basketball analyst, both in the podcast space and on television.As he prepares for his new gig as a member of NBA on Amazon Prime's broadcast crew, Wade shared when he knew it was time to retire.\"Once I knew that I didn't have that special quality anymore, that I lost all my powers and I became a regular basketball player, the game was not as fun as it used to be,\" Wade told GQ.Wade spent 14 years of his 16-year career operating at peak levels. Even at 35-years old, he was still averaging 18.3 points a game, something only seven other players have accomplished since 2000. But those last two seasons saw a downturn in production from one of the league's most efficient scorers when he was in his prime.\n        \n            \n                The Conversation: Can the Heat reinvent themselves again after the Jimmy Butler era?\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's a situation most professional athletes go through when they're reaching their twilight years. Perhaps the only two people it hasn't impacted are LeBron James and Tom Brady, two titans who have defied father time. Brady played until he was 45 and won a Super Bowl at 43. James is about to turn 41 in December and is still operating at All-NBA levels. While James is set to miss his first season opener in his record-breaking 23rd season due to sciatica, there still isn't a more feared image for opponents than James driving full speed into the lane with the objective of finishing at the rim when healthy.\nWade was once that way, too. He wasn't quite the physical specimen James is, but his quickness and athleticism made him one of the most difficult players to guard.\"When you had the career I had, you don't envy someone else's journey,\" Wade said. \"I got everything out of the game of basketball that I possibly wanted.\"Wade wasn't just one of the best players in the league, he was one of the most popular, too. His talent transcended the Miami Heat fanbase, so it wasn't uncommon to see No. 3 Wade jerseys overflowing at away arenas whenever he and the Heat came to town. Fans chanting his name -- or booing him -- is a feeling that can't be replicated outside of the NBA, and while he likely doesn't miss back-to-back games, or the grind of an 82-game regular season, there is one thing the Hall of Famer misses.\n\"What I do miss is being better than people,\" Wade said. \"I miss being good at something, really good at it.\"\n            ",

It ranks 27th in passing defense, so Joe Flacco, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins will also be popular with NFL player props and Thursday Night Football betting.Rodgers has an NFL prop bar of 219.5 passing yards, after he threw for 235 yards in Week 6 and hit the Over. However, he went under this NFL prop total in three straight games prior to Sunday, and with Cincy possessing the No. 28 run defense, Pittsburgh may lean more on the ground game. With the same prop odds of -112 for the Over and Under, this may be one TNF prop to simply avoid altogether.

The Steelers have always struggled to contain Chase, who has at least 81 receiving yards in four straight versus Pittsburgh. He's averaged 98 receiving yards over this stretch, and many of those defenses were much better than this year's unit in Pittsburgh. The Steelers are giving up 178.8 receiving yards to opposing wideouts, which is the third-most in the NFL.Chase is also coming off 94-plus receiving yards in each of the last two weeks, and he showed great rapport with Flacco on Sunday, posting a stat line of 10-94-1. It's also important to note that Thursday's game will take place in Cincinnati, where Chase has gone over his receiving yardage prop in each of his last five home games, which includes a Week 13 contest versus the Steelers last season. The AI model projects Chase to have 93.7 receiving yards, giving this NFL prop bet a 4.5-star rating. See more NFL props here.New users can also target the FanDuel promo code, which offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins:How to make NFL player prop bets for Bengals vs. SteelersIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has 13 additional NFL props that are rated four stars or better.

    "body": "\n        In every college basketball season since 2012, at least one team that began the season ranked in the AP Top 25 has failed to reach the NCAA Tournament. In the past three years alone, there were 13 teams ranked in the preseason that didn't reach March Madness.It's basically a guarantee that at least one team we are lauding in October will be flopping by February. Over the past 13 years (excluding the COVID-impacted 2019-20 season) an average of four teams ranked in the preseason poll fell short of the Big Dance. Last season, there were three culprits (No. 17 Indiana, No. 20 Cincinnati and No. 25 Rutgers). Arguably the most famous recent example is from the 2022-23 season, which is when North Carolina became the first-ever preseason No. 1 team to fail to reach the NCAA Tournament. Those Tar Heels serve as the ultimate case study in how, just because a team looks good on paper, it doesn't mean they'll be good in reality.\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Each AP Top 25 team's strengths, weaknesses and depth chart entering 2025-26\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGiven recent history, it's safe to assume there will be at least a couple of teams ranked in this year's preseason poll that fall short of expectations. For this edition of the Dribble Handoff, our writers are picking the ranked teams they believe could miss the NCAA Tournament.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    No. 23 CreightonI'll stay true to the Top 25 And 1 and start this list with Creighton, which is the only team in the Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll that isn't in my rankings. Does that mean I'm actually predicting the Bluejays to miss the 2026 NCAA Tournament? No. It just means that, by definition, according to my rankings, they are the team most likely to miss the field after losing the top three scorers from last season's team -- among them Ryan Kalkbrenner, an All-American who was a four-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year.Simply put, collectively, the players who exited Creighton's program seem to be better, at least on paper, than the ones who just enrolled at the Omaha-based school earlier this offseason. That's usually not good. And, don't forget, last season's theoretical better roster still only received a No. 9 seed in the 2025 NCAA Tournament before finishing 35th at KenPom.com. If you're curious, the Bluejays are now sitting at 41st in KenPom's preseason rankings, making them the lowest rated team in that computer that voters placed in the preseason AP poll. -- Gary Parrish\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    No. 24 WisconsinWell, I suppose I have to tip my hand just a smidge here. My thinking is similar to GP's. Every year, I research and compile a ranking of the top 101 teams heading into the season. My rankings are finished but that piece won't publish until next week. That in mind, I'll reveal that the AP Top 25 team that I have ranked lowest is in fact Wisconsin. So logic would dictate I need to pick Bucky as my whiff candidate here (and yet, though this will obviously prove to be incorrect, I actually think every preseason Top 25 team is going to make the 2026 NCAA Tournament). \nMy Wisconsin thinking goes: John Tonje (who was an All-American, remember!), Max Klesmit and Steven Crowl will not be replaced in the aggregate. UW went 27-10 and got a  No. 3 seed. Badgers fans should expect a step back for sure, but with a mix-matched group of transfers coming in to support John Blackwell, I wouldn't be shocked if Wisconsin just missed out. I also think the Big Ten will be the best league in the country, which will affect Wisconsin's push to be in the top six or seven in the league standings by mid-March. -- Matt Norlander\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    No. 20 AuburnHow many programs in college basketball, realistically, could withstand the loss of a potential future Hall of Fame coach and be as good (or even better) after they stepped aside just weeks before the start of the season? Think about it. There's probably no schools that come to mind because it's highly unlikely any program would be in a better spot in that situation.That's the basis here on why I'm skeptical Auburn can maintain its preseason expectations as a top-25 team. With Bruce Pearl transitioning into a new role at Auburn and son Steven Pearl now head coach, it's reasonable, and even likely, I'd argue, that Auburn has downgraded dramatically at head coach. That's not to say Steven will fail or even that he won't do well. Don't hear what I'm not saying. \nBut replacing a coach in the elder Pearl who retires with a career winning percentage better than Eddie Sutton, Rick Pitino and Bob Knight, among many others, is a gargantuan ask. Especially for a program that is now handing the keys to a first-time head coach at a place that has largely been unsuccessful in basketball without him.Tahaad Pettiford and the top of Auburn's roster is very good. Steven is set up for success. Auburn, over the short- and long-term, should largely succeed because of how the foundation was set over the last decade. But if any top-25 team finishes unranked or even misses the NCAA Tournament entirely, my bet would be on the Tigers. The SEC will take no prisoners and it can swallow up even the best coaches. If this team misses the Big Dance in five months I don't think we should be surprised given the headwinds it faces. -- Kyle Boone\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    No. 22 Michigan State If this roster were coached by anyone else other than Tom Izzo, there is no chance it would be ranked in the preseason AP poll. But because it's Izzo who is on the sidelines, Michigan State is getting the benefit of the doubt, and understandably so. The Spartans have reached 27 straight NCAA Tournaments under Izzo, and that mark would be 28 if not for the COVID-impacted 2019-20 season. Izzo, 70, is one of the greatest to ever do it, and he might be able to take a roster full of kids from Michigan State's supply chain management program and lead them to the Big Dance.\nSo, just bookmark this for whenever Michigan State ends up in the Final Four for a ninth time under his direction. Now that my respect and admiration for Izzo has been established, let's take a closer look at the 2025-26 Spartans. As has often been the case in recent years, Michigan State will need to be a team whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts. There are no preseason All-Americans, five-star freshmen or projected NBA lottery picks on this team. There aren't even any rockstar transfers. The top three scorers from a 30-win team are gone, and no one on this roster has ever averaged double figures for a high-major program. While there are four rotation players back from last season, they'll be taking on heightened roles in what figures to be a brutal Big Ten.Izzo deserves to be trusted. But if you take away the coach and do a blind roster breakdown, the Spartans would be no more than a bubble team. -- David Cobb\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    No. 25 North CarolinaI wrote about North Carolina not once, but twice during this week. I discussed why the Tar Heels shouldn't be ranked in the initial preseason AP Top 25 poll and should be lower than third in the ACC poll. So, I guess I'm (tripling?) down by picking North Carolina here. The main reason is that UNC coach Hubert Davis doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt. North Carolina missed the NCAA Tournament entirely when the program was ranked preseason No. 1, reached the Sweet 16 in 2024 and shockingly were one of the \"Last Four\" teams in the field last year. Truthfully, UNC should've been sitting at home.\nThis is a make-or-break season for Davis, and anything less than a deep run in the NCAA Tournament will put him back on the hot seat.UNC's roster is talented, no denying that. Five-star Caleb Wilson is a stud, Arizona transfer Henri Veesaar is a breakout candidate and Alabama transfer Jarin Stevenson has already proven he can step up in the big moment. Losing RJ Davis, one of the top scorers in program history, is a big deal. Colorado State transfer Kyan Evans will have big shoes to fill.What will make or break UNC's case for the NCAA Tournament is nonconference games against Kansas, Kentucky and Michigan State. The ACC is top-heavy this season and North Carolina only plays NC State and Louisville once. If North Carolina struggles in nonconference play, it will be playing behind the eight ball entering ACC play with not many opportunities to rack up signature wins. -- Cameron Salerno\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    No. 23 CreightonCreighton's defense is pretty clearly the worst unit of any team that made the AP Top 25. Greg McDermott is a revered offensive mastermind, but he only had one top-25 defense before Ryan Kalkbrenner arrived in Omaha. With the King of Verticality off to Charlotte, Creighton's defense could take a massive plunge because the personnel on that end is uninspiring.\nNik Graves comes from Charlotte, the worst defense in the AAC. Josh Dix and Owen Freeman come from Iowa, where it was defense optional. Oh, and Freeman is still recovering from a knee injury. Is Howard transfer Blake Harper going to be a shutdown defender at the high-major ranks right away? I'm skeptical. What about sweet-shooting Austin Swartz, who Creighton rescued from a Miami dumpster fire? No defense was played in The U for five straight months.McDermott is a smart coach, who will win the shot-quality game, but the personnel is a tad crippling. There's only so much you can do. Creighton faces a steep uphill climb just to get to that top-50 range defensively, which means you're asking an offense with a new starting point guard, new starting shooting guard, new starting wing and new starting center to bail you out time and time again? No, thank you.College basketball is cyclical. Kalkbrenner helped vault Creighton to new heights, but I'm projecting a step back in 2025-26 because you just don't replace dudes like that. -- Isaac Trotter\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The available Week 7 survivor pool teams has dwindled even further. Couple that with a number of upsets, including the Thursday night New York Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles 34-17, and many survivor pool players' hopes are in tatters. For those still alive, this week's schedule does give them a number of options to be able to move on. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Packers vs. Cardinals (+6.5), Buccaneers vs. Lions (-5.5) on 'Monday Night Football', Broncos (-7) vs. Giants and Mike Vrabel's return to Tennessee in Patriots (-7) vs. Titans Meanwhile, the Kansas City Chiefs will look to battle their way back to the top of the AFC West standings when they take on the visiting Las Vegas Raiders. Las Vegas is 2-4 on the year and fourth in the AFC West, while the Chiefs are third at 3-3. Kansas City enters as an 11.5-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Chiefs will be an appealing option for those who can still use them.

The Rams are 3-point and -156 money-line favorites, as one of the road favorites in the Week 7 lines. They are coming off a 17-3 win over the Baltimore Ravens as Matthew Stafford completed 17 of 26 passes for 181 yards and one touchdown. The Jaguars, meanwhile, are off to a 4-2 start following a 20-12 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. Fading the Rams may also be part of a greater NFL survivor pool strategy, which sees the Rams play a struggling Saints team in a couple of weeks.

    "body": "\n        The New York Jets made a splash in free agency this past offseason when the franchise signed quarterback Justin Fields to a two-year, $40 million contract. However, Fields hasn't proved to be the offensive weapon that the team envisioned as he's thrown just four touchdown passes in six games.As a result, Fields feels he needs to be more aggressive going forward if the Jets want to be successful on the offensive side of the ball.\"I feel like I've been a little bit too conservative in a sense,\" Fields said, per ESPN. \"Probably just [need to] be a little bit more aggressive. I've always just been big on ball security and not putting the ball in jeopardy, but it comes to a point where you just have to find that healthy balance between trying to maybe fit it in smaller windows and just letting it rip.\"Fields failed to get the ball out and down the field in a 13-11 Week 6 loss against the Denver Broncos. The former first-round pick completed just 9 of 17 passes for 45 yards and was sacked on nine different occasions. In total, the Jets finished with 10 net passing yards, which was the fewest in an NFL game since Ryan Leaf started for the San Diego Chargers back in 1998.\nOne positive has been the fact that Fields hasn't thrown an interception in his 123 passing attempts this season. In fact, Fields is the only NFL signal-caller with at least 100 passes and zero interceptions.While Fields has taken care of the football, it hasn't resulted in much success for the Jets offense. The Jets, who possess an 0-6 record this season, are averaging just 20.5 points per game (25th in the NFL) and have scored 22 or fewer points in five of their last six contests.\"No interceptions is a great thing,\" Fields said, \"But I also think taking some shots down the field and trying to stretch the field a little bit, I think that's important for us as an offense to create explosive passes.\n\"Everybody is going to throw picks, that's just a part of playing quarterback,\" he continued. \"I looked at myself this past game, and really over the season, and kind of just told myself that I can be a little bit more aggressive. So this Sunday, [I'm] probably going to be a little bit more aggressive, but also not being reckless at the same time. So, it's just being smart when pushing the ball downfield.\"Choosing to hold onto the ball too long has been a theme for Fields throughout the 2025 season. In fact, Fields has been sacked 19 times, which is the second-most in the league with only Tennessee Titans rookie Cam Ward being sacked more frequently.The Jets will look to land in the win column on Sunday when they host the Carolina Panthers. When Fields takes to the gridiron, he may have to do so without star wide receiver Garrett Wilson, who will likely miss the game due to a hyperextended knee.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        U.S. women's national team star Trinity Rodman exited the Washington Spirit's game on Wednesday with an undisclosed leg injury and will undergo scans on Thursday to determine the severity of the injury. Rodman came off in the 41st minute of the Spirit's 4-0 win over Monterrey in the Concacaf W Champions Cup, going to ground after attempting a tackle. She was eventually helped up by team staff but was unable to place any weight on her right leg as she came off the field. She was then seen heading into the locker room at halftime on crutches, and later in a full-length knee brace post-match while still on crutches.The player's exact diagnosis is unclear at this time.\"We need to wait until tomorrow,\" Spirit coach Adrian Gonzalez said after the game, according to Pro Soccer Wire. \"She's going to get scanned tomorrow, and we will have more information.\"The injury came on the same day that Rodman received her first USWNT call-up since April, spending much of the spring and summer treating a chronic back injury. She has, though, played a sizable role for the Spirit since returning from that injury and has seven goals and two assists across all competitions.\nThe USWNT have three friendlies at the end of the month – two against Portugal on Oct. 23 and Oct. 26 – and another against New Zealand on Oct. 29. The Spirit, meanwhile, have two regular season games left in the NWSL and are gearing up for the playoffs after clinching second place and securing home field advantage in the quarterfinals and semifinals should they advance, with the postseason beginning on Nov. 7.Who steps up in Rodman's place on the USWNT?If Rodman is unable to take part, USWNT head coach Emma Hayes has several players on October's roster that are both willing and able to make meaningful attacking contributions against Portugal and New Zealand. Hayes spent the year since the U.S.' gold medal triumph at the Paris Olympics providing opportunities to rising talents, many of whom cracked the roster for this month's friendlies after stepping up in the absence of the \"triple espresso\" of Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson.For Rodman's typical role on the right wing, Hayes has several talented players at her disposal – Michelle Cooper, Ally Sentnor, Yazmeen Ryan and Emma Sears. Ryan and Sentnor are some of the big winners of Hayes' year of experimentation as two of just three players who were not on the Olympics roster to earn 10-plus appearances since, and Sentnor has been one of the team's most productive attackers in that stretch with four goals and two assists. Ryan, meanwhile, has one goal and two assists in the last year with the national team.\nCooper and Sears are not too far behind Senator and Ryan in terms of playing time with eight appearances each, with Sears notching one goal and two assists in that time and Cooper posting one of each. The good news for Hayes – and perhaps all of these players – is that with three games on the schedule this month, there will be plenty of minutes available to all of the attacking talent, refreshing the decades-old sense of competition for playing time in the USWNT's offense.\n            ",

Two weeks ago, we would've been raving about the undefeated Eagles and Bills. Now both teams have lost two straight games. How about Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, one of the preseason favorites? With Jackson having been out each of the last two weeks, Baltimore enters its bye week 1-5 and is in serious danger of missing the postseason. Even the three-time defending AFC champion Chiefs aren't immune. They sit 3-3 heading into a Week 7 home date with AFC rival Las Vegas, though Kansas City is the largest favorite of the week at -11.5.Which teams would you take today to make the Super Bowl?

The Eagles struggled mightily on defense last week, and it's uncertain if cornerback Quinyon Mitchell (hamstring) will be back this week. \"I think it's fair to call this game a must win for Philadelphia coming off two straight losses. We've already seen one Eastern Pennsylvania team fire a successful head coach (Penn State, James Franklin), and while I don't think Nick Sirianni's job is in imminent danger considering he most recently won the Super Bowl, a third straight loss will turn up the heat a bit. Coming off a bye week and with a brutal stretch ahead, this game might be a must win for Minnesota as well. This is the type of game where I would bet both sides +7.5 at something like -125 odds and prepare for a close game no matter who wins.

    "body": "\n        Jonathan Gannon is no stranger to leaving spectators scratching their heads. Since stepping into the NFL limelight in 2023, the Arizona Cardinals head coach has had more than his share of viral moments -- from his awkward first team meeting and asking players if they drove or took the bus to the facility to smacking a broadcast camera out of his face on the sideline.But the past two weeks have elevated Gannon's reputation for unpredictability to a new level. Amid Arizona's 2-4 start, the 41-year-old coach has found himself back in the social-media crosshairs due to a string of sideline incidents and eyebrow-raising comments.Sideline altercation with Emari DemercadoThings seemingly started to devolve in Week 5, when the Cardinals suffered arguably the worst loss of any team this season — blowing a 21-3 lead to the previously winless Tennessee Titans in a 22-21 defeat.The game's defining moment came when running back Emari Demercado broke loose for what should've been a 70-plus-yard touchdown, only to let go of the ball just before crossing the goal line. The ball rolled out of the end zone for a touchback, erasing the score.\nThat led to a sideline altercation between Demercado and Gannon, where the head coach appeared to make contact with the player. The Cardinals fined Gannon $100,000 for his actions, and he publicly apologized the following day.\"Yeah, I woke up this morning and didn't feel great about it, honestly. So in the team meeting, I addressed it. I apologized to Emari, apologized to the team and I just told them I kind of let the moment of what happened get the better of me there. \"I try to be emotionally stable and calm because my job is to solve problems during a game, and kind of lead the charge on that. So it's not really who I am, who I want to be, and I told the guys that today. So it's a mistake by me, and it's just like everybody in there, everybody made some type of mistake yesterday, which culminates to why we didn't win the game, and we can't let it happen moving forward.\" Kyler Murray injury, another blown lead vs. ColtsThe very next week, Gannon was without his franchise quarterback in Kyler Murray after he was sidelined due to a foot sprain. Despite starting backup Jacoby Brissett, Arizona not only hung around with the Indianapolis Colts, but held a 24-17 lead entering the fourth quarter and a 27-24 lead in the middle of the final period as well. Yet once again, they couldn't close. The Colts rallied late for a 31-27 win, handing Arizona its fourth consecutive loss.Brissett's solid showing -- in which the Cardinals offense registered season highs in points (27) and yards (400) -- led to questions about a potential quarterback controversy when Murray comes back. Gannon quickly shut that down.\"When Kyler is healthy enough to play, he'll play,\" Gannon told Burns & Gambo on Arizona Sports.\nThe Michael Vick comment that went viralThen came Wednesday's headline-grabbing moment. Asked during his press conference about learning to control his emotions as a coach, Gannon flatly replied: \"2007. When our quarterback went to jail.\"That was Gannon's final answer of the presser before walking off. \nGannon was referencing his time as a quality control coach for the Atlanta Falcons during Michael Vick's suspension and prison sentence related to a dogfighting investigation. While the moment may have been intended to show perspective gained early in his career, the blunt delivery left many stunned -- and the clip quickly went viral.\nIs Gannon feeling the heat? All of it raises a familiar question: Is Gannon's seat getting warm?The Cardinals have now been under .500 in each of his first two seasons (4-13 in 2023, 8-9 in 2024), and their 2-4 mark entering Week 7 has them tied with the New York Giants for the NFC's second-worst record. Arizona started 2-0 but has since dropped four straight and fallen to the bottom of the NFC West.It's possible these actions from Gannon, who signed a five-year deal in 2023, are concerns about his job status bubbling to the surface. Because if Arizona doesn't turn things around, it could very well result in him getting the boot at the end of the year. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Tennessee Titans became the first NFL team to fire their coach this season, as they parted ways with Brian Callahan following a 1-5 start. The Callahan era was an abject disaster, as the Titans went 4-19 under his leadership. However, all of those losses did net Tennessee a new quarterback in Cam Ward.Ward hasn't lit the NFL world on fire just yet, but he has flashed some of the potential that led to him being selected with the top pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Ward is hardly the first young quarterback to go through a coaching change, as each of the last four quarterbacks picked No. 1 overall had their coaches fired during their rookie seasons.What does Ward want to see in his new coach? The rookie signal-caller was asked that question on Wednesday.\"Somebody who can really do everything from top to bottom, and that's both sides of the ball -- offense, defense,\" Ward said. \"They know the system in and out, and I think the biggest thing is how is the coach going to be with the players. We have all different types of personalities in our locker room and whoever we get, I know they'll be the right hire, but that's not really my main focus right now. I'm with coach [Mike] McCoy right now and we're going to try to win some games.\"\nIt sounds like Ward would appreciate a coach that has served as a lead man before, and that's something many believe Tennessee will look for as well: Experience.According to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport, two names to watch for the Titans job are Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Both have served as head coaches before. Nagy even won NFL Coach of the Year with the Chicago Bears in 2018, while Smith is a very familiar name to Titans fans, as he cut his teeth as an offensive assistant in Nashville.\nSenior offensive assistant Mike McCoy has been named the interim head coach in Tennessee, and you can't rule out him earning the full-time job either. The last three interim coaches in franchise history ended up keeping the job. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We are approaching the halfway point of the 2025 NFL regular season. Can you believe it? It felt like we learned plenty in Week 6. The New York Giants have a fun dynamic duo in Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo, while the Philadelphia Eagles and Buffalo Bills have some major question marks. The Kansas City Chiefs again look like the favorite in the AFC following their statement victory over the Detroit Lions, and the Carolina Panthers are apparently unbeatable at home.This week, Mike Vrabel makes his return to Nashville to face his former team, which just fired his replacement. The Los Angeles Rams take on the Jacksonville Jaguars in Trevor Lawrence's home away from home -- London. Plus, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Lions face off in a potential NFC Championship preview.Bet this week's top games at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Which teams should you pick in Week 7, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Steven Taranto are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken on Oct. 15, via FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users can get $300 in bonus bets:\nPittsburgh Steelers (-5.5) at Cincinnati Bengals (TNF)\nDajani (Bengals +5.5): It's 40-year-old Aaron Rodgers vs. 40-year-old Joe Flacco in prime time on a short week. Take the Under. This is actually the first NFL matchup featuring 40-year-old quarterbacks that does not include Tom Brady and Drew Brees. While the Bengals have now lost four straight games, I think Flacco showed on a short week vs. the Green Bay Packers that he's going to be an upgrade over Jake Browning. I would be absolutely shocked to see Mike Tomlin lose this game, but I do think the Bengals can keep it close  …  Prediction: Steelers 21, Bengals 17Taranto (Steelers -5.5): The Unction is about where the intrigue in this matchup ends for me. Even if Joe Flacco can still sling it a bit and take advantage of having the Bengals' receiving corps to throw to, the Steelers are well on their way to running roughshod over the entire AFC North. The Standard has shown up throughout their three-game winning streak, which includes last week's manhandling of the Cleveland Browns in their first division game. That being said, I do expect at least a one-score game here as I don't expect Cincinnati to just roll over despite their (many) issues.  … Prediction: Steelers 24, Bengals 17Los Angeles Rams (-3) at Jacksonville Jaguars (London)\nDajani (Rams -3): The Jaguars have proven to be a feisty team, but NFL MVP candidate (not kidding, in my opinion) Devin Lloyd won't be available for this game, which really hurts. In a weird season defined by parity, I do believe the Rams are still one of the best teams in the NFL. They are the only team to rank top three in yards per play in both offense and defense, so give me Matthew Stafford  …  Prediction: Rams 24, Jaguars 18\nTaranto (Rams -3): As the Brits would say, the Jaguars got caught feeling rough as a badger's arse against Seattle after the emotional high of beating the Chiefs in primetime -- Or, more simply put on this side of the pond, they were hung over from a huge win. The Jags will be on a national stage yet again with their annual game in London, but playing regularly in the UK doesn't give them an advantage against this specific opponent: Since Sean McVay took over as their coach, the Rams are 2-0 in games they've played in London, outscoring their opponents by a combined 57-10. … Prediction: Rams 27, Jaguars 17New England Patriots (-7) at Tennessee Titans\nDajani (Patriots -7): Don't assume this is going to be the easiest pick of the week. Yes, the Titans stink and just fired their head coach, but since 2015, teams that fire their coach midseason are 12-12 in their next game. Titans owner Amy Adams Strunk is clearly hoping for that \"interim bump,\" but I can't bring myself to bet on this Titans squad. Mike Vrabel wants to embarrass Tennessee, but will do so respectfully  …  Prediction: Patriots 27, Titans 17Taranto (Titans +7): Do not discount the vibes boost that comes after a team fires its head coach. Since 2015, teams that have fired their coach midseason have gone 12-12 in the next game, though it should be noted that not all coach firings are created equally and exactly how the players rally and respond depends on how they felt about their coach to begin with. I still don't expect the Titans to be much of a match for the Patriots, but I do think that they'll show a little pride in the face of adversity -- especially with Mike Vrabel coming back to town …  Prediction: Patriots 24, Titans 20\nNew York Giants at Denver Broncos (-7)\nDajani (Giants +7): It's tough not to love this new-look Giants team. Did you know Jaxson Dart is just the third quarterback in the modern era to rush for at least 50 yards in his first three starts? He joins a short list that includes Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts. I'm not sure what the disconnect is with Sean Payton and Bo Nix, but this offense has been hard to watch this year. Nix completed just 19 of 30 passes for 174 yards and one touchdown vs. the lowly New York Jets in London. For that reason, I'll take the Giants to cover a big number, which I don't quite understand  …  Prediction: Broncos 24, Giants 20Taranto (Giants +7): Remember a couple of days ago when everyone was on Giants defensive coordinator Shane Bowen for running a vanilla scheme and not catering to his players' strengths? Credit where credit is due, because Bowen has apparently listened to his players and started to get more aggressive, and that aggression played a big role in taking down the Eagles -- particularly on Cor'Dale Flott's interception that put the game away. Denver's defense presents a great challenge for the upstart Giants offense, but NFL sack leader Nik Bonitto hasn't reckoned yet with anyone like Giants left tackle Andrew Thomas, who is playing at an All-Pro level again and has allowed Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo to rejuvenate this team and make them feel like anything is possible. Including this week.  …  Prediction: Giants 20, Broncos 13Washington Commanders (-1.5) at Dallas Cowboys\nDajani (Cowboys +1.5): What do we make of the Cowboys? They are 1-1-1 with 104 points scored and zero turnovers in their last three games. Dak Prescott has thrown 10 touchdowns with zero interceptions over the last three weeks, and he's 34-9 SU and 30-12-1 ATS in his career vs. NFC East opponents. The Commanders are certainly feisty, but they gave away that game against the Chicago Bears with three turnovers. I expect plenty of points in this matchup, but give me the home dog  …  Prediction: Cowboys 31, Commanders 30\nTaranto (Commanders -1.5): Even if their offense is hard to stop, the Cowboys' comically bad defense renders them a paper tiger when it matters most. A week ago, the Panthers were the far tougher team when it mattered in the fourth quarter, as they were able to bully their way down the field to set up a chip-shot field goal to win the game. It's going to take a lot more than Dak Prescott throwing it all over the yard for this Dallas team to win consistently, especially against a Commanders team that's going to come into this matchup angry after giving the game away against the Bears on Monday night.  … Prediction: Commanders 37, Cowboys 34Atlanta Falcons at San Francisco 49ers (-2.5) (SNF)\nDajani (Falcons +2.5): It's hard to gauge what this 49ers team is since their roster has to leave games in ambulances half the time, but what I do know is that the Falcons are coming off a momentous victory over the Bills, and Fred Warner and Nick Bosa will not be on the field Sunday night. I'm tempted to take the Falcons straight up here. Brock Purdy could make his return to the lineup, but is he just going to hit the ground running? With Ricky Pearsall, Jauan Jennings and George Kittle banged up? Maybe Atlanta isn't a Super Bowl contender, but the Falcons are 2-0 SU as an underdog this season. And both of those games came in prime time!  …  Prediction: Falcons 21, 49ers 20Taranto (Falcons +2.5): It should not be undersold just how devastating Fred Warner's season-ending injury is. Since he entered the league in 2018, Warner has played in 121 of a possible 122 games, meaning there's only been one game that he hasn't manned the middle of the 49ers defense and done so at an extremely high level. His absence, combined with mounting attrition in general, bodes poorly for San Francisco. They face a Falcons team coming off a huge win over the Buffalo Bills, featuring a virtuoso performance by running back Bijan Robinson and exceptional play by wide receiver Drake London. Their offensive system will at least give them a chance, but the more banged up they get, the more I doubt they can sustain winning the way they have.  …  Prediction: Falcons 27, 49ers 17\nTampa Bay Buccaneers at Detroit Lions (-5.5) (MNF)\nDajani (Lions -5.5): Baker Mayfield is a legend, but can he win vs. a top five team despite all of the Bucs' injuries? I love the Buccaneers, but I think the Lions are arguably the best team in the NFC despite the most recent loss to the Chiefs. Detroit has won four straight meetings in prime time and has committed just three turnovers this season. I'm looking for a bounce-back, as Detroit is 11-0 SU and ATS following its past 11 SU losses, and has covered in six straight games as a favorite …  Prediction: Lions 31, Buccaneers 24Taranto (Buccaneers +5.5): This matchup presents a good case study in what attitude can do for a team one way or the other. The Buccaneers' toughness and resilience have been a central element in their 5-1 start, as Tampa Bay has followed the lead of quarterback Baker Mayfield in his emergence as a potential MVP candidate. The Lions' attitude got the better of them against Kansas City. They are now without one of their best players on defense, safety Brian Branch, after he started a fight following Detroit's 30-17 loss. Consider the impact of not having Branch and pick accordingly.  …  Prediction: Buccaneers 31, Lions 20Houston Texans at Seattle Seahawks (-3.5) (MNF)\nDajani (Texans +3.5): Many believe the Seahawks are one of the more underrated teams in the NFL. I am one of them. BUT... this team HATES playing in front of their home fans. Seattle is just 2-8 in its last 10 home games, and the Texans are not only coming off their bye, but also a 44-10 win over the injured Baltimore Ravens. If you're giving me the hook in this spot, I'll take it. This game could come down to the Texans defense vs. Sam Darnold. Houston is allowing 12.2 points per game this season, which ranks No. 1 in the NFL …  Prediction: Seahawks 20, Texans 17\nTaranto (Seahawks -3.5): Part of what's impressive about the Seahawks' 4-2 record is that they are a perfect 3-0 on the road to just 1-2 at home, which has given them a runway to figure out how to reclaim the home-field advantage they once enjoyed at Lumen Field. While the Seahawks have had issues winning in their own stadium going back to last year, it isn't as though they aren't scoring, as they blew out the New Orleans Saints 44-13 before losing a 38-35 shootout to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This is a good opportunity for the Seahawks to get right and get a win at home in primetime, particularly against a Houston Texans team that is coming off their Bye and has gotten to 2-3 by beating up on the lowly Tennessee Titans and (shockingly) Baltimore Ravens. …  Prediction: Seahawks 34, Texans 21\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A UFC lightweight title shot could hang in the balance for Arman Tsarukyan and Dan Hooker. The UFC Fight Night headliners hope to use Saturday's fight in Doha, Qatar, as a launching pad to Ilia Topuria.Tsarukyan (22-3) checks off what should be the last stop on his redemption arc. His reputation took a major hit after UFC 311. Tsarukyan pulled out of his lightweight title fight with Islam Makhachev, citing a back injury. If losing his title shot wasn't bad enough, UFC CEO Dana White said Tsarukyan would need to earn another crack at gold. He made reparations by serving as backup for Topuria vs. Oliveira. Tsarukyan believes the UFC will position him as Topuria's next fight once he puts away an overmatched Hooker.\"If you compare our skills and who I fought and beat, I'm in the right spot. That's why I'm the No. 1 contender,\" Tsarukyan told CBS Sports. \"He lost all his opportunities against good fighters. He lost to Dustin Poirier, Islam Makhachev and Michael Chandler. He had good fights, but he lost his opportunities.\" Hooker (24-12) is executing his master plan to leapfrog other contenders in the division. Hooker campaigned for the Tsarukyan fight, believing other top contenders were avoiding him. If Hooker cashes as a major underdog, he might find himself as the top contender. That's where the shortcuts end. Hooker believes Tsarukyan is the most skilled lightweight fighter, even greater than champion Topuria. \n\"He had no choice but to fight me,\" Hooker told CBS Sports. \"I knew that, looking at the division. I knew no one between him and me would take the fight. It's too risky. They have a good excuse because he pulled out of his title fight in the last five minutes with a sore back. So the champ Ilia has a good excuse not to face him.\" \nSaturday's co-main event also has title implications. Former welterweight champion Belal Muhammad looks to bounce back against rising contender Ian Machado Garry. A standout performance is imperative after Michael Morales and Carlos Prates notched highlight-reel knockouts at UFC 322. Muhammad and Garry have been trading barbs in the media over how their fight, a grappler vs. striker fight on the surface, will play out.\"I'm going to grab hold of him, I'm going to take  him down, then I'm going to let him back up, just because I'm going to  show him, 'I could take you down if I want to.' Then I'm going to outbox  him because he said he could outstrike me...\" Muhammad told MMA Junkie. \"It's finishing  him on the feet and reminding everybody who I am.\"\n\"That sounds like someone who can't hold me down... If you get me down, keep me down. Try that,\" Garry told CBS Sports in response, later adding, \"I think he's chatting out of his backside. I don't believe it for a second. I think he's playing reverse psychology. If he were smart, he'd be saying this. However, I genuinely think he's thick enough to believe that.\"Let's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings Sportsbook before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassArman Tsarukyan -650Dan Hooker +470LightweightIan Machado Garry -270Belal Muhammad+220WelterweightVolkan Oezdemir -225Alonzo Menifield +185Light heavyweightMyktybek Orolbai -250Jack Hermansson +205WelterweightWaldo Cortes Acosta -135Shamil Gaziev +114HeavyweightTagir Ulanbekov -218Kyoji Horiguchi +180FlyweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Nov. 22 | Start time: 1 p.m. ET (main card)Location: Doha, QatarStream: ESPN+PredictionArman Tsarukyan vs. Dan Hooker: Hooker winning would mark one of the best career comebacks in UFC history and thrust him into a high-profile fight with Topuria. I fear, however, it's an outcome reserved for fairytales. Tsarukyan is a nightmare for any lightweight. Tsarukyan is arguably the top lightweight wrestler after Makhachev's welterweight graduation. Hooker has great takedown defense, but Mateusz Gamrot managed to score five takedowns against him. Tsarukyan is almost as potent a takedown artist as Gamrot, with better top control. While it'd be irresponsible for Tsarukyan to kickbox with Hooker, his evolving striking and solid chin create opportunities to initiate takedowns. Hooker can drag people through hell, but Tsarukyan's well-roundedness allows him to put the fight in his wheelhouse. Pick: Tsarukyan via submission\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 college football schedule is here, and Saturday's games are set to draw a lot of betting interest, including a historic SEC rivalry featuring the Florida Gators and Tennessee Volunteers at 7:30 p.m. ET.

Injuries eventually derailed their campaign, however, and they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Mercury. Days after their Game 3 defeat, the Liberty announced that Brondello would not return as coach. During Brondello's four seasons in charge, the Liberty went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In addition to their 2024 WNBA championship, Brondello also captured the Commissioner's Cup title in 2023.\nDespite all of Brondello's success, general manager Jonathan Kolb and the Liberty's brain trust felt it was necessary to go in a different direction to get the most out of their championship window. \"Coming out of this season and really seeing an influx of change on many teams, it made the decision timeline tangible and one that we can be actionable on,\" Kolb said during his exit interview about the decision to move on from Brondello. \"You can stand still or you can embrace change and move forward. My commitment is to keep pushing the New York Liberty to new heights. We believe that embracing this change will bring a freshness and an energy to our group.\"\nThe Liberty only have two players under contract for 2026 -- Leonie Fiebich and Nyara Sabally -- and like every team in the league face a fascinating offseason. Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Jonquel Jones have all expressed a desire to return, but it remains to be seen how free agency will work after a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified. In addition to trying to re-sign their Big Three, the Liberty will have big decisions to make about Natasha Cloud and Emma Meesseman. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Kyrie Irving will be 34 years old in March. He tore his ACL eight months ago. If the post-Nico Harrison Dallas Mavericks are open to trading Anthony Davis, who is one year younger than Irving, then presumably they would be just as open to an Irving deal... right?Instead, the team is reportedly still fully committed to keeping Irving around.\"Teams are actually sniffing around Kyrie Irving -- his availability on the court, potentially trade-wise and his playing status the rest of the season -- but my understanding is the Mavericks have made it clear privately that they want Kyrie Irving as a complete part of their future moving forward,\" Shams Charania said on \"NBA Today.\" \"He's still in recovery, in rehab from that ACL tear from March, he signed a three-year deal in the offseason, but the Mavericks value his leadership on the court, off the court and his fit with Cooper Flagg, too, potentially. \"Cooper Flagg is going to need a point guard whenever [Irving] is ready to be back out on the court and you just see right now how much this team misses Kyrie Irving, some of these close games that they've had. And that's the difference, though, between the Kyrie Irving situation and the Anthony Davis situation: Listening to potential trade calls on Anthony Davis, but with Kyrie Irving, they want him a part of their future moving forward.\"On the court, a healthy Irving could certainly help Flagg. The Mavericks have been the worst offensive team in the NBA and they are desperate for more playmaking. In the bigger picture, though, if they've pivoted to building around Flagg, who doesn't turn 19 for another month, it's hard to understand why Irving would be off-limits in trade discussions.\nDallas is \"not encouraging trade inquiries\" for Irving, according to Marc Stein of The Stein Line, who noted that the nine-time All-Star is \"already vibing nicely\" with Flagg in practice. He also noted, however, that, after the 2026 Draft, the Mavs won't control their own draft pick until 2031. You do not need an advanced understanding of NBA team-building to see the simplest path forward: Trade veterans for picks and prospects, bottom out this season, then build something new around Flagg and the player they pick next June.This is not to say that everything about the Irving situation is simple. He and the organization need to weigh the pros and cons of him returning to the court this season. If he does return, though, and he plays well enough before the Feb. 5 trade deadline, then he could have a more interesting trade market than Davis by virtue of his contract. Irving is making $36.6 million this season, is owed $39.5 million next season and has a $42.4 million player option in 2027-28. (Davis' deal is structured the same way, but the numbers are much bigger: $54.1 million, $58.5 million, $62.8 million.) Regardless of Dallas' reported plans at the moment, a bidding war for Irving would be ideal.The Mavericks are in a healthier place than they were a couple of weeks ago, but it's still a strange situation. If they make a major move (or multiple major moves) around the deadline, it is unclear who exactly will be doing the negotiating. While they look for a new lead executive, Matt Riccardi and Michael Finley are sharing that responsibility on an interim basis. Minority owner Mark Cuban is involved again, and he told The Athletic that they are still trying to win and not even looking to trade Davis, who remains sidelined with a calf injury. Sure.\nDallas is 4-12, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. By firing the guy who didn't believe in Luka Dončić but believed in this oddly shaped roster, the franchise has given itself an opportunity to turn the page on the most galaxy-brained experiment in NBA history. Now it's time for the Mavs to do the conventional thing: Prioritize Flagg and their future above all else. This doesn't mean they absolutely must trade Irving in the next two and a half months, but they'd be crazy to rule it out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Detroit Lions placed tight end Sam LaPorta on injured reserve last week due to a back injury, which officially ruled him out for Detroit's next four games. However, he's going to miss much more than that. Lions coach Dan Campbell told reporters Friday that LaPorta \"had a procedure,\" and that he's going \"to be out for awhile.\" Campbell also said that LaPorta's chances of returning this season are \"very, very slim.\" He did say that the procedure went well.In nine games this season, LaPorta caught 40 passes for 489 yards and three touchdowns. His best performance came just three weeks ago, as LaPorta caught six of eight targets for 97 yards and a touchdown in the loss to the Minnesota Vikings. The No. 34 overall pick out of Iowa burst onto the scene as a rookie in 2023, catching 86 passes for 889 yards and 10 touchdowns. LaPorta never missed more than one game in his first two seasons. LaPorta's extended absence could cause the Lions to shake things up offensively, and it will be interesting to see how this unit adapts with Campbell now calling plays on offense. Detroit trots out 11 personnel (one tight end) 55.2% of the time, and 12 personnel (two tight ends) 29.8% of the time, according to SumerSports. Tight ends Brock Wright and Ross Dwelley will be asked to step up in LaPorta's place. \nThe Lions still have plenty of firepower offensively with Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, but Jared Goff will certainly miss his big target in LaPorta. Up next for the Lions are Jameis Winston and the New York Giants at Ford Field on Sunday. \n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        Looking back at the 2025 NFL Draft, the top-end talent hasn't produced just yet. Cam Ward can't turn around the Tennessee Titans by himself, ",
    "body": "\n        Looking back at the 2025 NFL Draft, the top-end talent hasn't produced just yet. Cam Ward can't turn around the Tennessee Titans by himself, Travis Hunter is on injured reserve, the New York Giants recently penalized Abdul Carter after missing a walkthrough and Ashton Jeanty averages just 55.4 rushing yards per game. Then, there's Tetairoa McMillan.The No. 8 overall pick of the Carolina Panthers is coming off the best performance of his young NFL career, catching eight of 12 targets for a season-high 130 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-27 overtime win over the Atlanta Falcons. Raheem Morris boasted what was statistically the No. 1 pass defense in the NFL until McMillan got through with them.Up next for the Panthers are the San Francisco 49ers on Monday night, and their coach, Kyle Shanahan, told reporters that McMillan really caught his eye during the draft process. Furthermore, Shanahan also predicted that McMillan is going to be one of the best wide receivers in the NFL in the near future.\"I think he's a stud,\" Shanahan said. \"He's going to be one of the best receivers in this league sooner than later. He's got all the skill sets to do it and I think he's just getting started.\"\nMcMillan the Arizona WildcatTravis Hunter won the Biletnikoff Award last season, but McMillan earned his own consideration as the top wide receiver in the class. The Arizona star caught 84 passes for 1,319 yards and eight touchdowns in 2024. McMillan earned consensus All-American and First Team All-Big 12 status, and his 1,319 receiving yards ranked third in the FBS.McMillan led the FBS in receiving yards over his last three seasons with 3,423, which also set an Arizona program record. He showed off his ability as a deep-ball threat, with 35 career receptions of 20-plus air yards, which again, ranked most in the FBS from 2022-24. Apart from the production and big-play ability, McMillan also possessed desirable size at 6-foot-5, 212 pounds. He tied Mike Evans, Calvin Johnson, Mike Williams and Plaxico Burress in being the tallest wide receiver drafted in the top 10 in the Common Draft Era. \nWhere McMillan ranks among Panthers rookie WRs\nIt's safe to say that Bryce Young has found his new WR1. In 11 games this season, McMillan caught 54 passes for 748 yards and four touchdowns. Check out how that stacks up against the rest of the NFL:CategoryNumberNFL rankReceptions54T-15thReceiving yards7486thYards per reception13.9T-22ndLast Sunday against the Falcons, McMillan became the second rookie in Panthers history to have 100 receiving yards and two touchdowns in a single game, joining David Gettis in 2010. Statistically speaking, he's on track to be the best rookie wideout in Panthers franchise history. YearPlayerReceiving yardsReceiving yards per game2014Kelvin Benjamin1,00863.02018DJ Moore78849.32004Keary Colbert75450.32025Tetairoa McMillan74868.0No longer a sleeper in the Offensive Rookie of the Year raceEarlier this season, Offensive Rookie of the Year looked like a two-horse race between Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Emeka Egbuka and Indianapolis Colts tight end Tyler Warren, with maybe Jaxson Dart making a case in the background.

Newcastle has dropped two of its last three matches and sits just 14th in the EPL standings while Man City has won four in a row across all competition and is second behind Arsenal in the EPL table. Kickoff from St. James' Park is set for 12:30 p.m. ET. Newcastle are +240 money line underdogs in the latest BetMGM Sportsbook odds while Man City are -102 money line favorites. A draw comes in at +280 and the total sits at 2.5 (Over -155, Under +110). The SportsLine Projection Model has Manchester City winning in 46% of simulations to bring value at these odds. Before making wagers on Newcastle vs. Manchester City, be sure to see what SportsLine expert Jon Eimer is betting in this match.Eimer finished 2023 as SportsLine's No. 1 soccer expert, posting a 248-234-12 (+25.93 units) record on SportsLine article picks.

Anyone following his soccer betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.  Here are Eimer's best bets for Newcastle vs. Manchester City on Saturday.Newcastle vs. Manchester City best betsErling Haaland anytime goal scorer (-120, BetMGM) -- 1uManchester City Over 1.5 team total (120, BetMGM) -- 1uHaaland's 100th EPL goalErling Haaland has been virtually unstoppable this season. He's currently leading the golden boot race in Premier League play and has already picked up 14 goals over his 11 starts for the club this season. He's already scored against the best defenses in the league, and he will be looking to return from scoring for Norway to start scoring for his club again. He's also currently one goal away from a pretty remarkable milestone. His next goal will be his 100th EPL goal, and if he scores against Newcastle, he would have accomplished that in just 109 appearances. Expect Haaland to be charging the goal for 90 minutes straight. Manchester City momentum Liverpool is crumbling right now, Arsenal are prepping for the North London Derby and Manchester City are lurking. Right before international break, Manchester City really started to turn up the gas. They wiped the floor with Liverpool 3-0, ran over Dortmund in UCL play 4-1 and outscored both Bournemouth and Swansea 3-1. This team is firing on all cylinders and the break will just have made them stronger. I know playing Newcastle at home is now joke, but City is welcoming back players from injury and should be looking to pick up right where they left off knowing Arsenal could very well drop points this weekend. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        As the regular season winds down, pressure is mounting for some of college football's most prominent programs. With only two weeks left before the postseason, most teams are running out of time to impress the College Football Playoff selection committee.Only five conference champions are guaranteed a playoff spot. The other seven at-large bids remain up for grabs, and at this point any team in the CFP Rankings has a path to the 12-team field.No conference championship matchups are set yet, either. Some leagues, like the SEC and Big Ten, appear fairly cut-and-dry, but the Big 12 and ACC remain wide open. Six Big 12 teams are still alive for a spot in their title game, and four ACC teams carry just one conference loss.All of that sets up a busy stretch over the next two weekends. So which games deserve your attention this Saturday? Here's a viewer's guide to help navigate the Week 11 action.\nThe best games No. 22 Missouri at No. 8 Oklahoma -- noon on ABC, fuboTV (try for free): Oklahoma is one of the nation's hottest teams over the past few weeks. After back-to-back road wins against ranked conference opponents -- No. 20 Tennessee and No. 10 Alabama -- the Sooners return home to face old rival Missouri. The Tigers beat Oklahoma last season in the programs' first meeting since 2011, and a repeat on Saturday could knock the Sooners out of the CFP race entirely.No. 15 USC at No. 7 Oregon -- 3:30 p.m. on CBS, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium: The Pac-12 lives on -- if only in spirit. Now, in 2025, this meeting of West Coast foes marks one of the most important Big Ten games left in the regular season. The conference title picture looks clear, with No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Indiana on track to meet in Indianapolis, but USC and Oregon remain firmly in the playoff hunt. For the Ducks, every game matters with potential first-round homefield advantage in play. The Trojans already have two losses, and they can't afford another if they want to stay in contention for an at-large bid.Pittsburgh at No. 16 Georgia Tech -- 7 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): Pittsburgh's CFP hopes tanked with its Week 12 loss to Notre Dame, but the Panthers can still reach the ACC Championship Game -- so the door isn't closed yet. To stay alive, they'll have to get past Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets, meanwhile, can punch their ticket to Charlotte with a win Saturday. They'll need to play far better than they did against hapless Boston College, and they can't afford to look ahead to next week's regular-season finale against No. 4 Georgia.\nNo. 11 BYU at Cincinnati -- 8 p.m. on Fox, fuboTV (try for free): BYU is hanging around as the first team out of the playoff. The Cougars also control their own destiny in the Big 12 race -- win their last two and they're in the conference title game. Cincinnati is stuck in the muddle of two-loss Big 12 teams, but the Bearcats aren't out of it yet. They need a win to keep their hopes alive, and they'll also need losses from Arizona State, Houston and Utah. Best of the rest Rutgers at No. 1 Ohio State -- noon on Fox, fuboTV (try for free)  No. 13 Miami at Virginia Tech -- noon on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free)  Louisville at SMU -- noon on ESPN2, fuboTV (try for free)   Tulsa at Army -- noon on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Syracuse at No. 9 Notre Dame -- 3:30 p.m. on NBC, fuboTV (try for free)  Arkansas at No. 17 Texas -- 3:30 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free)  Duke at North Carolina -- 3:30 p.m. on ACC Network, fuboTV (try for free)  Jacksonville State at FIU -- 3:30 p.m. on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Kansas State at No. 12 Utah -- 4 p.m. on ESPN2, fuboTV (try for free) No. 18 Michigan at Maryland -- 4 p.m. on Big Ten Network, fuboTV (try for free) \nTCU at No. 23 Houston -- 4  p.m. on Fox, fuboTV (try for free) New Mexico at Air Force -- 7 p.m. on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App   Nebraska at Penn State -- 7 p.m. on NBC, fuboTV (try for free) No. 20 Tennessee at Florida -- 7:30 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free)No. 25 Arizona State at Colorado -- 8 p.m. on ESPN2, fuboTV (try for free) Utah State at Fresno State -- 10:30 p.m. on CBS Sports Network, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 NBA season has already reached the point where trade rumors are starting to leak, and I haven't even gotten to enjoy my slice of Thanksgiving pie yet. The latest comes out of Charlotte, where LaMelo Ball is reportedly open to being traded from the Hornets. The All-Star guard shared his thoughts with a brief, yet effective post on social media with a clown emoji, suggesting that these reports are fictional. On the Hornets' side, Jake Fischer reported that the Hornets are not actively looking to move Ball any time soon.Charlotte reportedly wants to wait for this core of players to get healthy before making any moves, as they have yet to truly see what Ball, Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges etc. can accomplish. That's a fair line of thinking, but it's also been the same song and dance for the last two seasons and they're no closer to a definitive answer to that question. Injuries to Ball and Miller and a suspension to Bridges have limited the Hornets' ability to figure out if this is the core they want to continue building around. In the past two seasons, that's been a fine path to walk given there's really been no other avenue for them to consider. Then they selected Kon Knueppel with the No. 4 pick in the 2025 Draft and suddenly the Hornets may have another path to consider, one that includes trading Ball.\nThrough the first month of the season, Knueppel is leading all rookies in points, is fifth in rebounds and is on pace to completely shatter the rookie 3-point record. Already the Duke product is proving to be much more than just the best sharp shooter in this draft class. While Ball was sidelined with yet another ankle injury, Knueppel was tasked with more on-ball responsibility. He's initiating Charlotte's offense and flashing skills as a scorer off the dribble. Opponents are trying to take away his 3-point shot, but are underestimating his ability to get to the rim, where his 62% finishing rate has him ranked higher than the likes of All-Stars Cade Cunningham and Ja Morant.His ability to play with or without the ball will make him a dangerous scoring threat over the course of his career, as he uses off-ball screens to create the amount of space we're only accustomed to seeing with elite shotmakers. \nKnueppel is proving to be more than a solid role player, which is something he might only become if the Hornets enter a full rebuild. At the same time, it might be too soon in the season for the Hornets to abandon their current path because of one month of quality production from a rookie. With Knueppel making an immediate impact, it'll only make the Hornets better when they're fully healthy, right? But that's the caveat that's been looming over this team for three seasons now.The Hornets haven't been healthy since Ball's second season. When Ball's healthy, he's one of the most electric scorers in the league. He's a fan favorite, especially amongst the younger generation with his shifty handle and ability to make shots that most players would only dare to take in warm-ups. He plays with such a relaxed, effortless energy that can be mistaken for not caring, but this is a guy who can light you up for 25+ points every night and will dabble with a triple-double frequently. He's an offensive engine, but it hasn't amounted to much team success in Charlotte.In Ball's six years with the team, Charlotte hasn't made the playoffs once. They've finished with just one winning season, a 43-39 record during Ball's sophomore year during which he earned his lone All-Star appearance. That was also the healthiest Ball has ever been, as he's never come close to the 75 games he played that season since. In each of the last three seasons, Ball has failed to hit 50 games, as ankle injuries have plagued him continuously. They're already made an appearance this season, as he's missed six games due to another ankle injury.\nSeasonGames played2020-21512021-22752022-23362023-24222024-2547For as brilliant as Ball is offensively, he's only played 20 more games than Zion Williamson over their careers, and those two players are viewed in a far different light when talking about their injuries. Williamson is seen as a walking red flag with his inability to stay on the court, while Ball is considered someone with upside who can maybe break out of his bad habits if only he were in a better organization. That last part may be true of Ball; it's not as if Charlotte is held in high regard for roster or coaching decisions. You could argue that Ball has succumbed to a losing environment and a change in scenery could be just what he needs to turn things around.If that's the case, then all the more reason to trade him if you're Charlotte. Given how frequently Ball is injured, the Hornets may not ever get to see this team healthy over a sustained period of time. If a team is willing to cough up a couple draft picks for him, then why not? Even with the injury concerns, Ball will certainly generate a favorable trade market that could net the Hornets a quality return.Knueppel might not be \"the guy,\" but the Hornets will be paying Ball north of $40 million in each of the next three seasons and there's no guarantee he'll stay healthy enough to make it worth it. If Charlotte can parlay this into a couple of future draft picks and manage to land a top-3 pick in what's supposed to be generational draft in 2026, it gives you a pretty nice exit ramp while Ball can go prove himself in a better situation. \n            ",

The latest Week 13 college football odds list the Ducks as 10-point home favorites. Other Week 13 college football lines of note include No. 8 Oklahoma (-6.5) vs. No. 22 Missouri, No. 12 Utah (-17.5) vs. Kansas State and No. 20 Tennessee (-4) vs. Florida.

Missouri quarterback Beau Pribula (ankle) has at least a chance to play for the first time since late October as he's listed as questionable on the availability report.\nThe Sooners have two losses, but have also piled up an impressive list of wins that includes Alabama, Tennessee and Michigan. Missouri, however, has lost by more than one score just one time this season, and Marshall says the trends points to a competitive game in Norman.\"The Tigers won and covered (-3) 30-23 last season at Columbia. Mizzou has only played two road games to this point in 2025 and is 1-1 straight up and against the spread,\" Marshall told SportsLine. \"Mizzou, however, is on a 12-5-1 spread run since mid 2024. The Sooners have failed to cover the last two at Norman this campaign, and road team has actually covered in last four OU games.

    "body": "\n        Josh Allen showed plenty of frustration during Buffalo's 23-19 loss to the Houston Texans on Thursday night and it's easy to understand why: He was sacked a career-high eight times and he also threw two interceptions. As bad as the sacks and interceptions were, there was one specific play that seemed to frustrate Allen more than anything and that was a failed fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter. With just over 10 minutes left to play in the game, the Bills were trailing 23-16 and they had the ball at Houston's 23-yard line. With the team facing a fourth-and-1, Bills coach Sean McDermott decided to go for it, and the decision immediately blew up in his face when James Cook got stopped cold for a two-yard loss on the pivotal play. As you can see below, Cook had no chance. \nAfter the fourth down failure, Allen headed to the sideline and he definitely didn't look happy. He sat on the bench next to backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and appeared to say \"What are we doing?\"\nFollowing the game, Allen was asked about his sideline interaction with Trubisky and he admitted that he was extremely frustrated. \n\"Just frustration on my part,\" Allen said. \"In a situation like that, probably should have just banged a timeout. We got the play in late. Didn't give ourselves a chance there.\"That's a short answer, but there's a lot to dig into here. For one, Allen suggests that the team should have called a timeout, which is a poor reflection on McDermott, who didn't recognize that a timeout might be the best option there. Allen also said that that play came in late, which isn't a good look for offensive coordinator Joe Brady. Someone on the Bills' sideline probably should have realized that the offense was in total disarray just before the fourth down play and responded by calling a timeout. \nHere's what happened leading up to the play that caused so much confusion for Buffalo: 1. James Cook appeared to be gassed. Just before the fourth-and-1 play, Cook ran the ball on third down, which was the fourth straight play where he had carried the ball. Cook ran for 20 yards to get a first down at Houston's 32-yard line. He then had a 3-yard run, a 5-yard run and a 1-yard run to set up Buffalo's fourth-and-1. After the third down play, it was pretty clear that Cook was gassed and he started to walk off the field. James Cook was walking off the field just before Buffalo's fourth-and-1 attempt.  At this point, the Bills should have called a play that didn't involve him or taken a timeout to give him a break, as Allen suggested. \n2. After briefly going to the sideline, Cook eventually returned to the game, but he didn't get to the huddle until there were just 20 seconds left on the play clock. And let's not forget, the play call came in late here and it appears Allen was still trying to figure out what the call was with just 18 seconds left on the play clock. The Bills struggled to get their fourth down play in.  At this point, the offense is now rushed, which is not what you want on fourth down. In the end, the play call ended up going to Cook, who didn't even want to be on the field for the play, because he wanted a chance to catch his breath. Like Allen said, this would have been the perfect spot for a timeout, but the Bills didn't take one, and their fourth down play never had a chance. Later in the quarter, the Bills ending up pulling off one of the most improbable plays of the NFL season when they converted a fourth-and-27, but since they lost, that's probably not the fourth down play that Allen is going to remember from the game. Instead, the Bills star quarterback is likely going to remember his frustrations from the fourth-and-1. \nThe Bills had actually converted a fourth-and-1 earlier in the game with Allen jumping over the pile, but Brady decided not to go that route again. \nAllen threw for 253 yards in the game, but he totaled zero touchdowns against the Texans in a performance that came five days after he totaled six touchdowns in a 44-32 win over the Buccaneers. It was definitely a frustrating loss for Allen, but he didn't pin the blame on anyone except for himself. \n\"I have to be better with throwing the ball away, living to see another down, letting us play some situational football and pinning them deep,\" Allen said. \"Too many times, I was going backwards, and I have to be better on that.\"Allen lost a total of 70 yards on the eight sacks that he took, and his interceptions were both costly. Allen's biggest problem might just be playing in Houston. The Bills quarterback is now 0-4 in his career when playing at NRG Stadium. Allen had been undefeated on Thursday nights (8-0) going into Week 12, but that unbeaten streak is now over after the Bills' stunning loss. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 12 has arrived for NFL DFS players, and there are three matchups on the Sunday 'main slate' that feature an over/under of 50 points or higher. Lions vs. Giants, Colts vs. Chiefs and Patriots vs. Bengals will all be potential sources of major offense. While NFL DFS lineups won't feature Ja'Marr Chase (suspension) this week, they could feature Joe Burrow, who has returned to practice for the first time in around two months and is eyeing a return from his toe injury.Which NFL DFS picks from those matchups should you target, and are there players from potentially lower-scoring games like Seahawks vs. Titans or Raiders vs. Browns who should factor into your NFL DFS strategy?

Generally the most expensive tight end in the player pool in recent years, Kelce is now the third-most expensive TE option on the main slate for both sites as his overall production has slipped. McClure, however, is encouraged by his massive numbers last week that included season highs in targets (13), receptions (9) and yards (91). The Colts rank 30th in the league in points given up to opposing Fantasy tight ends, opening the door for a massive day for Kelce in what could be a high-scoring game. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Packers running back Emanuel Wilson ($6,500 on FanDuel, $5,300 on DraftKings), who could see a big workload with Josh Jacobs (knee) possibly out. Wilson, a third-year pro out of Fort Valley State, did a nice job in relief last week with 49 scrimmage yards and a score. He was also effective against the Steelers last month in the other game he saw extensive action, piling up 87 scrimmage yards. Minnesota has given up the ninth-most rushing yards to opposing backs this year.  See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Week 12McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        The WNBA coaching carousel has taken its last lap and every job is now filled. The New York Liberty are hiring Warriors assistant Chris Demarco as their new head coach, replacing Sandy Brondello. That marks the fifth and final hire of the offseason. The Seattle Storm have hired Sonia Raman, while the Portland Fire brought in Alex Sarama. Brondello landed with the Toronto Tempo and the Dallas Wings have gone back to college and hired Jose Fernandez away from the University of South Florida.\n        \n            \n                New York Liberty hiring Golden State Warriors assistant Chris DeMarco as new head coach, per report\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nQuinn's departure was expected. The Storm won only one playoff series since she took over in 2021 and she was investigated last offseason for alleged bullying and harassment. Likewise, it was not all that surprising to see Koclanes relieved of his duties. He went 10-34 in his first season in charge of the Wings and did not seem cut out for the job. The Liberty's decision to part ways with Brondello just one year after she led the franchise to its first championship, on the other hand, came as a shock to many. It's unlikely we'll see any further coaching changes this winter. Seven teams changed coaches last offseason, and if you count Natalie Nakase with the expansion Golden State Valkyries, eight coaches started new jobs. One, Koclanes, has already been fired, and the only other one who could be in trouble is Tyler Marsh, who went 10-34 with the Chicago Sky. However, if the Sky were going to move on from Marsh, they likely would have done so by now. Of the five teams that entered the 2025 season with established coaches, the Storm and Liberty have made changes. The Las Vegas Aces and Phoenix Mercury made it to the Finals, and Becky Hammon and Nate Tibbets have excellent job security. As does Cheryl Reeve, despite the Minnesota Lynx's early exit from the playoffs. \n WNBA coaching tracker Team2024 recordPrevious coachNew coachDallas Wings10-34Chris KoclanesJose FernandezNew York Liberty \t\t\t\t27-17 \t\t\t\tSandy Brondello \t\t\t\tChris DeMarcoPortland Fire \t\t\t\tN/A \t\t\t\tN/A \t\t\t\tAlex SaramaSeattle Storm \t\t\t\t23-21 \t\t\t\tNoelle Quinn \t\t\t\tSonia RamanToronto Tempo \t\t\t\tN/A \t\t\t\tN/A \t\t\t\tSandy BrondelloLibertyOut: Sandy BrondelloDuring Brondello's four seasons in charge, the Liberty went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In addition to their 2024 WNBA championship, Brondello also captured the Commissioner's Cup title in 2023.In: Chris DeMarcoDeMarco has been an assistant coach with the Golden State Warriors since 2012, a tenure that included four NBA titles. He also served as the head coach for the Bahamas men's national basketball team and as an assistant coach in the NBA All-Star Game in 2015 and 2017.StormOut: Noelle QuinnQuinn, who won a championship with the Storm as a player, joined the Seattle coaching staff as an assistant in 2019 immediately upon her retirement. In 2021, she was elevated to head coach after Dan Hughes stepped down due to health reasons. While she led the Storm to four playoff appearances, they won only one series despite an abundance of talent and never finished higher than sixth in the league in offensive rating. Furthermore, Quinn was investigated for alleged bullying and harassment of players. A second consecutive first-round exit in 2025 was the final straw. In: Sonia RamanPrior to her lone season as an assistant with the Liberty this year, Raman served as an assistant with the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies from 2020 to 2024. Before making the jump to the professional ranks, she was the head coach of MIT women's basketball team for 12 years between 2008 and 2020. During her tenure, she led the team to its first two Division III conference championships and two NCAA Tournament appearances. Before that, she was the lead assistant at Wellesley College for six seasons and began her coaching career at her alma mater, Tufts University.WingsOut: Chris KloclanesAfter a number of years as an assistant at both the WNBA and collegiate levels -- largely working under Curt Miller, who is now the Wings' general manager -- Koclanes got a chance to run the show himself. His lone season with the Wings was a disaster. He never seemed comfortable in charge, and the Wings finished in last place at 10-34 and set the league's single-season losses record. By the end of the season, fans were chanting \"We want Nola!\" during games, asking for the team to replace Koclanes with assistant Nola Henry. The Wings will now search for their third coach in as many years. In: Jose FernandezUSF coach Jose Fernandez is making the leap from the college ranks to the WNBA after 25 years coaching the Bulls. After leading South Florida to 10 NCAA Tournaments, including in eight of the last 11 seasons, he'll take over the Wings and Rookie of the Year Paige Bueckers, coming off a 10-34 record in 2025. Liberty Out: Sandy Brondello Brondello had a very successful tenure in charge of the Liberty. Over her four seasons in charge, the team went 107-53, won a franchise-record 32 games in both 2023 and 2024, never missed the playoffs and made two Finals appearances. In 2024, she led the Liberty to the first championship in franchise history and in 2023 she helped capture the Commissioner's Cup title. Ultimately, those accomplishments were overshadowed by a disappointing 2025 campaign. The Liberty were beset by injuries, finished in fifth place and were bounced in the first round of the playoffs by the Mercury.  In: TBD \n        \n            \n                Liberty coaching search: Top potential candidates to replace Sandy Brondello after New York's stunning move\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFireOut: N/AIn: Alex SaramaSarama, who was born in England, has a fascinating résumé. He's worked with Paris Basketball and the London Lions -- where he briefly overlapped with Fire general manager Vanja Černivec -- as well as the Rip City Remix, the Portland Trail Blazers' G League affiliate, and the Cleveland Cavaliers. He also founded Transforming Basketball in 2023, which is \"widely regarded as a globally-leading resource in basketball coach education,\" and is a leading proponent of Constraints Led Approach or CLA, an innovative training technique. He was very highly regarded with the Cavaliers, but whether he works out as a head coach remains to be seen. \n        \n            \n                Portland Fire coaching hire: WNBA expansion team to hire Alex Sarama from Cleveland Cavaliers, per report\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTempoOut: N/AIn: Sandy BrondelloThe Liberty's decision to shake things up was a major win for the Tempo, who were able to hire Brondello as the first coach in franchise history.

She's compiled a 269-181 lifetime record, is sixth on the all-time wins list and has won championships with two different franchises (Phoenix Mercury in 2014, Liberty in 2024). Brondello is highly regarded by her players and staff everywhere she goes, and will help set a winning culture in Toronto as the franchise begins its WNBA journey. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two longtime rivals collide in a Big Ten showdown with College Football Playoff implications when the No. 7 Oregon Ducks host the No. 15 USC Trojans at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Ore. The Ducks (9-1, 6-1 in the Big Ten) and Trojans (8-2, 6-1) are in a three-way tie with Michigan (8-2, 6-1) for third place in the conference, and the winner of Saturday's game theoretically would be in position to make the Big Ten Championship Game if either No. 1 Ohio State or No. 2 Indiana would drop one of its remaining regular season games.But the Oregon-USC showdown is more about positioning in the CFP rankings. Already outside of the 12-team bracket, the Trojans would be dealt a devastating blow to their national title hopes with a loss. Meanwhile, the Ducks would also be in danger of falling outside of bracket with a defeat on Saturday. Bet college football Week 13, including USC at Oregon, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and three months of NBA League Pass. Click here to sign up:USC will need to solve its issues on the road to stay alive in the CFP hunt. Since coach Lincoln Riley arrived in Los Angeles in 2022, the Trojans are 1-6 when playing a ranked team on the road. That includes defeats at No. 23 Illinois and No. 13 Notre Dame this season. Over its last 20 games facing ranked opponents on the road, USC is 2-18. In addition, the Trojans haven't won in Autzen Stadium since 2011.Top sportsbooks have made Oregon a 10-point favorite over USC. The line has risen from -8.So what should you make of all that line movement? Is it a market correction or an overreaction? Here's a look at the Oregon-USC point spread, as well as the line movement on four other Week 13 games. All times Eastern.No. 22 Missouri at No. 8 Oklahoma (noon)Open: Oklahoma -10Current: Oklahoma -6.5This line was on the drop even before Tigers quarterback Beau Pribula (ankle) was upgraded from doubtful to questionable to Thursday night. And now, Thursday's news has dropped the number to below the key number of -7 (though Missouri backers can still find some -7s out there). However, if Pribula is not 100% mobile, the Sooners' defense, which ranks second in the country in sacks per game (3.70), will be salivating to hunt him in the pocket. Though Oklahoma faces the possibility of a letdown one week after upsetting Alabama, the value is now on the Sooners.Bet Week 13 college football games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets. Click here:Ball State at Toledo (2 p.m.)Open: Toledo -23Current: Toledo -28This game features the biggest line movement of the week, with sportsbooks now making the Rockets four-touchdown favorites. The movement makes sense. Toledo is a perfect 5-0 at home this season, winning by an average of 40.0 points per game. Conversely, Ball State is 0-5 on the road this year, losing by 26.4 points a game. The Rockets boast the No. 1 offense and defense in the MAC, while the Cardinals are 12th (out of 13) in offense and 10th in defense. Toledo bettors won't get the best number, but it may not matter.Marshall at Appalachian State (2:30 p.m.)Open: Marshall -2Current: Marshall -5This point spread shift is a reaction to Appalachian State's recent slide. The Mountaineers have lost four in a row and are coming off a 58-10 blowout loss against James Madison. Though they are at home, they have dropped their last two home contests to Coastal Carolina and Georgia Southern. Meanwhile, the Thundering Herd (5-5, 3-3 in Sun Belt) still have incentive on Saturday; one more win makes Marshall bowl-eligible.Bet college football at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens. Click here to get started:No. 15 USC at No. 7 Oregon (3:30 p.m.)Open: Oregon -8Current: Oregon -10Duck supporters better hop on quickly. This point spread has jumped from its opening and may get to -10.5, though there are still some heavily juiced -9.5s out there. Oregon is a bad matchup for the Trojans; the Ducks lead the nation in both pass defense (127.3 yards per game) and pass efficiency defense (94.27). They have the ability to make the Trojans play lefthanded on Saturday. In addition, USC could very well be without its best offensive lineman, left tackle Elijah Paige. Oregon bettors have missed the best number at this point, but the Ducks still seem to be the right side.New Mexico at Air Force (7 p.m.)Open: Air Force -1Current: New Mexico -3.5This line completely flipped with the news that Falcons quarterback Liam Szarka is out for the season with a broken arm. To replace Szarka, Air Force will turn to Kemper Hodges, a 6-foot, 245-pound converted fullback who has taken just 39 snaps this year. The Falcons managed just nine points after Hodges replaced Szarka in last week's loss to UConn. Meanwhile, the Lobos (7-3) are in the midst of one of the best turnaround seasons in college football this year.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots will host the New York Giants on 'Monday Night Football,' at 8:15 p.m. ET with the teams' respective quarterbacks headlining the NFL DFS player pool. Drake Maye is an MVP contender as vets like Stefon Diggs and Hunter Henry have eased the learning curve in his second season. Meanwhile, Jaxson Dart can again be considered for daily Fantasy football lineups after missing the last few games. With an assortment of Giants injuries, Dart's leaned on the likes of Tyrone Tracy and Theo Johnson, thus providing options for NFL DFS stacks.You can't forget about the under-the-radar players as potential MNF DFS picks, such as New York's Isaiah Hodgins. He's played just two games in 2025 but has 99 yards and a score across them. Finding players who outperform their price tags is a tried-and-true winning NFL DFS strategy. Before making any Patriots vs. Giants NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

The sophomore signal caller entered Week 13 leading the NFL in passing yards while ranking seventh amongst quarterbacks in rushing yards. Now he gets to face a Giants defense which has allowed the second-most Fantasy points to QBs this season. Each of the last seven starting quarterbacks to face the Giants have had multiple total touchdowns, while Maye should be able to use his legs versus New York, which has allowed the most rushing yards to QBs. See who else to roster at SportsLine.McClure is also rostering Giants receiver Wan'Dale Robinson who is coming off a 9-156-1 stat line, with the 156 receiving yards being a career high. Robinson already has surpassed his career high in receiving yards for the season and entered Week 13 with the 11th-most Fantasy points amongst wideouts. With New England having the No. 2 run defense, but ranking just 17th versus the pass, expect the Giants to heavily utilize the air game, which boosts Robinson's NFL DFS value. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set Giants vs. Patriots NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football'.

They are now huge favorites in the Sun Belt Championship Game this coming Friday. Chesney led a top-10 scoring offense this season that was especially dominant in the run game. The Dukes, however, were well-rounded with a top-10 scoring defense as well. He doesn't have obvious ties to UCLA or the West Coast, but with the available Power Four jobs shrinking, this could be a logical next step for the up-and-coming coach.\"If you're looking for the next Curt Cignetti, why not start with the guy who inherited James Madison from him?\" the BRO staff said in its last hot board post. \"Chesney actually has a similar story, putting together two very good seasons at James Madison after excelling at lower levels, turning Holy Cross into a contender at the FCS level, and before that showing his chops at a pair of D2 and D3 schools in Assumption and Salve Regina. This would absolutely be UCLA making an evaluation and plucking a guy who has shown that he can really coach and develop.\" See more candidates at BruinReportOnline.\nHow to get insider UCLA coaching search updates The rest of the list includes several other exciting possibilities, including a rival head coach \"who could be interested if approached.\" You can only see who it is at BruinReportOnline.Who are the top names in the UCLA football coaching search, and which big-name coach could the Bruins take a big swing on?

    "body": "\n        Just minutes before the current collective bargaining agreement was set to expire, the WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association agreed to a 40-day extension, the league announced Sunday night. The new expiration date for the current CBA is Friday, Jan. 9, 2026. Either party can terminate the extension at any point with 48-hour notice. This is the second time that the current CBA has been extended. It was originally set to expire on Oct. 31, but days before that deadline the two sides agreed to a 30-day extension that pushed the expiration date back to Nov. 30. There was little movement -- at least publicly -- over the last 30 days, and it seemed as though the two sides may be heading for a status quo period until their last-minute extension late on Sunday night. Extensions are not a new phenomenon in CBA negotiations. In fact, the two sides needed a 60-day extension to come to terms on the current CBA, which was not ratified until January of 2020. It appears as though the ongoing negotiations could follow a similar timeline. WNBA's most recent offer didn't move the needleIn November, the WNBA made a new offer to the players that included substantial salary increases, including a new minimum salary (more than $220,000) that would be more than the 2025 regular max salary ($214,466), according to the Associated Press. However, the players did not believe that offer moved negotiations forward, per ESPN. \n\n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: League's latest offer would raise minimum salary above 2025 maximum, per report\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile the players want more money, a new revenue-sharing model is their top priority, not just higher salaries. \"If me and you aren't set on going to the correct restaurant, who cares what we're ordering as an appetizer?\" WNBPA first vice president Kelsey Plum said earlier this year. \"First, second, third is rev share [and] salary. So when I say that we continue to propose and the counter proposals that are coming back are further away from where we thought we would be, that to me is -- and I think a lot of the players are in agreement as a union -- this is literally the meat and potatoes.\"Under the current CBA, however, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. \nCurrently, players reportedly only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive. While the current CBA does have a clause to trigger revenue sharing if the WNBA hits certain benchmarks, they have never been met, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the WNBA's latest offer reportedly included a revenue sharing component, ESPN's report indicated that the players were still not satisfied with how the salary cap, and thus player salaries, would grow. What happens next?There are four paths forward from here. Let's quickly run through them:1. A new CBAThe ideal outcome would be a new CBA. The sooner the two parties can come to terms on a new CBA, the sooner the offseason can commence. While the draft lottery was finally held late last month -- the Dallas Wings won the No. 1 pick for the second year in a row -- none of the other major offseason activities can take place until a new CBA is ratified. \nA new CBA by Jan. 9 would also ensure that the 2026 season can start on time, which is extremely important for the continued growth of the league. 2. Another extension to the current CBAIf, for some reason, the two sides still cannot agree to a deal by Jan. 9, they could negotiate another extension. While that would not be ideal, it would be better than the risk of a work stoppage. 3. A status quo periodIf Jan. 9 passes without a new CBA or another extension, there would not automatically be a work stoppage. Instead, the two sides would enter a status quo period.\nPer the Cornell Law Review: \"Courts developed the 'status quo' doctrine from the Katz prohibition of unilateral changes. This doctrine requires employers 'to maintain, during ther period of negotiations, the status quo concerning conditions of employment in order to avoid committing [a violation of the duty to bargain in good faith].'\"The key difference between status quo and an extension is that either side could announce a work stoppage at any point during status quo, while an extension would lock in the current CBA until a set date (or until a new CBA is agreed upon).4. A work stoppageAt any point during a status quo period, either side could enact a work stoppage. That would most likely come via the owners locking out the players, though the players could also go on strike. \nIn the event of a lockout, all league business would cease and players would be prevented from accessing team facilities. That would mean no expansion draft, no free agency, no trades, no 2026 WNBA Draft, nothing until a new CBA is in place. Depending on how long the lockout lasted, it's possible that the 2026 season could be delayed or, in a worst-case scenario, cancelled. The WNBA has never lost games due to a work stoppage. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After several big hits and coming up empty on various misfires during Sunday's 26-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills, Aaron Rodgers attempted to detail what went wrong amid the Pittsburgh Steelers' third setback in their last four games. Rodgers finished 10 of 21 for 117 yards, one of the worst outings of his career. A fractured left wrist forced him to play with a cast. He briefly exited the game at one point to bandage his bloodied nose following a strip-sack from behind by Joey Bosa.Pittsburgh hopes to expand its options with Rodgers after another week of injury recovery.\"I felt good enough to be out there, just not ready to take a snap under center, hopefully next week for that,\" Rodgers said. \"Disappointed in my performance, disappointed in the offensive performance and got to flush it.\"  Rodgers placed some of the blame on miscommunication and timing errors with his receivers. Tight end Darnell Washington led the Steelers with two catches for 45 yards. D.K. Metcalf was a non-factor for the second straight game, finishing with 32 yards on five targets. The ineptitude offensively led to a chorus of boos from the Steelers' home crowd in the second half.  \n\"I totally understand the frustration,\" Rodgers said. \"I've been booed on offense, even in Green Bay over the years. That was a boo-worthy performance.\"Playoff outlookPittsburgh plays a pivotal road game Sunday against the Ravens, before concluding with Miami, Detroit, Cleveland and the season finale against Baltimore at home. With three games left against divisional competition including a pair of matchups with the AFC North co-leaders, the Steelers' playoff hopes will be ultimately determined by offensive production and if Rodgers can get back on track.Rodgers and his receivers have to get on the same page in the film room first, he said. \n \"When there's film sessions, everybody shows up, and when I check to a route, you do the right route,\" Rodgers said. \"We have our meetings every week. We have other opportunities outside of the facility, and [I] look forward to seeing all the boys there.\"Pittsburgh is the second team out of the AFC's playoff picture in the No. 9 spot. The fourth-seeded Ravens own the tiebreaker over the Steelers for the time being based on best win percentage in common games.Buffalo's 23 unanswered points in the second half were tough to stomach for the Steelers, who dropped five of their last seven games since starting the season 4-1.\n\"That's an awful performance by us,\" Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots will host the New York Giants for Monday Night Football in Week 13 with kickoff scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET. The Giants are hopeful that Jaxson Dart will be cementing himself as a franchise quarterback this time next year, just as Drake Maye has done for the Patriots. Maye is an MVP candidate and tight end Hunter Henry has become one of the second-year quarterback's favorite targets. Henry is tied for the team lead with five touchdowns on the season and is coming off a 100-yard game last week, but he's still priced as high +210 in the Patriots vs. Giants anytime touchdown scorer odds. That's why he's one of the SportsLine Projection Model's top MNF anytime TD scorer picks. Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Monday Night Football in Week 13. With NFL props available for almost every player in Giants vs. Patriots at top online sportsbooks, SportsLine's proven computer model can help you find value to add to your New England vs. New York NFL picks. New users can take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest BetMGM bonus code, where new users can get up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if their first bet loses:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model entered Week 13 on a sizzling 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns. Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Patriots vs. Giants.Best Monday Night Football anytime TD prop picks:Hunter Henry, Patriots (+210)Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots (+230)Theo Johnson, Giants (+260)Parlay these picks for +3300 odds with the latest DraftKings promo code and get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins:Hunter Henry, Patriots (+210, bet365)Henry established himself as a reliable option early in Maye's tenure, leading the Patriots in targets (97) and receiving yards (674) while tying for the team lead in receptions (66) last season. New England has had more wide receiver involvement with Stefon Diggs joining the roster this offseason, but Henry still ranks second on the team in targets (61) and receiving yards (537). He's also tied for first with five touchdowns and he's coming off his biggest game of the season last week in Cincinnati, with seven catches for 117 yards and a TD. The model predicts that he scores 0.46 touchdowns on average while the implied scoring probability is 32.3%. Use the latest bet365 bonus code to find this price and get $150 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots (+230, bet365)Stevenson has been surpassed by rookie TreVeyon Henderson as New England's top back, but he's still the more bruising back and Henderson has had mixed results as a short-yardage runner despite being the more explosive back. Against New York's putrid run defense, there might be plenty of opportunities for both. The Giants rank last in the NFL in rushing yards allowed and yards allowed per carry (5.9). The model predicts 0.46 touchdowns on average for Stevenson while the odds imply a 30.3% chance to score. Get $150 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.Theo Johnson, Giants (+260, FanDuel)The second-year tight end out of Penn State has been by far the team's most reliable red-zone threat since Malik Nabers went down with a season-ending knee injury. He leads the team with five receiving touchdowns and four of those scores have come from inside the 20-yard line. The model predicts that Johnson scores 0.42 touchdowns on average while the odds imply a 27.8% chance to score. Use the latest FanDuel promo code to find this price and get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins.Want more Monday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Patriots vs. Giants.

But before each conference crowns its champion for 2025, now is a great time to take stock of how every team in the FBS stacks up against each other in the college football rankings. The CBS Sports 136 is a comprehensive ranking of all 136 FBS teams, as determined by experts from CBS Sports and 247Sports. We begin the process in August with a preseason balloting and will continue to finalize the picture of college football for this season with another update next week and then a final one after the conclusion of the national championship game. But here, after Week 14 results are in the books, is a good point to see how things have concluded for each team before the coaching carousel and transfer portal continue to adjust the way each team looks moving forward. For the top -- and most important spot in the rankings -- the biggest news coming out of Week 14 was Ohio State solidifying its position at No. 1. With Texas A&M's loss to Texas and the Buckeyes' emphatic win at Michigan, our voters have reached a unanimous position that Ohio State is the No. 1 team in the country. Ryan Day's squad has held the No. 1 position in our rankings for several weeks, but to wrap the regular season with that unanimous support and a 12-0 record puts a successful season in perspective for the reigning national champions. Of course, anyone tied to Ohio State recognizes the bigger challenges ahead, including a Big Ten title game matchup against Indiana and pursuing another national championship. But it's worth noting that this program lost double-digit starters and NFL Draft picks after winning it all and ran it back to the point of being 12-0 and unquestioned as the top dog in the sport. The latest update for the CBS Sports 136 also has some reactions to the Week 14 results, including an adjustment for Texas A&M after the Aggies took their first loss of the season at Texas on Friday night. The Aggies dropped from No. 3 to No. 6, barely edging out Ole Miss for the No. 6 spot with an average voter ranking of 6.33 compared to 6.55 for Ole Miss. Texas Tech moved up into the No. 3 spot in our rankings by beating out Georgia and Oregon for the honor of highest-ranked one-loss team, again by narrow margins in a competitive tier of the top 10 that sits behind Ohio State and Indiana but ahead of the Aggies and the Rebels. \nBecause our voters have been tracking these teams and judging resumes all season long, one single result has a limit on how much movement will be created in the rankings. As such, some of the biggest changes in terms of the number of spots moved up or down can be found further down outside the top 20. We've detailed some of those notable week-to-week adjustments in the Mover's Report below the top 25 table. College football experts from CBS Sports and 247Sports contribute ballots each week, which are averaged together for our rankings. You can see the top 25 below and 26-136 on our rankings page.\nRankTeamRecordPrevious1Ohio State12-012Indiana12-023Texas Tech11-154Georgia11-145Oregon11-166Texas A&M11-137Ole Miss11-178Notre Dame10-289BYU11-11110Alabama10-21011Oklahoma10-2912Miami10-21213Vanderbilt10-21414Utah10-21315Texas9-31716USC9-31817Virginia10-21618North Texas11-12019Michigan9-31520James Madison11-12121Arizona9-32722Tulane10-22423Georgia Tech9-32224Pittsburgh8-42325Tennessee8-419Biggest movers No. 70 Florida (+8): The Gators finished a disjointed and ultimately disappointing season with a cathartic rivalry win against Florida State on Saturday, then positioned itself for the future by hiring Jon Sumrall on Sunday. It's not often that 4-8 teams finish inside the top 75 of our rankings, but Florida's win against Texas and competitiveness against other quality opponents gave them a leg up when sorting out teams in the bottom half of the rankings. No. 34 TCU (+7): Sonny Dykes' team finished the season with back-to-back quality wins against Houston and Cincinnati, providing a nice rebound from back-to-back losses and sending the Horned Frogs into the bowl season with some momentum. Since Houston and Cincinnati each spent considerable time inside the top 35 this season, it makes sense the win would get a positive response from our voters. No. 21 Arizona (+6): Speaking of momentum, Brent Brennan and the Wildcats finished the regular season with five straight wins, closing with a rivalry road win against Arizona State. This team was buried in the bottom of the Big 12 last season but returned with a roar, finishing tied for fourth in the conference standings with a 6-3 record. No. 25 Tennessee (-6): Getting run out of the building by your rival is never a fun way to end the regular season, and now a Tennessee team that was at one point in the mix to return to the College Football Playoff will be making holiday plans elsewhere after finishing 8-4 following a 45-24 loss to Vanderbilt. The overall resume is still strong compared to the average FBS team, since the only losses came to Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma and Vanderbilt. But Tennessee measures itself against those teams and not the average FBS team.  No. 41 Cincinnati (-7): The Bearcats were a midseason darling of the CBS Sports 136 as Scott Satterfield's group ran off a seven-game winning streak that encompassed the early portion of the Big 12 schedule. However, Cincinnati lost the final four games of the regular season and now returns somewhere close to preseason expectations with a 7-5 record overall and a 5-4 showing in conference play. No. 48 San Diego State (-13): This is a pretty dramatic reaction to a double-overtime loss to another conference title contender, as a defeat to New Mexico in extra time dropped the Aztecs to 9-3 on the year. The computer ratings formula adopted by the Mountain West to break a four-way tie for first place left San Diego State on the outside looking in when it comes to playing this weekend in the Mountain West title, and getting judged as a three-loss team instead of a two-loss team resulted in the Aztecs losing some tiebreakers on ballots from our voters.Check out the rest of the CBS Sports 136: Teams ranked 26-136\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Motor sports have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years, which has brought mainstream sports fans to F1 betting and NASCAR betting through pop culture. We'll take a look at how sportsbooks operate when it comes to motor sports, how bettors can wager on racing events and go over some of the best strategies and tips when it comes to racing betting.Finding the best sportsbook promos for motor sports bettingHere's a look at some of the promotions going on at top sportsbooks for fans interested in getting into motor sports betting.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $150 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBS20XBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanaticsBet and Get Up To $2,000 in Bet Insurance FanCashCBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 are all offering \"bet and get\" promotions where users get bonus bets after wagering $5 or more. FanDuel requires a user's first bet to win, while DraftKings and bet365 provide bonus bets regardless of the outcome of the qualifying bet. DraftKings is also giving users a discount on NFL Sunday Ticket for the 2025 season.BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook are also giving out bonus bets but in a different way. BetMGM covers a user's first bet up to $1,500 with bonus bets if that first bet loses, but users must wager at least $1,500 to be eligible for the full amount. Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook has gone away from bonus bets, instead offering 20 100% profit boost after users wager $1 or more at the sportsbook.Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook which consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingNetflix's \"Drive to Survive,\" NASCAR's Chicago Street Race and big-budget films like Ford v. Ferrari and F1: The Movie have brought a new audience to racing, and that means more action when it comes to racing betting. Arguably the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Hamilton finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there's season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks which correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track, which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed, and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

Normally, the Sunday after the college football regular season concludes brings with it a plethora of firings. But with a majority of the firings coming throughout various points across the season, this year prominent schools are setting the college football world on fire with notable hiring announcements.  Then, of course, there's the Lane Kiffin saga, which saw the Ole Miss coach leave a team bound for the College Football Playoff to take over at LSU after the Tigers fired Brian Kelly during the season.  \nIt's turned into one of the craziest college football coaching carousel cycles we have seen in recent memory, and CBS Sports is tracking every move in the 2025-26 cycle and grading each hire below.

One day after the season concluded, Kiffin chose LSU, leaving the playoff-bound Rebels searching for a coach. Ole Miss quickly responded by hiring Golding, a former Nick Saban assistant who has led the Rebels' defense since 2023. Golding should help stabilize a program that could find itself on shaky ground as Kiffin moves to poach assistants and potentially players for his new operation in Baton Rouge.

His replacement will likely have Power Four experience. Jon Sumrall has been a head coach for four years, and in each season he has led programs to a conference championship game. The Tulane head coach has never won less than nine games in his career. Sumrall is one of the more intense and passionate coaches in the country and will be a shark in the transfer portal.

    "body": "\n        LANDOVER, Md. -- Sunday night marked Sean Payton's 305th game, including playoffs, as an NFL head coach. It also marked a first. When Talanoa Hufanga broke up a fourth-down pass in overtime, Payton removed the communication pack that allows him to talk to his quarterback from his pocket, another heart-pounding win seemingly secured.But there was a flag. Hufanga had arrived early trying to defend Zach Ertz. Payton, for the first time in his storied career, had to put the device back in his pocket. The drive continued.The Broncos were destined to do battle again until the bitter -- or, for many times for Denver this year, beautiful -- end.On and on it went. Marcus Mariota found Terry McLaurin for a fourth-down touchdown, and suddenly, the Commanders were within one point and going for two.\nMariota dropped back. Jeremy McNichols ran wide open into the flat. The ball never got there: Nik Bonitto, flying in unblocked on a blitz, tipped the pass away. The Broncos had held on for ninth straight win, seven of which have been decided by four points or fewer, all of which they've trailed at some point. It's the longest winning streak in which a team has trailed in every game in NFL history.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Week 13 winners and losers: Bryce Young bounces back for Panthers; slumping Colts stumble again\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"You do begin to believe it's gonna happen,\" coach Sean Payton said. \"But there can't be that false belief. I mean, there has to be that preparation and corrections so that the next week is better.\"\nMoments earlier, Bo Nix had done it again, leading another game-winning drive. As the Broncos barrel toward their first AFC West title in a decade, they're doing so following in the image of their quarterback: some ups, some downs, a lot of moxie and even more wins. At 10-2, Denver is off to its best 12-game start since 2015, when it won the Super Bowl, and is currently the No. 1 seed in the AFC.\nSunday night, Nix made the plays that keep both his own coach and opposing defensive coordinators up at night. The second-year quarterback finished 29 for 45 for 321 yards, one touchdown and one interception. The journey to get those numbers was a winding one.The touchdown could lead any Week 13 highlight reel. The second-year quarterback stepped up in the pocket, and with Preston Smith pulling him down by his right leg and Javon Kinlaw bearing down on his left, delivered an 11-yard strike to Courtland Sutton.\n\"From my perspective, it kind of feels like you're floating for a second,\" Nix said. \"... In a game like that, we literally talked about game of inches, but it really is, comes down to an inch or two every once in a while.\"\nVarious teammates lauded it as \"incredible\" and \"amazing\" and \"really impressive.\" Left tackle Garett Bolles couldn't even choose an expletive.\"Bo, man, shit damn. I mean, he was just slinging the ball.\"The miscues could make any lowlight reel. Early in the fourth quarter, Nix threw a perfect pass ... if it had been intended for Washington linebacker Bobby Wagner, who made an easy interception to set the hosts up in scoring range.That play epitomized a fourth quarter -- normally the quarter Nix and his team dominate -- in which he averaged just 2.9 yards per pass and the Broncos' offensive drives resulted in an interception and three punts. Washington took advantage and forced overtime.\nAnd then the roller coaster had another turn: Nix leading a five-play, 76-yard breeze of a touchdown drive, with Nix going 4 for 4 for 71 yards.\"He just has a dog mentality, man,\" Bolles said. \"No moment or situation fazes the kid. He just has some serious swag. When it's time to score, it's time to score, and he does his thing. It's like he gets some Hulk juice at halftime or something and just turns green or something. I don't know what it is. It's crazy. I love him.\"\"When it's time to score, it's time to score,\" is perhaps the best way to explain Nix's exploits in key situations. He now has an NFL-high six game-winning drives this season.\nBo Nix EPA per play this season by quarterRankFirst quarter-0.2328thSecond quarter0.1211thThird quarter-0.1826thFourth quarter/OT0.207thHe's somehow a poised Hulk -- if one ever existed -- in the huddle.\"Bo is cool, calm and collected,\" Harvey said. \"He's never under pressure. He's calm, and I'm just grateful to have him as my quarterback.\"Harvey, taking on a larger role since J.K. Dobbins' foot injury, scored two touchdowns, including the game-winner. Though the yardage total -- 35 yards on 13 carries -- underscores a ground attack that has struggled since Dobbins' injury, Nix pointed to Harvey's contributions on the game-winning drive.\"R.J. had a great first catch to get it going, he had a great pickup on the next play, block pickup, and then he gets the ball in the end zone, and it is pretty impressive,\" Nix said. \"Really good drive for a rookie. He had no back down in his face and looked really confident, looked really good.\"It was a nice change for a team has often leaned on its defense to pull out close ones.\"They bailed us out of so many games the last couple weeks, and it was our time to do what we needed to do to score and put the defense in a great situation,\" Bolles said.It's also indicative of a team that keeps finding different ways and different heroes. Bonitto and Harvey this week. Ja'Quan McMillian -- who sacked Patrick Mahomes twice and picked him off once -- in a key win over the Chiefs in Week 11. Wil Lutz several times; when you're in so many close games, you'd better have a good kicker.\"It's been the special teams, it's been offense, it's been defense,\" linebacker Alex Singleton said. \"We're able to hang our hat in each room. Playing a complete game would be nice for four quarters, but that's not how this league works, so to just continue to find ways to win is important.\"Nix remains at the center of it all, though, and he holds the keys to the Broncos' potential playoff run, one that has long eluded the franchise. Denver hasn't won a playoff game since Super Bowl 50 nearly a decade ago.So all the numbers of new expectations -- every 10-2 Broncos team has made the Super Bowl, for example -- of close wins, of game-winning drives?\"They're just a stat,\" Nix said. \"They have nothing to do with the football game. They can't grow legs and go out there and score touchdowns for you.\" ... This is not where we wanted to be. We didn't want to be 10-2. We didn't want to get to December and be 10-2. Our goal was to make a deep playoff run, and we're clearly not there yet. We haven't even had time to get there yet. So we're going to continue to battle, continue to fight.\"There are peripherals that belie a 10-2 team, underlying issues that could come into play. Nix's inconsistency is one. Living in the tiniest of margins is not for the faint of heart. Then again, neither is the NFL.\"Pick a Super Bowl team -- and I say that respectfully -- and then go look at that season,\" Payton said. \"I mean, look at it honestly. ... You begin to build some momentum. Yeah, there's some things you want to clean up, but just take a peek at any one of them. Every once in a while you get one of those teams that just rolls right through it all, but this is a tough league.\"Again, it will come back to Nix. Denver's outstanding defense will keep it in almost any game; Denver is 4-1 this season when scoring 20 points or fewer. The rest of the NFL, for what it's worth, is 26-124. Nix has has mystifying stretches of poor play, moments as low as his highs are high.Whether it's unsustainable smoke and mirrors -- fittingly, the Broncos had a smoke machine going in the locker room to celebrate the win -- or an ability to get the only outcome that matters will be determined when the stakes are raised in the weeks to come.\"We don't escape,\" Payton said. \"We won.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Even on a holiday weekend, the Hot Stove remained turned on, and while many of the biggest names on the market remain unsigned, we've seen a few high-profile exceptions lately. So, before we get to the heart of today's newsletter, here's a quick rundown of the major moves from the past week:Ryan Helsley signs with the Orioles: Scott White says you should expect to draft Helsley in the 12-15 range among relievers in 2026 now that it looks like he'll be closing once again.Dylan Cease signs with the Blue Jays: I covered this one, noting that while Cease can be a frustrating pitcher who will wreck your ratios, he's also one of the most reliable sources of volume and is capable of brilliance, making his SP20 price in early drafts worth chasing. Sonny Gray traded to the Red Sox: Is this the big upgrade to the Red Sox rotation we were promised? It's certainly an upgrade, though one that carries some downside risk given the cracks that are starting to show up as Gray reaches his late 30s. Hopefully, the next few weeks will see a bunch more signings, and we won't go into the new year with players unsigned and Spring Training looming. But we can't control that. Here's what I can control: My Breakout picks for 2026. And that's what we're focusing on in the rest of today's newsletter. And, unlike last week's sleeper picks, price doesn't matter here. I mean, sure, I'd love to get any of the following 10 players at a Draft Day discount. But the whole point of this specific exercise is that, if I'm right about these guys, they'll be discounts at pretty much any price. Not all of them have superstar upside, but most of them do; the ones that don't could still be significant difference-makers in Fantasy if all goes right. Here's what it would look like: \nWay-Too-Early 2026 BreakoutsChase Burns, SP, RedsBurns was the No. 2 pick in the 2024 MLB draft, and by the time he made his debut this summer, he was arguably the top pitching prospect in baseball. His 4.57 ERA in his first taste of the majors won't get your heart racing, but if you look under the hood, there's so much to be excited about here. Most notably, he had a five-game stretch where he struck out 10 batters in four of them, and that seems like a pretty good signal in and of itself – only eight pitchers had more double-digit strikeout starts than Burns all season, and they're pretty much all aces for Fantasy. \nBurns isn't there yet, but he has the ace tool kit, and, frankly, it looks a lot like his teammate, Hunter Greene's – big fastball, absurdly dominant slider, and just enough command to make it all work. Greene will be a top-15 starter despite significant injury question marks, and while he definitely should go ahead of Burns in drafts, there's a decent chance we get to May, and we view the two as more or less the same guy. There are some injury and innings limitation concerns here.Ben Rice, C, YankeesRice is going to be one of the most popular breakout picks in Fantasy in 2026, and for good reason. His exact role for 2026 hasn't been revealed just yet, but we know he's catcher eligible, and we know he's probably going to play every day somewhere. If it's not actually at catcher, that's fine for us – we'll take a catcher-eligible hitter who doesn't actually have to face the rigors and risks of donning the tools of ignorance regularly. And Rice might not just be a good hitter for a catcher; he might be an elite hitter even by the standards of first base.His .255/.337/.499 line with 26 homers was good for any position, but there's reason to believe he could be even better. His .358 wOBA was accompanied by a .395 expected mark, and there really isn't anything in his profile that suggests he should be a perennial underperformer. He has a good approach at the plate, makes plenty of contact, and hits the ball in the air to the pull side (25.2% pulled-air rate) with authority (93.3 mph average exit velocity). The skills are all here for Rice to make a big leap, especially since he should be in line for more consistent playing time after he sat against some lefties earlier in the season. You might get top-three first baseman production from your catcher spot, and that could be a huge edge on the competition. \nNolan McLean, SP, MetsMcLean has the Logan Webb Starter Kit. He starts with a worm-killing sinker and pairs it with multiple high-spin breaking balls that can generate whiffs, plus a very good four-seamer he typically saves for two-strike counts. It's all very Logan Webb, and I think that's a decent place to set expectations for McLean. He probably won't be the same kind of volume as Webb, though the fact that he threw 161.2 innings last season means we likely won't see any real limitations on his workload in 2026, at least.The real question is how much better McLean can be than Webb. That's asking a lot, but hey, this is a guy who just put up a 2.06 ERA and 3.56 xERA in his first taste of the majors – and who wasn't even a full-time pitcher until 2024. Expecting another step forward isn't unreasonable, in other words, and the \"Logan Webb Starter Kit\" isn't that different from the \"Zack Wheeler Starter Kit\". McLean has the arsenal depth, if not necessarily the elite results across the arsenal. Yet. He's going to be a popular breakout candidate precisely because of that combination of a high floor and the potential for another step forward. Jackson Merrill, OF, PadresThe shine is off the rose for Merrill, whose price is likely to drop between 40 and 50 picks on average from last season. I'll be buying the dip with a guy who doesn't even turn 23 until next April and has been a well-above-average hitter through his age 21 and 22 seasons. A guy who, even in a disappointing season where he battled injuries, showed excellent barrel control and hit the ball hard all over the field. \nI'll also point out that Merrill was hitting .304/.349/.474 in mid-June when he suffered a concussion. He was cleared to play again just over a week later, but the issues stemming from concussions can linger a lot longer than the official diagnosis lasts. That Merrill bounced back with a huge September makes me even more confident in projecting the bounce-back season from him, and I would hope we'll see more activity on the basepaths from him after he stole just one base in 2025 (while dealing with hamstring and ankle injuries). Ultimately, it's a bet on an elite talent who still showed high-end skills and flashed high-end production. Even if he isn't much of a base stealer moving forward, I still think he could be a high-end four-category contributor; if the steals come back, he could still be a first-rounder. Samuel Basallo, C, OriolesThe case here is similar to the one for Rice. Basallo is, of course, much less proven at the MLB level, and there are more questions about his playing time, but the bet is the same: In a best-case scenario, we're talking about a potential difference-making first baseman with catcher eligibility. Basallo made his debut shortly after his 21st birthday and, to be fair, looked overwhelmed, hitting just .165/.229/.330. So we have to look to his minor-league track record for hope here, and there's a lot to be hopeful about. Despite being 20 for most of the season, Basallo's 151 wRC+ at Triple-A was the third-best for any hitter in the International League, and he did that while showing both excellent plate discipline (14% walk rate, 24% strikeout rate) and huge power (94.2 mph average exit velocity, 57% hard-hit rate). The tools are all here for Basallo to be an absolute difference maker at catcher. Eury Perez, SP, MarlinsIf all you knew about Eury Perez is that he made the majors as a 20-year-old and threw 90 innings, you'd have every reason to believe he's going to become one of the best pitchers in baseball. Since 2001, here's the full list of pitchers who got to at least 90 innings as a 20-year-old:\nEury Perez (2023)Jose Fernandez (2013)Jordan Lyles (2011)Madison Bumgarner (2010)Rick Porcello (2009)Clayton Kershaw (2008)Felix Hernandez (2006)Zack Greinke (2004)Jeremy Bonderman (2003)Oliver Perez (2002)CC Sabathia (2001)That's not quite a list of the best pitchers of the past 25 years – what the heck is Jordan Lyles doing there? – but it's not far off. And then you look into Perez himself closely, and it's pretty clear this guy isn't the next Jordan Lyles. He's put up a 28.1% strikeout rate with an average walk rate and comes after hitters with an excellent fastball and a full complement of breaking balls. He's still trying to find the right mixture of secondaries, but the pieces are clearly here, and the numbers are even more impressive when you remember his age and that more than half his MLB innings have come after recovering from Tommy John surgery. Perez won't even be 23 years old on Opening Day and might be poised to emerge as one of the very best pitchers in baseball as soon as this season. Jackson Holliday, 2B, OriolesThis is just another opportunity to bet on a preternaturally young, gifted player who hasn't quite put it together. Maybe Holliday never will. If you believe in the underlying stats on BaseballSavant.com as being relatively fixed, they aren't giving us a ton of reason to be optimistic – his .312 expected wOBA was right in line with his actual .304 mark, and Holliday hasn't really shown either the high-end exit velocities or exceptional plate discipline you're looking for, settling in around average in terms of max exit velocity and in the quality of his swing decisions. As a 21-year-old. I know I'm harping on this a lot with Merrill and Perez, too, but it's just worth keeping in mind that players this young deserve to be graded on a scale. Holliday was holding his own in the majors last season while being just eight months older than Kevin McGonigle and 15 months younger than JJ Wetherholt, two top prospects who have yet to actually make their MLB debuts. So, yeah, there's some blind faith involved in planting a flag with Holliday. But if he's capable of a 17-homer, 17-steal season while still developing, it doesn't take much for this profile to really take off. \nMichael Harris, OF, BravesMichael Harris is good. I know this might be a controversial statement for some of you, but I stand by it. Oh, let's be clear: He's incredibly frustrating, and probably always will be given his wildly aggressive swing decisions. When you swing at everything, you'll make contact with pitches you're probably better off leaving alone, and I think that explains why he's been so frustrating over the years. And I don't expect that to change in 2026. But the thing is, even if all he is is the 2025 version of himself, that's a pretty terrific Fantasy player – the .249 average hurts, but he went 20-20 with 86 RBI! And the underlying numbers suggest he left a lot on the table, with his .289 wOBA paling in comparison to his .315 mark – and that .315 mark was the worst of his career, a compelling reason to think a bounceback is in store. A 20-20 floor with room to grow from a 25-year-old with plus athleticism and bat speed is a profile worth betting on when it only costs around the 100th pick. Kyle Bradish, SP, OriolesBradish might just be one of the best pitchers in baseball. We don't have a ton of evidence to support that claim, but here's what he's done in his past 14 starts since the start of the 2024 season: 2.65 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, 2.48 FIP, 34.6% strikeout rate, 8.6% walk rate.\nHe had some trouble keeping the ball on the ground after he returned from Tommy John surgery last season, but the swing-and-miss stuff was totally intact, including a pretty massive 25% strikeout rate with his sinker of all pitches. You should rank him more conservatively than his recent skills indicate, given the small sample size we're working with, but there's just a ton to get excited about here, even if the Orioles might have to limit his workload at certain points. Bradish's ceiling is well within the top 12, while his current price is barely inside the top 30 at SP. Cade Smith, RP, GuardiansSmith might just be one of the best relievers in baseball. Because he's a reliever, we're obviously dealing with inherently tiny sample sizes, but in his case, it's 149 innings with a 2.42 ERA and 35.1% strikeout rate in his MLB career. That ERA is good for 11th among all pitchers who have thrown at least 100 innings over the past two seasons, and his FIP is even better. Than anyone. At 1.67, he has the best FIP in baseball over the past two seasons, with more than a half-run gap between him and No. 2, Mason Miller. And he's pitching for a Guardians team that has produced 40-plus saves pretty much every season – last season, Smith and Emmanuel Clase combined for 40, and Clase had averaged 44.3 from 2022 through 2024. Smith might just fill the Emmanuel Clase-shaped hole in the RP rankings perfectly. \n            ",

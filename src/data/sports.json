However, there is not much that separates favorites versus underdogs when it comes to making NFL picks.

Brady Kannon, who is 26-9-2 (+1590) over his last 37 NFL ATS picks, is backing the Chargers (+3.5) to cover versus New England on Sunday night.\"Patriots' schedule has been a sore spot for their supporters all season but there is no denying, they played hardly any good teams. They were 2-2 vs playoff teams, splitting with the Bills and also splitting with the Panthers and Steelers, the two worst teams in the tournament. Chargers were 3-2 vs playoff teams (not counting Week 18) and had to face Denver, Philly, Steelers, Jaguars, and Texans. LAC also has the better point differential vs common opponents. They have an excellent formula for playoff football: a rushing attack, a pass rush, and an excellent defense. When I crunch my numbers, I come up with LAC as a 1-point favorite. I'll gladly take anything greater than a field goal and they just might win outright.\" Kannon's Wild Card NFL picks can be found here.Bet the Chargers to cover at DraftKings:\nSteelers vs. Texans Monday night picks Something has to give on NFL Wild Card Monday as the Steelers have lost six straight postseason games, while the Texans are 0-6, all-time, in road playoff games. Both of these squads enter their Monday night meeting with nine against-the-spread wins this season as they will meet in a playoff game for the first time ever. R.J. White, who is 37-20-1 (+1455) over his last 58 ATS picks in Steelers games, is backing Pittsburgh (+3.5) to cover.\"The Steelers are in the playoffs by the skin of their teeth, and the market is treating them as DOA. But I'm not underrating a team that scored 25+ points in nine of its last 12 games, even managing it in the finale without DK Metcalf. He's back, as is T.J. Watt, and when you throw in Mike Tomlin as one of the best coaches in football, the current version of Pittsburgh rates above average for me. The Texans' elite defense gave up 30 points to Riley Leonard and the offense has been inconsistent, getting shut down in Week 16 by the Raiders of all teams. Pittsburgh is live for the win here at home against an indoors team playing in a tough road environment.\" See more Texans vs. Steelers picks here.Pick Pittsburgh to cover at DraftKings:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Peach Bowl will see Big Ten teams squaring off on Friday as the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers face the No. 5 Oregon Ducks. This 2026 College Football Playoff semifinal contest is a rematch of a mid-October game in which the Hoosiers prevailed on the road, 30-20. That remains the only loss for the 13-1 Ducks, who are coming off a dominant 23-0 shutout win over Texas Tech. As for the 14-0 Hoosiers, they are coming off a 38-3 blowout of Alabama and have aspirations of becoming the first 16-0 team in college football history.Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. Indiana odds per SportsLine consensus. The over/under for total points is 48.5, having risen 2 points since opening at 46.5.

The Ducks have also covered at at 75% clip as an underdog since 2023, while IU is just 5-4 ATS over its last nine versus Big Ten teams. On the field, Oregon possesses the better offense both on the ground and through the air. The Ducks average more passing yards than Indiana, with a higher completion percentage, in addition to averaging more rushing yards, as well as more yards per carry. On the other side of the ball, Oregon is coming off a season-high of four takeaways in the win over Texas Tech, and the Ducks had a pick-six of Fernando Mendoza in the first contest. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Indiana can coverNo one can match Indiana's production on both sides of the ball, as it has the No. 2 scoring defense and No. 3 scoring offense, and no other FBS team ranks in the top five of both. The Hoosiers have allowed two touchdowns, total, over their last four games, and they've given up a rushing touchdown in just one of their last nine games. Mendoza leads the nation with both 36 passing touchdowns and with a 184.7 passer rating, and Indiana isn't the type of team that hurts itself. Just one team in all of college football commits fewer penalty yards per game, while just two teams in the country commit fewer turnovers per game.

    "body": "\n        U.S. women's national team coach Emma Hayes has named her first squad for 2026, selecting a 26-player roster for the annual winter camps and upcoming matches against Paraguay (Jan. 24) and Chile (Jan. 27).With the January camp falling outside an official FIFA window, the roster is mainly composed of players representing the NWSL and having less senior team experience. The lone exception is forward Trinity Rodman, who is currently unattached to a club as she remains in contract negotiations, and she returns to USWNT camps for the first time since April 2025. Rodman leads the roster in caps (47) and goals (11), and the remaining members of the roster have a combined 17 international goals. \"Once again, our roster presents opportunity for the coaching staff to evaluate players and for some NWSL players we haven't seen as much in the national team environment, as well as for some first-time call-ups, to show they can contribute in 2026, 2027, or beyond,\" said Hayes. \"We're looking forward to having a few more training days than usual in this camp, as well as getting two matches to see this part of the player pool in game action and hopefully add even more depth and options for our 2026 SheBelieves Cup roster.\"\nThe annual camp is always a reset. A chance for a fresh start and to put those soccer New Year's resolutions to the test. With it also come changes and shifts.Last year's January camp was a launching pad for Hayes and her staff to implement the first \"futures camp\" of her coaching era, and it reinvigorated the U23 program. The once-dormant program was a frequent component throughout 2025, often holding concurrent camps alongside the senior team and even participating in international windows against other U23 sides. Hayes utilized the program to broaden the depth chart and pull current talents into the senior team.This year, the January camp will include friendlies against Paraguay and Chile, and it will provide a chance to players battling for spots on the depth chart to showcase their skills in a crucial World Cup qualifying year. \nIn 30 matches coached with the national team, Hayes has given 27 players their first senior caps and provided 50 different starts to players across the roster pool. No other USWNT manager has named more than 36 different players in their first 30 games as head coach.Those numbers could increase with four additional first-time call-ups to the roster in forwards Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC) and Reilyn Turner (Portland Thorns FC), and midfielders Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage) and Sally Menti (Seattle Reign FC). Jackson and Dahlien were constant features in all five U23 events during 2025 after featuring in the January 2025 futures camps, while Menti was involved in two U23 camps last year. With the 2026 Concacaf W Championship (World Cup qualifiers) set for November, January's 11-day camp is the start towards the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup in Brazil.\nUSWNT January camp rosterListed by position (Club; Caps/Goals)Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 6), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Jordan Silkowitz (Bay FC; 0)Defenders (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 5/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 9/1), Izzy Rodriguez (Kansas City Current; 1/1), Tara Rudd (Washington Spirit; 9/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 7/0), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC; 4/0), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave FC; 2/0), Kate Wiesner (Washington Spirit; 2/0)Midfielders (8): Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit; 5/0), Hal Hershfelt (Washington Spirit; 3/0), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 11/1), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; 0/0), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current; 4/0), Sally Menti (Seattle Reign FC; 0/0), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC; 2/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 11/5)\nForwards (7): Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC; 0/0), Jameese Joseph (Chicago Stars FC; 1/0), Trinity Rodman (Unattached; 47/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 15/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville FC; 12/4), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 13/4), Reilyn Turner (Portland Thorns FC; 0/0)\n            ",

Meanwhile, Green Bay is riding a four-game losing streak and is a 1.5-point favorite against the Bears on Saturday night, per the latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds.Those two split their regular season matchups as they'll tangle in the postseason for just the third time ever.

Head here to see every pick. Top Wild Card Weekend NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Wild Card Weekend NFL picks is the Steelers (+3, 39.5) covering at Houston on Monday night at 8 p.m. ET. These teams have the same 9-8 spread record, but Pittsburgh is 4-1 ATS over its last five, while Houston has failed to cover in two of its last three. While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss. The Steelers are forecasted to cover over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Wild Card NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule and just revealed three teams projected to outright win over 60% of the time, potentially giving you a huge payday.

L.A. is also facing a team with an 8-9 record, and teams with losing records are 2-6 in the playoffs all-time. The Rams have the league's best offense, ranking first in points, total yards and yards per play, and it's a unit that doesn't hurt itself as no one has committed fewer penalties. Matthew Stafford has two touchdowns and no interceptions in each of his last three postseason starts, and the MVP contender is riding a seven-game playoff streak with multiple touchdown passes. This season, Stafford has more TD passes (46) than Carolina has total touchdowns (35) as the Panthers rank 27th in both points scored and total yards. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Panthers can coverIt was just six weeks ago that Carolina upset the Rams as double-digit underdogs, forcing Stafford into three turnovers. The Panthers have 10 ATS wins as an underdog this year, the most in the NFL, and they also have a one-day rest advantage after playing last Saturday. The Rams have lost three of their last four road games, and the Panthers are decidedly more potent on offense at Bank of America Stadium. Five of their six highest point totals this year have come at home, and the most points they scored all year came versus Los Angeles in Week 13. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Panthers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Panthers vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Rams vs. Panthers, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

It has allowed seven total touchdowns over its last six games, which were all wins, and the team also has three times as many takeaways (12) as giveaways (four) during this stretch. Additionally, Miami can keep Ole Miss' explosive offense on the sideline by attacking the Rebels' defense on the ground and eating up the clock. Just two SEC teams allow more yards per rush (4.2) than Ole Miss, which has allowed an average of 167 rushing yards over its last three games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Ole Miss picksFornelli has analyzied Ole Miss vs. Miami and is leaning Under on the total.

Despite not starting this season, Chambliss is sixth in the nation in passing yards (3,660) with 21 touchdowns and three interceptions, playing significant snaps in 12 games this season. Although Miami has made the semifinals largely on the back of its defense, Carson Beck is one of the most experienced quarterbacks in college football, and Miami averaged 30.6 ppg this season. After the way Chambliss dominated a Georgia defense that ranks 12th in the nation in scoring, the model expects Ole Miss to find ways to score again on a stout Miami defense.

They return to Utah off a four-game road trip, and the Jazz are 4-2 against the spread over their last six home games. Dallas is 14-23 this season, including 2-4 over its last six games.

    "body": "\n        Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles told the Tampa Bay Times that he would return for his fifth season, but changes were coming to his staff. Those changes began Thursday, when the Bucs fired offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard, per CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. The Buccaneers also parted ways with quarterbacks coach Thad Lews, per ESPN. He had been Baker Mayfield's quarterbacks coach since arriving in Tampa. Grizzard just wrapped up his first year as offensive coordinator, and replaced Liam Coen after he accepted the Jacksonville Jaguars job. Previously, Grizzard served as Tampa Bay's pass game coordinator for one year after coming over from the Miami Dolphins. This season, the Buccaneers offense finished ranked No. 21 in the NFL, averaging 320.4 total yards per game, and tied for 17th in points per game (22.4). The Bucs began the season 6-2, but dropped seven of their final nine games en route to an 8-9 finish. This year marks the first time the Bucs missed the postseason since 2019.The Buccaneers now launch their fourth offensive coordinator search in as many years. Byron Leftwich served in the role from 2019-22, followed by Dave Canales in 2023, Coen in 2024 and then Grizzard.\nFurthermore, Mayfield will experience more turnover at offensive coordinator. It's something he's become all too familiar with since being selected No. 1 overall by the Cleveland Browns in the 2018 NFL Draft. Baker Mayfield's offensive coordinatorsYearOffensive coordinator2018Todd Haley and Freddie Kitchens2019Todd Monken2020Alex Van Pelt2021Alex Van Pelt2022Ben McAdoo, Liam Coen2023Dave Canales2024Liam Coen2024Josh Grizzard2026???Los Angeles Rams passing game specialist Nathan Scheelhaase, Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken and Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson are some names to watch for the position, NFL Media reports.\nAs the Buccaneers flailed down the stretch, it became clear they regressed on both sides of the ball. That includes the play of Mayfield. The two-time Pro Bowler appeared to be a legitimate MVP candidate through the first six weeks of the season, before the offense began to go awry. Now, Tampa Bay is searching for someone who can get the most out of the star signal-caller. First six gamesLast 11 gamesW-L5-13-8Completion percentage66.2%61.5%Passing yards per game256.5195.8TD-INT12-114-10\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing, and with the new year having come and gone we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. With plenty of big-name free agents and trade candidates still on the board even at this increasingly late hour, there's a daily supply of rumors and reporting regarding them. Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's roundup just below. Three possible frontrunners for Tucker\nKyle Tucker is our top-ranked free agent of the offseason and it's possible his thus far quiet market is starting to make a bit of noise. Specifically, the Dodgers, Blue Jays, and Mets have emerged as three leading options for Tucker, the Athletic reports. As Will Sammon writes: \"The Mets' preference is to offer a shorter contract length (probably less than four years) with a high annual average value. League sources expect the Blue Jays to go longer. Assuming they'll act aggressively and given their history of swooping in and making deals with stars, the Dodgers loom as a contender.\"Speaking of a short-term, high-AAV deal for Tucker, our Mike Asixa recently explored what that might look like. The Blue Jays have been among the most aggressive of teams this offseason coming off their pennant-winning campaign in 2025, and the Dodgers of course remain the standard in terms of ownership's commitment to building a championship roster. As for the Mets, owner Steve Cohen has vast resources and they're in need of a headline-grabbing addition after the free-agent losses of Pete Alonso and Edwin Díaz. \nAs for Tucker, he's going into his age-29 season in 2026 and he boasts a career OPS+ of 139 and a WAR of 27.3 across parts of eight MLB seasons. His combination of power, plate discipline, defense, and base-running make him a star. Rockies ink LorenzenThe Rockies and right-hander Michael Lorenzen have agreed to a one-year, $8 million free agent contract with a $9 million club option for 2027, ESPN reports.\nLorenzen, 34, is coming off a 2025 season for the Royals in which he pitched to a 4.64 ERA and a 4.59 FIP in 26 starts and one relief appearance. For his career, the one-time All-Star has an ERA+ of 103 and a WAR of 10.6 in 11 major league seasons. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        If you hate the Trae Young trade for the Washington Wizards, I get it. Young is an awful defender, he's shot the ball terribly this season and the Atlanta Hawks decided they were better without him. The young Wizards have been better lately, too, and Young, a four-time All-Star, is not the kind of player who will seamlessly slide into their offensive system. He is the system, essentially. You don't trade for him unless you're willing to give him the ball and let him go to work.Given how the Wizards are constructed, though, and what they gave up to get him, this is not a reckless decision. It's not as if they sent Atlanta multiple first-round picks in a desperate attempt to accelerate their rebuild. In fact, there were no picks involved at all. And since they don't have a primary playmaker on their roster, Young is not exactly getting in anybody's way.The main argument in favor of this deal is straightforward: For the vast majority of his career, Young has been an efficient offense unto himself. His presence will naturally slot Washington's young players into more suitable roles. He led the league in assists last season, and the Wizards, who rank No. 27 on offense, can benefit from someone creating high-quality looks. As soon as he gets on the court, he'll draw more defensive attention than anybody else on the roster. \n        \n            \n                Trae Young trade grades: Hawks get 'B+' for sending former face of their franchise to Wizards\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOpponents will blitz Young's pick-and-rolls with Alex Sarr, and he'll find Sarr in the pocket, where the 20-year-old big man is getting more and more dangerous. He'll find Bilal Coulibaly cutting to the rim and allow Kyshawn George and Tre Johnson to attack with an advantage rather than having to initiate against a set defense. Above all, he will give Washington structure. The front office is betting on him helping the Wiz kids develop by putting them in a healthier offensive environment.\nIf this works as well as it hopes, Washington will look brilliant not just for this move, but the ones that led to it. In the summer of 2023, after acquiring Chris Paul in the Bradley Beal trade, the Wizards sent Paul to the Golden State Warriors in a deal that returned Jordan Poole. Last offseason, they swapped Poole for CJ McCollum. On Wednesday, they turned McCollum's expiring contract into Young. No one could have predicted this series of transactions when the first one went down.Washington is counting on Young returning to form as a shooter. He has shot just 12 for 46 (26.1%) on pull-up 3s this season, a small sample that would be less concerning if he hadn't shot just 33.6% on pull-up 3s last season. Ideally, he'll be motivated to show he can be the type of leader this team needs, too, after seeing his value dwindle to the point that the Hawks more or less gave him away.This is not to say that the Wizards got him for free. McCollum has been flat-out better than Young this season, and Corey Kispert is a useful role player on a relatively cheap, long-term contract. It is rare to get an offensive engine at anything close to this price, though, and, as long as they don't sign Young to an extension right away, there's little downside here. Washington is only committed to him through next season, assuming he picks up his $49 million player option. If this experiment doesn't work, they can move on quickly, whether that means trading him or letting him walk. They will still have plenty of cap flexibility this coming summer, and the absence of Kispert means more minutes for their young wings.\n\n        \n            \n                Winners and losers of Trae Young trade: How this deal hurts Ja Morant and LaMelo Ball -- and helps the Knicks\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nI have nothing nice to say about what this move means for the Wizards' No. 29-ranked defense, except that getting even worse on that end should ensure that they keep their top-eight-protected first-round pick. But while small, defensively deficient guards are not en vogue right now, that doesn't mean there's no place for players like Young anymore. He may have worn out his welcome in Atlanta, but for Washington, a team without an organizing principle, he might be a breath of fresh air. And while you don't have to love that the Wizards have bought in on the Young experience, you must admit they bought low.\n            ",

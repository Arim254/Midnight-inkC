Brown was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Month in January, and he is averaging 29.5 points per game this season. The Celtics cruised to blowout wins over the Kings and Bucks in their previous two games, while the Rockets have failed to cover the spread in four of their last five games.

They cruised to a 128-92 win over Orlando on Tuesday, holding the Magic to 38.2% shooting overall. The Spurs have only covered the spread twice in their last seven games against Western Conference opponents, and the model has Oklahoma City covering 60% of the time on Wednesday night. Back the Thunder at bet365 here:Ty Jerome Over 20.5 points + assists (-110)\"The Grizzlies traded Jaren Jackson Jr. to the Jazz on Tuesday. The main haul in the trade was draft picks, so they are going to have a void in the scoring department moving forward,\" SportsLine expert Mike Barner said. \"The players they did acquire might not be available yet, which would leave the Grizzlies even more shorthanded. Although Ty Jerome has played limited minutes since returning from injury, he combined for at least 26 points and assists in both games. He could get a few extra minutes against a Kings team that has the third-worst defensive rating in the league, so this over is appealing.\" Back Jerome at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA betting picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Wednesday.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Oklahoma State picked up a desperately needed marquee victory by upsetting No. 16 BYU 99-92 on Wednesday night, despite 36 points from Cougars star freshman AJ Dybantsa. The win is the first Quad 1 victory for the Cowboys (16-6, 4-5 Big 12), who travel to face No. 1 Arizona on Saturday.The outcome prompted a court-storming at Gallagher-Iba Arena as the Cowboys closed out a win that could prove monumental come Selection Sunday.Oklahoma State led by as much as 15 in the first half before Dybantsa keyed a furious rally to send the teams into halftime tied at 41. BYU kept the surge going in the second half, building a five-point lead in the opening minutes before the Cowboys finally regained their footing. Anthony Roy led the charge for Oklahoma State with 30 points, as the senior guard built on a 26-point performance from Saturday's win at Utah with another big showing. The Green Bay transfer keyed a 10-3 run late in the second half as Oklahoma State kept the Cougars at arm's length down the stretch.\nDybantsa finished 13 of 20 from the floor for BYU (17-5, 5-4), but his fourth 30+ point game of the season couldn't save the Cougars from their fourth loss in five games. BYU committed 16 turnovers, which marked its highest tally since Jan. 7. Oklahoma State capitalized with an 21-8 edge in points off turnovers.Implications for Oklahoma StateOklahoma State entered the day among the \"First Four Out\" in the CBS Sports Bracketology model. Initial projections suggest the Cowboys will move to a No. 11 seed in the next updated bracket after securing their best win to date. While it's technically the Cowboys' first Quad 1 win, it's not their first over a projected NCAA Tournament team. Oklahoma State also owns victories against Texas A&M and UCF, both of whom are on track for at-large bids to the Big Dance. There is a strong likelihood that Oklahoma State will rise into the top 40 nationally in the important Wins Above Bubble (WAB) metric as a result of its victory over BYU.\nFallout for BYUBYU, projected to remain a No. 4 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, is grinding through a difficult portion of schedule after a soft opening to its Big 12 slate and has now dropped four of its past five games. While BYU is 4-5 in Quad 1 and has no losses outside of Quad 1, it doesn't yet have a true marquee victory. Beating No. 8 Houston on Saturday would change that, but BYU will have to snap out of its recent funk to pull that off, particularly on defense. BYU's past three opponents have each shot better than 50% from the floor.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Gavin McKenna, a star forward for the Penn State hockey team who is widely considered the top prospect for the 2026 NHL Draft, is facing a felony charge following an alleged incident at a bar in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night, Onward State reports. According to a court filing, McKenna is awaiting a preliminary hearing after being charged with felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor simple assault, as well as summary counts of harassment and disorderly conduct. The Felony I charge is defined as \"attempts to cause serious bodily injury or causes injury with extreme indifference.\"According to Onward State, McKenna and other members of Penn State's hockey team met at Doggie's Pub with friends and family after Saturday's game against Michigan State at Beaver Stadium before the alleged assault occurred. McKenna is accused of assaulting an individual, who reportedly suffered a broken jaw in the incident.Penn State, in a statement, said it is aware of the charges.\n\"We are aware that charges have been filed; however, as this is an ongoing legal matter, we will not have any further comment,\" the statement said.McKenna, an 18-year-old freshman from Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, has 32 points -- 11 goals and 21 assists -- in 24 games this season for the Nittany Lions. McKenna, touted before his arrival at Penn State as a potential generational prospect, had a goal and had two assists on Saturday. An NCAA rule change allowed junior hockey players from the Ontario Hockey League, Western Hockey League and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League to play Division I hockey. In the past, junior hockey players were considered professionals and therefore weren't allowed to play in the NCAA, but the change allowed a prospect of McKenna's caliber to go through the college recruiting process in the U.S.\nAs a 17-year-old, McKenna put together a sensational season for the Medicine Hat Tigers in the Western Hockey League in 2024-25. He posted 129 points (41 goals, 88 assists) in 56 games while also producing 38 points (nine goals, 29 assists) in 16 playoff games as Medicine Hat won the WHL Championship. McKenna, who recorded a 54-game point streak, ranked second in the WHL in points and fifth in goals while leading the league in assists.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        An offseason of change continues for the Philadelphia Eagles, and the latest departure is perhaps as big as any non-head coach, non-coordinator movement in the NFL. Jeff Stoutland, the Eagles' offensive line coach since 2013, announced Wednesday he is leaving his post after 13 seasons. \"Philadelphia,  I've decided my time coaching with the Eagles has come to an end,\" Stoutland said. \"When I arrived here in 2013, I did not know what I was signing up for. I quickly learned what this city demands. But more importantly, what it gives back.  The past 13 years have been the great privilege of my coaching career. I didn't just work here, I became one of you. Stout out.\"In a statement, the Eagles thanked Stoutland for his \"legendary contributions to the game of football.\"\"It is hard to fathom another coach investing more personally and professionally in their players than Jeff Stoutland,\" the team said. \"Our organization is deeply grateful for Stout's contributions to our team over the last 13 seasons.\"\nStoutland, 63, was one of the bedrocks of the Eagles' organization since his arrival. After winning BCS national championships as Alabama's offensive line coach in 2011 and 2012, Stoutland joined the Eagles as part of Chip Kelly's first staff in Philadelphia. He stayed through two coaching transitions -- Kelly to Doug Pederson and Pederson to Nick Sirianni -- and was part of the Eagles' Super Bowl LII and LIX victories.\n        \n            \n                Eagles hire Sean Mannion as offensive coordinator after down year for Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia offense\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlong the way, Stoutland was arguably the game's best position coach. Since 2012, the Eagles' 27 Pro Bowl selections from offensive linemen are most in the NFL, with Stoutland's development of late-round picks and journeymen being among the many feathers in his cap. Jason Kelce (sixth round, 2011) and Jordan Mailata (seventh round, 2018) are among his biggest successes among the former. Kelce became a seven-time Pro Bowler and six time first-team All-Pro, putting him among the greatest centers in NFL history. Mailata, a left tackle, was a second-team All-Pro in 2024. Mailata, a native of Australia, was a rugby standout who had never played American football before the Eagles drafted him. During \"Sunday Night Football\" player introductions, Mailata has said he attended \"Jeff Stoutland University\" in the spot most players say the college they attended.\nStoutland oversaw the ascension of six-time All-Pro selection Jason Peters, as well as the development and stardom of 2013 No. 4 overall pick Lane Johnson, who has six Pro Bowl selections, two first-team All-Pros and three second-team All-Pros to his name -- all under Stoutland's tutelage. Several other less-heralded linemen, such as guards Brandon Brooks, Evan Mathis and Mekhi Becton, played the best football of their careers when in Philadelphia.Sirianni has credited Stoutland for finding and coaching up the Eagles' \"Tush Push\" as well.Another change in a big offseason for EaglesOn the heels of winning Super Bowl LIX, the Eagles struggled offensively in 2025, and Sirianni removed Kevin Patullo as offensive coordinator after the team's wild card loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Stoutland held the run game coordinator role dating back to the 2018 season, but lost that title during the season, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. \nSince the end of the season, Sirianni has made wholesale changes to his offensive staff. He hired former Green Bay Packers quarterbacks coach Sean Mannion as the team's new offensive coordinator. Only a few years removed from his time as a backup quarterback, the 33-year-old Mannion will be a first-time play caller. That he'll do it without Stoutland is a major loss. Sirianni and Mannion are filling out the rest of the offensive staff and started that process with new pass game coordinator Josh Grizzard, formerly the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offensive coordinator.The changes might not be limited to the offensive side of the ball, as defensive coordinator Vic Fangio has reportedly considered retirement. Additionally, secondary coach Christian Parker took the Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator job.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's been five long years in Golden State, and the Jonathan Kuminga saga is officially over. The Golden State Warriors are reportedly trading Kuminga and Buddy Hield to the Atlanta Hawks for Kristaps Porziņģis. This deal seemingly puts an end to Golden State's pursuit of Giannis Antetokounmpo, according to Charania. Reports had indicated that the Warriors hoped not to include Jimmy Butler's max contract in a deal, which would have meant using contracts like Kuminga's, Hield's and Draymond Green's to make a deal. With this deal now made and the Bucks having turned down Golden State's picks-based offer, the Warriors moved on to another target.The Hawks, meanwhile, continue their retool by trading away their second former All-Star of the season. With Trae Young gone as well, the Hawks no longer have a single fully guaranteed contract on their books for next season belonging to a player above the age of 27. The youth movement is fully on, so let's grade this deal for both sides.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Golden State Warriors: BAfter five years of inconsistent playing time in a system that he didn't fit within, Kuminga no longer held meaningful trade value. There were reports over the summer that Sacramento was willing to give up a lottery-protected first-round pick for him, but any hope of a deal there seemingly passed when the Kings landed De'Andre Hunter. He had essentially become little more than matching salary, and with the odds of an Antetokounmpo deal seeming low, the Warriors moved on.\nNow, if this were a healthy Porziņģis, Golden State would get an A+. The Warriors have spent years looking for this sort of player. Part of the motivation of signing Al Horford this offseason was the need to pair Draymond Green with a center who can shoot. Golden State has never really had a gigantic, stationary rim-protector before, and his size near the rim gives them a dimension they've largely lacked as well.Of course, this is not a healthy Porziņģis. Even if this was the standard, \"misses games due to injury, but is great when he plays\" Porziņģis the Warriors would come away as clear winners, Instead, he's struggled with POTS, an autoimmune disorder with a number of troubling symptoms including rapid heart rate, dizziness and lethargy. Porziņģis was spectacular in his first 11 games in October and November, averaging over 18 points and posting spectacular on-off splits. He's played six times since, mostly ineffectively. It is not clear when or if he will ever be able to play at 100% again, and that doesn't even factor in the other injuries he's dealt with for most of his career.The version of Porziņģis Golden State is getting, at least for now, is a compromised one. Yet it's still a gamble worth taking for a number of reasons. The risk, for example, was minimal. Porziņģis is on an expiring contract. The Warriors gave up no draft picks to get him. If they have him in the building for three months and decide they don't trust his health, they can wash their hands of this relatively easily. They even got off of the $3 million guaranteed to Hield for next season, so it'd be a minor win.\nBut more likely, they look to re-sign Porziņģis to a team-friendly deal. If he can be had for $10-15 million instead of the $30 million he's making now, the risk-reward calculus shifts quite a bit. The stakes aren't especially high here. Golden State isn't betting a championship core on his health. They know they need to hit a home run if they're going to win anything in the near future, so it made sense to take a high-reward swing. Generally speaking, low-risk, high-reward moves make sense.And then there are the optics here. It's no secret that the Warriors are near the end of a legendary run. Stephen Curry is about to turn 38. The only reason they ever seemingly had a chance at landing Antetokounmpo was that their post-Curry future is so bleak their draft picks held theoretical value. Given how little else they have in the cupboard, one could argue that an all-in push for Giannis represented far greater risk than reward. Yet the Warriors had to try. They owe it to Curry. A player of his stature deserves to end his career at least competing in the playoffs, if not for a championship.The Porziņģis trade isn't nearly as exciting as an Antetokounmpo deal, but it shows Curry and their fans that they're trying. He's a respectable name, someone who has a chance to be very helpful for them, but like Jimmy Butler, doesn't come at an exorbitant cost. Truthfully, those are the sort of players they should be targeting right now. The goal should be to retain as much of their draft capital as possible to ensure they're capable of rebuilding once Curry is gone, but still at least making some attempt to give Curry a competitive roster now. This deal straddles that line. It creates hope without a major cost looming down the line, and it relieves the locker room of all lingering Kuminga-related tension. So it makes sense even if this isn't the best version of Porziņģis.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Hawks: BThe Hawks and Warriors are operating one different timetables. They genuinely hoped Porziņģis could form a center tandem with Onyeka Okongwu that they could build around moving forward. That didn't happen. They simply couldn't justify paying Porziņģis on a long-term deal. They need certainty at the center position, and he couldn't provide it. So moving on made sense.Could they have gotten, say, a meager draft capital return? Sure, but it likely would have been attached to unsavory salary. Atlanta has very valuable first-round picks coming from the Pelicans or Bucks both this summer and next. Maintaining financial flexibility is far more important to them than accumulating draft capital. They need their money to both find a reliable center and look for a shot-creating guard to replace Trae Young.So, like Golden State, the Hawks took a low-risk, high-reward flyer. Hield is only guaranteed $3 million next season, but because he has two years left on his deal, that can even be stretched across five years if he's waived. That's an easy enough contract to dispose of. And Kuminga has a $24.3 million team option for next season. If they need to use him as matching salary in a summer trade, they can. If they want to just get off of the contract for whatever reason, they can do so as well.\nIf we're operating under the assumption that Atlanta did not plan to re-sign Porziņģis, turning him into a different potential expiring contract makes plenty of sense. Why not give Kuminga a two-month audition and see if he looks better away from the Warriors? Atlanta does run a system somewhat similar to Golden State's. The Warriors lead the league in passes every year and in 3s this season. The Hawks are 10th in passes and 11th in 3-point attempt rate. Quin Snyder wants the ball zipping around the court and the 3-pointers flying. But nobody really plays the way Golden State does. The Hawks are closer to a normal NBA ecosystem, and it's worth seeing how Kuminga might fit into one. He does still have stellar athletic traits, after all. We're talking about someone who just faced Minnesota in a playoff series and averaged 24 points on 55-49-72 shooting in the four games in which he played significant minutes last year. There is clearly something here. The Hawks love their big wing ball-handlers. They already run plenty of offense through Jalen Johnson and Dyson Daniels, though all three have pretty distinct offensive strengths and weaknesses.Snyder is a creative offensive coach. You can never have enough wings. And the Hawks have made no real commitment here. Considering they're only giving up a player they seemingly didn't plan to keep, this is a solid lottery ticket. They were only a Play-In Tournament team anyway, so there's no harm in devoting a few months to seeing if you can unlock a former high draft pick so that next year you might be something more.\n            ",

Fans stormed the court inside the Chiles Center after the final buzzer sounded to celebrate the program's first victory over the Zags since Jan. 9, 2014.It was Portland's first win over a ranked opponent since that day more than 12 years ago. It also marked the Pilots' first-ever victory over team ranked in the top seven of the AP poll. The Zags (22-2, 10-1 WCC) entered on a 15-game winning streak and favored by 21.5 points.Losing to Portland marks Gonzaga's first loss to a team ranked below 200th at KenPom since it lost in overtime at San Francisco on Jan. 30, 2010. Portland entered at 213th.It marked Gonzaga's first loss since a 101-61 shellacking at the hands of Michigan on Nov. 26. That loss came against a projected No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. This one came against a team that entered with 10-14 record and No. 230 ranking in the NET and will not help the Zags on Selection Sunday. After the loss, Gonzaga is expected to drop from a No. 3 seed to a No. 4 seed when the CBS Sports Bracketology model is updated Thursday.  \nThe win was particularly sweet for Portland because it marked the Pilots' last visit from Gonzaga as a WCC foe before the Zags leave for the rebuilding Pac-12 next season. Gonzaga is now 47-3 against the Pilots under coach Mark Few.Gonzaga had no answer for Joel Foxwell.\nThe freshman guard from Australia led Portland with 27 points. He was aided significantly down the stretch by James O'Donnell, a sophomore forward from Australia who scored all of his 16 points in the second half.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- As everyone knows, it's not cheap to attend a Super Bowl. If you want to attend this year's game between the Seahawks and Patriots, it's going to cost you at least $4,600, which is currently the going rate for the cheapest ticket on the secondary market. If you're hoping to get a ticket at face value, you should probably just give up now, because that's not going to happen. Although $4,600 is certainly a large chunk of change, it's just a small drop in the bucket for some people. For some fans, money is no object and for those fans, I decided to go on a mission for you this week: I looked up the most expensive ticket on Stubhub and then I went to sit in the seat so you we could all get an idea of what it's like to sit in the most expensive seat at the Super Bowl. \n        \n            \n                Super Bowl sneak peek: Here's the wildest food that Seahawks and Patriots fans will eat at Levi's Stadium\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for Wednesday, the best seat on Stubhub is in Row 1 of section C114 behind Seattle's bench and if you want to sit there, it will cost you $30,751 per ticket. This is the most expensive ticket on Stubhub.  \n                                                                    Stubhub\n                                                            Basically, you could buy a car or you could attend the Super Bowl. You know what? Forget the car, we're going to the Super Bowl. So how close to the field are you if you buy this ticket? Let's check it out. \nHere's what a $30,000 ticket will buy you at the Super Bowl.  \n                                                                    John Breech/CBS Sports\n                                                            Now that you know where the seat is, let's check out the view. The seats in section C114 have a view on the 40-yard line, and although I couldn't get get directly to that seat, I found my way to Row 1 of section C116, which is in a similar spot, but on the opposite 40-yard line. And here it is, here's your $30,000 view: \nWhen I posted the tweet, I estimated how much a front row ticket would cost in this section and I was $10,000 off, so please never ask me to appraise your house. It will not work out well for anyone involved. There are currently two tickets on sale on the secondary market for more than $25,000 each and the other one is in Row 2 of Section 114. \nIt's a huge asking price, but for fans who want to be part of history at any cost, it can certainly be worth it. The Seahawks are in the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 years and when you've waited a decade to get back to the big game, it can be easier to justify this kind of purchase. For the Patriots, yes, they do have six Super Bowl titles, but it's been seven years since their last trip to the big game. And let's not forget, there are a lot of rich people in Silicon Valley, so it's certainly possible that someone ends up forking over $30,000 for these tickets, and if they do, you'll know exactly what view they have at the game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Team USA's 2026 Olympic hockey roster shows the talent pool has never been deeper for the Americans, and that led to some tough decisions as Team USA built a roster expected to compete for the gold medal this month in Italy.Team USA previously announced Matthew Tkachuk, Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy to the Olympic roster earlier this year. That meant 19 spots were available, and general manager Bill Guerin chose from at least two dozen players worthy of making of the roster.After being left off the 4 Nations Face-Off roster around this time last year, Jason Robertson had a point to prove. In the calendar year of 2025, Robertson scored 49 goals. Only two players, Morgan Geekie and Nathan MacKinnon, scored more. His 97 points ranked sixth in the NHL over that span. Despite those efforts, Robertson was left off the Olympic roster.\n        \n            \n                Team Canada 2026 Olympic hockey roster: Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon join forces to lead favorites\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnother young goal-scorer, Cole Caufield, hoped to play his way onto the team. There were questions about whether the undersized Caufield (5-foot-8 and 175 pounds) would convince Team USA leadership that he could thrive in an intense best-on-best tournament. Ultimately, Caufield will remain at home while Team USA goes overseas.\nAs always, the Americans have an embarrassment of riches in goal, and they had a laundry list of options to choose from with three-time Vezina Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck leading the way.Here is the complete 2026 Olympic roster for Team USA:*denotes injury replacementForwardsMatt Boldy, WildKyle Connor, JetsJack Eichel, Golden KnightsJake Guentzel, LightningJack Hughes, DevilsClayton Keller, MammothDylan Larkin, Red WingsAuston Matthews, Maple LeafsJ.T.

He's one of the best scorers in the league, and he upped his game after getting snubbed from the 4 Nations Face-Off last year. What more does the Team USA front office need to see from him?Taking Miller, Connor and Trocheck over Robertson is absurd. Miller, now 32, is on pace for his least productive season since 2018-19. Trocheck has topped 30 goals in a single season once, but that was all the way back in 2017-18. At least Connor provides you with some scoring touch, but he gives it all back on the defensive end. Robertson should have been an easy choice over any of those players.\n\n        \n            \n                Olympics 2026: Why this U.S. men's hockey team is different and poised to overcome woeful overseas history\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen it comes to Fox, the idea that the Americans took two Rangers while leaving perhaps the team's best player at home, boggles the mind. Since the start of the 2024-25 season, New York has outscored opponents 91-63 with Fox on the ice at five-on-five, per Natural Stat Trick. That plus-28 goal differential leads the team, and no one else is even remotely close. Do the decision-makers for Team USA (which include Rangers general manager Chris Drury) think those numbers are just a coincidence?Faber is a good young defenseman who plays tough minutes -- and a lot of them. Having said that, the Minnesota Wild just stay afloat with Faber in the game. The Rangers excel when Fox is on the ice. Guerin, the Wild general manager, should have made the tough choice to bring Fox over Faber.Elite goaltending depthMost teams in the Olympics would love to trade places with the United States when it comes to the goaltending position. Just ask Canada. The Americans had a lot of options for the third spot in the crease with Hellebuyck and Oettinger essentially locked in as No. 1 and No. 2.\nSwayman of the Boston Bruins wound up getting the final spot, and that's understandable. He's played at a Vezina Trophy level in the NHL, and when Swayman is on, he can be unbeatable. That's not a bad guy to have third on the depth chart.That said, I think there was at least one more goalie who warranted serious consideration. Spencer Knight has done his best to make the Chicago Blackhawks respectable by saving 9.05 goals above average, per Natural Stat Trick. That ranks ninth in the NHL, and Knight has a sparkling .861 high-danger save percentage.Ultimately, there were no bad decisions for the Americans when it came to their third goalie spot. It's a good problem to have, and it's a big reason why this team has a shot to win gold in Italy.\nGood enough for gold?Despite a couple clear missteps in the roster construction department, Team USA is still capable of ending the country's 46-year gold medal drought. The Americans have just made it a little harder on themselves.I've already laid out Team USA's advantage in net. If just one of Hellebuyck, Oettinger or Swayman are at the top of their game, the team should cruise to the medal round. From there, any of them have the ability to steal a win in a do-or-die situation.In front of them, the defense is still rock solid, even without Fox. The Americans didn't have Hughes, the second-best defenseman in the world, at the 4 Nations Face-Off and still pushed Canada to overtime. \nFinally, the omission of Robertson caps the Americans' upside, but Thompson and Keller were pleasant surprises. Both have a ton of skill, and Team USA needs that to complement some players who prefer a more grinding style. While Matthews has struggled this season, he's led the NHL in goals three times, and the Tkachuk brothers will be menaces on the forecheck.It shouldn't come as a surprise that Team USA has the second-best odds (+175) to win gold in Italy, per DraftKings. This team is more talented and deeper than any Olympic team the Americans have iced before.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- Stefon Diggs was one of the pivotal additions the New England Patriots made last offseason, which has since propelled them to a Super Bowl LX appearance. On the field, he became the first 1,000-yard receiver New England's had since Julian Edelman in 2019. Off the field, he's arguably the most vocal leader they have in the locker room and a linchpin to this tight-knit roster. But this alliance almost didn't come to pass. As Diggs explained on Wednesday, the wideout nearly inked a deal with the Denver Broncos, who his Patriots just took down in the AFC Championship to punch their ticket to the Bay Area. \"I played against Sean Payton a lot,\" Diggs said when expounding on what piqued his interest in Denver. \"I've seen what his offense can do. So, that was the one thing. And then a couple people on the staff that I knew. Davis Webb, I was familiar with. He helped me out a lot in Buffalo as far as learning the plays.\" \n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: How free agent spending spree paid off in helping Patriots and Seahawks reach Super Bowl\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite that kinship with Webb, who Diggs later called a \"good friend\" of his, Diggs ultimately chose New England.\n\"When you weigh all the pros and cons, I felt the Patriots were probably going to be the best fit,\" he said.  Part of New England's appeal was its young quarterback, Drake Maye. During the 2024 season, Diggs got an up-close view of his future quarterback while on the Houston Texans. They visited Foxborough in Week 6, which coincided with the first start of Maye's career. Even in those infancy stages, Diggs saw Maye's potential. \"It was crazy,\" said Diggs. \"He had got like a mini standing ovation when he went out. It was one of his first games going in. He showed a lot of promise. He made some throws. He was running around. I clearly remember a ball he threw Kayshon Boutte in the back corner to the right, a touchdown. I was like, 'He can spin it a little bit.''\nThis was the throw by Maye to Boutte that caught Diggs' attention. \nAfter a full regular season and three playoff games together, the admiration has only grown. \"His maturation process is second to none,\" Diggs continued on Maye. \"One of the best I've ever seen from a quarterback position. He's still super young, which is crazy. He's had a lot of success, but as I have grown closer to him, I'm a huge fan of him. ... He's a good teammate as well. We joke and laugh a lot in that building, in that room. The more time we spend, I see that relationship growing. He's cool with all his teammates. He's like that quarterback – I don't know how to describe it. If you play football, you'd know, but he has that quarterback mindset, that quarterback energy.\"Denver certainly would've been a viable option due to his relationship with the coaching staff and strong roster. However, it's safe to say Diggs is pleased with his choice of uniting with Maye in New England, as they're now on the doorstep of playing in the Super Bowl.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lefty Framber Valdez is finally off the board. The Tigers have landed the top free-agent pitcher on a three-year contract worth $115 million, reports ESPN. Valdez has an opt out after the second season and there are deferrals, reports The Athletic. The team has not yet announcing the signing.There are questions with Valdez that explain why he sat around on the market until just days before pitchers and catchers report to spring training. Still, there's a very good track record of success here.Valdez, 32, has been one of the game's top starters over the last six seasons, pitching to a 3.23 ERA since 2020 and averaging 30 starts and 192 innings per year since 2021. He is the game's preeminent ground ball starter. Since 2021, Valdez has gotten a ground ball on more than 60% of balls in play, easily the highest among starting pitchers. The league average is around 42% grounders.We ranked Valdez as the fourth-best free agent available this offseason, and the top starter available. Here's the write-up:\nValdez isn't for everyone. He's a contact manager from a  swing-and-miss generation who, year in and year out, belongs near the  bottom of the majors in average exit velocity surrendered. Of course,  that statistic doesn't tell the whole story. Valdez utilizes his  three-pitch mix (sinker, curve, change) to coerce the kind of earthbound  contact that removes the sting from the ball. Pair him with some  well-positioned and surehanded defenders and you'll be happy with the  outcome. Otherwise, why bother? Valdez rejected the qualifying offer earlier this offseason. The Tigers will have to surrender a 2026 draft pick to sign him and the Astros, Valdez's longtime team, will receive a 2026 compensation draft pick for losing him to free agency.Remember, Valdez came up in the Astros' system and debuted in 2018, pitching for current Tigers manager A.J. Hinch in the 2018-19 seasons before Hinch was dismissed in the wake of the sign-stealing scandal. In adding Valdez, the Tigers now have a pair of frontline lefties atop the rotation along with two-time AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal. Skubal is, of course, a free agent after the 2026 season. The presence of Valdez in the rotation post-2026 helps mitigate some of the potential loss of Skubal's services, unless the Tigers are able to come to terms on an extension with Skubal. There is also the chance the Tigers decide to trade Skubal and have Valdez take his place in the rotation, too, though that would be a substantial downgrade. As things stand, the Tigers look to have a potentially robust rotation. Skubal and Valdez are an excellent place to start. Casey Mize was an All-Star last season, going 14-6 with a 3.87 ERA in 28 starts. Jack Flaherty has shown himself to be inconsistent for years, but when he's on, he looks like a frontline starter (most recently in 2024). Reese Olson is quite capable for someone who figures to be the fifth starter and Drew Anderson is coming back to the majors after a 2.25 ERA in 30 starts in Korea in 2025. \nThe Tigers have made the playoffs and advanced for two straight seasons, losing in Game 5 of the ALDS both times. They had a 14-game lead last season and blew that, finishing one game behind the Guardians for the AL Central title. Still, they bested Cleveland in the Wild Card Series to advance.The Tigers were already arguably the favorites in the AL Central (+125, per Caesars), so adding Valdez to beef up the rotation puts them in better position to take their first division crown since 2014.\n            ",

On Sunday, Feb. 8, the AFC champion New England Patriots will do battle with the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks for the right to raise the Lombardi Trophy.New England advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2018 season thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. The Patriots won a sloppy, snowy AFC title game over a Broncos team starting its backup quarterback, emerging with a 10-7 win thanks to several Denver miscues, some well-timed runs from Drake Maye and an electric performance from a defense that has stepped up in a big way during this playoff run.Seattle is headed back to the Super Bowl for the first time since making it in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks. They won a thrilling, back-and-forth NFC title game on the strength of a fantastic performance from Sam Darnold, who slayed some demons by throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the 31-27 victory.Which of these two teams will emerge victorious and hoist the Lombardi Trophy?

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images)\n            \n            \n    \n        SAN FRANCISCO -- We are one step closer to Super Bowl LX. Both the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots took the practice field on Wednesday to continue their preparation for their bid to hoist the Lombardi Trophy. One of the key storylines of this Super Bowl will be the health of both franchises as each has dealt with some injuries, particularly at the quarterback position. Sam Darnold has been nursing an oblique injury this postseason, while Drake Maye has been managing an injury to his right throwing shoulder. Of course, if both teams have to have their best chances of finding themselves as the land team standing and Super Bowl champions, they'll need their signal-callers firing on all cylinders. Below, we'll update you on both Maye and Darnold, along with the rest of the roster, as both clubs unveil their first official injury report of Super Bowl week. Seattle Seahawks (-4.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBCSeahawks: Seattle had perfect attendance at practice, but did have several players limited: Quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique), offensive tackle Charles Cross (foot), safety Nick Emmanwori (ankle), offensive tackle Josh Jones (ankle, knee), linebacker Demarcus Lawrence (rest), fullback Robbie Ouzts (neck), receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba (rest), and defensive end Leonard Williams (rest). \nPatriots: Linebacker Robert Spillane (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday due to an ankle injury. However, he did tell the Boston Herald earlier in the day that he's \"100% confident\" that he'll be able to play in Super Bowl LX. Meanwhile, linebacker Harold Landry (knee) and offensive tackle Thayer Munford Jr. were both limited with knee injuries. Maybe the most important development on the injury front for New England comes at quarterback as the team listed Drake Maye (right shoulder) as a full participant. \n            \n    ",

Sabonis, who had missed three games prior this season due to a variety of ailments, is averaging 17.2 points and 12.3 rebounds per game this season, and he has led the NBA in rebounds per game in each of his three full seasons with Sacramento so far. This year, the struggling Kings have the NBA's third-worst rebounding percentage in the NBA.Sacramento has dealt with a bevy of injuries this season, including to promising forward Keegan Murray (thumb), who is yet to make his season debut.

    "body": "\n        'Thursday Night Football' kicks off NFL Week 12 with a pair of AFC playoff hopefuls battling as the Buffalo Bills visit the Houston Texans. C.J. Stroud (concussion) is out, but creating a Texans vs. Bills SGP could still lean on several big names like Josh Allen, James Cook and Nico Collins. With both teams possessing top-3 passing defenses, though, many may lean on the running backs with NFL props and when looking to construct a winning NFL same-game parlay. Additionally, not only is Stroud out, but Buffalo will be without Dalton Kincaid and Keon Coleman, both of whom are inactive.The Bills are favored by 5.5 points, per the latest NFL odds, and the over/under is 43.5. Apart from Cook, Houston's tandem of Woody Marks and Nick Chubb could factor into NFL player props and TNF best bets. One also can't forget about what Allen can do on the ground as he had three rushing scores last week and has the shortest NFL odds as an anytime touchdown scorer at -125.

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Some records in sports carry more weight than others. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott has taken hold of some of predecessor Tony Romo's all-time franchise records before, but the one available to him in Week 12 against the Philadelphia Eagles is a big one: the all-time Cowboys passing yards record.Romo currently sits atop Dallas' all-time passing yards leaderboard with 34,183 yards with Prescott just 160 yards behind him at 34,024. Prescott's longtime go-to-guy in All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb thinks the record will fall in the first quarter on Sunday at AT&T Stadium. \"Dak deserves it. He's done a lot of things for this franchise, this organization,\" Lamb said Thursday. \"He's the epitome of a leader and a dynasty, essentially. As for Dak, he's going to get that. I have no doubt about it. He's going to get it probably in the first quarter.\"Prescott himself, funny enough, could have seen this day coming because he felt he was a little arrogant after going from being a fourth-round pick in 2016 to the league's Offensive Rookie of the Year in a 13-win season. \n\"I'm humbled. Thankful to be healthy and to be in this position to do it. I was on the [TV] production call, and they asked me the same thing, 'Would I have thought this 10 years ago?' And I said, 'Yeah, I was very arrogant as a rookie,'\" Prescott said. \"When you've played in this game long enough and you can stay healthy, with my expectations of what my play is, that's supposed to happen. So just thankful, humbled, super grateful to be playing a game I love at this high of a level. To still be doing it and look forward to keeping going any of those that will happen.\"It's one he views as being shared with all of the wide receivers and tight ends he's thrown to over the years from Lamb, George Pickens and Pro Bowl wide receiver Amari Cooper to future Hall of Fame tight end Jason Witten and more. \"I's definitely something to be shared, whether it be with CeeDee, whether it be with Amari had a big part of it, right? All these receivers. Michael Gallup played a big part of these records, right? Dalton Schultz. Jake Ferg, Witten,\" Prescott said. \"Like, so many of them. I'm just a product of a lot of great players. And that's my point, you play a long time and you play with the standard and expectation that I have, you should accomplish these types of things.\"\nHowever, Prescott himself actually takes more pride in already being the Cowboys' all-time completion percentage leader at 67.1%. He's also taken hold of the career passer rating record (98.5) and more. \"I'd probably say I take the most pride in completion percentage, and that's something that's hard to do. It's hard to do every year, each game and that's something that I actually don't think about the long haul of it,\" Prescott said. \"I just go into every game honestly trying to get 80 [percent] and that's such a steep number but that's what I want. I think I've told y'all that after games, any incompletion I don't like unless it's a good one (where) I have to throw it away and have to live to the next play. That's probably the one I'm most proud of. The rest of them, like I said, when you're playing this game long enough, I think you should to an extent.\"Dak Prescott, Cowboys all-time ranksDAL All-Time RankCompletion pct67.1%1stCompletions 3,0331stPass attempts4,5212ndPass yards34,0242nd*Pass TD2342ndPasser rating98.5 1st* 160 yards away from surpassing Tony Romo as Cowboys' all-time pass yards leaderWith Prescott at the controls once again this season under first-year head coach Brian Schottenheimer, Dallas' offense is one of the best in football. Prescott (2,587 yards passing, fifth-best in the NFL), running back Javonte Williams (809 yards rushing, fifth-best in the NFL) and wide receiver George Pickens (908 yards receiving, second-best in the NFL) are all playing like top-five players at their respective positions for the NFL's No. 2 scoring offense (29.6 points per game). The Cowboys are the only team in the league this year entering Week 12 to have a player in the top five of the NFL in passing, rushing and receiving. That doesn't even factor in Lamb, who missed three games with a sprained ankle.\"He's hoopin. I've said that plenty of times,\" Lamb said. \"He's taking control of the offense, he's taking the control of the game, he's managing the game, he's operating the game, and obviously we're clicking on all cylinders when he's doing that.\"To Lamb's points, Prescott is playing like a top-5 to top 10 quarterback on the field this season. Although to Schottenheimer, that's not even where Prescott is at his most valuable at times despite the sparkling statistics. \"I think he's invaluable in so many ways, what value he adds to this team, from leadership, from accountability, from he holds himself more accountable than maybe anybody. He's the first to say, 'I messed that up; I screwed this up. Hey, I got to be better.' You love that about your leader, one of your best players, the confidence he exudes, the way he's teaching and reading some of these young guys,\" Schottenheimer said. ... We've had a few more player-led meetings the past two weeks, just kind of wanting these guys to be able to talk football a lot. Sometimes it's good for the coaches to get the hell out of the way, and let these guys that have to go step in between the white lines and do the things together, do that. We've done that both on offense and defense. Dak certainly is very involved running that, but I'm not in there. I stay out of there, but my feedback from talking to the guys in there is it's great feedback. They work out the kinks on certain things, which I think is invaluable for us in this game and moving forward.\"Dak Prescott 2025 season, NFL ranksNFL rankCompletion pct69.9%4thCompletions 2531stPass yards  2,5875thPass TD  21T-2ndPasser rating  102.59thCompletions of 25-plus yards22T-4th\n            ",

He had three passing touchdowns and three rushing touchdowns for the second such game with those stats in his career, and no other player in NFL history even has one such regular season game. With his dual-threat ability, plus James Cook, Buffalo leads the league in rushing offense. On the other side of the ball, Buffalo is elite at defending through the air, ranking in the top five in both passing yards allowed and passing touchdowns given up. Struggling to move the ball through the air would cause tons of problems for Houston, as the Texans have a bottom-10 rush offense and rank 31st in red-zone scoring. Also, Houston is winless against the spread (0-3) as an underdog in 2025. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Texans can coverThere's no better unit in all of football than Houston's defense, which boasts No. 1 rankings in both scoring defense and total defense. The Texans have no holes on that side of the ball, with additional top-three rankings versus the run, versus the pass and on third downs. Houston also has a big edge in the all-important turnover differential metric at +7, compared to the Bills being at +1. Additionally, the Bills' No. 31 run defense could get a middling rush offense like Houston's going, and you can't ignore the recent history of this series. The Texans are 5-0 outright and 4-1 against the spread over their last five home games versus Buffalo, while the Bills are 3-5 ATS as a favorite this season.. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Bills vs. Texans picksFor the NFL Week 12 'Thursday Night Football' game of Texans vs. Bills, the model is leaning Under the total, projecting 43 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Derrick Henry has a chance to do something pretty incredible during the Ravens' Week 12 matchup with the New York Jets. Henry, who is currently 15th all-time in career rushing yards, has a chance to pass four Hall of Famers on the all-time list during Sunday's game. Among those Hall of Famers is Jim Brown, who many consider to be the greatest running back in league history. Henry also has a chance to pass fellow gold jacket recipients Marcus Allen, Edgerrin James and Marshall Faulk on the all-time list. Earlier this season, Henry recently became only the 17th player of the 12,000-yard club, which is especially notable as every eligible member of that club is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He also recently passed Hall of Famer Walter Payton for fifth all-time in career touchdown runs. Barring an injury, it's practically a given that Henry will pass Allen and James on Sunday as he is currently just 13 and 16 yards behind them, respectively. He'll need at least 50 yards against the Jets to pass Faulk and 83 yards to move ahead of Brown and into 11th on the career rushing list. \nNFL's all-time career rushing list PlayerYards1. Emmitt Smith**18,3552. Walter Payton**16,7263. Frank Gore16,0004. Barry Sanders**15,2695. Adrian Peterson14,9186. Curtis Martin**14,1017. LaDainian Tomlinson**13,6848. Jerome Bettis**13,6629.

Thurman Thomas**12,07418. Fred Taylor11,69519. Steven Jackson11,43820. John Riggins**11,352** -- Pro Football Hall of Fame members Now 31, Henry is on the precipice of passing some heavy hitters on the career rushing list. Allen and Faulk are two of just three players in NFL history with at least 12,000 career rushing and 5,000 career receiving yards. Allen, in addition to his versatility, is also one of the most prolific scorers in league history having retired as the NFL's career leader with 123 touchdown runs. As a member of the Raiders, he ran for two scores against Washington in Super Bowl XVIII en route to winning game MVP honors. \nArguably the most versatile back in league history, Faulk became the second player in history to go over 1,000 yards in both rushing and receiving in 1999, the same season he helped lead the Rams to the franchise's first Super Bowl win. He would win league MVP honors the following year. While he was never on a Super Bowl-winning team, James nonetheless received a ring from former Colts owner Jim Irsay following the team's win over the Bears in Super Bowl XLI. The gesture was a symbol of James' immense impact on the Colts despite his departure the prior offseason. James, who won two rushing titles during his first two seasons in the NFL, did help lead the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl berth in 2008. Brown, who in 1964 led the Browns to their most recent NFL title, was the league's career rushing leader at the time of his retirement despite playing only nine seasons. In those nine seasons, he won a whopping eight rushing titles in addition to being an eight-time All-Pro and three-time league MVP. \nWhile he's rubbing shoulders with some of the greatest running backs is history, Henry is making a case as the best running back of his generation. A five-time Pro Bowl player, Henry is just one of nine players to rush for over 2,000 yards in a season. Last year, his first with the Ravens, Henry led the NFL in rushing touchdowns for a third time while setting the single-season record for rushing yards gained by a player over the age of 30. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Despite being 8-2 and fresh off a Super Bowl win, there continues to be a lot of negativity surrounding the Philadelphia Eagles. At the forefront of this negativity has been wideout A.J. Brown, the Eagles' talented yet disgruntled receiver who hasn't been shy about voicing his frustration with his and the offense's underwhelming production through 10 games. Brown threw more gas on the fire on Thursday when asked about speculation that he isn't the same player that he once was. \"I guess Saquon ain't the same player either, then,\" Brown said. \"I don't care about that.\"\nObviously, Brown putting the spotlight on Barkley's struggles this season is not a good look. It's yet another example of the missteps Brown has taken this season, both on and off the field. But while mentioning another teammate may not have been the best approach, Brown has a point in that you'd be hard-pressed to find any Eagles offensive player who is performing at the level they did a year ago. If Barkley is getting a \"pass\" for his underwhelming numbers, why isn't Brown? The answer to that question might be rooted in the fact that -- unlike Barkley and quarterback Jalen Hurts -- Brown is airing his grievances in a multitude of ways that appear to be detrimental to the Eagles. \nOn the field, Brown has often appeared either frustrated, moody, dejected, disinterested, or a combination of all four. It's worth questioning if his negative body language has contributed to his and the Eagles' offensive struggles this season.\n Off the field, Brown has made headlines for the wrong reasons. His recent comments on a livestream reportedly led to him having a 10-minute conversation with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie. Brown may the figurehead of the current lack of brotherly love in Philadelphia, but he isn't alone. On Wednesday, for example, Hurts had to field questions stemming from a report that coaches and teammates have grown frustrated with him. \n\"I guess I get a lot of attention when things are going well and when things are not going so well,\" Hurts said. \"I never run away from holding myself accountable, and I think that's exactly what I've taken the approach of doing. I take great pride in what we do on offense. I take great pride in how we go out there and play as a team and what our flow is. I think we've got work to do, and that obviously starts with me. That's always my approach. That's always me looking internally first in everything that we do and then in due time rising above.\"While they may be the most dysfunctional Super Bowl caliber team since the 1995 Cowboys, the Eagles still have a lot of football ahead of them. And despite their dysfunction, Philadelphia is currently sitting at 8-2 and are running away with the NFC East title. When it comes to Brown, his frustration does appear to be coming from a good place. He wants to have a larger role in the offense in an effort to help the unit realize its full potential. His next change to do that will be this Sunday in Dallas against the arch rival Cowboys. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Back in April, the margins between Chelsea and Barcelona seemed unbridgeable, 4-1 defeats home and away cementing the sense that European football's finest club were streaking away from the field. Seven months later and the English champions know just how close they are. What were the margins Thursday? The inches that Ellie Carpenter somehow contrived to find when it seemed so much easier for the scorer of a brilliant opener to double her tally. The flick of the post that denied Wieke Kaptein off Alyssa Thompson's delicate touch. The subatomic particles by which Catarina Macario was offside when her header had unleashed delirium at Stamford Bridge.On many another day, this would have been a win to send a statement to the rest of Europe. Then again, if Chelsea continue to perform at this level, they need not worry too much about that. They will get the points needed for a top-four finish and a swift passage to the quarterfinals. What will matter is the statement sent to Barcelona. This doesn't look like a team who are semifinal fodder in waiting. If these two meet again, they should do so as evenly matched foes.Indeed, if anyone will have to adjust it might be Barcelona, who never really found an answer for what Chelsea wanted to do to them. The hosts had judged their game plan to a tee. When Barcelona had the ball at the back, blue shirts converged on central areas, waiting as long as they had to for Cata Coll to get possession moving. If she wanted to tiptoe 15 yards up the pitch, no matter. Chelsea would not be baited into flinching first in the standoff. If they could stay patient, let Barcelona make the first move, they had a good sense of what would happen next. Even a midfield with Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmati can't pass its way around every roadblock. Sometimes they'd be played through but more infrequently than you might have expected.\nWhen Chelsea did get the ball back, they knew the weak points to hit. Claudia Pina's justified proclivity to vacate her left wing berth and Esmee Brugts' commitment to driving up the field opened up a clear avenue for the breakaway. Carpenter charged into it and kept charging until she found herself just inside the penalty area, a ferocious swing of her right boot serving as evidence that sometimes you can't blame a goalkeeper for being beaten at their near post.A poacher's finish off a scrappy corner from Ewa Pajor had Barcelona level but it did not deliver the rhythm that the Catalans had established early on. Their pursuit of it was further disrupted by a lengthy break in play in the first half as broadcast facilities at Stamford Bridge went haywire. Ten minutes in 30-degree conditions is hardly conducive to anyone performing at the highest level and Bonmati and Putellas in particular seemed to ease off after both breaks.Their first dropped points of the European season will matter little for Barcelona and it would be easy to say that they meandered to the final whistle because they never needed more than the point they clung onto. To do so would be to give discredit to Chelsea though.\nAcross the field, their organization was exemplary. In a way not dissimilar to how she throttled the Spanish at the Euros, Lucy Bronze would track whichever of Putellas, Pina or Pajor happened to be serving as the left winger in that particular passage of play. Carpenter, the dynamo on Chelsea breakaways, dropped back to ensure that wherever her teammate went, a right back was still on hand.Should Barcelona get through, then they found Naomi Girma to be at the top of her game. Nights like these call for so much from top players but often what is required can boil down to the simplest things. For Girma, this was a day for proper old school center backing. See ball, clear ball. There'll be plenty of other opportunities to demonstrate her abilities to progress possession.On this night, it was more important that Chelsea demonstrate their worth as a rival to Barcelona for the biggest prizes. Their collective responses at the final whistle said just how much there would have been to gain from a win. Sonia Bompastor shook her head, Nathalie Bjorn threw her arms up in frustration. There but for the grace of a few pixels went a win.\nAnd yet in the huddle that soon followed, you sensed a different view was emerging. The heavy favorites to win the Champions League had come to town, perhaps not as the best version of themselves, and Chelsea had been better than them. That may matter a great deal when this competition reaches its decisive games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first two years of the dynamic kickoff era in the NFL brought an uptick in returns, fulfilling the league's goal of increasing action on special teams. The shift in formats in 2024 brought fairly radical changes, and the NFL continues to assess and tweak its rules to find the sweet spot between excitement and safety. Many coaches embraced the refreshed kickoff model, but it is not without its points of contention, including the elimination of surprise onside kicks and introduction of the 35-yard touchback.President Donald Trump is among those to voice displeasure with the dynamic kickoff format. Earlier this season, he called it \"demeaning\" to the game of football and said he urged commissioner Roger Goodell to revert to more traditional rules.Kansas City Chiefs special teams coach Dave Toub was not having any of that criticism, though.\"He doesn't even know what he's looking at,\" Toub said in Thursday's media availability. \"He has no idea what's going on with the kickoff rule. Take that for what it's worth. I hope he hears it.\"\nTrump's primary point of contention pertains to the delay from the kick to the moment coverage players are allowed to move. Players on the kicking team line up on the opposing 40-yard line while players on the receiving team stand between their own 30-and 35-yard lines and are not allowed to move until the ball lands or hits a returner.\"I hate the kickoff in football,\" Trump said last week on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"I think it's so terrible. I think it's so demeaning. I think it hurts the game, it hurts the pageantry. I've told that to Roger Goodell. And I don't think it's any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other. It's the opposite of what the game -- the ball is in the air, nobody's moving. It's supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you're supposed to be moving. The pageantry of the game is so badly hurt.\"In an effort to further increase the frequency of returns, the NFL ahead of the 2025 season modified its touchback rule, bringing the ball out to the 35-yard line instead of the 30 (in the first year of the dynamic kickoff model) or the 25 (prior to dynamic kickoffs).Returns are up again in 2025The experimental year of the dynamic kickoff format delivered precisely what the NFL sought: an increase in return frequency. The return rate grew to 32.8%, up from the 21.8% mark from the final year of the old format (which was the lowest rate in NFL history). The average length of return also ballooned from 23 yards to 27.5 yards.But it was not the dramatic increase the league desired, so it made the change this year to touchbacks in an effort to further improve the odds of a return. So far, so good in that regard. \nLeague data obtained by The Athletic showed that through Week 7, players returned an astounding 79.3% of kickoffs, marking more than a 100% uptick from the first seven weeks of the 2024 season. Lengthy returns are also up significantly this season. There were 32 returns of at least 40 yards through Week 7 this year, more than double the 13 from that same time period a year ago.Players may not be in motion while the ball is in the air like Trump said he prefers. But once they get the green light, they produce more action than they did under previous kickoff formats.Injury rate fluctuates with format changesTrump contested that dynamic kickoffs are no safer than standard kickoffs, but NFL data from 2024 indicated otherwise. The league said that the concussion rate on kickoffs dropped by 43% in the first year of the dynamic model and that the overall injury rate was the same as on all plays from scrimmage.\nHowever, with the uptick in returns in 2025 also came more concussions. League data showed that, through Week 7, the rate of concussions per 100 kickoffs jumped from 0.09 last year to 1.18 this year. The NFL acknowledged that the uptick in overall injuries was expected.Player safety was among the reasons for the move to the dynamic kickoff format, and the restriction of full-speed movement projected to reduce serious injuries.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 12 kicks off with an AFC showdown in the Lone Star State, as the 5-5 Houston Texans welcome Josh Allen and the 7-3 Buffalo Bills to town. The Texans are coming off their second straight victory, a 16-13 win against division rival Tennessee Titans, while the Bills emerged on the right side of a 44-32 shootout with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It will be Davis Mills under center again for the Texans, as C.J. Stroud will miss a second straight start due to his concussion. Mills is 2-0 this season as a starter and is averaging 283 passing yards per game. He's scored four total touchdowns, thrown one interception, but also been sacked six times in those contests. You can bet Texans vs. Bills at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:The Bills got back to their winning ways last week in a game that featured nine lead changes, but they are still 1.5 games behind the surprising New England Patriots in the AFC East. Between facing a backup quarterback and a bottom-10 rushing attack, this is a big opportunity for Buffalo.\nIt's probably safe to say that another six-touchdown outing is probably not in the cards for Allen, but the NFL's reigning MVP does have an 8-0 record on Thursdays. Six of those victories have come on the road, although Houston has not been kind to Allen who is 0-3 when playing deep in the heart of Texas.Let's break down this week's edition of \"Thursday Night Football,\" but first, here's how you can watch the game. Where to watch Bills vs. Texans liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 20 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: NRG Stadium -- HoustonStream: PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -5.5; O/U 43.5 (via FanDuel)Bills vs. Texans: Need to knowDavis Mills struggled in his one start vs. Buffalo. While Mills has been winning as of late, his one career start vs. the Bills back in 2021 was a disaster. He completed 11 of 21 passes for 87 yards, zero touchdowns and a career-high four interceptions in a 40-0 loss. Josh Allen has bad luck in Houston. Allen has an 83-37 record as a starter in the regular season, but he's had bad luck in H-Town. The Bills have lost on walk-off field goals in Houston twice when Allen has started.Bills run defense is an issue. The Bills have the No. 2 pass defense in the NFL, allowing 169.7 yards per game. However, the run defense is a major problem. Buffalo allows the second-most rushing yards per game with 153.0, and has allowed six rushing touchdowns of 30 or more yards this season -- which are tied for the most through 10 games in NFL history.Best defense in the NFL? Many believe the Denver Broncos have the best defense in the NFL, but that title may belong to the Texans. Houston allows a league-low 258.1 total yards per game, and is the stingiest when it comes to allowing points on the board at 16.3 per game. And that 16.3 is the fewest allowed through 10 games by a team without a winning record since 2003! Houston has allowed fewer than 20 points in seven of 10 games this season.Not-ready-for-prime-time players? The Bills are 2-2 in prime time this season, but have lost their past two night games. The Texans on the other hand have lost both of their prime-time matchups this year. Bills vs. Texans prediction, pick\nAllen may not love playing in Houston, but he certainly likes playing on Thursdays. Allen has the best Thursday record (8-0) by a starting quarterback since 1950. He's scored 290 total touchdowns in his career, which are the most all-time by a player 30 years old or younger, and has the most total touchdowns in the NFL this season with 28. All that to say, he's good enough to rise above this vaunted Texans defense. \nThe Texans mounted an impressive comeback against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 10 and found a way to win in Tennessee last Sunday despite not scoring a single point in the first half, but the Bills are a different kind of test. Buffalo covers the spread in prime time. Pick: Bills -5.5; Under 43.5\n            ",

Denver has ripped off eight straight victories, seven of those being one-score games.Thanks to a nasty defense, one that leads the league in sacks with 49, and timely fourth-quarter play by Bo Nix and the offense, the Broncos have staked a claim as one of the league's best teams.In his third season with the Broncos, coach Sean Payton has Denver as a real Super Bowl threat. The offense may be inconsistent at times, but that defense is special.\nAnd we know the old adage: Defense travels in the postseason -- and this one might not need to hit the road until the Super Bowl if it gets the top seed in the AFC.The Broncos' two losses came on field goals in the final seconds early in the season. Turning that around and winning close games is a great way to prepare for the postseason. They are battle-tested.The Broncos are now up to fifth in my Power Rankings this week as they head into the bye. After the bye, their schedule has road games against the Washington Commanders and Las Vegas Raiders, then home games against Green Bay and Jacksonville before finishing up at Kansas City and home against the Chargers. The last four will decide if they are the top seed in the AFC.\nWe know Nix has been inconsistent at times and the running game needs to be better, but Payton has this team believing in the fourth quarter that they can win games, even when behind. That, coupled with the dominant defense, will make them a threat come playoff time to win it all.They've played the last three games without reigning Defensive Player of the Year cornerback Patrick Surtain II. He is expected back after the bye, which will make them even better.If you didn't believe in this team before Sunday, you should now. Slowing Patrick Mahomes and beating the Chiefs on Sunday is proof of that.\nNote: These rankings were finalized prior to Thursday night's Bills–Texans matchup. Results tonight could influence next week's order.\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                6\n            \n                Jaguars\n            \n                6\n            \n                Seahawks\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Rams\n                                \n                            The defense came up big in the victory over the Seahawks.

    "body": "\n        No. 17 Texas took a tumble down the College Football Playoff Rankings following last week's 35-10 loss at Georgia. The Longhorns fell seven spots in the poll, and now find themselves in serious danger of being left out of the College Football Playoff this season. This is the reality of any team with three losses.However, not all hope is lost. Texas still has a possible path back into the field, and the formula is pretty simple: win the final two games. While beating a 2-8 Arkansas team won't do much to boost their stock, the Longhorns will finish the regular season with a game against No. 3 Texas A&M. A win there could provide a boost large enough to snatch an at-large.But they have to win this game first, and don't let Arkansas' 2-8 record fool you. This team has made a habit of sticking around in games when it isn't expected to, and you know they would love to destroy Texas' season for good.Texas vs. Arkansas: Need to know  Texas has won 19 straight home games against unranked teams: The Longhorns have lost six games since the start of the 2024 season and five of those losses have come against Ohio State and Georgia. The third Georgia loss came last week in a 35-10 defeat in Athens. While the Longhorns lost to Florida earlier this year, it was in Gainesville, which kept Texas' home win streak alive against unranked opponents. The last home loss to a team outside the polls was a wild 57-56 loss to Kansas during the 2021 season. Of the 19 straight wins, 17 have come by at least 10 points.  The Texas defense is struggling: The Texas defense had been its strength all year, but it comes into this game having allowed at least 30 points in its last three games. The Arkansas offense has been one of the more explosive attacks in the SEC this season, and if the Hogs crack 30, it'll be the first time Texas has allowed 30 or more in four straight games since that same 2021 season.  \nArkansas has a positive point differential: What's the big deal about that? Well, Arkansas is 2-8 on the season, and one of those eight losses came by 43 points. Yet, some how, some way, the Hogs have still scored more points than they've allowed. How's that possible? Well, five of their eight losses have come by three points or fewer. That's tied for the most in one season by any FBS program this century.

And it's not just Georgia and Vanderbilt. Mississippi State was able to put 38 points on the board, and their offense isn't all that dissimilar to what Arkansas does. That, combined with the chance Texas may have its eyes looking slightly forward to the A&M game, make me think this one won't be a blowout. Pick: Arkansas +10.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        LSU is in hot pursuit of Lane Kiffin in a coaching search saga that continues to dominate the SEC news cycle. And in the event the Tigers do secure Kiffin as their replacement for Brian Kelly, they already have eyes on targets for their assistant coaching positions, including one name particularly familiar to those in Baton Rouge: Ed Orgeron. CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz has reported that LSU is open to hiring its former head coach to a role on Kiffin's staff.Orgeron, who led LSU to the 2019 national championship as the highlight of his six-year tenure as the Tigers' coach from 2016-21, has been out of work since his firing four years ago. He made it known last month that he would be open to a return to coaching and, particularly, to LSU.\"I love LSU,\" Orgeron said in October. \"I still got my home in Baton Rouge. I loved when I coached with coach [Les] Miles being the defensive line coach. I love the Tigers. And I'm getting back to coaching. For sure I'd consider it. No doubt.\"\n        \n            \n                Ole Miss wants clarity from Lane Kiffin. He's not in a position to give it. What's next?\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOrgeron would be a natural fit on Kiffin's staff. Not only does he hold strong ties to LSU as a former player and national title-winning coach, but his relationship with Kiffin dates back more than two decades and spans multiple schools.\nKiffin and Orgeron, both assistants at the time, first shared a staff at USC during the peak of the Pete Carroll era. They reunited in 2009 when Kiffin, then the head coach at Tennessee, hired Orgeron as an assistant. The two moved back to USC the following year when Kiffin took the Trojans job, and after Kiffin's ouster in 2013, Orgeron took over as interim coach.Before LSU potentially brings Orgeron back to Baton Rouge, it obviously first has to get a deal done with Kiffin. That is no forgone conclusion as, at this point in a whirlwind process, it seems there is no telling whether the Ole Miss headman will take the job, bolt for Florida or stay with the Rebels. Adding to the drama this week, Kiffin's family took visits to Gainesville and Baton Rouge.\nOle Miss wants clarity in Kiffin's decision-making process, and while he pushed back on the idea that the Rebels gave him an \"ultimatum\" to either shut down his suitors or pack his bags, the lack of finality only seems to get more awkward by the day. There could come a point where the sides must decide whether to press on with College Football Playoff preparations or part ways, and according to CBS Sports' John Talty, if Ole Miss is not convinced that Kiffin is committed to the Rebels long-term, it will not let him coach in the postseason.\n            ",

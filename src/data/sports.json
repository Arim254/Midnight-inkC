Plenty of the betting action will center on the spread, money line and over/under, but bettors are also always looking to push the envelope to put together huge parlays. The Rams vs. Bears matchup has the highest over/under (48.5) despite frigid temps and heavy winds expected, so many will look at the alternate total in that contest.From NFL player props to alternate lines to exact score predictions, there are several plus-money NFL bets one could pursue in their playoff parlay for a shot at a massive return. Before making any divisional round NFL picks or parlays, you need to see the divisional round NFL longshot parlay from SportsLine's proven computer simulation that pays out $1.2 million on a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the divisional round of the 2026 NFL playoffs on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the divisional round NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $1.2 million for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top divisional round NFL parlay picksFor the divisional round, one of the picks featured in the parlay is taking Rams tight end Colby Parkinson as an anytime touchdown scorer vs. the Bears. It's a player prop that returns +230, making it a great pick to take either individually or as part of a longshot parlay. Parkinson ranked 86th in the NFL regular season in receptions at 43, but he was extremely efficient in the red zone, scoring eight touchdowns, which tied for 11th in the NFL. After not scoring in the first six weeks of the season, he piled up his eight scores in nine weeks, and then followed that up with a score in the wild-card round last week. SportsLine's model has him scoring 36% of the time on Sunday, making it a great value at these odds. See the rest of the picks in the divisional round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Parkinson as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.2 millionThe parlay also includes several additional picks from the divisional round Sunday from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that returns +600 or higher. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the divisional round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.2 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

With that type of potency, no team has more against-the-spread victories than Los Angeles' 12 this season, while the Bears are just 2-7 ATS over their last nine divisional round playoff games. The L.A. offense sometimes overshadows the other side of the ball, which is elite in itself. No team has allowed fewer rushing scores than Los Angeles, which also finds itself in the top 10 in interceptions, sacks and passer rating allowed. That defense contrasts with what Chicago offers as the Bears rank 29th in total defense and allowed 6.0 yards per play in the regular season, which was the third-most in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Bears can coverThe Windy City has certainly provided a home-field advantage for the Bears who are 8-2 both straight-up and ATS over their last 10 home games versus the Rams. This season, the team is 11-4-1 ATS over its last 16 games, while the Rams are the only team playing this weekend that lost versus the spread in the Wild Card Round. The Rams have lost against the line in three of their last four road games, and Chicago's highly efficient offense can exploit Los Angeles' suddenly leaky defense. No team has committed fewer turnovers than the Bears, who also possess top-10 rankings in both points scored and yards gained, while the Rams have given up an average of 30 points over their last five contests. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Bears     picksSportsLine's model has simulated Bears vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 52 combined points.

    "body": "\nThe Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks have punched their tickets to the championship game in their respective conferences. On Sunday, they'll find out who they'll be battling for a spot in Super Bowl LX.Denver awaits the winner of the AFC Divisional Round matchup between the No. 5 Houston Texans and No. 2 New England Patriots at 3 p.m. ET at Gillette Stadium. Seattle will take on the team that survives the NFC Divisional Round clash between the No. 5 Los Angeles Rams and No. 2 Chicago Bears at Soldier Field at 6:30 p.m. ET.Houston (12-5) cruised past the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-6 in the Wild Card Round, while New England (14-3) defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 16-3. The Rams (12-5) squeaked past the Carolina Panthers 34-31 and the Bears (11-6) rallied past the Green Bay Packers 31-27.Five games are on Sunday evening's NBA schedule, one of which has the Denver Nuggets (29-13) hosting the Charlotte Hornets (15-27) at 8 p.m. ET at Ball Arena. The Nuggets are seeking their fifth consecutive victory, while the Hornets have split the first four contests of their five-game road trip.The NHL has a pair of games on its evening slate, including an Atlantic Division showdown between the Ottawa Senators (22-19-6) and Detroit Red Wings (29-16-4) at 5 p.m. ET at Little Caesars Arena. The Red Wings, who are tied with the Tampa Bay Lightning atop the Atlantic, posted a 5-3 victory at Ottawa in their first meeting with the last-place Senators this season.One of four college basketball games taking place Sunday evening has Arizona State (10-7) visiting the Fertitta Center to face No. 7 Houston (16-1) at 6:30 p.m. ET. The Sun Devils have lost five of their last six contests, while the Cougars enter the matchup with a 10-game winning streak.The Patriots are 3-point favorites against the Texans in the latest consensus NFL odds, while the Rams are 3.5-point favorites against the Bears. The Nuggets are 1.5-point favorites against the Hornets, the Red Wings are -127 favorites on the money line versus the Senators and Houston is a 17.5-point favorite against Arizona State.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Jan. 18. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchTexans at PatriotsTime: 3 p.m. | Location: Foxborough, Mass. | TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 40.5 (-113) | Expert: Patriots -3 (-113, Bruce Marshall)The Texans led the NFL in total defense during the regular season with an average of 277.2 yards allowed. They were second in points allowed at 17.4 per game and limited the Steelers to a pair of field goals in their Wild Card matchup. New England also was stingy as it allowed an average of 18.8 points to rank fourth in the league, and Mike Vrabel's squad gave up just one field goal against the Chargers last weekend. But since the Patriots were second in scoring at 28.8 points per contest and the Texans were 13th at 23.8, the SportsLine Projection Model is leaning toward a battle in which the offenses outperform the defenses as the Over hits in 51% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+1389 on his last 96 NFL spread picks) believes New England will cover the spread as he doesn't have faith in Houston's offense since the club scored two defensive touchdowns against Pittsburgh and quarterback C.J. Stroud fumbled five times.Rams at BearsTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: Chicago | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Bears +3.5 (-104) | Expert: Kyren Williams Over 59.5 rushing yards (-114, PropBetGuy)The Rams lost three of their final four road games in the regular season and were fortunate to get past the Panthers in Carolina last weekend. They held their own in the snow at Philadelphia in the Divisional Round last year and ultimately lost 28-22, but frigid temperatures in Chicago could prevent their offense - which led the NFL this campaign with an average of 30.5 points scored per game - from performing at its peak. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Bears keeping it close as its simulations have them covering the spread 54% of the time. SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (+1616 on his last 104 NFL player prop picks) thinks Los Angeles' Kyren Williams will be productive on the ground as he rushed for at least 60 yards in 14 of his 17 regular season outings and fell just three yards shy of the mark last weekend.NBA best bets, where to watchHornets at NuggetsTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Denver | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Hornets +1.5 (-113)The Nuggets have won six of their last seven contests, but five of those victories were by fewer than seven points. Charlotte was routed at Golden State on Saturday, but three of its previous four losses were by fewer than three points and two were one-point decisions. The Hornets beat the Lakers in Los Angeles by 18 points on Thursday, and the SportsLine Projection Model thinks they can end Denver's four-game winning streak as they defeat the Nuggets and cover the spread in 64% of its simulations.NHL best bets, where to watchSenators at Red WingsTime: 5 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Senators +1.5 (-224) | Expert: Red Wings -125 (Matt Severance)Over their last four games, the Senators posted a pair of victories, lost a one-goal decision against the Florida Panthers in regulation and were beaten by the Montreal Canadiens in overtime. The Red Wings doubled up the San Jose Sharks 4-2 in their last outing but were blanked by the Boston Bruins and edged the Carolina Hurricanes in overtime in their previous two contests. The SportsLine Projection Model has taken all of that into consideration and sees the Senators keeping it close against the Red Wings as Ottawa covers the spread in 69% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (17-8, +765.5 on his last 25 NHL money line picks) feels Detroit will notch the victory as Ottawa had a tough battle with Montreal at home on Saturday. CBB best bets, where to watchArizona State at HoustonTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: Houston | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Houston -17.5 (-114)After four consecutive single-digit victories, the Cougars posted back-to-back dominant wins, defeating Baylor by 22 points and West Virginia by 29. Meanwhile, three of the Sun Devils' last five losses were by fewer than eight points, including a seven-point setback against No. 1 Arizona last Wednesday. However, the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see them putting up a similar fight against Houston as its simulations have the Cougars covering the spread 60% of the time.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL divisional round concludes on Sunday with two more games that will finalize the AFC and NFC Championship matchups.

Sitting in 13th place in LaLiga, things haven't gone according to plan for Sociedad in what was supposed to be a season of improvement but everyone tries to put their best foot forward when the league leaders come to town. Not much has stopped Barcelona lately as Ferran Torres is running with the number nine role, and while he may be off the pace of Kylian Mbappe's 19 league goals, Torres scoring 11 has been more than enough to keep Barcelona moving forward.How to watch Real Sociedad vs. Barcelona, oddsDate: Sunday, Jan. 18 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Reale Arena -- San Sebastian, SpainLive stream: ESPN+Odds: Real Sociedad +425; Draw +375; Barcelona -188Hansi Flick's men enter having won 11 straight in all competitions after their Champions League disappointment away to Barcelona back in November, and Joan Garcia's return to health has improved the defense in a big way. Barcelona have only allowed two goals in their last five matches, keeping shutouts in four. They've also doubled down on their faith in the Spanish keeper, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen closing in on joining Girona on loan. Barcelona's former number one in net, injuries have held ter Stegen back over the past few seasons, forcing the team to make a long-term decision on the position. That led to signing Garcia from Espanyol ahead of this season, and after his strong start to life at Barcelona, this is now step one closer to ter Stegen figuring out his own future. \nIn LaLiga, only Aaron Escandell of Oviedo has bettered Garcia's goals prevented of 5.63 as Garcia has helped make Flick's high line succeed. Barcelona are going to allow shots with the way that they play, so having someone who is adept at stopping everything that comes their way is critical.More defensive improvements will be on the way with Joao Cancelo returning to Barcelona. Now that he's registered for LaLiga play, Cancelo has completed his loan move from Al-Hilal in the Saudi Pro League. Cancelo last featured for Barcelona in the 2023-24 season, scoring four goals and assisting five more. While he may be a few years older during this spell at the club, Cancelo will still have a large role in a season where Barcelona are balancing Champions League and LaLiga ambitions. \nIf the defense can continue to do their job while led by Garcia, this is a team that can win the Champions League. Raphinha and Lamine Yamal are doing plenty to pace the attack so this isn't a team that will be shut out by many teams in the world. That already adds enough pressure to facing Barcelona, and that will only increase if they can continue to rely on their defense.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are in the market for a new coach following Mike Tomlin's shocking decision to step down, which is unusual given that Pittsburgh has had just three head coaches since 1969. The Steelers have now requested to speak with nine candidates, and the most recent reported interviewee could be a natural fit. The Steelers have scheduled an interview with former Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy, according to NFL Media. Not only is McCarthy a Pittsburgh native that worked as a grad assistant and then wide receivers coach at the University of Pittsburgh, but Tom Pelissero says that McCarthy's father was a firefighter and Pittsburgh police officer who owned Joe McCarthy's Bar and Grill. McCarthy was even raised a Steelers fan.McCarthy is very much unlike the coaches the Steelers have hired in the past. In fact, their last three head coaching hires were all defensive coordinators in their 30s that didn't have head coaching experience. McCarthy is a 62-year-old offensive mind who has served as the lead man for two different organizations. Still, he could be what the Steelers need as they go through this transition.\nMcCarthy is 174-112-2 in his 18 seasons as a coach, spending 13 seasons with Green Bay and five in Dallas. He went 49-35 with the Cowboys, and owns the fourth-best win percentage in franchise history. McCarthy led the Packers to a Super Bowl XLV victory, which came against the Steelers, and left Green Bay with the second-most wins (125) in franchise history.When it comes to who the Steelers are looking at for their next coach, it's an appropriate smorgasbord of talent. They will interview young offensive minds, young defensive leaders and also a couple of men who have previously led teams.\nSteelers interview trackerNameMost recent jobMike McCarthyCowboys head coachNathan ScheelhaaseRams pass game coordinatorChris ShulaRams defensive coordinatorAnthony WeaverDolphins defensive coordinatorJesse MinterChargers defensive coordinatorBrian FloresVikings defensive coordinatorEjiro EveroPanthers defensive coordinatorJeff HafleyPackers defensive coordinatorKlay Kubiak49ers offensive coordinatorWhile the Steelers are considered to be one of the premier franchises in the NFL, there are plenty of questions to answer this offseason. Aaron Rodgers is not expected back, which again puts the Steelers in the market for a new quarterback, then the defense finished the season ranked seventh-worst in the league, and some of the talent is aging. Many view Pittsburgh as a team that is in need of a reset. Depending on who Art Rooney II hires, that reset may not take long.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe New England Patriots and Houston Texans both used stifling defensive efforts to carry the day in their Wild Card Weekend playoff victories. Something has to give when the No. 2-seeded Patriots host the No. 5-seeded Texans on Sunday in the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs. Kickoff from Gillette Stadium is set for 3 p.m. ET in the nationally-televised contest.  The AFC East champions Patriots are coming off a dominant 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers in which they sacked Justin Herbert six times and allowed 207 yards of total offense while holding Los Angeles to 1-of-10 on third-down attempts. The Texans used a similar profile as their rugged defense broke open a tight game in the second half for a 30-6 victory over the homestanding Pittsburgh Steelers. Houston allowed just 175 yards of total offense and 3.1 yards per play, and two late defensive scores helped overcome a three-turnover performance from quarterback C.J. Stroud. New England is a 3-point favorite at home and the over/under for total points scored is 40.5, per the latest DraftKings NFL odds for Texans vs. Patriots. Here is a look at the Texans vs. Patriots matchup from a betting perspective: Texans vs. Patriots oddsOpening spread: Patriots -3Opening money line: Patriots -175, Texans +145 Opening total: 41, now 40.5  Texans betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 12-5ATS record:10-7O/U record: 7-10The Texans quietly overcame an 0-3 start -- by 13 combined points -- to end the regular season on a nine-game winning streak behind one of the NFL's top-rated defenses. A national TV audience on Monday night saw what that menacing group, with a relentless pass rush and ball-hawking secondary, is capable of. However, they were fortunate that Pittsburgh is an extremely limited offensive team because Stroud's consistent troubles with the snap (he had five total fumbles) and shaky decision-making kept the Steelers in the game for three quarters and could have spelled doom against a higher-quality opponent such as the one they will face Sunday in the Patriots. Patriots betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 14-3ATS record: 11-6O/U record: 9-8 The Patriots were a trendy pick to exceed their over/under win total and perhaps contend for a playoff berth, and they cleared both hurdles with room to spare. There's little doubt they were aided by the NFL's weakest schedule but, even so, a road win over the Bills and their wild-card victory over the Chargers illustrated that this team is no fluke. Second-year quarterback Drake Maye, who is an MVP candidate, didn't have his best game in the opening round but still outplayed Herbert, who has yet to notch a playoff victory. Maye sealed the game with late TD pass to Hunter Henry. Maye threw for 268 yards and added a team-best 66 rushing yards as the Patriots moved one win away from an AFC title game appearance in their first year under coach Mike Vrabel. Texans-Patriots prop pick: C.J. Stroud Over 0.5 interceptions (-118)\nAlthough we believe the Houston defense is strong enough to carry the Texans to a Super Bowl appearance, the alarmingly poor play of Stroud in the opening round is a concern that can't be ignored. All the Texans need from the former No. 2 overall pick is a game manager-plus profile, one that includes playing mistake-free football with the occasional big play mixed in, and Stroud has shown such ability in the past. But he looked uncomfortable from the start against the Steelers and appeared unwilling to use his legs to get a first down when the opportunity presented itself. This dynamic caused his awful red-zone interception. Stroud's lack of accountability also was concerning as afterward he repeatedly told a stunned media contingent -- many of whom believed he was trolling -- that he thought he played well in the victory. While a similar performance will guarantee a Houston exit, we're hoping for better from the third-year QB who, in fairness, has led the Texans to the Divisional Round in all three seasons as their starter. But we expect the Patriots' varied looks to force Stroud into at least one mistake and feel comfortable that he will cash the Over on this interception prop.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Los Angeles Rams head to the Windy City on Sunday for a date with the Chicago Bears, a franchise that the team has not had much success against for whatever reason, winning just 14 of 37 total matchups. The only time these franchises squared off in the postseason was one sided as the Bears dominated 23-0 in the 1985 NFC Championship Game en route to a Super Bowl victory. The Rams will hope for better results this time around when they visit the Bears at 6:30 p.m. ET in the Divisional Round at Soldier Field. Los Angeles is the fifth seed and is coming off a narrow win at Carolina in which the team needed a late touchdown to win after entering as double-digit favorites. Chicago, meanwhile, used more late-game magic to advance past Green Bay last weekend, scoring 25 points in the fourth quarter. Despite entering the postseason as a wild card team, the Rams have the second-shortest Super Bowl odds at DraftKings at +320, sitting only behind the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks, who have +270 odds to capture the Lombardi Trophy.The Rams are 4.5-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 48.5 in the latest DraftKings NFL odds for Los Angeles vs. Chicago in the Divisional Round.Here is a look at the Rams vs. Bears matchup from a betting perspective.Rams vs. Bears odds\nOpening spread: Rams -3.5 -- now Rams -3.5Opening money line: Rams -192, Bears +160 -- now Rams -198, Bears +164Opening total: 51.5 -- now 48.5The line has budged slightly here as the Rams opened as 3.5-point favorites. They moved up to 4.5-point favorites but have climbed back down to the original number on Sunday. The total has also dipped from 51.5 at open to 48.5 entering the weekend. Los Angeles is now just the fourth team since 1970 to be a road favorite at least twice during one postseason run. On the flip side, Chicago is only the fourth team to be a home underdog twice in the same postseason, with two of the previous three making the Super Bowl -- the 2008 Cardinals and 2017 Eagles, the latter of which won the big game. Chicago also will become one of only five teams to be a home underdog in the Divisional Round over the last 40 years.Rams betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 13-5 (including playoffs)ATS record: 12-6 (including playoffs)O/U record: 11-7 (including playoffs)The Rams were double-digit favorites against the Panthers in the Wild Card Round but didn't cover. However, all but one of their regular-season victories were by five or more points, including each of their five triumphs away from home.Los Angeles has covered the spread in two-thirds of its Divisional Round games since 1970, going 12-6. Last year, the Rams were seven-point underdogs against the Eagles and managed to cover as Stafford and Parkinson hooked up for a touchdown with less than three minutes to play in the fourth quarter of Philadelphia's 28-22 victory.Stafford, who is expected by many to win the 2025 MVP Award as he led the NFL in passing yards (4,707) and touchdown tosses (46), can match Aaron Rodgers' league record by throwing at least two TD passes in his ninth consecutive playoff game. The 37-year-old, who enters with a postseason-record four straight 300-yard passing performances on the road, also is one scoring pass away from joining Tom Brady and Peyton Manning as the only quarterbacks with two seasons in which they had a total of at least 50 regular-season and playoff touchdown tosses.Bears betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 12-6 (including playoffs)ATS record: 10-7-1 (including playoffs)O/U record: 9-9 (including playoffs)A cover by the Bears wasn't looking good last weekend as they trailed Green Bay 21-3 at halftime and were down 27-16 with just over six minutes left in the fourth quarter. But Caleb Williams connected with Olamide Zaccheaus for a touchdown and Colston Loveland on the ensuing two-point attempt with 4:18 remaining before throwing a 25-yard scoring pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 to play.Chicago hasn't done well against the spread in the Divisional Round since winning Super Bowl XX, going just 2-7. However, the club has had success against Los Angeles at home of late, covering in eight of their last 10 meetings at Soldier Field.Williams got off to a rough start in his postseason debut as he threw a pair of interceptions without guiding the Bears to a touchdown over the first three quarters against the Packers. But he finished with 361 passing yards and two TD tosses and can match the franchise record of seven consecutive games -- including playoffs -- with multiple scoring passes set in 1995 by Erik Kramer. Williams also can join Sid Luckman (two in 1941), Jim McMahon (three in 1985) and Rex Grossman (two in 2006) as the only QBs in Bears history to win multiple games in one postseason.Both teams are in good shape health-wise, though second-year Chicago receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with the same foot injury that caused him to miss considerable time in the later stages of the regular season. Rams-Bears prop pick: Puka Nacua anytime TD scorer (-110)\nNacua found the end zone in nine of his 16 games during the regular season, including four of the final five. The 24-year-old wideout, who was the NFC Offensive Player of the Week twice in 2025, proved to be a double threat last week against the Panthers as he had a 14-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter and a 5-yard TD run in the second. It was the second rushing score of the campaign for Nacua, who has amassed eight touchdowns over his last six outings. The Bears allowed four different Green Bay receivers to score in their wild card win, so it doesn't seem likely that they'll be able to keep Nacua from doing so.\n            ",

The Patriots and Texans won't have to contend with quite as aggressive of cold weather conditions as the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams in Chicago, but they will need to have the parkas and heaters ready on the sideline. The big question for the Texans, a team that plays home games in a dome and a warm weather climate in Houston, will be if C.J. Stroud fares better in cold temperatures this round after a rough showing last week. Stroud threw an interception and lost two fumbles against the Pittsburgh Steelers -- with three other fumbled snaps the Texans recovered that caused the offense to struggle finding a rhythm. Houston's defense proved it's more than capable of playing at its typical elite level in the cold, as the hard-hitting Texans dominated Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers in Mike Tomlin's final game as coach in Pittsburgh. Now they'll look to present similar problems to the Patriots and their young star quarterback Drake Maye. \nMaye was sacked five times and threw one interception in a 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers in the wild card round, but was able to produce enough both through the air (235 yards and one touchdown) and just as critically on the ground (10 carries for 66 yards) to keep the Patriots offense moving enough to get the win. He figures to need to improve in his second career playoff start given the challenge the Texans present. New England is a three-point favorite currently over Houston at DraftKings Sportsbook, with a point total of 40.5 as oddsmakers anticipate a low-scoring, defensive game between two teams led by their defenses. \nTemperatures near freezing and snow that's not sticking figures to be to the defense's benefit, as snow fall can be difficult for the passing game, and the biggest problem snow presents defenses is in keeping their footing when it sticks. \n            \n    ",

On top of that, there's a 69% chance of light snow showers and 20 mph winds with gusts reaching 27 mph, per AccuWeather, as the Windy City will live up to its name. That will present a challenge for both teams, particularly in the passing game. Even with a pair of strong-armed quarterbacks in Matthew Stafford and Caleb Williams, throwing the ball down the field in 20-plus mph winds is exceedingly difficult. \n        \n            \n                Bears vs. Rams prediction: Can the Bears continue their magic by upsetting Matthew Stafford and the Rams?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Bears should at least be accustomed to playing in cold weather, even if it won't be ideal conditions for Williams, their second-year quarterback. The conditions figure to aid in their home field advantage against a Rams team from sunny Los Angeles that plays their home games indoors. \nLast year, the Rams lost 28-22 in the divisional round on a snowy evening in Philadelphia, and they may have to navigate similar cold and slick conditions on Sunday in Chicago. In that game, Matthew Stafford fumbled twice, losing one, and Kyren Williams also turned it over once with a fumble, with those two turnovers proving pivotal in a tight loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the eventual Super Bowl champions. Ball security will be paramount once again in frigid temperatures and potentially snowy conditions, and Stafford and the Rams will have to make some improvements on last year in that area if they are going to get the win. \nLos Angeles is a 3.5-point favorite on the road even with the forecast calling for extreme cold and winds, with a point total of 48.5 at DraftKings Sportsbook. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- A wild and fascinating 2025 college football season all comes down to this. One game to not only determine college football's best, but to possibly prove any program with the right plan and right amount of money can win big in this current era. No. 1 Indiana has crushed everyone on its path to Hard Rock Stadium. First, it was a 38-3 shellacking of No. 9 Alabama in the Rose Bowl. Then came a dominant 56-22 win over No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl. Led by Curt Cignetti, Indiana is so good that you sometimes forget just how incomprehensible it would have been just two years ago to imagine the Hoosiers winning a national championship in football. No. 10 Miami squeaked into the field as the last at-large team but has proven it belongs. The Hurricanes upset No. 7 Texas A&M, No. 2 Ohio State and No. 6 Ole Miss to get a home national championship date. Miami is one win away from Mario Cristobal finally declaring, \"The U is back.\" Miami is an 8.5-point underdog to Indiana. \nWho wins Monday night? Here's the blueprint for each to do so …\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    How Indiana can winTo start, just keep doing what it has been doing. Against Alabama and Oregon, the defense was ferocious and effective at pressuring the quarterback. The offense was remarkably balanced with the Hoosiers averaging 184.5 passing yards and 200 rushing yards in those games. Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza didn't rack up the passing yards but still totaled eight passing touchdowns. Indiana is very good at giving itself third-and-manageable situations on offense that make it hard for an opposing defense to get off the field. Against a stout Miami team, it'll come down to the trenches. Miami has a talented offensive line which includes future top 10 draft pick Francis Mauigoa and All-American center James Brockermeyer. Indiana DC Bryant Haines is a defensive wizard whose defense tormented Alabama's Ty Simpson and Oregon's Dante Moore. How aggressive does Haines need to be to get pressure on Miami quarterback Carson Beck? Can the defense force Beck into a big mistake early the way it did against Moore? Indiana has a nation's best plus-21 turnover margin headed into the title game. \"So just from the front to the linebackers, they all do a really good job flying around making plays, creating chaos,\" Brockermeyer said. \"It's going to be a really big challenge for us. They do a good job of playing together. Don't really make mistakes.\"\nOffensively, there is opportunity for Indiana against Miami's secondary. The Hurricanes will be without Xavier Lucas for the first half, a notable loss that Cignetti and offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan will find a way to capitalize on. The Hoosiers boast a ton of receiving options, led by Omar Cooper Jr., Elijah Sarratt and Charlie Becker. It'll be challenging for Miami to stop, especially if Mendoza can keep finding guys like Sarratt with those beautiful back-shoulder throws. If Indiana plays its game -- smart, methodical, without major errors -- it should win. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    How Miami can winThe Hurricanes are a sizable underdog in this game for a reason. A lot is going to have to break right for Miami to pull off the upset. \nTwo critical components: 1) Keep a clean pocket for Carson Beck and 2) Force Fernando Mendoza into mistakes. Indiana's quarterback is so efficient and so smart with the ball, but he's not flawless. In Indiana's 13-10 slugfest win over Ohio State in the Big Ten championship, Mendoza was sacked three times and threw an interception. It'll be crucial for Miami DC Corey Hetherman, who knows Cignetti and Shanahan well from their shared time at James Madison, to unleash Rueben Bain and Akheem Mesidor on Mendoza. Miami's pass-rushing stars have combined for 19 sacks and 32 tackles for loss this season. The Hurricanes will need at least a few against the Hoosiers on Monday. \"Miami's D-line, it all starts with them,\" Indiana offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan said. \"They got a lot of really talented guys, guys also play really hard, and they can be very disruptive as we all know. So keeping them off balance with the run pass, but also the scheme, what they're seeing play in and play out. It all goes into it. And then moving the pocket, changing loss points, quick game, RPOs, just trying to keep them off balance, keep them guessing throughout the game.\"\nOffensively, the biggest threat Miami has over Indiana is Malachi Toney. He's so elusive, so talented with the ball in space, that even when you gameplan him, he's still almost impossible to completely stop. Against Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl, Toney had a 36-yard touchdown that gave Miami a late fourth-quarter lead. Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson has to find creative ways to get Toney the ball. Prediction: Indiana 34, Miami 20\n            ",

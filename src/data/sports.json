    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- When Dallas Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey drained a 64-yard field goal to send Dallas to overtime in an eventual 40-37 overtime victory over the New York Giants in Week 2, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb called Aubrey \"a GOAT.\"It's only Aubrey's third NFL season in 2025, but in Dallas' 44-22 victory over the Washington Commanders on Sunday afternoon, he added another bullet point to a growing resume that backs up Lamb's claim. Aubrey calmly drilled a 61-yard field goal that put Dallas up 20-8 midway through the second quarter that became his fifth made kick from at least 60 yards out. That's the most field goals from 60 yards or deeper in NFL history. Even the league's official X/Twitter account added the phrase \"with ease\" when posting the highlight of his kick.  \"It's going to be a living record with kickers getting better and better every year. It's going to be tough to hold on to that one with just five,\" Aubrey said postgame on Sunday. \"It feels good. It feels like I've set myself apart with a particular set of skills, I guess, that are hard to replicate, so I just want to keep showing that every week.\"\nCowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones finds himself surprised that he no longer feels stunned when Dallas trots out their kicker from 60-plus yards. That's a testament to Aubrey. \n\"I tell you it doesn't surprise me, and that's ironic when we step out there [from 60-plus yards],\" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said postgame. All Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer could do when asked about Aubrey breaking the record is smile, laugh and shake his head thinking about the latest history Aubrey made in Week 7. \"Let's talk about the weapon. What's the record, most 60-yard field goals in a career? The guy is incredible, he really is. He's incredible,\" Schottenheimer said postgame. \"Dak [Prescott] and I kind of laugh because literally when we get the ball, it's like, he's like, 50 [yard line]. I'm like, 'yeah, 50.' ... So, he's just, he's amazing.\" \nAmong Aubrey's crazy accomplishments are the following: Aubrey made an NFL-record 35 field goals in a row to begin his career. Aubrey's 14 made field goals from 50 yards or deeper in 2024 are the most ever in a season in NFL history. He owns the longest made field goal in Cowboys history, a 65-yarder he made in Week 3 last season against the Baltimore Ravens, the second-longest made field goal in NFL history. Five career made field goals from 60 yards or deeper, the most in NFL history.He's now connected on 91 of his 100 field goal attempts in his career. No one has attempted or made more field goals than Aubrey since he entered the NFL in 2023. \"My goal has always been to be at 90%, so we're doing just good enough to meet that goal,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can keep that going for my career.\"Brandon Aubrey career, NFL ranksNFL ranks since 2023Made field goals911stField goal attempts1001stField goal pct91%3rd*Made field goals of 50 yards or deeper291stMade field goals of 60 yards or deeper51st* Among 18 kickers with least 70 field goal attempts since 2023The only difference Aubrey feels when booting a kick from 60 yards or deeper is Dallas long snapper Trent Sieg's enthusiasm on the ensuing celebratory helmet tap after the kick goes through the uprights. \"My long snapper definitely hits my head harder, so yes,\" Aubrey said when asked if he feels a difference. His range at AT&T Stadium, as Schottenheimer said, is the 50 where the Cowboys' star sits right in the middle of the turf. Aubrey's star will continue growing brighter and brighter the longer he keeps rewriting the NFL's all-time record books.\"It feels like that is now well within my range,\" Aubrey said. \"It's something I expect myself to make, so it feels like I'm doing my process and treating it like any other kick.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 7 of the Fantasy Football season brought some new players to the forefont with breakout performances that belong on your Fantasy Football radar now. On the Fantasy side, we received more data on how each offense plans to utilize its personnel. Our expectations for backfield touches, targets in the pass game, snap shares, and overall usage are often not met, and that's when we have to pivot.In Week 7, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 8 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Oronde Gadsden II, TE, ChargersAfter breaking out in Week 6, I was surprised to see Gadsden still available in so many leagues even leading up to Week 7 Sunday kickoffs. I can understand the hesitation considering how many options are available to Justin Herbert in the pass game, but Gadsden is quickly proving to be one of their best. Gadsden provides Herbert a mismatch as he can be matched up against linebackers in man coverage. With defenses focused on stopping the top-three trio of Chargers receivers, Gadsden has found a way to shine with a quarterback who is willing to go through his full progression and get past his first and second reads. Gadsden turned his Week 6 breakout into an even bigger one in Week 7 when he went off for six receptions, 156 receiving yards and a touchdown on eight targets. He will be the top priority waiver addition at any position this week.Xavier Legette, WR, PanthersLegette showed signs of developing as Bryce Young's No. 2 target in Carolina's Week 7 win. He turned 11 targets into nine receptions for 92 yards and a touchdown. He is starting to develop as a strong option for Young in the red zone but in Week 7 he showed he can be more than that. Legette played a key role as a chain mover and turned double-digit targets into nine receptions and nearly 100 yards. That's someone worth rostering as attrition continues and bye weeks make those FLEX decisions much harder. Kyle Monangai, RB, BearsThe Bears came out of the bye last week and showed some signs of getting their rookie back more involved. That continued in Week 7. Monangai saw 13 rushing attempts and turned them into 81 yards and a touchdown. He also saw three targets in the pass game, catching two of them for 13 yards. Monangai is worth rostering as a handcuff but is quickly proving to be a capable back-end FLEX option when the Bears have a positive gamescript in the matchup ahead and 2. \nBrashard Smith, RB, ChiefsWhen the Chiefs drafted Smith -- the former collegiate wide out turned running back -- their director of player personnel made it clear that Andy Reid envisioned a role for him early on. The Chiefs are paying up on that promise already not even halfway through the season. Smith's role has grown in each passing week and in Week 7 he saw a career high 14 rushing attempts. Smith's value will come mostly via the pass game where he turned five targets into five receptions for 42 receiving yards. Smith is a priority add in all PPR leagues.Chimere Dike, WR, TitansDike was the first receiver the Titans drafted this past May after drafting Cam Ward, but he fell behind on the depth chart this offseason. However, he offers an over-the-top type speed that fits Ward's arm talent. With Calvin Ridley out, Dike got his opportunity in Week 7 and turned four receptions into 70 yards and a touchdown. Daniel Bellinger, TE, Giants Bellinger helped kickstart the Giants pass game in Week 7 and finished with 88 yards receiving and a touchdown on three receptions. Bellinger came inches away from hauling in his second touchdown pass later that game. With the Giants dealing with so many injuries on the receiver front, Bellinger could emerge as a favorite target for Dart. \nJoe Flacco, QB, BengalsThis Flacco-Bengals thing sure looks it's going to work out. Flacco lit the Steelers up for 342 passing yards and three touchdowns in Week 7. Flacco should be added in all leagues where you need quarterback help. In the right matchup, he can easily find himself as a top-12 option given the receivers he has to work with, the way the Bengals call their offense, and the state of the Bengals defense. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos pulled off one of the most unlikely comebacks in NFL history on Sunday. The Broncos were able to beat the New York Giants 33-32 despite the fact that they were trailing 19-0 going into the fourth quarter. Here are five wild stats to know from Denver's win, including two NFL records that the Broncos set. NFL record: Broncos' fourth-quarter explosionGoing into the fourth quarter, the Broncos were trailing 19-0 and it didn't look like they had a chance to win the game, but then they exploded for 33 points during the final quarter to win. It was the most points ever scored by a team that had been shut out through the first three quarters. The Broncos broke a record that had been held by the 1981 Atlanta Falcons, who got shut out for three quarters by the Green Bay Packers before scoring 31 in the final quarter. The Broncos and Falcons are the only two teams in NFL history to score at least 30 points after scoring zero in the first three quarters. \nNFL record, Part II: Bo Nix goes offThe Broncos were able to score 33 points thanks in large part to Bo Nix, who had one of the best fourth-quarter performances in NFL history. Not only did Nix throw for 174 yards and two touchdowns in the final quarter, but he also rushed for 46 yards and two MORE touchdowns. \nWith those four scores, Nix became the first player in NFL history with two passing touchdowns AND two rushing touchdowns in any quarter ever. Broncos' fourth-quarter point total almost broke recordAs we've already mentioned multiple times, the Broncos scored 33 points during the fourth quarter, which isn't a record, but it was the second most points that any team has ever scored during the fourth quarter of a game in NFL history. The only team to score more came in 2007 when the Detroit Lions scored 34 points in the fourth quarter during a 34-14 win over the Chicago Bears. \nComeback kidsThe Broncos were trailing 26-8 with just six minutes left to play and still managed to win, making them just the second team since 2000 to win a game after trailing 18 points or more in the final six minutes. The only other time that's happened over the past 25 years came in 2003 when Peyton Manning led the Colts back from a 21-point deficit in the final six minutes during a 38-35 win over the Buccaneers. NFL teams had lost 1,602 consecutive games when trailing by 18 points or more in the final six minutes, but that streak ended on Sunday. Comeback kids, Part IIThe win over the Giants marked the second time this month that the Broncos have won a game despite trailing by at least 14 points heading into the fourth quarter (The Broncos trailed the Eagles 17-3 going into the fourth quarter back in Week 5 before winning the game, 21-17). The Broncos are just the third team since the AFL-NFL merger to overcome a deficit of 14 points or more in the fourth quarter of two different games in the same month. \nThe only other teams to pull that off are the Bears (September 2020) and the Dolphins (September 1980). The win over the Giants marked the first time since 1983 that the Broncos won a game despite trailing by at least 19 points heading into the fourth quarter. It was a huge win for the Broncos, who are now sitting atop the AFC West with a one-game lead over both the Chargers and the Chiefs. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        What's happening at Florida State is a perfect illustration of how fluid the idea of job security is in college football's new era.  The Seminoles were an early-season darling after a convincing Week 1 win over Alabama and raced off to a 3-0 start -- exactly what coach Mike Norvell needed coming off a 2-10 2024 campaign.  Then came an overtime loss to Virginia. Then Miami. Then Pittsburgh. At that point, the heat had turned up to about medium on Norvell -- no immediate firing, but perhaps in danger after this season if all hell broke loose, and if nothing else the lead face of all 2026 hot seat content.  But now things are at a scalding temperature. In the early hours of Sunday morning, on the East Coast at least, Florida State lost 20-13 to lowly Stanford, a game the Seminoles were favored to win by 17.5 points.  \nThe fourth straight loss (the fourth time Norvell's had a four-game losing streak in Tallahassee) was, in the words of one industry source, when Norvell's seat went from warm to \"legit fire hot.\" It's a long flight from Palo Alto to Tallahassee. Many boosters, per sources, spent those trips back commiserating and planning. Conversations in Tallahassee about Norvell's status have continued throughout the day; Norvell even acknowledged during a Sunday staff meeting that conversations about his future were happening, sources tell CBS Sports. His buyout of around $55 million, per Noles247, no longer seems like a major roadblock to making a change many around the program view as necessary.   🏈 💰Most Expensive Buyouts in College Football History RankCoachSchoolBuyout Amount1 \t\t\t\tJimbo Fisher \t\t\t\tTexas A&M \t\t\t\t$76.8 million \t\t\t\t2 \t\t\t\tJames Franklin \t\t\t\tPenn State \t\t\t\t$49 million \t\t\t\t3 \t\t\t\tGus Malzahn \t\t\t\tAuburn \t\t\t\t$21.4 million \t\t\t\t4 \t\t\t\tCharlie Weis \t\t\t\tNotre Dame \t\t\t\t$18.9 million \t\t\t\t5 \t\t\t\tWillie Taggart \t\t\t\tFlorida State \t\t\t\t$18 million \t\t\t\t6 \t\t\t\tEd Orgeron \t\t\t\tLSU \t\t\t\t$16.9 million \t\t\t\t7 \t\t\t\tTom Allen \t\t\t\tIndiana \t\t\t\t$15.5 million \t\t\t\t8 \t\t\t\tTom Herman \t\t\t\tTexas \t\t\t\t$15.4 million \t\t\t\t9 \t\t\t\tBryan Harsin \t\t\t\tAuburn \t\t\t\t$15.3 million \t\t\t\t10 \t\t\t\tArt Briles \t\t\t\tBaylor \t\t\t\t$15.1 million \t\t\t\tSome believe Norvell's message is getting lost on his team. After the loss to Stanford, a source told CBS Sports that players were cracking jokes in the locker room about having to \"respond\" yet again. \"Respond\" is a common phrase for Norvell to his team as losses mount. CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello, who spent Saturday in the ACC replay center, said on the College Football Insiders that he could see Florida State's sideline in the All-22 camera view and was struck by the lack of player engagement.  Florida State is 5-14 going back to the start of the 2024 season.  \nThe Seminoles again went all-in with the portal this offseason, signing 23 transfers to turn the program around. But just like it saw in 2024, part of the risk of a transfer-heavy strategy is that one-year rentals aren't steeped in the program culture, which matters when things go sideways. As for the on-field business, this is not a cheap roster. Between rev share and front-loaded name, image and likeness payments, sources say FSU's roster cost well into the $20 million range.  The combination of expensive additions and compounding losses puts Norvell in the crosshairs, especially when you consider there are no easy fix moves remaining after Norvell changed both of his coordinators last offseason. If the Seminoles fire Norvell, it would cost the program far more than just that $55 million. They would spend millions buying out assistant coach contracts. There are also multiyear deals for Seminole players on the roster the next head coach might not want to keep. Add in a new coach, his staff and a full portal class of salaries and it could cost close to nine figures to fire Norvell.  That's a staggering sum for a program, less than a year ago, that openly rebelled against the ACC to generate more revenue. Fifty-five million would be the second-largest buyout in college football history. But it's a number some around Tallahassee consider necessary with no sustained signs of improvement.  \n        \n            \n                The Buyout Bubble: Why college football keeps paying millions to make coaches disappear\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCould Norvell survive? Absolutely. Firings in college football are inherently political, and Norvell could claw his way out of this. But even if he escapes Sunday with his job intact, Norvell isn't necessarily safe given that the Seminoles are on a bye week, an opportune time to make a change no matter the day.  Norvell looks like he'll make it through Sunday. Monday, Tuesday and the rest of the year after that? We'll see. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Noles247 brings fans trusted coverage from a dedicated team of insiders who are all over the latest with Norvell and Florida State.  With 10+ years of experience and a staff that includes Chris Nee, Brendan Sonnone and Zach Blostein, the site delivers daily updates, recruiting scoop, team and transfer intel.

The former first-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 2012 NFL Draft played seven NFL seasons prior to his career ending after a brief stint with the Oakland Raiders.Martin rushed for 1,454 yards as a rookie in 2012 before playing in only 17 games over his next two years with the Buccaneers. Martin's resurgence was notable in 2015 when he posted an All-Pro and Pro Bowl season in which he rushed for 1,402 yards. \nThat offseason, Tampa Bay signed Martin to a five-year, $35 million contract extension. Martin struggled thereafter for the NFC South franchise, including a suspension for violation of the league's substance abuse policy that caused him to miss multiple games at the end of the year. The suspension came amid Martin being benched while the Buccaneers were making a playoff push during the 2016 season. The Buccaneers released Martin after the 2017 season and he later signed with the Raiders to back up Marshawn Lynch.Known for his bruising style at 5-feet-9 and 225 pounds, Martin starred at Boise State and earned the nickname \"Muscle Hamster\" during his time on the blue turf. \nPrior to Heisman finalist Ashton Jeanty's career, Martin was considered one of the top ballcarriers in program history after ranking third all-time at the school with 43 rushing touchdowns and 48 total touchdowns, fifth with 3,431 rushing yards and sixth with 617 rushing attempts.\n            \n    ",

However, it appears he dodged a bullet. Crosby is expected to be OK moving forward, per NFL Media. Ian Rapoport reports it was \"more of a precaution than anything.\"Crosby, who was limited during Friday's practice session with a back injury, made three tackles before exiting the game. He was listed by the team as doubtful to return. In the first six games of the season, the four-time Pro Bowl lineman recorded 25 tackles, four sacks and 10 tackles for loss.While this is good news for the Raiders, it doesn't negate the fact that absolutely nothing went right on Sunday. The Vegas offense recorded 95 total yards of offense, picked up just three first downs and went 0 for 7 on third downs while losing the time of possession battle, 17:52 to 42:08. \nThe Raiders ran just 30 plays in the 31-point loss. According to CBS Sports Research, those 30 plays are the fewest plays run by any team in a game since the Cleveland Browns ran 28 plays in that franchise's first NFL game back in 1999. Sunday marked the Chiefs' largest shutout win over the Raiders.\"There's a lot of soul-searching that needs to be done,\" Raiders quarterback Geno Smith said after the game, per ESPN. \n\"I'm upset that we aren't the team that I envision us being yet,\" Smith added. \"Tough losses like this should be a gut check and make you lock in with your teammates. ... Thirty-one to nothing is embarrassing. We put too much into this game to come out here and not have a shot. My heart is broken for the Raiders fans.\"\n            \n    ",

Daniels was later ruled out. After the game, coach Dan Quinn said Daniels will undergo an MRI on his hamstring Monday. Quinn also said Daniels wanted to re-enter the game.\nDaniels has already missed two games this season due to the knee sprain he suffered in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, though that injury was to his left leg. He has been wearing a brace on that knee ever since.Mariota started both games Daniels missed earlier this year and played well, throwing for a touchdown and running for another in a win over the Las Vegas Raiders and throwing for two more touchdowns in a loss to the Atlanta Falcons.\nWashington, now 3-4, was already without its three top wide receivers -- Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel and Noah Brown -- entering the game and has been hit hard by injuries on both sides of the ball this season.\n            \n    ",

Gotham earned a free kick in a dangerous spot in the final third, and the veteran midfielder took her place over the mark. She struck the ball with her left for a clinical finish, showing off equal parts technical brilliance and sheer will. \nShe showed her veteran presence in a big moment and only needed a little step to get behind a sensational effort. The goalkeeper was frozen for just a moment, perhaps wondering if Lavelle would go far post, and that little hesitation gave the American star enough time to curl the ball over the wall and into the goal.\nWith the draw, Gotham are on 36 points and are currently the seven seed ahead of the final day of the regular season on Nov. 2. Thanks to conceding that late goal, the dropped points leave Louisville in the eighth spot, ahead of the last game with the North Carolina Courage two points back.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LINCOLN, Ala. -- In an overtime restart where only the right moves in the draft separated playoff contenders from the chance to race for a NASCAR Cup championship, Chase Briscoe found his way to the lead on the final lap to win the YellaWood 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. In his first year with Joe Gibbs Racing, Briscoe advances to the Championship 4 for the first time in his career and will have the opportunity to race for his first Cup title.After a frentic battle among the lead pack in the final 10 laps ended with Chris Buescher crashing out of the lead with two laps to go, the race came down to an overtime restart that was seemingly set to be decided between Hendrick Motorsports teammates, with William Byron and Kyle Larson lining up first and second and a Championship 4 spot at stake for both. But on the final lap, things went awry for both when Larson ran out of fuel while leading the inside line on the backstretch, opening the door for Briscoe to make his move.\n        \n            \n                NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\n                \n                    Steven Taranto                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith Larson dropping back clearing the inside line, Briscoe ducked to the inside of Bubba Wallace entering turn 3 for the final time, picking up enough drafting help from teammate Ty Gibbs to clear Wallace in the trioval. As Wallace got split three wide, and Byron was spun out coming to the finish line, Briscoe was able to make it to the checkered flag at the front, earning the fifth win of his career and by far the most important to date.\"I can't believe I won a superspeedway race. I haven't done it at any level,\" Briscoe told NBC Sports. \"... It's not hit me. We're going to Phoenix.\"So thankful  that the Lord has blessed me opening doors, even closing doors at times, but certainly opening an incredible door here with Joe Gibbs Racing. God is so good, I say it all the  time. Even today, I just had such a peace. Normally I'm scared to death, a nervous wreck around this place. And I had such a peace that regardless of  the finish, He was going to use it somehow for His glory. And pretty cool that it ends up in  Victory Lane.\"\nTodd Gilliland earned his best career Cup finish in second, followed by Ty Gibbs, Wallace, and Cole Custer. The rest of the top 10 was comprised of Carson Hocevar, Tyler Reddick, Christopher Bell, Zane Smith and Brad Keselowski.With Sunday's win -- his third victory of 2025 -- Briscoe joins Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Denny Hamlin in the Championship 4, giving the company at least a 50 percent chance of winning the Cup championship at the end of a day that ended up being rough for rival companies Hendrick Motorsports and Team Penske. Larson and Byron's last lap issues -- they finished 25th and 26th -- paled in comparison to Chase Elliott, who was taken out in a grinding multi-car crash near the end of stage 1. Elliott finished 40th, leaving him with a single point and putting him 62 points back of the cut line entering the Round of 8 finale at Martinsville.\nAs for Team Penske, Ryan Blaney and Joey Logano went from controlling the race at the front of the field -- Logano led the most laps with 35 -- to getting shuffled back in the lead pack, rendering them unable to make it back to the front when the field formed up three-wide and left them little opportunity to make it back to the front. Logano finished 16th and Blaney 23rd, leaving both in likely Must Win scenarios at Martinsville along with Byron.\nWith one race to go to settle the final two spots in the Championship 4, Christopher Bell (+37) and Kyle Larson (+36) hold a sizeable but delicate lead over the cut line. For William Byron (-36), Logano (-38), Blaney (-47), and Elliott (-62), their likeliest path to racing for a championship in Phoenix now comes down to next week's Round of 8 finale and the penultimate race of the season at Martinsville Speedway.\nYellaWood 500 results#19 - Chase Briscoe#34 - Todd Gilliland#54 - Ty Gibbs#23 - Bubba Wallace#41 - Cole Custer#77 - Carson Hocevar#45 - Tyler Reddick#20 - Christopher Bell#38 - Zane Smith#6 - Brad Keselowski#88 - Shane van Gisbergen (R)#99 - Daniel Suarez#1 - Ross Chastain#42 - John Hunter Nemechek#60 - Ryan Preece#22 - Joey Logano#71 - Michael McDowell#66 - Casey Mears#8 - Kyle Busch#10 - Ty Dillon#62 - Anthony Alfredo#33 - Austin Hill#12 - Ryan Blaney#11 - Denny Hamlin#24 - William Byron#5 - Kyle Larson#3 - Austin Dillon#78 - B.J.

In 2024, he carried the ball 304 times for 1,456 yards and scored 14 rushing touchdowns, while also catching 61 passes for 431 yards, showcasing both durability and versatility.Through six weeks in 2025, Robinson has maintained a strong pace with 314 rushing yards on just 64 carries (about 4.9 yards per attempt), along with 18 receptions for 270 receiving yards.

In 2024, he appeared in just four games, rushing 50 times for 202 yards (4.0 yards per carry) and catching 15 passes for 146 yards without scoring a touchdown - a rare dry spell for the versatile back.In 2025 through six games, McCaffrey has already logged 108 carries for 336 rushing yards (3.1 yards per carry) and one rushing touchdown, while adding 46 receptions for 444 receiving yards and three receiving scores. After battling injuries in 2024, McCaffrey has once again become a focal point of San Francisco's offense, particularly as a receiving threat out of the backfield.

    "body": "\n        Another Sunday, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 7 has had no shortage of major storylines so far: After Joe Flacco and the Cincinnati Bengals outdueled Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers to kick off this week's schedule, a couple of other surprising teams stole the spotlight, including the Cleveland Browns against the sinking Miami Dolphins.Some results were fairly predictable, like Mike Vrabel leading a decisive win over his old team, the Tennessee Titans, thanks to another crisp performance from quarterback Drake Maye. Others were a bit more eye-opening, like the Los Angeles Rams laying waste to the Jacksonville Jaguars overseas, despite the latter entering the international contest with a promising 4-2 record. And then there were the literal no-contest matchups, like the Kansas City Chiefs blanking the rival Las Vegas Raiders in a 31-0 shutout.Which players, coaches and teams were the biggest winners (and losers) of Week 7? Here are our top picks for the most noteworthy standouts of Sunday's matchups, for both better and worse:Winner: Bo NixDown 19 points in the fourth quarter? No worries. Nix has built a reputation as a late-game fighter, and it showed up in a big way on Sunday, when the New York Giants looked poised to run away with a road upset against his Denver Broncos. The second-year quarterback led five straight scoring drives and totaled four of his own touchdowns to fuel the Broncos' massive comeback.\nLoser: Brian DabollThe embattled Giants coach may be best friends with hotshot rookie Jaxson Dart, but his seat may heat up after his squad surrendered 33 points in the fourth quarter of a would-be win over Denver. His handpicked emergency kicker, Jude McAtamney, missed two extra points. And it can be hard to overcome the kind of gut punch the locker room will feel after an \"L\" like this.Winner: Brian SchottenheimerWhy aren't we talking more about what this guy's doing -- or at least enjoying -- at the helm of the Dallas Cowboys? America's Team may still lack a playoff-caliber defense, but Dak Prescott has been slinging it like MVP material for most of the year. That continued against the rival Washington Commanders, with Javonte Williams, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens all making splash plays.Loser: The CommandersSunday was a double whammy for Washington. Not only did Dan Quinn's team, which finished 2024 on the doorstep of the Super Bowl, look increasingly old and slow playing catch-up with the Cowboys, but star quarterback Jayden Daniels also left with a hamstring injury. That's Daniels' second significant injury of the year, and we're not even to the midway point of 2025 just yet.\nWinner: Andy ReidReid's Chiefs looked like they might finally be returning to title-caliber form in a prime-time rout of the Detroit Lions in Week 6. Everything finally clicked against the Raiders, though, with Patrick Mahomes greatly benefiting from the 2025 debut of Rashee Rice. The formerly suspended wide receiver showed up with seven catches and two scores to balance out Reid's offensive arsenal.Loser: Tua TagovailoaEach week has basically been a new low for the Miami Dolphins quarterback, both on and off the field. Fresh off a public apology for implying his teammates were slacking off in the building, Tagovailoa tossed three picks in a hapless blowout loss to none other than the Cleveland Browns. Back-breaking turnovers have been his 2025 calling card.Winner: Matthew StaffordNo Puka Nacua? No problem for the Los Angeles Rams quarterback, who gave London a show for the ages despite rainy conditions against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Stafford may be 37, but he slung it like he was 27 on the international stage, tossing five scores, including three to Davante Adams. He also felt zero pressure, getting elite defensive support to the tune of seven sacks.\nLoser: Aaron GlennLook, we're not going to sit here and suggest all rebuilds are effective overnight; Glenn's old team, the Detroit Lions, endured lots of bumps before emerging as a real contender. But after Sunday's ugly 13-6 loss to the Carolina Panthers, in which he finally benched Justin Fields despite repeatedly assuring reporters he would not, Glenn became the first Jets coach to ever start 0-7.Winner: The Eagles' passing gamePhiladelphia produced some scarily erratic passing work in a two-game skid prior to Sunday, especially considering the wealth of talent in their lineup. Up against Brian Flores' exotic Minnesota Vikings defense, however, Jalen Hurts really settled in, distributing one timely dart after another to both A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. They enjoyed their most fluid aerial attack in a long time.Loser: The TitansWas Tennessee right to move on from Mike Vrabel after the 2023 season? You can still make that case. But there's no denying Vrabel finds himself in a much better place than his former organization. Making their first appearance under the interim direction of Mike McCoy, the Titans once again lost the ball with rookie Cam Ward under center, gifting an easy win to Vrabel's Patriots.\nWinner: Ben JohnsonThe Chicago Bears aren't necessarily winning pretty. But any Chi-Town resident would've signed up for a 4-2 start in a heartbeat. Even with quarterback Caleb Williams posting a so-so stat line against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, Johnson kept the ground game churning through both D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, while his defensive guru, Dennis Allen, also showed up.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Drake Maye wasn't going to let Mike Vrabel off the hook. Just as Vrabel was finishing his postgame speech, his quarterback stepped in to make sure he was properly honored after the Patriots recorded a 31-13 win over the Titans, who fired Vrabel after going 6-11 in 2023. \"One sec,\" Maye said while patting Vrabel's chest. \"Coach Vrabel, we love playing for you. Glad you're our head coach. We love you, coach.\"The two then embraced with Maye giving Vrabel the game ball. \nVrabel went 54-45 with three playoff appearances and two AFC South titles during his six years coaching the Titans. After he was let go, Vrabel spent the 2024 season with the Browns as a coaching and personnel consultant before being brought on to coach the Patriots, the team he won three Super Bowls with as a player during the 2000s. \nVrabel, who was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame two years ago, has led the Patriots to a surprising 5-2 start. On Sunday, the Patriots won their fourth straight game by playing complementary football. On offense, New England ran for 175 yards and a score while also receiving a near flawless performance by Maye, who went 21 of 23 for 222 yards with two touchdowns and no picks. Defensively, the Patriots forced two turnovers and did not allow a point during the second half after initially falling behind 10-3.While Sunday was an impressive performance, Vrabel feels that the Patriots' best ball is still ahead of them. \"There's so much better football that we can play,\" he told his team following Sunday's game. \"It's close. But you kept taking care of business.\"\nWhile Vrabel and the Patriots are ascending, the Titans are mired in a lost season. Tennessee is now 1-6 and will play the remainder of the season without coach Brian Callahan, who was fired last Monday. Mike McCoy is serving as Tennessee's interim coach. \n            ",

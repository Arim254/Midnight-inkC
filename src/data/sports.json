    "body": "\n        Right now you can use the latest FanDuel promo code to receive $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Tuesday features games in the NBA, NHL, college football and college basketball. We're zeroing in on Senators vs. Stars in the NHL, Ohio vs. Western Michigan in college football and New Mexico vs. UC Riverside in college basketball. Western Michigan 5-1 against the spread in its past six games at home, but SportsLine's model is backing the Bobcats, who are 10-1 in their last 11 games in conference play. Picks from all three of those games are among our Tuesday best bets at FanDuel Sportsbook from SportsLine's team of experts and the SportsLine Projection Model. Claim the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our FanDuel promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Tuesday best bets at FanDuel SportsbookSenators money line vs. Stars (-118)Ohio money line vs. Western Michigan (+102)UC Riverside -19.5 vs. New Mexico (-108)Combining the model's three picks into a three-leg parlay at FanDuel would result in a payout of +612 (risk $100 to win $612). Bet it at FanDuel here:\nSenators money line vs. Stars (-118)\"This will be the Dallas Stars' first trip to Canada this season. They have won nine games, eight of which were victories by one goal, including a streak of six consecutive one-goal wins. Both teams have a goal differential of -3. However, Dallas has a shot differential of -37, while Ottawa is at +27,\" SportsLine NHL expert Jeff Hochman said. \"Linus Ullmark will be in goal for the Senators, and he's 2-0 with a 1.46 GAA and .952 save percentage against Dallas over the last three seasons. With both teams playing their third game in four days, let's ride with the Senators at home.\" Back the Senators at FanDuel Sportsbook:Ohio money line vs. Western Michigan (+102)Both of these teams are in a four-way tie atop the MAC standings at 4-1 in conference play, but Ohio is the defending league champions and will be riding high coming off a crucial 24-20 win over Miami (OH), who is also 4-1. Sieh Bangura rushed for 102 yards and a touchdown while also catching three passes for 30 yards in the win and he's settled back in as one of the best backs in the MAC after leaving Ohio for one-season stint at Minnesota. Western Michigan's run defense has been boom or bust all season, so a lot rides on Bangura's ability to find traction. The model has the Bobcats winning in 72% of simulations. Back Ohio at FanDuel Sportsbook:UC Riverside +19.5 vs. New Mexico (-108)\"Mountain West sources are suggesting that the Lobos are a work in progress for new HC Eric Olen (via UCSD), who has an entirely new roster in Albuquerque and already giving a long look to various frosh, including top early scorers F Tomislav Buljan (via Croatia) and G Jake Hall. UNM is barely hitting 40% from the floor and 30% beyond the arc vs. limited opposition in two games,\" legendary college basketball handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Meanwhile, reports from the Big West indicate UCR could be a sleeper under new HC Gus Argenal, most recently a winner at CSUSB. Argenal obviously worked the portal hard for a collection of far-flung transfers such as G Marqui Worthy Jr (18.5 ppg; via UMass) & F Osiris Grady (18 ppg; via UVU).\" Back Dallas at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more college football and basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Tuesday.

And that's the case once again on Saturday when UFC makes its annual trip to Madison Square Garden for UFC 322. A pair of superfights tip the bill with (now) former champions moving up in weight in pursuit of glory in a second division. In the main event, Islam Makhachev moves up from lightweight to welterweight to challenge Jack Della Maddalena for the 170-pound title. In the co-main, Weili Zhang moves from strawweight to flyweight to face Valentina Shevchenko for the 125-pound crown.Technically, champion vs. champion super fights are a thing of the past because UFC CEO Dana White's new philosophy requires champions to vacate their titles before changing divisions. That's exactly what happened with Makhachev and Zhang, who relinquished their UFC titles to move up in weight and become two-division champions. Makhachev (27-1) set the record for most UFC lightweight title defenses, eclipsing mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and others, before moving up to challenge Jack Della Maddalena in the latter's first title defense. Della Maddalena inspired some confidence that he can give Makhachev a tough fight after busting up Belal Muhammad to become the 170-pound champion.Zhang Weili dominated women's strawweight before leaving Mackenzie Dern to pick up the vacant strap at UFC 321. Her second reign as champion saw her beat Amanda Lemos, Yan Xiaonan and Tatiana Suarez. Now she seeks to put an end to Shevchenko's second women's flyweight title reign, which Shevchenko kick-started after ending her series with former champ Alexa Grasso.Below is the complete fight card for UFC 322, along with the latest odds.

Embiid and the Sixers were hopeful that procedure would clear up his issues and allow him to get back on the floor more regularly, but now he finds himself dealing with an issue with his right knee. \"No expectations at all,\" Nurse said when asked if Embiid could miss multiple games. \"We are going to see what they say about the imaging.\"\nEmbiid has injured his right knee before, suffering a right knee sprain during the 2023 Playoffs in the first round against the Brooklyn Nets that limited him going forward. This season, Embiid has appeared in six of the Sixers' 10 games and averages 19.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per game while being limited to 20-25 minutes of action. Despite a cautious approach to his minutes load early in the season, he finds himself dealing with knee soreness once again.  The Sixers have held him out of back-to-backs, including their most recent game against Detroit, but his absence on Tuesday night raises new concerns, as it comes after two days off.\nThe 76ers are 6-4 on the season thanks to a sensational start from their young backcourt led by Tyrese Maxey and rookie VJ Edgecombe. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Awards week in Major League Baseball continued on Tuesday. On Monday, Nick Kurtz of the Athletics won the American League Rookie of the Year Award for 2025 and Drake Baldwin of the Braves claimed the Jackie Robinson Award in the NL. The Cy Young winners in each league will be revealed on Wednesday night and Thursday will wrap things up with the Most Valuable Player awards. As for Tuesday, the AL and NL Managers of the Year were unveiled. These awards are voted on by 30 members of the Baseball Writers Association of America (that's two per MLB city in each league). Votes were submitted before the beginning of the playoffs, meaning that only regular-season contributions are taken into account.Here, then, are MLB's Manager of the Year award winners for 2025.Murphy repeats as NL winnerFor a second straight year, the Brewers' Pat Murphy is NL Manager of the Year. Murphy prevailed in the voting over the other two finalists, Terry Francona of the Reds and Rob Thomson of the Phillies. Here's a look at the voting:Manager1st 2nd3rdTotal pointsPat Murphy, Brewers272-141Terry Francona, Reds291249Rob Thomson, Phillies17632Craig Counsell, Cubs-7324Clayton McCullough, Marlins-5722Torey Lovullo, D-backs--11Mike Shildt, Padres--11Murphy this season led the Brewers to an MLB-best 97-65 record, which was good for both the NL Central title and top overall seed in the postseason. Murphy's and the Brewers' success in 2025 came once again despite a low payroll and the exodus of more talent -- including shortstop star Willy Adames, who signed a free-agent contract with the Giants last offseason. Murphy's 2025 team was notable for its crisp play in the field and on the bases, deep lineup, and well-run bullpen. Murphy won the award in 2024 thanks to a 93-win season in Milwaukee and a division title. In the playoffs, the Brewers were swept by the Dodgers in the NLCS, but to get there they prevailed over the division-rival Cubs and former Brewers manager Craig Counsell in the NLDS.  \nMurphy becomes the first back-to-back winner of NL Manager of the Year since Bobby Cox of the Braves in 2004 and 2005. Overall, he's the first repeat winner since Kevin Cash of the Rays won the AL award in 2020 and 2021.Vogt is AL winner againSteven Vogt of the Guardians has repeated as AL Manager of the Year, as he won the balloting over his fellow finalists John Schneider of the Blue Jays and Dan Wilson of the Mariners.

Vogt's case for the award gained steam down the stretch thanks to a miracle comeback by the Guardians. Cleveland fought back from 15 ½ games out in the AL Central, which made it the largest comeback in the divisional era (i.e., since MLB split into divisions in 1969). As well, Vogt's Guardians trailed the Tigers by 14 games as late as July 9 and by 9 ½ games as late as Sept. 10. Cleveland's 20-7 record in September played a leading role in that comeback and, thus, Vogt's winning of the award. This, of course, is to say nothing of the Guardians' low payroll and very limited commitment to winning from ownership.\nVogt has now won the hardware in each of his first two seasons as an MLB manager.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the second round of College Football Playoff Rankings were released on Tuesday, Miami found itself slotted as the top team in the ACC. Because of the placement, the Hurricanes were mocked into CFP bracket projections and graphics as the projected ACC champion as the 11-seed. There's only one problem: Miami probably can't win the ACC and secure a bid for the league. On paper, the Hurricanes have been the best team in the ACC by a wide margin. Miami beat No. 10 Notre Dame, No. 25 South Florida and Florida in nonconference play. They rate No. 13 in the SP+ ratings and feature one of the nation's best pass rushes behind defensive ends Rueben Bain and Akheem Mesidor. \"The conversation with Miami has been about their consistency, especially on offense,\" CFP selection chair Mack Rhoades said. \"The head-to-head win with Notre Dame comes up. Seven straight (for Notre Dame), better defensively than what they were at the beginning of the year. We've got great respect for Miami. When you think about the eye test, they're really talented on both sides of the football.\" \nBut after suffering stunning losses against Louisville and SMU, their pathway to contending for the College Football Playoff becomes awfully complicated. Despite the nonconference victories, Miami sits with a 3-2 record in ACC play. There are five ACC teams with only one conference loss. The other two-loss team, Louisville, has a head-to-head victory over them that would provide a critical tiebreaker. Because of the difficult path, Miami has the seventh best odds to win the ACC, according to SportsLine projections. The Hurricanes are given only a 2.9% chance to win the league because of how they bungled their conference schedule. Best chance to win ACCRankTeamSportsLine Odds1No. 16 Georgia Tech35.4%2SMU20.1%3Duke13.0%4No. 22 Pittsburgh12.2%5No. 19 Virginia8.5%6No. 20 Louisville7.0%7No. 15 Miami2.9%Because of the massive 17-team ACC with complicated tiebreakers, it's highly unlikely that the best teams in the conference will contend for the conference title. There are five teams ranked in the CFP Rankings; amazingly, two of the top three teams in odds to win the ACC are unranked anyway, which could throw the ACC's bid into chaos. The Hurricanes are the only team with even a prayer of contending for an at-large, and they still rank behind five other two-loss teams. \"We really look at each team on its own,\" Rhoades said. \"We don't look at conferences. We look at each of the teams. I think for the ACC, when you look at their nonconference schedules, there's really no signature wins other than Miami vs. Notre Dame.\"SMU has the second-best odds to win the conference. They also have three terrible losses to Baylor, TCU and Wake Forest. Duke's situation is even uglier. The Blue Devils are 5-4 with losses to Illinois, Tulane, Georgia Tech and UConn. Let's keep in mind, five conference champions are guaranteed spots in the College Football Playoff. There's no rule mandating that four of them have to be from the Power Four. No. 24 South Florida already ranks ahead of Duke in the CFP Rankings, just like Mountain West champ Boise State ranked ahead of ACC champ Clemson last year. If the Blue Devils won the league, a 12-1 Sun Belt champion James Madison would suddenly become an odd and unsettling factor. In the SP+ ratings, the Dukes rate ahead of Duke. There's no telling whether the internal metrics used by the College Football Playoff committee agree. And it could create a disaster for the ACC. Granted, SportsLine projections do give Miami a 12.7% chance to make the College Football Playoff, which is fourth in the ACC. That projection primarily leans on them as an at-large team. The Hurricanes should finish the season 10-2 with a road win against No. 22 Pittsburgh, which would give them a fairly strong resume. Miami would need plenty of help, but a bid for the Hurricanes isn't completely off the table. But exiting nonconference play, Miami seemed like a virtual lock to reach the postseason. The Hurricanes ranked No. 3 in the AP Top 25 entering ACC play. At the time, they didn't have a single other ranked opponent on the schedule after defeating then-No. 18 Florida State. They went on to blow close results against Louisville and SMU, which has been an unfortunate hallmark of the Mario Cristobal era. When the dust clears, the best team in the ACC doesn't have a realistic chance at earning an auto-bid for the conference, and they only have themselves to blame. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest College Football Playoff Rankings saw plenty of change among the at-large spots after a chaotic Week 11 slate. Three teams featured in the previous bracket were cycled out of the field during Tuesday's rankings reveal after getting upset to bring in an entirely new round of competitors. BYU was the most notable casualty, as the Cougars lost their spot after a 29-7 loss on the road against Texas Tech. BYU was still listed as one of the first teams out, so there is a path back to the playoff if the Cougars finish the year on a high note. The same cannot be said for Virginia, which plummeted from projected ACC champion to out of the race entirely after it suffered a home loss to unranked Wake Forest. Memphis was supplanted by fellow American Conference power South Florida as the Group of Six's representative, as well. Though the lower rungs of the bracket went through some change, the projected first-round byes remained entirely unscathed. Ohio State, Indiana, Texas A&M and Alabama still occupied the first four seeds.  \nThis bracket is a projection heading into Week 12. Here is a look at how the College Football Playoff bracket looks after the second CFP Rankings release. \n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            ACC still in the hunt for multiple bids The selection committee choosing to rank Miami first among ACC teams and subsequently projecting the Hurricanes as the conference's champion is an odd choice. The chances that Miami actually makes the ACC Championship Game are next to zero. The Hurricanes already have two losses in conference play, which puts them behind the five one-loss ACC teams atop the league's standings. In the event that chaos reigns, Miami would still lose head-to-head tiebreakers against Louisville and SMU. \nThis does mean that the ACC's hopes for multiple bids are still alive. It's clear that, regardless of its ACC championship status, the committee thinks highly of Miami. The Hurricanes also have a head-to-head advantage against another potential bubble team in Notre Dame, which remained at No. 9 Tuesday. There's a world in which the ACC champion -- be it Georgia Tech, Virginia, Louisville or a team outside the rankings -- and Miami both make the cut come December. \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Why Miami -- ACC's highest-rated team -- won't make the field\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTexas Tech pushing for a bye Texas Tech jumped one spot to No. 6 following its monumental rout of BYU. While a miniscule move may not seem significant in a vacuum, the Red Raiders vaulted over Ole Miss and came one step closer to securing a first-round bye. \nIf Texas Tech can finish the regular season undefeated and cap things off with a Big 12 championship, it will have a case to secure a top-three spot at the very least. The current top four consists of two SEC teams and two Big Ten teams. Only half of that field can actually win a championship. A 12-1 Texas Tech with a Big 12 title would be a stronger candidate for a top-four seed than an SEC or Big Ten school that lost in their championship game. Vanderbilt hanging around Vanderbilt's had a tough November. The Commodores suffered a major setback on Nov. 1 when they lost to Texas and then got taken to the brink in a Week 11 showdown against an Auburn team that is 1-6 in conference play. \nDespite the latest streak of less-than-desirable results, though, Vanderbilt actually moved up two spots to No. 14 in the latest poll. Given that the Commodores rank ahead of a couple of projected conference champions, they're still a little outside of the \"first team out\" range, but they are well within shouting distance of an at-large spot. If they can take care of business against Kentucky and No. 23 Tennessee to finish with a 10-2 record, that would likely be enough to make the cut in an expanded field. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The mood inside KFC Yum! Center alternated between elation and tension Tuesday, with attitudes shifting to fit the big moments and stakes of a strangely timed rivalry contest in No. 12 Louisville's 96-88 victory vs. No. 9 Kentucky.When Louisville freshman phenom Mikel Brown Jr. drilled his third 3-pointer of the first half to put the Cardinals up 18 points, it was elation from the heavily pro-Cards crowd.As Kentucky struck back with an 18-7 run to end the half, the pendulum shifted back toward tension as \"go big blue\" chants rose from the pockets of Kentucky faithful clustered throughout enemy territory. In the earliest ever meeting between these bitter in-state foes, it was hard to decipher what was real, what was fake and who could be trusted. Brown sure looked like the real deal in his first regular-season game on the big stage. \n\n        \n            \n                Trotter's Trends: An early look at the contenders and darkhorses in fierce Freshman of the Year races\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCould he sustain it in such an electric environment against such a high-caliber opponent?The answer turned out to be an emphatic yes as No. 12 Louisville withstood the No. 9 Wildcats' comeback attempt behind 29 points from their five-star guard. \nIt ended Louisville's three-game losing streak in the rivalry and gave the Cardinals a marquee early-season victory in the first top-15 showdown between the teams since the 2016-17 season. \nCardinals pass early season testWhat has typically been a late December midterm for Kentucky and Louisville devolved into a high-octane entrance exam to determine who earned an early-season pass into the sport's contending class. By the end of the road, there were insights on both teams.Louisville's offense is unequivocally the real deal. The Cardinals hoisted 40 3-pointers for just the second time in coach Pat Kelsey's two seasons and drilled 13. They also racked up 20 assists for the second time under Kelsey and shredded a Kentucky defense that faces a long road toward competence. \"We just knew we were facing an issue that we hadn't found good resolution to in practice,\" Kentucky coach Mark Pope said, \"and it showed on the court tonight for sure.\"\nThe Cardinals' defense, though imperfect, forced 14 turnovers and neutralized the impact of Kentucky preseason All-American guard Otega Oweh.Brown enters Freshman of Year race If there is going to be an All-American from either team, the smart money is on Brown.The No. 6 overall prospect from the Class of 2025 showed that he takes a backseat to no one in the discussion surrounding college basketball's blockbuster freshman class.\nBrown pushed the Cardinals' lead to 20 with a pair of free throws with 12:24 remaining, bringing a fresh wave of elation to the heavily pro-Louisville crowd of 22,586. But then tension seeped back in as Kentucky whittled the deficit to 88-84 entering the final media timeout.\"Go big blue,\" made its return as fans of both colors stood. With more than two weeks until Thanksgiving, it felt like March.Work to do for KentuckyKentucky is an unfinished product still garnering offensive chemistry with point guard Jaland Lowe, who suffered a shoulder injury last month that kept him out of action until last week's win over Valparaiso. But the Wildcats showed their offensive potential against Louisville by roaring back twice from deficits of 18+ points to make Louisville earn it.\nNeither team had faced a competent opponent in regular-season action, yet here they were 18 days before their football meeting duking it out on the hardwood.With the game on the line, Brown delivered again. His and-one with 2:52 remaining boosted Louisville's lead to 91-84 and provided the critical separation the Cardinals needed in order to ensure that all the elation and tension didn't end in stunning disappointment.Brown held the basketball in his hands as the buzzer sounded.\"My goodness was he special tonight,\" Kelsey said.Kelsey makes painful pointThe postgame wave of elation involved Kelsey making a joyful postgame romp through the Cardinals' student section. It didn't stop there.\nLouisville's infectiously energetic second-year coach apparently took the celebration to an even greater extreme when he ventured onto the team's practice court to debrief with the Cardinals staff before they entered the locker room to speak with the team.\"As soon as I walked in, those guys just start running at me and chasing me,\" Kelsey said. \"You know how when a guy gets a walk-off home run sometimes and everybody mobs him and he just runs around the field?\"The celebratory scene ended in Kelsey dislocating a finger and arriving at his postgame press conference wearing a splint.\nHe didn't seem to mind.\"There was so much adrenaline going on in my body,\" Kelsey said, \"that I didn't feel anything when doc was pulling that thing.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NWSL officially awarded Atlanta with an expansion team on Tuesday, with the league's 17th franchise scheduled to begin play in 2028 and set to stage home matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of MLS' Atlanta United and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.Atlanta's NWSL expansion team is backed by AMB Sports and Entertainment, the organization that also owns United and the Falcons and is led by Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank. AMBSE also owns Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which opened in 2017 as a multipurpose venue. While the venue seats 71,000 for NFL games and can expand to 75,000, Mercedes-Benz Stadium usually holds 42,500 for United matches. For the incoming NWSL team, the stadium will use its modification techniques for an expected capacity of around 28,000.The NWSL will reportedly collect an expansion fee of $165 million for the Atlanta franchise, according to The Athletic, the largest in the league's history. The ownership group behind the Denver Summit, which begin play next year, reportedly paid a $110 million entry fee earlier this year, while fellow 2026 expansion side Boston Legacy and 2024 entrant Bay FC reportedly paid around $53 million each.Blank's investment will include staff dedicated specifically to the NWSL team, as well as their own training ground. NWSL-specific training grounds are quickly becoming an area of focus for NWSL ownership groups, with the Kansas City Current and Angel City amongst the teams with their own facilities. Additionally, The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation will provide seed funding to launch the NWSL Foundation, which will be focused on advancing research and innovation in women's sports and have a specific emphasis on female athlete performance and health.The NWSL's new expansion chapterAtlanta is the first market to be awarded with an NWSL expansion team since the league moved to a \"rolling process,\" as commissioner Jessica Berman has described it. Since Berman assumed her role in 2022, the league has overseen two expansion rounds with a fixed deadline for bids but made the switch after becoming familiar enough with the process of welcoming four new teams.\n\"We made the decision to shift to a rolling process mostly because we've been through [these] two rounds and so we pretty much know the universe of people who are interested,\" Berman said in September. \"There's more than a dozen of them. These conversations are ongoing and each of them have a different perspective on how much time they need to launch, the investments they need to make in order to be successful, including potentially around infrastructure and we want to not force a square peg into a round hole. We want to be more flexible so that we can get the best possible result for the next round.\"Atlanta fits the NWSL's recent expansion strategy in more ways than one. Blank now has a well-documented investment in soccer with United and his $50 million commitment to U.S. Soccer's National Training Center in the suburb of Fayetteville, which is expected to open in 2026 and will bear the businessman's name. The city was also once the home of the Atlanta Beat, which played in the Women's United Soccer Association and Women's Professional Soccer before those leagues folded. The appetite for women's soccer does not end there – Mercedes-Benz Stadium set the U.S. women's national team's attendance record for a friendly on home soil when 50,000 filled the venue for a 2-1 win over Japan in April 2024.The NWSL has also favored major media markets in recent expansion endeavors. From 2022 to 2028, they will have added teams in four of the U.S.' top 10 media markets – the LA-based Angel City, Bay FC, Boston Legacy and the Atlanta team. As for Denver, home of the Summit, the city ranks inside the top 20 and has the perk of an international airport.\nAtlanta, though, will be the first NWSL expansion team despite the intent of playing on artificial turf rather than artificial grass. Mercedes-Benz Stadium would not be the first NWSL stadium with artificial turf – the Portland Thorns and the Seattle Reign, two of the league's original teams, play on artificial turf at Providence Park and Lumen Field, respectively. Boston Legacy, meanwhile, will play their inaugural season at Gillette Stadium, which is primarily an NFL venue, like Mercedes-Benz Arena and Lumen Field.\n            ",

Brown was on his way to Florida via transfer from a New Jersey jail this week after being extradited from Dubai to the United States to face trial earlier this month, according to the Miami Herald. Jail records in Essex County, New Jersey, show Brown was released Tuesday for transfer. Mark Eiglarsh, Brown's lawyer, acknowledged his client's not guilty plea in an email to the Associated Press. Brown is expected to be inside a South Florida courtroom for his bond hearing, according to Eiglarsh.Brown was involved in a May 16 altercation following a celebrity boxing event in Miami. Several videos from the incident circulated on social media, as well as pictures of Brown in handcuffs. Brown claimed police detained him, but released him that same night. \nBrown claims on social media that he was \"jumped by multiple individuals\" who tried to steal his jewelry, \"and cause physical harm to me.\" He even said that he would speak to attorneys about pressing charges on the individuals that allegedly assaulted him.However, one month later, a warrant obtained by The Washington Post stated that police received video footage showing Brown punching a man, and then appearing to take the gun of a security officer and run towards the individual. Two gunshots were then heard. The alleged victim in this case told investigators that a bullet possibly grazed his neck, and that he went to a local hospital to be treated. According to the warrant, patrons in the parking lot told police that Brown was the shooter.\nBrown, who turned 37 in July, last played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021, and was a member of the Super Bowl LV team. Regarded as one of the best wide receivers of the 2010s, Brown earned First Team All-Pro status four times, and made seven Pro Bowls. Brown starred for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010-18, and led the league in receptions and receiving yards twice, and receiving touchdowns once.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NWSL postseason is off to an outrageous start. Playoff brackets are already busted after the 2025 NWSL Shield winners and first-place Kansas City Current were upset by eighth-place Gotham FC, and things will only get more chaotic as the final four teams prepare for the semifinal round. With just one more game to break through into the championship, players will step up and show out for their respective clubs. That means it's the perfect time for Attacking Third's NWSL Team of the Week:After weekly fixtures across the 2025 NWSL campaign, Attacking Third analysts selected a team of the week, head coach, and honorary captain based on performances across the weekend. Now we're keeping the hottest content trend of the year going into the playoffs. If you're keeping track of who has been on our past lineups, make sure to look back at our team selections from week 26.NWSL semifinal weekend gears up Saturday with Washington Spirit and Portland Thorns FC (Nov. 15, 12 p.m. ET on CBS, Paramount+), while 2024 NWSL champions Orlando Pride face 2023 NWSL champions Gotham FC on Sunday.CBS is the home of the NWSL Championship, and teams will compete for a spot in the final on Nov. 22. \nTake a look at our best XI:\nGoalkeeper: Aubrey Kingsbury (Washington Spirit)The Washington Spirit are back in the semifinal after a high drama penalty shootout. Goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury delivered a stone-cold performance in net. The veteran keeper made the goal look far too small for Racing Louisville, and after three failed conversions, Kingsbury and the Spirit are still on the path to the championship.\nDefender: Emily Sams (Orlando Pride)The Orlando Pride looked primed as ever to run it back after a quarterfinal win at home. They're doing it with plenty of dedication to team efforts in defensive shape. Defender Emily Sams was essential and led the team not just in touches (66) and pass attempts (50), but also led the charge on clearances with seven.Defender: Rebeca Bernal (Washington Spirit)The Washington Spirit have had to manage the majority of their season rotating players in and out due to a lengthy injury list. During the first half of the season, Rebeca Bernal was a crucial multi-positional player, often pugging in and out as centerback and defensive midfielder. She also sustained an injury late into the season, but now she's back and aiding the Spirit during the playoffs when more injuries are piling up on the backline. \nDefender: Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC)Perhaps Gotham FC's most consistent player, centerback Emily Sonnett provided plenty of coverage and the assist on Gotham's goal in regulation. She played all 120 minutes of the quarterfinal and was second on the squad in aerials (four), clearances (eight), and interceptions (four).  Her reliability and connectivity will be major attributes to the squad as they try to work back to another championship final. Defender: Rosemonde Kouassi (Washington Spirit)Having a bit of formational fun this week, we welcome Washington Spirit's Rosemonde Kouassi as a wingback. She's having another postseason where the Spirit is relying on her playmaking and creativity. She provided an assist on Gift Monday's goal, but isn't shy about taking her own chances on goal.\nMidfielder: Haley McCutcheon (Orlando Pride)Good teams figure out how to win, and elite players often lead the way. Haley McCutcheon embraces doing the quieter, complex work that goes unnoticed. But that's not the case out of quarterfinals; the defensive midfielder came up huge and scored the game-winning goal.\nMidfielder: Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC)If the Thorns midfielder Olivia Moultrie keeps up her form, she's gonna remain a threat for opposing defenses. Whether scoring on free kicks or setting up teammates, she's doing plenty to ensure Portland have a deep playoff run. \nMidfielder: Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit)Croix Bethune's sophomore season is just another reminder of how valuable she was even in her rookie season. The second-year player and 2024 NWSL Midfielder of the Year got back into the squad following injury, and her relentless efforts led the team in recoveries (nine), while her vision, playmaking flair, and backline movements will keep the Spirit as contenders moving forward. Forward: Katie Stengel (Gotham FC)To appreciate the NWSL is to know its lore, and Katie Stengel is among its most storied fables. A veteran journeywoman across leagues, perhaps no other player has done more for her teams in playoff moments than Stengel. Only one of two players to convert a penalty in the 2016 NWSL championship, scored the game-winner for Gotham FC in the 2023 NWSL semifinals, and now adds a game-winning goal during the 2025 NWSL quarterfinal.\nForward: Reilyn Turner (Portland Thorns FC)All the questions about the Portland Thorns heading into 2025 were about who was going to step up for the club in the absence of forwards with Sophia Wilson on maternity leave, Morgan Weaver out with injury, and the retirement of Christine Sinclair. Reilyn Turner was often the answer and was again during the quarterfinal round.\nForward: Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC)Sometimes it's about matching the right player with the right club at the right time, and there's no better example of that for Jaedyn Shaw and Gotham FC. She scored a momentum-shifting goal against first-place Kansas City, and that'll just be another attacking weapon for Gotham moving forward.\nCoach: Rob Gale (Portland Thorns FC)Finishing the season as a top-three team without your star striker and other injuries along the way? No problem for Rob Gale. Even first-year players are stepping up when needed. If he's hyped on the sidelines, then something's going right for Portland, and he'll be taking the energy all the way to Washington, D.C. now. \nHonorary captain: Luana (Orlando Pride)While Attacking Third panelists differed on who should be across the team of the week, there was no debate about the honorary captain. Pride midfielder Luana spent the 2024 season battling Hodgkin lymphoma, and won. The 2025 season has been about working back into form, and after Marta made an out-of-this-world 80-yard dash and drew a penalty during the quarterfinal, her Brazilian national teammate handed her the ball to put the game on ice. \"One year ago, I didn't even know if I would be playing again, and today I'm here. Nothing is impossible,\" Luana said after the game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        About a week after being cleared to resume football activities, Asante Samuel Jr. is signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers, according to ESPN. The veteran cornerback had recently been cleared for football activities after undergoing spinal fusion surgery in April.  A 2021 second-round pick of the Chargers, Samuel played in just four games last season after experiencing what he described as a stinger in both shoulders. Dr. David Okonkwo, a neurosurgeon for the Steelers, performed Samuel's surgery.Samuel, 26, had two interceptions in each of his first three seasons with the Chargers. In the 2022 AFC wild-card round, Samuel had three interceptions and six pass breakups during Los Angeles' loss to the Jaguars. Overall, Samuel has 176 tackles and six interceptions in 50 career games (47 starts).\nWhat does Asante Samuel Jr. bring to the Steelers?Pittsburgh's decision to sign Samuel makes sense given its recent injuries at the position. Starting cornerback Darius Slay is in the concussion protocol after getting injured during the Week 10 loss to the Chargers. The Steelers, now 5-4, were already thin at cornerback after Jalen Ramsey's recent move to free safety to replace DeShon Elliott, who recently went on injured reserve. \nSamuel will now work alongside Joey Porter Jr. (who had an interception in Pittsburgh's Week 9 win over the Colts), emerging backup Brandin Echols and veteran backup James Pierre. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 11 Power Rankings: Belichick who?

    "body": "\n        In the closing seconds of the Mavericks' loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Nov. 10, PJ Washington stood at the free-throw line with the chance to tie the game and potentially send it to overtime. After Washington converted the first one, the second one clanked off the front of the rim. Fans in attendance immediately broke out into a \"Fire Nico\" chant as Washington took his third free throw, which he also missed. The Mavericks recorded their eighth loss on the season and the frustrations with the team's roster and front office impossible to ignore.Less than 24 hours after those chants rang down on Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison as he sat in attendance for the game, he's now out of a job. Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont said in a statement that the decision was made in part to show the team's commitment to \"building a championship-caliber organization, one that delivers for our players, our partners, and most importantly, our fans.\"It's a decision that was a long time coming, nine months in the making since Harrison executed what is undoubtedly the worst trade in NBA history. Trading Luka Dončić to the Lakers for a package that centered around Anthony Davis on Feb. 2 not only shocked the NBA or sports world but became a talking point beyond that. Even Southwest Airlines took a jab at the Mavericks in a post about ending their free checked bag policy: \"It's not like we traded Luka...\" read the announcement.Harrison's name will forever be synonymous with a trade so unfavorable that fans began protesting outside the arena as soon as news broke. But his legacy will be explained by all the players he traded -- or let walk -- in the lead up to the Dončić trade.\n1. Kristaps PorziņģisThe first splash that Harrison made after he was hired in June 2021 came eight months later when he traded Kristaps Porziņģis to the Washington Wizards for Spencer Dinwiddie, Davis Bertans and Dallas' own future second-round pick. Porziņģis' tenure with the Mavericks was a lopsided one, but there were genuine bright spots with him and Dončić on the floor together. They were dream pick-and-roll partners thanks to Porziņģis' ability to pop out for a jumper, roll to the rim for a lob or just provide a solid screen for Dončić to create space. The issue often centered around Porziņģis' health, but two years after that deal, he became a champion with the Boston Celtics. We can look back on that deal and say, OK, Harrison was smart to make that trade because the Mavericks made it to the Western Conference finals that season. But at the time, the return made it confusing. Bertans was racking up DNP-CD's in between utterly horrible shooting performances (31.9% from 3-point range). Dinwiddie was a high usage, low efficiency guard who was causing friction in the Wizards' locker room.In the end, things didn't turn out too bad with this deal, but little did we know it would give Harrison a level of confidence that made him think every decision he made was the right one.\n2. Jalen BrunsonAside from trading Dončić, this is without a doubt Harrison's most egregious transaction. Just two months after making the Western Conference finals in 2022, the Mavericks made the incredibly confusing decision to allow Brunson to walk to the New York Knicks for nothing in return. Never mind the fact that Brunson carried the Mavericks when Dončić was sidelined for a portion of the first round against the Jazz. Harrison felt fine letting Brunson walk to the Knicks. The same Brunson who has since become a bonafide All-Star and MVP candidate and took the Knicks to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years last season.The most confounding part of the Brunson situation? If the Mavericks had no intention on keeping him, why not trade him to get something in return? It's on the record that Brunson was willing to take a substantially cheaper deal prior to the start of the season, and again in January 2022 with the hopes of remaining in Dallas long term. Mavericks brass declined and have had to watch Brunson blossom into one of the best guards in the league.The Mavericks once looked like geniuses when they managed to draft both Dončić and Brunson in the same class. That praise quickly turned into admonition after Brunson bolted for the Knicks. Harrison isn't the sole person responsible here; previous owner Mark Cuban also shares some blame in being arrogant in thinking there was no way Brunson would leave them. But, again, if the plan was to never re-sign Brunson, Harrison should have traded him at peak value and gotten something in return.\n3. Luka DončićI'll keep this short. You don't trade a perennial All-Star in the beginning of their prime for a soon-to-be 33 year old who has durability issues. You also don't make that trade and only net one first-round pick in return. That second part is more egregious than the first. You could talk me into an deluded reality in which a roster featuring Davis and Kyrie Irving is better than one led by Dončić, who just eights months prior to the trade led you to the NBA Finals. That roster is probably pretty good if you're playing 2K with injuries turned off. But we live in this reality, where both Davis and Irving are in their early-to-mid thirties, have long histories of injuries and, oh, neither of them are Luka Dončić.\n        \n            \n                Nico Harrison was done with the Mavericks the day he traded Luka Dončić; he just didn't know it\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt best, Davis and Irving are two of the greatest Robins in NBA history. Both were the perfect No. 2 options next to LeBron James' Batman on championship teams. Both have experience in trying to be \"the guy.\" Neither has had success in that role. Sure, Dončić is an unreliable defender even on the biggest stage and he complains to officials and he likes his hookah and beer like any regular 25-year-old dude. But that poorly conditioned 25 year old would still show up the next day and drill a game-winner en route to a 35-point performance.Dončić has been more durable than Davis, is leading the league in scoring (37.1) and has the Lakers out to a 5-2 start. He used the summer to focus on his diet and conditioning and is one of the frontrunners for MVP. Trading him for essentially a bag of Skittles and a lottery ticket should get you fired immediately. It took nine months for the Mavericks to figure that out.\n4. Quentin GrimesTwo days after making the worst trade in NBA history, Harrison lined up another stinker that often goes unnoticed. Grimes became a surprise contributor last season while Dončić was rehabbing from a calf strain. He had a few 20-point outings, but it was his effort on defense that made him essential in Dončić's absence. You know, the thing in which Harrison staked his entire career on by proclaiming \"defense wins championships\" after the Lakers trade? Grimes was an efficient shooter, could get to the rim and provided some necessary perimeter defense.Then Harrison traded him -- and a second-round pick -- to the 76ers in exchange for Caleb Martin. Since joining the Mavericks, Martin has appeared in just 23 games and is shooting an atrocious 23.8% from 3-point range. Meanwhile, in the immediate aftermath of the deal, Grimes went on to average over 20 points a game with Philadelphia, and this season looks like a frontrunner for Sixth Man of the Year.Grimes is the type of player who the Mavericks are quite literally desperate for right now: someone who can penetrate the defense, catch and shoot 3s and defend. Grimes would be killing it right now in Dallas with Irving out. Instead, the Mavs are forcing their 18-year-old No. 1 overall pick to play point guard despite no prior experience.\nThe Dončić trade was the straw that broke the camel's back for Harrison, but he's made several questionable decisions during his tenure. Any one of these moves would've gotten a general manager fired. But it took multiple missteps, an ownership change, a sellout streak ending and an incredibly vocal fanbase for Harrison to lose his job.\n            ",
